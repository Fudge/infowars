[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.900]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:18.900 --> 00:31.520]  texas alex jones while super tuesday was incredible and there's so many other
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.620]  big global developments we're gonna be breaking down here today on this March
[00:37.620 --> 00:44.180]  2nd 2016 global Wednesday transmission but really the biggest thing to come out
[00:44.180 --> 00:48.740]  of this is the mantra that is so true you rarely hear mantras and politics that
[00:48.740 --> 00:52.260]  are true they're normally establishment mantras but the mantra that
[00:52.260 --> 00:58.380]  regardless of who donald trump is he is a focal point of revolution and a
[00:58.380 --> 01:02.500]  peaceful overthrow of an illegitimate government run by offshore special
[01:02.500 --> 01:09.700]  interest and my cockabye former arkansas governor has come out and said it all
[01:09.700 --> 01:15.100]  says trump phenomenon is a peaceful overthrow of the government because
[01:15.100 --> 01:20.020]  trump saying we're going to put america first globalism is all about looting
[01:20.020 --> 01:25.180]  america and trump knows this but he he dumps it down to the public he says we
[01:25.180 --> 01:30.620]  have dumb leaders who make dumb deals with china and mexico and india and all
[01:30.620 --> 01:35.740]  these other nations we have dumb leaders the the deals are so one-sided
[01:35.740 --> 01:41.140]  they're not dumb this is global government where we were sold off and
[01:41.140 --> 01:46.140]  europe was sold off from ireland to germany to canada the united states to
[01:46.140 --> 01:51.940]  australia key infrastructure the panama canal all the rare earth minerals in
[01:51.940 --> 01:55.460]  in australia were just given people wonder why the communist chinese
[01:55.460 --> 01:59.420]  government has ninety nine percent in australia of rare earth minerals it's
[01:59.420 --> 02:03.700]  because they don't let australian or british or us or german or dutch or
[02:03.700 --> 02:08.420]  french companies operate this is strategic global government where they
[02:08.420 --> 02:13.220]  carve it all up and china has broken some of its deals with the globalist is
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.060]  why major fleets are off their coast right now because they weren't supposed
[02:17.060 --> 02:22.540]  to move militarily they were to be given economic power the united states was
[02:22.540 --> 02:28.020]  be the military power with nato as the world army china has double crossed the
[02:28.020 --> 02:32.660]  globalist and the ruskies aren't going along with it either but they are even
[02:32.660 --> 02:36.460]  more mistrustful the chinese is they are the chinese government tried to get the
[02:36.460 --> 02:42.180]  u.s. to do a joint strike twice on moscow in the fifties and sixties it's
[02:42.180 --> 02:46.100]  all coming up today the real history of the world and beyond i'm your host
[02:46.100 --> 02:49.900]  alec shones a lot of big guests and more coming up at first the incredible
[02:49.900 --> 02:56.420]  statements the truth the veritas flooding from the mouth of huckabee you
[02:56.420 --> 03:00.740]  know look donald trump disavowed david duke and the kuklutz clan so many times
[03:00.740 --> 03:05.700]  from friday through monday that you know the one time that he seemed to stumble
[03:05.700 --> 03:08.100]  a little bit he said it was his earpiece i don't know what he heard in his
[03:08.100 --> 03:11.500]  earpiece because i wouldn't air but i don't think there's any question that
[03:11.500 --> 03:15.060]  donald trump is not some kind of racist bigot and for people to pretend that
[03:15.060 --> 03:18.860]  that's our big concern and i thought donald trump last night in his press
[03:18.860 --> 03:23.820]  conference i thought that was a stroke of genius and he came across very
[03:23.820 --> 03:28.780]  conciliatory he was a lot nicer to ryan than ryan was to him and paul ryan and
[03:28.780 --> 03:32.220]  other people in washington need to recognize the reason that trump is
[03:32.220 --> 03:37.260]  winning is because they feel like people in washington have helped them lose and
[03:37.260 --> 03:40.300]  they're sick of it they've worked hard to get them elected and when they get
[03:40.300 --> 03:43.940]  there they don't do anything different and i'll tell you why three words
[03:43.940 --> 03:48.020]  follow the money the donor class runs the political environment of this country
[03:48.020 --> 03:51.860]  and people are waking up to that and they are tired of it and that's what
[03:51.860 --> 03:55.540]  this election is largely about it's an overthrow of the government and you know
[03:55.540 --> 04:00.540]  what we ought to be glad that it is a peaceful revolution with ballots rather
[04:00.540 --> 04:04.780]  than one with bullets and we're having in many ways somewhat of a
[04:04.780 --> 04:08.620]  political revolution in the republican party and in the country
[04:08.620 --> 04:17.660]  bravo huckabee veritas and it's shy off almost got to me on friday he
[04:17.660 --> 04:21.980]  disavowed the klan he did it 15 years ago on his own left the reform party
[04:21.980 --> 04:25.020]  because duke got involved without the media even saying anything i went back
[04:25.020 --> 04:29.620]  to the whole new york times article about it and then he did it more than
[04:29.620 --> 04:33.180]  12 times i was able to find it's like a sigh up by sunday i went up here in the
[04:33.180 --> 04:37.460]  media say disavowed disavowed i went i saw the tweets i saw him on tv so i
[04:37.460 --> 04:41.220]  finally went and found more than a dozen examples and finally last night he was
[04:41.220 --> 04:44.340]  asked three times he kept saying i disavowed disavowed disavowed and then
[04:44.340 --> 04:48.660]  again he goes stop it i just disavowed in here but that's their game he won't
[04:48.660 --> 04:54.660]  disavow fox cnn msnbc lying to their viewers saying he didn't disavow and
[04:54.660 --> 04:58.780]  then one time turning his earpiece off in the middle of all the disavowing to
[04:58.780 --> 05:03.420]  roman catholic bishops who led a central pennsylvania diocese helped cover up the
[05:03.420 --> 05:07.740]  sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests or religious leaders
[05:07.740 --> 05:13.300]  over a 40-year period according to a grand jury report issued tuesday reports
[05:13.300 --> 05:19.300]  fox news the 147 page report on sexual abuse in the local diocese was based
[05:19.300 --> 05:22.940]  partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant
[05:22.940 --> 05:27.260]  executed in august said pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane who
[05:27.260 --> 05:31.660]  announced the findings these predators desecrated a sacred trust and prayed
[05:31.660 --> 05:35.580]  upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe
[05:35.580 --> 05:39.740]  kane said in a statement just as troubling it's the cover-up perpetrated
[05:39.740 --> 05:44.380]  by clergy leaders that allow this abuse to continue for decades no criminal
[05:44.380 --> 05:48.300]  charges are being filed in the case because some abusers have died the
[05:48.300 --> 05:52.380]  statute of limitations has expired and in some cases the victims are too
[05:52.380 --> 05:58.700]  traumatized to testify she said you can find more reports on info wars com tell

[08:25.500 --> 08:30.220]  it is wednesday my friends

[08:35.340 --> 08:43.420]  to the third month of 2016 thank you so much for joining us
[08:43.420 --> 08:48.060]  here's an article from info wars dot com a new american magazine story by
[08:48.060 --> 08:51.740]  william f jasper globalist insider larry
[08:51.740 --> 08:55.580]  summers trump is a serious threat to american
[08:55.580 --> 08:59.980]  quote democracy these are the people that have hijacked our nation
[08:59.980 --> 09:03.820]  we're seeing a populist movement and then larry summers that engineered the
[09:03.820 --> 09:07.180]  derivative scams everything that we're currently under
[09:07.180 --> 09:10.540]  during the clinton administration who has helped
[09:10.540 --> 09:13.420]  shackle this nation to foreign debt that we don't even
[09:13.420 --> 09:16.940]  own or owe
[09:17.980 --> 09:23.100]  and he's saying that trump is a threat to quote democracy
[09:23.100 --> 09:27.820]  no he's a threat to people that are a threat to our republic
[09:27.820 --> 09:34.380]  and i'm going to play this clip again it is a clip from fox news
[09:34.380 --> 09:39.180]  last night with huckabee governor huckabee
[09:39.180 --> 09:45.580]  saying donald trump represents a phenomenon of a peaceful overthrow
[09:45.580 --> 09:49.260]  of the government and that's what the declaration of independence
[09:49.260 --> 09:53.260]  is a statement that we have a right to remove governments
[09:53.260 --> 09:58.940]  and that's what elections are and now via political correctness and foreign
[09:58.940 --> 10:03.500]  donors and money they are trying to shut down and checkmate the american people
[10:03.500 --> 10:08.380]  quite frankly donald trump is pretty milk toast
[10:09.020 --> 10:12.940]  but they invert reality and make it sound bizarre
[10:12.940 --> 10:15.820]  when first he's like yeah we got to bring in the refugees our government
[10:15.820 --> 10:18.860]  helped put isis in and now they're killing all these people we got to
[10:18.860 --> 10:22.060]  protect him he goes oh wait a minute they're radical jihadis a bunch of them
[10:22.060 --> 10:24.620]  and they're not vetting them they're not checking their passports
[10:24.620 --> 10:33.100]  they're not even we'll stop all of them until we know
[10:33.100 --> 10:36.140]  that's like locking your door at night and they just act like that's the end of
[10:36.140 --> 10:39.660]  the world this is what they do
[10:39.660 --> 10:43.500]  they count on people not checking the facts so i want to go over this
[10:43.500 --> 10:46.060]  here's the problem and i'm going to get roger stone back on today i'm going to
[10:46.060 --> 10:49.900]  get other political analysts on as well
[10:49.900 --> 10:53.820]  donald trump to stop a broker convention that the rnc coming up in a few
[10:53.820 --> 11:01.260]  months needs over 50 of the delegates
[11:01.260 --> 11:07.900]  the other candidates last night crews in second rubio in third
[11:07.900 --> 11:18.380]  kasek in fourth ben carson in fifth got 365 delegates total
[11:18.380 --> 11:26.860]  donald trump got 316 and if that strategy continues
[11:29.500 --> 11:33.740]  they will be able to steal the nomination or force him
[11:33.740 --> 11:39.260]  to take a vice president bare minimum at the rnc coming up
[11:40.780 --> 11:44.300]  now we have two reports coming up one that jacari jackson shot
[11:44.300 --> 11:49.660]  they're both excellent the other the joe big shot with a local news station
[11:49.660 --> 11:54.140]  they got at least a dozen calls in an hour on one of the news shows
[11:54.140 --> 11:58.060]  they're in the and then more in the newsroom that no we we try to vote in
[11:58.060 --> 12:00.860]  travis county but also in round rock in in in
[12:00.860 --> 12:04.300]  williamson county north of austin where i sit
[12:04.300 --> 12:11.740]  here in the heart of texas and it would flip to rubio or cruise
[12:11.740 --> 12:14.860]  and then i have personally gotten calls from
[12:14.860 --> 12:18.220]  longtime friends and others one of my former producers
[12:18.220 --> 12:24.540]  whose wife had hers flipped and by the way she works in computers
[12:24.540 --> 12:27.740]  for 30 years so she she knows what she's doing
[12:27.740 --> 12:31.180]  she said no it kept flipping kept flipping kept flipping
[12:31.180 --> 12:34.620]  and then we also talked to an election judge off camera he would be on camera
[12:34.620 --> 12:38.780]  he said no this was happening here so no doubt it was widespread you go well
[12:38.780 --> 12:45.020]  wait a minute cruise one overall what is it nine states
[12:45.020 --> 12:51.340]  but you see he narrowly lost texas and he narrowly lost other key states and
[12:51.340 --> 12:54.860]  it's point shaving because super tuesday none of the states were winter
[12:54.860 --> 12:57.260]  take all
[12:59.180 --> 13:04.620]  and so by stealing texas and i think there's clear evidence this happened
[13:04.620 --> 13:10.940]  and by stealing other states they are then able to come in with a broker
[13:10.940 --> 13:14.940]  convention and have these other candidates but
[13:14.940 --> 13:17.820]  also their delegates and basically super delegates
[13:17.820 --> 13:21.180]  publicans don't call them that but they are super delegates
[13:21.180 --> 13:24.940]  basically take it completely away from trump and if you don't think they'll do
[13:24.940 --> 13:27.820]  it get ready because marco rubio has been in the
[13:27.820 --> 13:31.260]  news the coke brothers have been in the news the republican leadership has been
[13:31.260 --> 13:33.500]  in the news jeb bush has been in the news saying
[13:33.500 --> 13:36.700]  we'll have a broker convention in fact i saw the crew just putting a bright
[13:36.700 --> 13:40.220]  bar article up where they're talking about that so
[13:40.220 --> 13:43.180]  sure you heard about this first six months ago from richard reeves you
[13:43.180 --> 13:46.700]  heard us obsessing on it with different expert guests but now it's here
[13:46.700 --> 13:53.020]  team rubio powerpoint illustrates path to broker convention
[13:53.020 --> 13:57.420]  that was back in february where they were plotting and openly talking about it
[13:57.420 --> 14:00.780]  now the answer is a total tsunami for trump and
[14:00.780 --> 14:04.460]  it's now time to be totally in for trump
[14:04.460 --> 14:08.860]  he may betray us this may be a takeover by another hostile group
[14:08.860 --> 14:12.860]  of the north american union command base this could be a
[14:12.860 --> 14:17.020]  coup in the system by another management team
[14:17.020 --> 14:21.340]  i'm not that stupid to come out here and tell you that that this could be
[14:21.340 --> 14:25.740]  super sophisticated intramural warfare inside the globalist
[14:25.740 --> 14:29.740]  i don't believe that the signs don't show that the entire power structure is
[14:29.740 --> 14:32.700]  freaking out trump is not somebody that's been
[14:32.700 --> 14:36.460]  allied with these groups he's allied with you know nascar
[14:36.460 --> 14:41.340]  owners and architects and designers and more
[14:41.340 --> 14:44.860]  nouveau riche wealthy
[14:45.660 --> 14:51.980]  what i'd call the production wealthy the the anti cloward and piven antigen
[14:51.980 --> 14:56.220]  to 21 prosperity wealthy
[14:56.220 --> 14:59.900]  they're billionaires but they're not in the club
[14:59.900 --> 15:03.180]  they don't control the trillions in banking manipulation they're not part of
[15:03.180 --> 15:07.740]  the rigged currency exchanges and the interest rates and the
[15:07.740 --> 15:11.020]  stock markets that they admit are all rigged now you've got the super elite
[15:11.020 --> 15:16.940]  that trade in trillions every day in currency and in derivatives
[15:16.940 --> 15:19.980]  for them money is a weapon to consolidate control then you got folks like
[15:19.980 --> 15:25.900]  trump with seven eight billion dollars and that's talking about his assets
[15:25.900 --> 15:28.540]  the new hit piece is going to be that trump's only worth a little over a
[15:28.540 --> 15:32.300]  billion dollars in what he actually owns get ready for that to come out the
[15:32.300 --> 15:36.220]  truth is he's not a lightweight he pretty much did
[15:36.220 --> 15:40.220]  build his money outside the system with a million dollar loan from his daddy
[15:40.220 --> 15:43.580]  he'd already made over a billion dollars by the time his dad died and gave him
[15:43.580 --> 15:48.060]  200 million he'd already eclipsed his father by the time
[15:48.060 --> 15:50.620]  daddy died
[15:52.300 --> 15:55.100]  that's old-fashioned family business he's got his sons getting ready to run the
[15:55.100 --> 15:58.140]  show as well that's what you do and then of
[15:58.140 --> 16:01.900]  course the son that is the best works the hardest ends up getting the
[16:01.900 --> 16:06.300]  the seat to run the show that's how it's always worked
[16:06.300 --> 16:09.500]  it's only the last 50 years they got rid of that
[16:09.500 --> 16:14.860]  so they attack all of this this is a true focal point of the revolution
[16:14.860 --> 16:19.180]  and even if they destroy trump blow up his airplane shooting whatever
[16:19.180 --> 16:23.020]  they're not going to get rid of him and i don't believe he's suddenly going to
[16:23.020 --> 16:25.740]  take a dive because of some scandal for hillary
[16:25.740 --> 16:29.420]  he is damaging them too big on the federal reserve on vaccines
[16:29.420 --> 16:35.980]  on china telling us what to do trump dumps it down for people and he says
[16:35.980 --> 16:39.580]  we make bad deals with foreigners they have two smarter leaders
[16:39.580 --> 16:43.100]  no the truth is the deals are all meant to screw us because this is global
[16:43.100 --> 16:46.860]  government being established off of the treasure of the west
[16:46.860 --> 16:51.900]  i said it earlier the communist chinese government gets 97 percent of world
[16:51.900 --> 16:56.060]  rare earth minerals they get 99 percent according to the
[16:56.060 --> 16:59.180]  wall street journal of australian rare earth minerals in about a third of the
[16:59.180 --> 17:01.260]  world's rare earth minerals are in australia
[17:01.260 --> 17:04.460]  another third or so are in africa the rest are spread out
[17:04.460 --> 17:08.780]  the government with regulators will not let a u.s company extract
[17:08.780 --> 17:12.380]  rare earth minerals in the united states
[17:13.100 --> 17:16.300]  they sick judges environmentalists talking chinese company comes in they're
[17:16.300 --> 17:19.900]  allowed to get whatever they want you ask why is that global secret treaties
[17:19.900 --> 17:23.260]  were agreed to in the 70s they've since come out part of them
[17:23.260 --> 17:27.100]  that china gets the deep water ports they get the Panama Canal
[17:27.100 --> 17:30.700]  they get a leverage control of world trade in the global deal
[17:30.700 --> 17:34.300]  shut up with richard nixon the rock of fellers and others nixon tried to pull
[17:34.300 --> 17:37.660]  out of it that's why they shut him down
[17:38.380 --> 17:43.660]  they were given the world economic system but they were not to control banking
[17:43.660 --> 17:47.740]  currencies or military that went to the anglo-american establishment the
[17:47.740 --> 17:55.100]  united states australia canada nato the european union
[17:55.100 --> 17:58.700]  china has double crossed that that's why the fleets three fleets are off the
[17:58.700 --> 18:01.340]  shore hoping he's not about war with china
[18:01.340 --> 18:04.780]  russia through the oligarchs off they're not perfect but they've got their own
[18:04.780 --> 18:09.100]  system running probably the most moral it's the least scientific
[18:09.100 --> 18:12.860]  designing to try to poison and kill families it's not eugenic it's thug it's
[18:12.860 --> 18:16.140]  corrupt it's got problems but it realizes it's very existence is under
[18:16.140 --> 18:18.860]  attacks with saying have kids don't take the vaccines
[18:18.860 --> 18:22.380]  they're putting poison in the water basically it's alex jones 24-7 in russia
[18:22.380 --> 18:26.860]  right now alex jones alex anter schultz needs a 24-7 in russia right now
[18:26.860 --> 18:30.300]  they're having a renaissance because they've never been out of the dark ages
[18:30.300 --> 18:33.980]  never out from under oligarchy and royalty and then the communist
[18:33.980 --> 18:38.620]  russia is having its attempt at 1776 that's why the globalists are rolling in
[18:38.620 --> 18:44.460]  on every border they've got so rush is the real wildcard here
[18:44.460 --> 18:48.620]  and this is an insurrection against tyranny and again trump is only one
[18:48.620 --> 18:52.460]  focal point of that and so folks ought to listen to me i've proven i know what
[18:52.460 --> 18:55.500]  i'm talking about i know how geopolitics works
[18:55.500 --> 19:00.620]  our best shot is to get behind trump and to watch the polls and be aware of
[19:00.620 --> 19:02.940]  what's happening and have investigators out there checking
[19:02.940 --> 19:06.220]  and have trump come out he doesn't want to sound like a sourpus
[19:06.220 --> 19:09.980]  but he needs to point out that there was major election fraud evidence
[19:09.980 --> 19:13.100]  in many different states and also in early voting in ohio
[19:13.100 --> 19:17.500]  to prop up casing and that it's going to take a huge tsunami
[19:17.500 --> 19:20.940]  to get him past 50 of the delegates of course he was winning in a bunch of
[19:20.940 --> 19:24.860]  places almost everyone was voting for trump
[19:24.860 --> 19:27.580]  democrats and national polls lean more towards trump
[19:27.580 --> 19:34.060]  so why was cruz and rubio winning in austin
[19:34.060 --> 19:38.460]  because they shave points and they're shaving points everywhere
[19:38.460 --> 19:42.220]  so they can go into that convention and steal it it's big
[19:42.220 --> 19:46.060]  it's out of control the coke brothers are putting 75 mill against him right
[19:46.060 --> 19:49.900]  now they now run rubio's campaign i'm alec shones it's a big
[19:49.900 --> 19:52.620]  broadcast stay with us the future not as of america

[24:13.500 --> 24:17.020]  but coming up in the next segment we have more time i'm going to play a scene in
[24:17.020 --> 24:21.900]  clip i played last night during our live coverage of super tuesday that went on
[24:21.900 --> 24:24.700]  for four hours
[24:25.500 --> 24:29.980]  because it illustrates how they mind control
[24:29.980 --> 24:35.500]  they played clips of trump repudiating and and and saying i'm not part of the
[24:35.500 --> 24:38.700]  clan why are you asking me this of course i
[24:38.700 --> 24:42.300]  disavow and then they cut to the southern probably law center and people
[24:42.300 --> 24:45.740]  going but he didn't disavow their views it's like a weird
[24:45.740 --> 24:49.420]  mind game it's like saying i don't like escargo
[24:49.420 --> 24:53.820]  snails and they go but describe the taste describe the flavor
[24:53.820 --> 24:58.140]  describe why you don't like it and and and how horrible it is
[24:58.140 --> 25:01.420]  i don't like snails
[25:01.740 --> 25:06.860]  and they ask you again do you like snails why won't you repudiate snails
[25:06.860 --> 25:10.540]  why won't you distance yourself from snails fine i don't like snails
[25:10.540 --> 25:13.500]  and jesse ventura came out the fence of trump because they're kind of the same
[25:13.500 --> 25:18.220]  old-fashioned pig-headed and he goes why is it if somebody endorses you
[25:18.220 --> 25:22.060]  anybody could endorse you then you've got to go defend it it's a free country
[25:22.060 --> 25:25.580]  he goes i wouldn't even respond to this and behind the scenes that's what was
[25:25.580 --> 25:29.420]  going on with trump he goes i did disavow in 15 years ago i disavowed him
[25:29.420 --> 25:32.940]  three or four times last week then they cut my audio off i don't hear it i say
[25:32.940 --> 25:37.100]  what groups disavow disavow and then last night three times in the press
[25:37.100 --> 25:41.260]  conference three questions will you disavow i have disavowed i disavow
[25:41.260 --> 25:45.340]  again you're the one the reporter goes lady
[25:45.340 --> 25:50.220]  i just disavowed i'm done they go to the next person
[25:50.220 --> 25:55.420]  will you disavow well who are you sir i'm i'm a serious xm okay i disavow
[25:55.420 --> 25:58.620]  another person will you disavow now wait a minute i just did this but you're
[25:58.620 --> 26:01.580]  gonna say i didn't disavow i disavow it's like a weird
[26:01.580 --> 26:07.580]  game these people play and it goes on and on and i i mean during the
[26:07.580 --> 26:10.940]  weekend and this week i would hear the news going he won't disavow
[26:10.940 --> 26:15.100]  on fox and cnn and and paul ryan comes out
[26:15.100 --> 26:18.620]  yesterday and goes donald trump will not disavow
[26:18.620 --> 26:26.380]  you must disavow donald how dare you we are the party of lincoln
[26:26.380 --> 26:31.020]  running the hoax like the public are idiots but they know only 20 of people
[26:31.020 --> 26:35.580]  watch news on average so it's targeting the people that kind of
[26:35.580 --> 26:39.660]  just get their news from the water cooler did you hear he wouldn't disavow
[26:39.660 --> 26:43.740]  and it was like mind control i was looking up stuff going he didn't disavow
[26:43.740 --> 26:48.220]  on friday and saturday and sunday and monday and tuesday
[26:48.220 --> 26:52.860]  and i just found more than 12 examples of where he disavowed
[26:52.860 --> 26:57.500]  and then the new thing is well he didn't disavow their views he just disavowed
[26:57.500 --> 27:02.940]  them it's like do you disavow child molesters
[27:02.940 --> 27:07.580]  yes i disavow them well disavow their practices talk about each practice
[27:07.580 --> 27:10.700]  i'm not going to talk about those practices here for them
[27:10.700 --> 27:14.140]  jacari jackson had a great point last night on the extended coverage
[27:14.140 --> 27:17.900]  he said if somebody wears an msnbc shirt and goes and robs a bank
[27:17.900 --> 27:22.060]  msnbc doesn't have to disavow but it's worse than that
[27:22.060 --> 27:26.220]  mecha la raza the blue black panther party black lives matter
[27:26.220 --> 27:31.420]  are just as racist or more so in many cases than the kkk
[27:31.420 --> 27:34.860]  in fact i had a caller last friday when i was going to vote or maybe it was
[27:34.860 --> 27:38.540]  thursday it was friday it was it was uh
[27:38.540 --> 27:42.780]  not a caller it was live streamed it was live streamed i've had callers too
[27:42.780 --> 27:46.380]  on youtube it's alex jones goes on the road and votes you can see it
[27:46.380 --> 27:51.740]  and then the person says disavow that you don't hate black people
[27:51.740 --> 27:56.060]  and i just said i'm not answering that and it's funny i walk in the grocery
[27:56.060 --> 27:59.580]  sort of vote and there's one of my friends uh cargill that owns central
[27:59.580 --> 28:02.620]  texas gunworks and i used to give the guy a hug which i normally do anyway it's
[28:02.620 --> 28:05.820]  such a nice guy i didn't even realize people in the world comment oh my gosh
[28:05.820 --> 28:10.780]  look he's hugging a black guy i mean this is how mind controlled this is
[28:10.780 --> 28:14.300]  and i said no i'm not going to say i don't hate black people it's like call
[28:14.300 --> 28:17.100]  up it's like calling going say you don't rape women and i'm like no i'm not
[28:17.100 --> 28:22.700]  going to do that because i haven't done anything so i was saying
[28:22.700 --> 28:25.740]  trump was annoying me not disavowing it more he'd already disavowed it four
[28:25.740 --> 28:28.940]  times at that point but now i kind of get his point in
[28:28.940 --> 28:33.900]  ventura so now there's this game though where he disavows disavows disavows
[28:33.900 --> 28:36.940]  disavows disavows and i'm gonna come back and play the clip and then go back to
[28:36.940 --> 28:40.540]  huckabee but this is such a big deal because it shows they know they're
[28:40.540 --> 28:45.500]  trying to deceive people and marco rubio is calling
[28:45.500 --> 28:49.020]  donald trump a con artist
[28:49.740 --> 28:54.620]  and now their new meme is because he had a real estate school one of the most
[28:54.620 --> 28:58.060]  successful in the country and if you go take one of those real estate school
[28:58.060 --> 29:01.260]  deals and you aren't successful that's your fault
[29:01.260 --> 29:06.380]  or when you got into the market it's like if you get a college degree
[29:06.380 --> 29:09.180]  90 of the time now it's not going to end up paying off
[29:09.180 --> 29:13.660]  is the whole thing a con game it's 10 times the con game of donald trump's
[29:13.660 --> 29:18.460]  real estate stuff you can go take computer courses rtf courses at little mom
[29:18.460 --> 29:22.460]  and pop schools that have like a hundred students in my experience people i know
[29:22.460 --> 29:26.700]  and yet more training and better jobs i know people that went and took
[29:26.700 --> 29:30.380]  weekend courses in web mastering 20 years ago that are making a million
[29:30.380 --> 29:34.060]  dollars a year today i mean in my experience

[33:26.700 --> 33:30.060]  here's an example of how we see for miles and miles we just actually read the
[33:30.060 --> 33:32.940]  trade publications
[33:32.940 --> 33:36.380]  it was about 18 years ago that i began to show trade publications on my
[33:36.380 --> 33:40.620]  local tv show and talk about it on the radio
[33:40.620 --> 33:44.140]  where the federal government and local governments through threat fusion
[33:44.140 --> 33:47.900]  centers that existed before 9 11 by the way they just rolled them out then to
[33:47.900 --> 33:53.180]  the public clinton's called it homeland security back in 1995 that
[33:53.180 --> 33:56.700]  was the secret name for it run by north com
[33:56.700 --> 34:01.580]  before north com was even officially established at colorado springs colorado
[34:01.580 --> 34:04.380]  that they were putting in what they called gunshot detectors all over the
[34:04.380 --> 34:07.740]  country that were really microphones that could listen to you at upwards of
[34:07.740 --> 34:12.380]  250 yards away and were run through nsa keyword
[34:12.380 --> 34:15.100]  software
[34:15.180 --> 34:18.860]  then we learned it was the cable boxes that were rolling out in the mid 90s
[34:18.860 --> 34:22.140]  also had the microphones in them
[34:22.940 --> 34:26.780]  by the time they tell you about it it's for voice command but the real use is to
[34:26.780 --> 34:30.380]  listen to you and we talked to five years
[34:30.380 --> 34:36.540]  ago about intelis streets in chicago and other cities billions being spent for
[34:36.540 --> 34:38.780]  smart
[34:38.860 --> 34:43.340]  street lights that have cameras and microphones and
[34:43.340 --> 34:48.300]  cell tower stingray type technology to steal all your data and break your
[34:48.300 --> 34:52.780]  passcodes we also told you google cars were
[34:52.780 --> 34:58.940]  driving around grabbing all your data well here it is drudgereport.com
[34:58.940 --> 35:03.660]  devices on public buses listening to private conversations
[35:03.660 --> 35:09.260]  clear channel billboards read you school monitor student social media to head
[35:09.260 --> 35:14.620]  off problems police push for armed drones
[35:14.620 --> 35:19.340]  and by the way that's the new york times on the billboard scanning you and
[35:19.340 --> 35:22.940]  reading you and spying on you and it's the washington post
[35:22.940 --> 35:26.220]  on the microphones on the buses it's also cameras
[35:26.220 --> 35:33.900]  boys and girls so see my problem is i was just aware of all this
[35:33.900 --> 35:39.260]  20 years before the general public and so i get up here and i go
[35:39.260 --> 35:42.540]  debos forum has just released an announcement that they want a 100
[35:42.540 --> 35:46.540]  trillion global tax and when the world economy collapses in the next decade
[35:46.540 --> 35:52.620]  they want a strategic drawing right that all of the currencies are based on
[35:52.620 --> 35:56.540]  then they have the news come out and say jones says next year the dollar will be
[35:56.540 --> 35:58.780]  abolished we'll have something called the amaro
[35:58.780 --> 36:02.460]  never said it that was a concept coin that was put out
[36:02.460 --> 36:06.700]  but everybody freaked out about that no you'll still have a dollar
[36:06.700 --> 36:11.660]  but it will be shut to the global currency and then they're going to phase
[36:11.660 --> 36:14.780]  that cash out you still have a credit card with an
[36:14.780 --> 36:19.500]  american flag on it that'll be your national ID card but it'll be global
[36:19.500 --> 36:25.020]  how did i know this because i read the big telecom consortium minutes that
[36:25.020 --> 36:28.540]  were public from meetings in tokyo and chicago and new york and
[36:28.540 --> 36:31.980]  sydney and i had all the experts on and i i i
[36:31.980 --> 36:35.420]  they talked about how they would control the future and track everything in real
[36:35.420 --> 36:38.380]  time and have smart dust on every item in the world
[36:38.380 --> 36:43.740]  by law integrated into the structure of it so you can't remove it
[36:43.740 --> 36:46.940]  and how they would genetically engineer every plant and animal and splice humans
[36:46.940 --> 36:52.060]  with animals and they're doing it all okay
[36:52.060 --> 36:59.180]  and i'm not here saying wow i was so right wow i'm so cool wow listen to me
[37:02.380 --> 37:05.100]  i am here
[37:07.580 --> 37:11.420]  just worried about my family and your family and i know for a fact i'm right
[37:11.420 --> 37:15.020]  because the enemy is public and i'm just telling you a declared
[37:15.020 --> 37:20.060]  operation like the borg arriving on earth
[37:20.060 --> 37:26.060]  and you see these allegories with the borg and uh with movies like
[37:26.060 --> 37:28.780]  oblivion
[37:30.700 --> 37:35.740]  and the allegory fits because what the elite are building
[37:37.020 --> 37:40.780]  imagine writing a science fiction book where there is a race of aliens in a
[37:40.780 --> 37:44.460]  higher dimension or a lower dimension and this is an allegory before the
[37:44.460 --> 37:47.660]  new york times runs with this and they interdimensionally are giving
[37:47.660 --> 37:51.180]  certain humans dark knowledge on how to build a grid
[37:51.180 --> 37:55.100]  control system that's a trojan horse and looks like it makes life easier
[37:55.100 --> 37:58.460]  but once you adopt it you give your consciousness
[37:58.460 --> 38:02.620]  up to it and then lose your humanity in the process
[38:02.620 --> 38:06.780]  and basically then decide you're a bad species
[38:06.780 --> 38:09.980]  and agree that you want to be assimilated and overwritten
[38:09.980 --> 38:14.860]  and merged with a machine and then lose your physical body
[38:14.860 --> 38:18.700]  now that's the promise of the globalist and their public plan
[38:18.700 --> 38:24.860]  from google to ray Kurzweil to hg wells to
[38:24.860 --> 38:29.180]  all of them that's why you see what i'm saying in
[38:29.180 --> 38:34.140]  arthur c clark mi6 agent os s before that inventor of the telecommunications
[38:34.140 --> 38:39.820]  satellite high-level illuminati 2001 space odyssey
[38:39.820 --> 38:49.260]  childlike allegory if you understand what it what's going to happen
[38:49.260 --> 38:54.620]  they are bringing in the end of humanity
[38:54.620 --> 39:00.780]  and they are building at the highest levels of the barbarian illuminati
[39:00.780 --> 39:04.380]  when you study them they believe they are channeling interdimensional beings
[39:04.380 --> 39:08.220]  this is not me this is them and that they're giving them
[39:08.220 --> 39:11.020]  advanced technology and information to control
[39:11.020 --> 39:14.380]  this third dimension and their orders are build this
[39:14.380 --> 39:17.980]  technocracy wipe out humanity and they're going to be gods
[39:17.980 --> 39:20.940]  and you're saying wait a minute that's that's childhood's end
[39:20.940 --> 39:23.900]  wait a minute that's all these science fiction movies in this culture
[39:23.900 --> 39:27.500]  we see themes of this not the full theme but themes of it
[39:27.500 --> 39:32.780]  and it's because that's what the global elite believe
[39:32.780 --> 39:39.020]  now christians would say yeah that's the devil doing that
[39:39.020 --> 39:43.340]  and that's the antichrist peace system see there it is again in the bible
[39:43.340 --> 39:46.860]  and it's in the vedic text with the indians and it's in every
[39:46.860 --> 39:51.660]  ancient religion and culture from the dogan tribe in africa right through
[39:51.660 --> 40:01.020]  now i don't know exactly what's going on because i deal with what i can prove
[40:01.020 --> 40:04.300]  but that's the big enchilada
[40:04.700 --> 40:07.500]  and they're building a system that is human
[40:07.500 --> 40:14.140]  ending i was watching fox news this morning
[40:15.420 --> 40:19.500]  and meghan kelly is morphing into an asexual creature the ads were all
[40:19.500 --> 40:22.780]  dads doing the mopping and dads doing the cooking and to be okay there was some
[40:22.780 --> 40:27.100]  of that that's the only message i saw during the ads and of course i already
[40:27.100 --> 40:31.980]  knew that but it's just wow i had the audio off
[40:34.460 --> 40:37.260]  and i was just looking at the at the close captioning and it was just total
[40:37.260 --> 40:41.260]  conditioning what orwell failed to predict is that we'd buy the cameras
[40:41.260 --> 40:45.420]  ourselves and then our biggest fear would be that nobody was watching
[40:45.420 --> 40:52.060]  that's keith lowell jensen said that that's a very good quote and so
[40:52.060 --> 40:55.580]  they weren't ready for you to know 20 years ago when i told you about the
[40:55.580 --> 40:59.980]  microphones and your appliances you weren't ready in their rollout to
[40:59.980 --> 41:03.340]  know that the street lamps are listening to you and watching you
[41:03.340 --> 41:06.860]  and that computers decide when something is suspicious
[41:06.860 --> 41:10.780]  and tell the police and so they claim oh well i had
[41:10.780 --> 41:13.820]  reasonable suspicion
[41:15.260 --> 41:20.300]  and you could argue of loving angels if the archangel gabriel
[41:20.300 --> 41:25.260]  or michael was running these you could say oh well it's okay
[41:25.260 --> 41:28.220]  there's always an excuse and it's for the greater good no
[41:28.220 --> 41:32.780]  the good guys don't run this and just look at the cancer rates the IQ is
[41:32.780 --> 41:35.820]  dropping the culture falling apart the family falling apart
[41:35.820 --> 41:40.700]  this thing we're being fed into doesn't lead to a nice place
[41:40.700 --> 41:44.380]  you smell what's down that dark hole let me tell you
[41:44.380 --> 41:47.420]  they're like hey doesn't matter put your virtual reality goggles on and it
[41:47.420 --> 41:51.100]  marks down this path it's really pretty that's why they want you in the matrix
[41:51.100 --> 41:55.420]  with the goggles on looking at your smartphone and watching american idol
[41:55.420 --> 41:59.420]  and the oscars and marching to hell they don't want you actually looking around
[41:59.420 --> 42:04.380]  you and using your instincts using your gut using your common sense
[42:04.380 --> 42:08.620]  so whether it's interdimensional spirits
[42:08.780 --> 42:14.620]  whether it's classical third dimensional deep space aliens
[42:14.700 --> 42:17.980]  or whether it's psychotic elites throughout history that have envisioned
[42:17.980 --> 42:21.100]  systems of total control and humans are so powerful they've been able to
[42:21.100 --> 42:25.980]  manifest it by stealing our dreams they manipulate us to
[42:25.980 --> 42:28.620]  build for them
[42:29.340 --> 42:33.020]  or whether the elite have grabbed onto ancient cosmologies and are deceived
[42:33.020 --> 42:35.820]  and believe that they're just ripping off a narrative but it sounds like a good
[42:35.820 --> 42:40.140]  control system whatever it is
[42:40.540 --> 42:43.740]  let's just say it's scientific and it's out of the mind of humans
[42:43.740 --> 42:47.260]  it doesn't matter they're building
[42:47.260 --> 42:53.500]  alien systems they're creating alien creatures
[42:53.740 --> 43:01.420]  human embryos growing in goats in sheep and pigs in cows
[43:02.380 --> 43:07.020]  for 20 years that i know about it and when the bbc reported on it 20 years
[43:07.020 --> 43:09.500]  ago i already read it in some public trade publications
[43:09.500 --> 43:14.940]  they said it had been going on for 10 that's 30
[43:14.940 --> 43:18.220]  years
[43:18.460 --> 43:23.500]  and now they're telling you about it this year 30 years later now they're
[43:23.500 --> 43:28.460]  telling you about microphones in the in the in the light poles and cameras
[43:28.460 --> 43:31.900]  20 years plus after
[43:33.020 --> 43:35.740]  they're going guess what those aren't gunshot detectors they're listening to
[43:35.740 --> 43:37.980]  you
[43:39.260 --> 43:42.700]  and seeing legalese they're telling the truth it is a gunshot detector it does
[43:42.700 --> 43:45.340]  pick up shots fired it does triangulate but it's really
[43:45.340 --> 43:48.700]  it's base uses a microphone just like your so-called smartphone
[43:48.700 --> 43:52.540]  with a great camera and all these amazing games and all the things it does
[43:52.540 --> 43:55.580]  and calculators
[43:56.940 --> 43:59.980]  you seen this before
[44:01.100 --> 44:05.500]  you seen this before where you seen that shape
[44:05.580 --> 44:09.980]  i was typing 2001 space odyssey into google
[44:09.980 --> 44:14.700]  pull up opening scene when they wake up in the morning and
[44:15.580 --> 44:19.420]  it's standing there and it sends out a signal
[44:19.420 --> 44:27.180]  activating their dna to evolve i'm holding up a iphone a smart phone
[44:27.180 --> 44:30.860]  it makes you smart but it really makes you dumb oh and as if that didn't tell
[44:30.860 --> 44:35.900]  you enough what was going on what is the obelisk oh it's the apple
[44:35.900 --> 44:39.980]  in the garden that the bike's been taken out of
[44:40.540 --> 44:43.180]  it's the mark
[44:49.100 --> 44:54.620]  now again we should probably come back with the 2001 music
[44:54.620 --> 44:59.660]  what is the obelisk what is the obelisk you're about to get the big secret i
[44:59.660 --> 45:02.780]  didn't need to get this from vivian kubrick his protege his daughter
[45:02.780 --> 45:06.460]  i already knew it when i told her she said no one else knew that
[45:06.460 --> 45:12.300]  the obelisk you see is the modern tv screen
[45:12.300 --> 45:17.980]  it's the final ratio it is the interdimensional gate
[45:17.980 --> 45:21.900]  through which the programming flows which you will then be inserted into
[45:21.900 --> 45:25.340]  with a virtual reality and wires directly into your cerebral cortex
[45:25.340 --> 45:30.060]  and it's game over it is the cheese
[45:30.060 --> 45:32.940]  on the trap
[45:34.940 --> 45:38.380]  and it sends out the signal

[46:02.940 --> 46:07.820]  shattered in the book to ignite the new son lucifer
[46:07.820 --> 46:11.980]  but first they have to battle the ai that took him to that level and
[46:11.980 --> 46:14.620]  transcended then he has to give up his humanity
[46:14.620 --> 46:18.700]  and warp to another dimension

[54:35.900 --> 54:41.820]  tv screen ratio today but at that time the ratio

[54:47.660 --> 54:51.340]  and so it's art it's literature it's culture it's ideas it's other realities

[54:55.420 --> 55:00.060]  a tool for good but also a great tool for bad
[55:00.460 --> 55:03.180]  and now they've had the revelation of the method what their plans are for
[55:03.180 --> 55:09.580]  humanity are writ large coming up you're dividing people by race cnn's
[55:09.580 --> 55:15.180]  jeff lord van jones blow up over trump kkk flap
[55:15.180 --> 55:18.380]  and van jones just keeps saying you know he hasn't denied it
[55:18.380 --> 55:23.580]  he hasn't disavowed he goes yes he has i think he's talking about
[55:24.940 --> 55:29.900]  black people in context as his as if only they matter
[55:29.900 --> 55:35.980]  and the other pundit just says look you're the one bringing up race you're
[55:35.980 --> 55:39.740]  the one injecting it and see that's the big elephant in the room is that they're
[55:39.740 --> 55:43.340]  the ones invoking all this
[55:43.340 --> 55:47.740]  just like when you if you read obama cared and had death panels
[55:47.740 --> 55:51.420]  and it had doubling and tripling of prices written by foreign insurance
[55:51.420 --> 55:55.180]  companies and rationing of care they would just go no it doesn't racist
[55:55.180 --> 55:57.820]  alex jones is deeply racist he doesn't like the fact that
[55:57.820 --> 56:01.260]  obama's black that's an actual quote on on msnbc
[56:01.260 --> 56:05.340]  he doesn't like it and that's why he's saying it's got death panels
[56:05.340 --> 56:09.020]  no it's because we read the subsections on air they'd get on air and go there are
[56:09.020 --> 56:13.260]  no fines it's all lies of course now the fines are going out
[56:13.260 --> 56:17.020]  this is the deception it's so crazy but it was a
[56:17.020 --> 56:21.100]  powerful uh piece on cnn powerfully deceptive
[56:21.100 --> 56:24.620]  where they finally have to admit that trump's been disavowing
[56:24.620 --> 56:28.620]  before the earpiece even cut out but then they say but he's not disavowing
[56:28.620 --> 56:32.540]  properly you see he has to disavow
[56:32.540 --> 56:37.580]  what the klan says and does and i guess give a five hour speech about it
[56:37.580 --> 56:42.380]  let's go ahead and go to that clip some white supremacists such as former
[56:42.380 --> 56:46.620]  kukucks klan grand wizard david duke may suggest support for donald trump
[56:46.620 --> 56:50.140]  running against donald trump at this point is really treason to your
[56:50.140 --> 56:53.420]  heritage but after a weekend of back and forth i disavow
[56:53.420 --> 56:56.700]  okay i don't know anything about david duke okay
[56:56.700 --> 57:00.220]  we still don't know if the republican frontrunner wholly rejects the
[57:00.220 --> 57:03.660]  controversial support it's a question trump has been struggling to answer
[57:03.660 --> 57:06.780]  clearly for months i didn't pause what i heard was very
[57:06.780 --> 57:10.700]  back it up he disavowed it 15 years ago when he joined the reform party
[57:10.700 --> 57:14.380]  trump got out of his own he disavowed him three or four times before that
[57:14.380 --> 57:17.020]  then they cut the deal he said who are you talking about
[57:17.020 --> 57:20.540]  then they kept doing it and they said we don't know we fully disavow
[57:20.540 --> 57:25.500]  see how the mind game works here it is we still don't know if the republican
[57:25.500 --> 57:29.180]  frontrunner wholly rejects the controversial support it's a question
[57:29.180 --> 57:33.100]  trump has been struggling to answer clearly for months what i heard was
[57:33.100 --> 57:37.260]  various groups and i don't mind disavowing anybody and i disavowed
[57:37.260 --> 57:41.820]  david duke yes he has disavowed duke but the republican
[57:41.820 --> 57:45.180]  frontrunner has yet to plainly condemn duke's ideology
[57:45.180 --> 57:48.540]  or that of the kkk and other white supremacist groups
[57:48.540 --> 57:52.060]  the anti defamation league has called for trump to do just that
[57:52.060 --> 57:55.500]  to no avail not answering this question directly
[57:55.500 --> 57:59.340]  has some risks but i think it has more rewards which is that
[57:59.340 --> 58:01.740]  he is hoping to just go let's stop right there
[58:01.740 --> 58:06.140]  tuesday evening and again it's about they set the parameters we say what you
[58:06.140 --> 58:09.260]  say we say what you do we say what words you can use
[58:09.260 --> 58:12.620]  you must disavow the way we say we're high and mighty and you're like all
[58:12.620 --> 58:15.100]  these are idiots ignore them they got your kids
[58:15.100 --> 58:17.980]  in the public schools in the private schools most of them
[58:17.980 --> 58:21.580]  follow this political correctness and in the colleges and they're in there
[58:21.580 --> 58:24.780]  bullying the daylights of them banning costume parties
[58:24.780 --> 58:29.020]  banning brown paper bags banning the word lynch off buildings
[58:29.020 --> 58:32.220]  running around foaming at the mouth getting people fired
[58:32.220 --> 58:36.140]  they're a bunch of control freak terrorists that want to break our will and
[58:36.140 --> 58:39.500]  want to hold us captive and they want to put people in forced labor camps
[58:39.500 --> 58:43.900]  what left us always do these people are so dangerous
[58:43.900 --> 58:48.380]  they are the scourge they're as dangerous as the nazis were in germany

[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:31.580]  we are live broadcasting worldwide into the second hour what did you think of super
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.660]  tuesday what did you think of clear evidence coming in around the country
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.140]  of those weren't flipping from rubio or cruise all over the country not just
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.660]  texas all over super tuesday states the reports came in they weren't flipping
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:49.260]  from from cruise or or rubio to trump it was the other way around and it was
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.820]  massive in austin election judges talked about it to our reporters
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.100]  uh reporters talked about it who talked to scores of people
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.340]  i'm going to play some of those reports uh from jakari jackson
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:05.660]  and of course uh joe biggs and others coming up but i want to take your calls
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.940]  on this where you specifically a witness to any fraud
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.660]  uh did did your vote get get flipped from from cruise
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.540]  to trump i mean maybe that happened to somebody out there we haven't
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.860]  heard that yet uh do you get my point that he needs to get half the delegates
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.700]  or more to not be challenged at the convention and they've got 365 and he's
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:30.220]  got 316 so far you see the strategy and they admit the strategies try to have
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:34.460]  a broker convention but to do that they got to fight dirty
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.420]  that's why they're staying until the end roger stone's right they're not backing
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.300]  off like they did with reagan after he swept super tuesday they're going all
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.460]  the way to the convention how do you counter that what's your view on that
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.180]  first time callers or people that experience this
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:57.020]  specifically 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and i know i tend to not go to call
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.980]  sometimes and that discourages good callers but today i'm going to be going
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.340]  right to your calls at the start of the next segment 800
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:09.660]  259 92 31 i want to play this huckabee clip again because it's such a big deal
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.540]  but i'm going to do that after the break so that we have time to get to it where
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.380]  he says that this is a overthrow a peaceful overthrow of the government
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:21.020]  that's what elections are every cycle but the people are getting behind trump
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.820]  because he's seen as not playing ball i mean i know a lot of people
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.860]  that are holding their nose on the spying and the torture and stuff that he's
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.060]  trying to sound tough on i disagree with big time
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.460]  some of his imminent domain stuffs over the line
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:40.780]  but he'll fight the tpp and the world government taking all of our land in
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.620]  giant secret deals you know he's fighting the real fraud that's going on
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:50.700]  the point is he's a sovereign nationalist person and the elite are
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.620]  panicking larry summers has come out top global is one of the top 10
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.060]  and said trump is a serious threat to american democracy when they're the
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.420]  people taking our country over 800 259 92 31
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.220]  i mentioned this earlier but i didn't plug it very very long so i'm going to say
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.740]  this a couple times this hour because it's so important your purchase of
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.180]  products funds everything we do here you see us growing in the face of this
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.580]  depression that's not easy to do but the audience is
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.780]  exploding so we're able to do it thank you for your support thank you for
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.740]  spreading the word about the broadcast thank you for calling affiliates and
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.020]  thanking them for carrying the show thanks for calling local stations in your
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:30.460]  area if you don't have an affiliate and tell them pick up the alexio show
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.020]  no army can stop an idea whose time has come to quote
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:40.860]  victor hugo and it's true no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.620]  and info wars has been proven right on the nsa on the spy grids on the
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.300]  microphones and the lamp posts on the state's senior kids belong to them
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.900]  on the vaccines having cancer viruses and most cancer ring viral and
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.620]  just everything we know what we're talking about
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:58.140]  because there's the real world and real medical literature and real trade
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.900]  publications and real think tanks who communicate with each other about all
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.580]  this stuff and then there's mainstream media and up until now
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.860]  there were these rules that you don't talk about chimeras you don't talk about
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.900]  gmo's or glyphosates or you don't talk about world
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.060]  government now they become so obsolete that they're kind of going
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:20.300]  ahead and tell everybody because it doesn't matter anymore they've
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.180]  already dug the hole too deep and it's too little too late
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.780]  mainstream media to come out and tell the truth people don't trust you they
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.620]  don't like you this battle with the globalist is ours to lose
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.820]  if we just realize there's a church government run
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.500]  syop that the end of the world comes and we're raptured first
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.420]  so no one has to fight evil it's the ultimate syop
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.300]  but here's the let's just say the rapture comes before world government the
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.420]  antichrist will god really say he recognizes you at the
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.380]  white throne judgment of your christian if you believe that like i do
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.500]  if you didn't fight evil when it was right in front of you come on
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.540]  you know that's not true in your gut in your spirit you know it
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.460]  two roman catholic bishops who led a central pennsylvania diocese
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.700]  helped cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.540]  or religious leaders over a 40 year period according to a
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.300]  grand jury report issued tuesday reports fox news
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:18.780]  the 147 page report on sexual abuse and the local diocese
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.220]  was based partly on evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.140]  search warrant executed in august said pennsylvania attorney general
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.420]  kathleen kain who announced the findings these predators
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.740]  desecrated a sacred trust and prayed upon their victims in the very places
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.020]  where they should have felt most safe kain said in a statement
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.860]  just as troubling is the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders that
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.820]  allow this abuse to continue for decades no criminal charges are being filed in
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.300]  the case because some abusers have died the statute of limitations has expired
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.780]  and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify she said you can

[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.140]  super tuesday has come and gone now we see the next big primary on the
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.220]  ides of march march 15th two big issues to sell
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.700]  we're taking your phone calls but the big issues are this clear evidence in key
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:41.500]  states of shaving votes
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:49.100]  for marco rubio and for ted cruz
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.660]  giving trump votes to them to keep them in the race
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.020]  for a broker convention and to make sure that trump does not have half the
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:02.860]  delegates when he gets in he only has 316 that they have 365
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:06.940]  the four other candidates together and then there will be a vote that goes
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.980]  around if trump doesn't get 50 if the delegates don't
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.260]  pledge themselves which the republican leadership says they're not
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:17.580]  they will then take it away from donald trump so we better get on this now
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.780]  they're going to spend it as sour grapes but we have the Koch brothers
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:25.500]  marco rubio and others in the news saying we're going to go for a broker
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:30.060]  convention stratagem and it's not a gambit it's not
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.260]  desperate it's it's been done before and people
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.380]  are finally getting more political savvy they're going to wait
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.900]  you know hillary lost in new hampshire in places but still got the delegates
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.340]  yeah that's because the democrats have actual
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.660]  super delegates a little bit different system they just take them right
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.700]  there on the spot and then brag and say yeah
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.020]  doesn't matter what you do birdie's gonna lose and suddenly he started losing
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.060]  all over because his own people just went well i just want to bet on a winner
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.380]  i want to feel important i want to buy into something
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.420]  sorry burn because it's so rigged with the democrats
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.540]  hundred percent it's like 90 percent rigged with the republicans
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:12.940]  but there's a revolution and what former arkansas governor
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:17.420]  my cock could be talked about on fox news last night and this morning as well
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:23.980]  is coffinels of the system that this is really a revolution against tyranny
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:28.860]  this is an overthrow of the of the illegitimate government
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:35.180]  nice the reason that trump is winning is because they feel like people
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:39.180]  in washington have helped them lose and they're sick of it they've worked hard
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.380]  to get them elected and when they get there they don't do anything different
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.860]  and i'll tell you why three words follow the money the donor class runs the
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.300]  political environment of this country and people are waking up to that and they
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.460]  are tired of it and that's what this election is largely about
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.820]  it's an overthrow of the government and you know what we ought to be glad that
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:03.020]  it is a peaceful revolution with ballots rather than one with bullets
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.860]  and we're having in many ways somewhat of a political revolution
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.220]  in the republican party and in the country that's right of course that was
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.580]  uh fox and friends this morning you also have similar things last night
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.380]  but it's what everyone's saying where'd you hear that first
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.140]  this is an information war we're trying to take the country back
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:25.180]  by pointing out we've been overthrown by revolutionaries by corporate foreign
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.820]  interest the donor class who's now trying to sew stuff up
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.100]  now that they pretty much had control they thought
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.220]  they want to get rid of people being able to give money to political campaigns
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.700]  they want to get rid of free speech on the internet talk radio
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.980]  because they think they've sewed it up and they'll selectively enforce and let
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.340]  the pope come and be political and let all the democrat churches be political
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.380]  and let everybody else be political unless you're a conservative libertarian
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:55.100]  christian or a veteran then they're going to persecute
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:00.940]  you and shut you up everything selectively enforced like obama care
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.660]  the taxes all the insiders get exemptions
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:10.220]  and donald trump says you're not going to get those exemptions anymore
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:14.620]  they passed laws to have the highest corporate income tax in the world
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:19.820]  the very corporation's lobby for that to make everyone move overseas to break
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:24.460]  the country's back the globalists admit that's their plan
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:28.300]  china and india and 160 other countries plus don't have can have dirty cold
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:31.340]  plants but we can't have clean ones and they're shutting over a thousand of
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:34.940]  ours down no one can compete if our energy is
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.700]  two or three times what china's is it's a plan
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.860]  trump calls it bad deals it's not bad deals it is a precision
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:46.940]  economic warfare takeover by the globalist class
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:52.540]  working with china who has the biggest population who's very hard working
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:57.820]  a billion 300 million chinese 70 of them working
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.380]  and working hard such an oxymoron that the chinese are communist
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:07.020]  one of the most entrepreneurial free market people probably in the world
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.780]  who's more entrepreneurial maybe the lebanese the stereotypes are true
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:17.900]  how could you do this you bring malin ci fighting he kills 85 million of them
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.620]  that wouldn't play ball 84 million excuse me
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.900]  i'm gonna go to your phone calls now but this is such a big deal and then i'm
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.700]  going to get to the amazing van jones flipping out when he's
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.780]  race baiting it's incredible uh and we've got more coming up but
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:36.140]  right now i want to go to your phone calls again the big news
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.740]  and i'm going to show this again for tv viewers we can go over it for radio
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:45.420]  listeners but the numbers are extremely clear
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:51.180]  trump got 316 delegates so far
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:57.020]  and the other people have 365 combined and so the republicans can easily steal
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:01.900]  it from him at a broker convention and they've said that's their plan
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.820]  now they have articles out saying i'm a conspiracy theorist roger stones
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:09.020]  conspiracy theorist there's no plan to have a broker convention even though
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.580]  they admit they're planning it they don't want to debate about that they
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.260]  want to stall you saying it doesn't exist just like there's no obama care
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.620]  fines or fees because they were delayed three years now they're
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.500]  this year going into place they went into place for businesses with more than
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:27.580]  50 employees last year hit us and then now this year individuals get to enjoy
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:37.180]  900 to $5,000 fines nico acosta he got hit with a $900 smacker last week
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.700]  you like your doctor you can keep your doctor i never said that he said
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.220]  this is mind games gruber it's a good thing the public's dumb and doesn't pay
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.420]  attention that's how we triple prices and i was brought in by the big
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.780]  insurance companies and banks and obama that's my plan and the professors and
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:58.140]  the graduate students on c-span there was like 15 videos of this
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:02.140]  but it was just like oh my gosh you're such a great liar
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.900]  so you don't build things now you lie and screw people
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.220]  and you you you you get promoted for it
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:14.700]  and you go on seeing it in fox and go and paul ryan comes out yesterday and says
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.180]  he will not decry the klan the party of lincoln this is outrageous
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.940]  how dare donald trump i am not i was not going to get involved but he's gone
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.100]  too far no and he'd already did not done it 10 times by then
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:33.020]  and then four times we know of last night 14 times not good enough for that
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:39.420]  snot nose pretty boy punk paul ryan rhino piece of trash
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:46.540]  okay i'm going to settle down excuse me 800 to 25 a 99231 your take on the
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:49.820]  election your view on all this but man they
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:56.220]  sit there and lie on the straight face with his pretty little blue twinkly eyes
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.860]  how dare donald trump this is how they mind game everybody
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.500]  some channels are still saying he won't decry the klan
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:08.540]  they just will lie they will lie and they will lie and they will lie but here's
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.500]  the good news a lot of people don't believe your bull anymore
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.180]  the horseman or you're selling and claiming it's you know valentine's day
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.900]  chocolate chocolate candy you didn't it's horseman or
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.740]  noel in minnesota a state they stole from front no doubt
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:28.700]  go ahead you're on the air noel hey alex i'm a little disappointed uh you're not
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.780]  doing more to teach us how to become delegates and take this over
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:37.180]  i know everything's my fault brother well i'm not trying to say it's your fault
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:41.020]  but yeah it's it's see i went to the delegate
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.980]  last night and it's the same church group that's there
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:47.980]  every time and there's eight of them they all vote for each other and they're
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.500]  the delegates and they lock everybody else out well let me let me just stop
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:56.060]  you because i don't mind criticism but i've
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:03.100]  probably done the last six months let's not exaggerate
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.980]  20 full segments or more on the delegate process and very state-to-state
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:11.740]  on the democrat and republican system at the conventions and i've probably done
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.140]  hundreds of sub pieces and discussions and we've shot
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.140]  five special reports on how to be a delegate and how to get involved
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.460]  do you people always calling they go you don't talk about the federal reserve
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:26.460]  enough or you know about 9 11 enough when i'm the founder of 9 11 truth
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.780]  in space and time it's like i write a book on something there it is go read
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.860]  that book or go watch the free video i can't just sit here i'm saying
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:38.060]  they're trying to steal the delegate process they're stealing the vote get
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.900]  involved get informed i can't sit here though and teach people how to change
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.620]  attire over and over and over again for four
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:47.340]  hours a day i'm teaching people how to change attire
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:51.660]  probably once a show or every two shows do you understand that i would murder
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:56.460]  the program if all i talked about was the delegate process
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:00.780]  so listen 12 hours a day you're not actually really informing us on it
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.940]  okay well then you're a better man than i and i understand i'm a bad person
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.900]  i apologize you have the floor tell us how to do it
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.900]  well if you were it it's not just going in and being a delegate
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.420]  if there's a group of eight and they only vote for those
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.620]  eight guys and if if you're a trump person
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:24.780]  you only vote for other trump people you don't vote for anybody else because
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.620]  then those other delegates get your vote and and these
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:33.820]  these older churchgoers they know this and they're the same people that are
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:38.300]  every time and they're the delegates so they lock everybody else out because
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.380]  they go in a group and they only vote for their own group
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.140]  i agree so people that get that this year i have my little delegate card
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:50.620]  and i'm gonna go and try to become a delegate and then a super delegate so
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.660]  uh that's exactly what we're doing we've did you see that video we shot we went
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.220]  and voted it's about 20 minutes long talk about the process
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.860]  no i don't i'm disappointed in you i know no no no no if i've got to be talking
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.660]  about it all the time you've got to be watching it all and i'm disappointed in
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.620]  you know how i watch i listen and watch 12 hours a day
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.660]  brother i'm being sarcastic i don't mind criticism
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:17.660]  it's just the default alex needs to do more
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.100]  i've pretty much gone insane i worked so much brother
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.740]  i fell asleep last night and they woke me up to go on air
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.020]  i went home and fell asleep at eight o'clock i was so exhausted i got back up
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:33.020]  and i'm not complaining it's just it it's an idea that i have to do more
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.460]  brother you're doing a great job too okay it's been a little bit sarcastic
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.740]  we need to shift back to the issue here that they're trying to steal the
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:44.700]  election from donald trump uh thank you noel and it varies state to state so

[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.180]  phase you out i got some motion front property in
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:13.900]  arizona from my front porch you can see the sea
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:19.740]  girl your memory won't ever haunt some good stuff too bad he's retired
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.340]  we knew he wouldn't retire he's under select shows in vegas
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.180]  guess that's where you die and go to heaven
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.340]  when you quit touring good part right here
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:37.500]  i don't worship the ground you walk on the ground you walk on
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:44.860]  never have and that's a fact
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:51.660]  i won't follow try to find you try to find you because i don't love you
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.940]  i'm sorry i'm singing along to the song this is unintentional
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.500]  but i have bumper music i love i got so then once i start getting to it i have
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.620]  trouble turning it off but there's allegories again in parables
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.940]  and parallels to everything we see today in a song like this
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.780]  if you don't think van jones and all these people aren't forge foundation
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:16.300]  trained to destroy this country and that they aren't scientists
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:22.140]  creating racism to control the population i got a bridge in brooklyn i'm
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:25.660]  ready to sell you and if you don't think the mega banks
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:29.180]  don't want to screw you and your family over i got a bridge i'm ready to sell
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:32.140]  you as well i want to go back to your calls
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:34.620]  and we get to bunch of these clips coming up and i shouldn't have gotten an argument
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.980]  with noel earlier but the whole crew isn't going absolutely
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:41.500]  the delegate process is different in every state every county every city
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.100]  you got to go deal with your own little mafia individually
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.460]  so the claim that i need to be walking people through the delegate process
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.460]  everywhere it's impossible you need to walk yourselves through it but i do get
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:55.660]  the frustration so when we're frustrated at the new world order let's not tear
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.100]  each other up because i'm in an aggressive mode
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:03.420]  as well let's talk to darrell in the great state
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:06.220]  of texas formerly texas now under femur region six
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.900]  but our governors fighting back for sovereignty we're almost a sovereign
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.740]  state again and more talk about revolution against the
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:17.500]  corrupt government likes coming out of the mouth of uh
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:21.420]  old huckabee we might actually get there this is not a revolution
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:25.020]  it's an overthrow of an occupying force like the french resistance overthrow in
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.540]  the nazis let's go ahead and go back to the calls darrell
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:33.020]  in texas you're on the air worldwide alex
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.540]  i was uh voting in mylam county yesterday and uh
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.700]  i noticed one of the officials taking the voting machine
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.540]  one of the portable voting machines out of the uh area
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.460]  and i asked though what's going on and they said that they had several voting
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.180]  machines go down and just go black in uh mylam county
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.860]  uh they at this point they don't know really what
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:00.300]  happened and that's the problem with the system is it you know
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.020]  the people that are operating these things know nothing about them i mean
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:07.100]  guys somebody else programs it and then they've been proven to be engaged in
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.020]  fraud thousands of times by design insiders have testified from at least
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:14.300]  six different big companies and all over the country ballots
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:18.460]  scantrons or punch cards were also premarked for rubio
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:21.660]  what a surprise the guy that the establishment wants
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:28.060]  the farangia ambassador you know at least when you have a uh written ballot
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:31.420]  yes you could have ballot stuffing an extra ballot but
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:35.740]  you don't have to understand how it works you know you can you can just
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:39.740]  put your hands on them basically and and watch them and you got to catch people
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.700]  ship it in the fake ones and they catch them in a back warehouse filling them
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:46.700]  out or a truck comes over and they're always getting caught the old way it's
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:49.100]  much better to have a little computer program in there and
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.620]  and then it all comes out in the wash they have algorithms that shave the
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:57.180]  numbers it's all very sophisticated now
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:01.660]  i wanted to get you to critique an idea i have alex uh and that is
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:05.260]  as far as washington is concerned the way i see
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.780]  ending this whole process of corruption is the only way to do it
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.020]  right now what we have is an analogy where we give the teenagers
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:16.300]  the keys to the beach house in washington and we shake our finger at them
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:21.100]  when we tell them don't do that again don't have any parties
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.460]  and what i'm saying is now they've done it so many times just come back with
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.420]  your allegory but you come back a month later and
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.980]  they're such criminals now and they got bad friends that have come in and
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.260]  taken over the beach house their friends are crack dealers they tie you up and
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:36.300]  torture you to get the codes to your bank account and then after they shoot
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.660]  you in the back of the head and bury in the sand dunes and then kill your kids
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:42.540]  that's basically what happened to washington they're sold out to foreign
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.740]  murderers and they're getting ready to cap us all in the head and complete the
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.900]  attack of that's actually what's going on
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:51.740]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:56.540]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.540]  we are quickly approaching the five-year anniversary of osama bin laden's supposed
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:05.740]  death at the hands of navy seals and to commemorate this the obama
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.660]  administration released 113 documents that were seized in the may
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.660]  second 2011 raid and if you read the myriad of articles at daily mail
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:17.340]  he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million-dollar fortune
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:20.460]  to the global jihad he also worried that his wife had been implanted with a
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:23.820]  tracking chip but he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:29.020]  he signs one syed bin usama another usama bin muhammad and another abu
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.420]  abdallah but i ask why didn't he use his cia code name of tim osman in any of
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.620]  these letters remember it was c bill edmunds the fbi translator who
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:40.060]  broke a gag order and said that the us had been working with usama bin laden
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.940]  right up until 9 11 and they were outsourcing him to conduct terror
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:46.060]  operations all over the world there's one final note he was calling on
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:48.860]  americans to help president obama fight climate change
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.940]  so using liberal logic if you don't disavow climate change then you
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.860]  were for osama bin laden rob do reporting for info wars dot com in info

[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:19.020]  it's alex jones all right i want to go to more your calls and a bunch of these
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:22.300]  clips and reports i've got to get to
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:25.580]  i was talking to daryl in texas daryl you were getting
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:31.660]  to a parable which of course is biblical or
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.020]  historical where you can tell a story that is
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:39.340]  an example uh or something contemporary to what's happening now
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:44.300]  try to finally get people to learn from the experience of others
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:49.420]  you can get knowledge through revelation through experience or through teaching
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:53.180]  and unfortunately so many people just want to get it through
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:59.660]  experience and sometimes that can be the school of hard knocks
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.420]  but you were getting into washington's like kids you leave for the weekend with
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:07.340]  the beach house teenagers and then finish your story i was
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:11.100]  saying well it's like teenagers that take over become crack heads
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.940]  criminals come in you come back you want them kicked out
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:18.300]  the criminals tie you down and torture you for your atm numbers and bank
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.820]  numbers suck the money out and then finally kill you
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.100]  and your kids and bury you in the sand dunes that's the kind of thing happens
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.780]  all the time actually teenagers get under the influence of older criminals
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:32.220]  and will do anything including killing their families
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:36.700]  uh so that's kind of what dc is a bunch of snot nose corrupt filth
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.100]  run by offshore crime cartels who want to show up the country for themselves and
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:45.100]  have a bunch of soft stupid socialist college grads that think they're about
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.340]  to run a military op against what's left of the republic the skeleton of this
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:52.940]  republic in a civil war will annihilate you but i
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:57.180]  don't want to go that path i want to have a peaceful
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:02.700]  restoration of the republic an overthrow of this occupying force
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:05.580]  and notice that narrative that i've been talking about for years
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:11.100]  that if it ever gets out bye bye new world order because when everybody knows
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:15.740]  the world government that new world order is about multinational above the law
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:19.420]  diplomatically immune crime syndicates that run
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:26.060]  child kidnapping snuff films drugs pharmaceuticals everything evil you can
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:30.300]  imagine once that all comes out because it's a fact
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:37.420]  what do they say in aliens game over man game over
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:43.020]  and you need to understand that the military already knows
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:47.020]  they already knew the narrative but i crystallized it
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.380]  and now other people have picked up on the narratives that i have
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:54.780]  analyzed and others have but let's just give credit where it's super
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:36:03.180]  dangerously do right here and we're coming for you
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:07.020]  and we're not stopping we're not backing down
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:11.260]  we're not intimidated and when you run false flags now you know we're watching
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:17.020]  you and we're analyzing it second one
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.900]  daryl in texas go ahead and finish your point
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:27.500]  yeah you're never going to stop the teenagers from lying if you let them
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.700]  have the keys to the beach house and keep sending them checks but if you make
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:34.620]  the teenagers live at home washington is not necessary
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.220]  with today's technology uh i believe the constitution
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:41.500]  requires them to meet for like a month they could play dress up
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.740]  for a month if they wanted to but the majority of their discussions and
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:48.940]  they're bill passing and things like that can be done through technology
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:52.620]  they come home all the senators and the congressman have their office
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:56.380]  in their home state right in our backyard and when they're
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.060]  dealing with something we are right there in their office they don't have five
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.820]  offices spread across the country the keys to the beach house are taken from
[01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:07.260]  them in game
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:11.180]  you're absolutely right in fact i'm asking them the crew to
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:16.140]  pull up the swiss form of government and the map of cantons
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.900]  and they've got cantons out of the states that convene
[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.180]  only a few times a year to make federal decisions
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:27.180]  they have the lowest crime rate in the world the highest standard of living
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.020]  uh and they're the only country in europe not letting the radical jihadis in
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:35.980]  they're letting some in and it is amazing uh and and actually we should
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:40.700]  we should have the canton model integrated into our system which is
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:44.860]  what it was designed off of our system was signed was hooked up off of the old
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.980]  dutch program uh which they got rid of a hundred
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:50.940]  years later and off the cantons system that's what the founder said
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:54.380]  integrated with iraqoi native american systems
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:58.220]  and that's a fact i mean that's in the history books so it's it's iraqoi
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:03.820]  it's about 20 iraqoi about 40 percent
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:07.340]  about 40 percent uh canton and another
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:13.420]  another 40 percent or so a dutch system and i mean i mean they claim it's greek
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:16.940]  and democracy no that was two buckets black stones white stones
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:21.100]  the ruling class could vote on even killing you for your free speech
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.540]  that is not where we come from that is not what we are
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:28.620]  and it just shows how ignorant the public is
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.700]  by the way max keiser did an incredible description of democracy on his show
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:35.740]  monday and i meant to air it it's like a 10 minute
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.780]  it's a 20 minute piece but i'd like to take his point on democracy and then go
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.820]  to my interview with him because i was i was calm and people really liked it so
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:45.420]  we i want to air max keiser's piece sometime this week
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:49.420]  okay uh thank you so much darrell that's a really great point
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:55.900]  let's talk to rick and michigan you're on the year go ahead
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:39:01.820]  okay there now i'm sure imbram hey alex first time caller here uh just want to
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.260]  thank you so much for all the information that you and your
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:11.020]  staff pump out on a daily basis uh i wish the whole world was listening to
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:15.740]  you guys unfortunately they're not but um
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:20.700]  we need to do whatever we can to make that happen right brother i'm trying i
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:24.860]  am fully committed and um i used to have so much
[01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.220]  frustration that we weren't getting enough change fast enough i'm just so
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:31.660]  committed now it just doesn't even matter in fact i'm pretty much possessed
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.300]  in a good way totally overtaken fulfilled uh in the fight against tyranny
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:39.500]  because i know this is a life and death struggle
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.980]  there is no compromise with a system that comes to end the human system as we
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.820]  know it and replace it with a monstrosity
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:51.100]  right on so i wanted to get your take on this
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:54.780]  on this thought you know there's a there's all kinds of talk in the media
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:40:00.620]  about how the gop is is scared of donald trump
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:05.180]  but i think the the people that are really the the most afraid of him
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:09.340]  is the is the democrats because if you look at what happened
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:14.940]  uh yesterday the democrats are losing people
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:19.260]  they're coming over to vote in the gop uh issues
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:23.980]  and they had a horrible turnout on their side
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:27.180]  in fact guys i know it's in my stack but i can't find it well you guys reprint
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:32.060]  me voting totals this election versus 2012
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.300]  because you're right this is since since reagan this is the highest percentage
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.980]  of republicans voting versus the lowest percentage of democrats
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.660]  which is what the demographers and and political analysts across the board
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:48.620]  political atheists top professors are saying 97 to 99 percent chance trump
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:52.060]  wins and maybe one of the biggest landslides in
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:58.380]  history but definitely a gargantuan colossal mega tsunami
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.340]  and so of course the entire establishment from the coke brothers the
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:05.340]  fox news the cnn are saying he's racist he's evil it's impossible
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.740]  he will lose he's unelectable because he annihilates celery clinton
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:14.140]  let's see they have to put it in our our mind that that he's she's gonna annihilate
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:18.060]  him in case they have to steal it in case they can't beat him
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.740]  at the convention they've got to get it in our minds that
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.500]  the corpse the hacking corpse the reanimated uh
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.140]  demon doll uh you know has defeated him go ahead sir i'm glad you raised this i
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:34.300]  meant to start the show at this point record numbers of people of democrats
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.580]  coming over and voting republican record number of republicans
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:42.300]  and yes trump is a mega unifier across the board record numbers of blacks
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.460]  record numbers of hispanics voting for him and the system is pulling its hair
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:50.780]  out absolutely and and like like you just
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:56.700]  mentioned it's it's tens of thousands of people who
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:02.300]  identify as democrats or independence and he is just
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:05.500]  lighting a fire under this whole thing he's going to burn it down
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:10.140]  it is a whole thing here is that the republican party is expanding
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:13.900]  exponentially absolutely and here's the deal
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:20.060]  trump is a pro free market ego maniac uh but he's our ego maniac and i've had
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:24.140]  high level people give me that exact quote uh he really reportedly knows
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:28.460]  about the new world order now hates it is upset and he wants to be george
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.620]  washington part two well i say letting and you know what it might get messy
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.020]  uh but uh the establishment is again crapping their drawers i hate to use
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.860]  that term but that's what they're doing i mean if the
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:42.940]  arose is arose my other name well the globalist you're soiling themselves is
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.220]  that by any other name and look at day to night you know didn't like trump now
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:50.220]  he's all in because this is real folks this is a
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:54.940]  revolution against the globalist it's on it is on
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:57.820]  god bless you rec appreciate your call i want to go to adam bruce
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.780]  craig jeff and others here but first speaking of the fix being in
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:05.740]  don't feel bad if they steal the election from him or put a bullet in his head i
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.340]  mean feel bad but no it's a manifestation of the awakening
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:13.740]  that's why brzezinski said three years ago to the cfr used to it was easy to
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.860]  spend you know propaganda money to brainwash a million people now we can
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.540]  it's easier to kill a million as dumbed down as some of the
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.580]  public is most people now know they're being lied to
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:27.420]  and folks are figuring things out real quick the the growth curve
[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:31.980]  of understanding the learning curve is skyrocketing
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:35.900]  and so stuff is spectacular i was in the shower this morning after i worked
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:39.500]  out i had to put my head up against the wall i just could not it was a good
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:43.740]  feeling but also a bad feeling of i can't believe how exciting the world
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.180]  is i can't believe how incredible it is i can't believe
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:50.460]  forget watching a football game or a cliffhanger movie
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:53.740]  i mean we are seeing open world government they're trying to start war
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.540]  with the russians i'm getting chills war with the communist
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.860]  chinese foreign governments are telling us what to do
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.900]  they're on the news saying fathers and families are bad
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:05.580]  total crazy cults are running wild uh the borders are wide open they're
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:09.580]  bringing in jihadis uh but people are waking up i mean
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:13.740]  it's gonna get crazier and wilder i've been telling you this for years and i
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:17.580]  said in the last few years get ready it's here it's here
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:22.700]  the animating contest of liberty thank god i'm alive right now
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:25.580]  so many people selfishly say i wish i would have lived the olden times it was
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.460]  simpler i wish i would have you don't know you didn't live in that time
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:32.460]  and sure that's romantic and i'm not knocking you man you're alive now
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:36.700]  live now this whole wall street systems to make you feel dead
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:42.460]  and madison avenue and hollywood they had the lowest oscar ratings in history
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:45.420]  and it wasn't just the lecturing and all of it
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:53.180]  people are sick of a bunch of painted trolopes and tough guys up there walking
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.940]  around trying to make commoners feel bad
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.540]  people want to go outside and have a barbecue or go play football or soccer
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:04.300]  or go hang out with their buddies at the bar or go climb a hill
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:08.140]  or go you know pick up some you know girls or whatever you're out doing or go to
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.660]  church and again some people are more caught in
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:15.340]  the matrix but more than ever people are getting out of it right now and it's
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:20.620]  just i mean it's a joke i watch the oscars for comedy
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:26.220]  they've jumped the shark folks they're not invincible
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:31.100]  and rats are leaving the sinking ship i told you this years ago
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:34.220]  i've probably talked
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:39.180]  or know people that have talked to basically all the top people in hollywood
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:41.820]  except for producers and owners and stuff they're they're pretty mafia and i've
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:45.660]  talked a lot of them and they tell me and they tell me to my face you've
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:50.380]  heard a lot of me on the show that no no no no no no no hollywood is
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.420]  info wars hollywood is libertarian 1776 patriot
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:59.420]  how many times did i tell you hollywood is 1776 and under total tyranny
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:03.020]  and told you'll be fired if you don't do what we say
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:08.620]  and then what did russell well so many of them have come out what did
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:13.100]  hurt russell come out and say he said i'm just libertarian but i'm 1776 i'm
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:16.780]  founding fathers i'm americana i've rediscovered it it then you know that
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.900]  everything makes sense
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:26.700]  and that's it it's what they discovered in the renaissance we're just rediscovering
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.140]  it and it's game over for the globalists that we just do that
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:33.180]  but let me tell you they get called in by people like summoner redstone who's
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:37.260]  finally gotten senile is drifting off into oblivion

[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:34.540]  and climbed around in freezing ice with his men where they would go on marches
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:37.180]  at night and they'd lose 10 15 people just in one
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:41.180]  battalion freezing to death
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:46.620]  to it dawn battle the germans three to one

[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:01.980]  with men dying all around them and george washington with diarrhea running

[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.660]  and then he went to trinton and the hessians wrote wrote this on our
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:43.980]  animals
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:47.820]  they attack at dawn the centuries the hessians all run out thousand of them
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:51.980]  and start at 200 yards shooting at george washington thousands of them
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:55.020]  and bullets were going through his hats through his clothes and they swore they
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:58.220]  were shooting him and nothing happened
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:05.420]  and it happened over and over again over and over again
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:11.020]  and george washington wrote he didn't brag about all this he wrote
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.580]  the whole time they were marching through all that snow and that ice and
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:16.460]  crossing those rivers
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.980]  he was praying to god just to have the strength to get there and defeat that
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:23.740]  enemy and you know he had the energy once he got
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:28.620]  there now that's where we come from that's who we are
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:31.980]  we're going to sit here and let a bunch of trash tell us what to do and how to
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:36.620]  think no it's a quote fee for them data ideas
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:39.260]  or bulletproof
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:44.460]  no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.820]  let's go to joe begge's report then jacar's report on election fraud so we
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:52.700]  can tell this here it is
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:58.220]  joe begge here with info wars dot com now earlier today listeners of the k lbj
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:03.020]  radio show called in with concerns about the voting process that is happening
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:07.340]  on super tuesday now multiple listeners called in saying that they had voted for
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:13.180]  donald trump and yet marco rubio was showing up this is the morning radio
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:16.700]  show host what's your name sir Todd jeffreys now Todd jeffreys what
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:19.020]  happened this morning when you're doing your show yeah it was uh pretty
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:22.380]  surprising probably about a dozen phone calls in a very short period of time
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:25.900]  they they just like you outlined they they wanted to vote for donald trump
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.020]  but in the end when they went back to check it showed that they voted for
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:33.020]  marco rubio uh and and some people actually called in
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:37.100]  saying that well it was a glitch well it was a operator error a mistake that
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:40.700]  sort of thing easily correctable if you just check your ballot before you leave
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:43.820]  the the voting booth uh but the bottom line
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.860]  is it's not accurate it's whether it's a mistake because of equipment or
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.180]  operator error the voter made a mistake
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:55.100]  the bottom line is it wasn't accurate i mean it it feels like
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:59.020]  you know we could pick an american idol more accurately
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:02.860]  than we can a president and if people can't trust the system you can't trust
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:06.860]  the process whether it was operator error or technical mistakes
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:11.500]  it's wrong and when people can't trust their election process
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.020]  then what the heck are we doing you know it's just not it's not fair it's not
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:18.860]  right it's not accurate and it's uh it feels so you know a lot of speculation
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:23.500]  and frustration and uh just a basic lack of trust in the system itself
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.460]  it was pretty interesting i was listening to some of your audio clips this morning
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:29.500]  i remember a caller coming calling and saying that uh
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:32.940]  last week his grandmother came in and voted tell me about that yeah he called
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:37.020]  in his grandmother had a problem voting last week and an older lady and he had
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:40.060]  some trouble with the the equipment in the voting booth with this new
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.940]  digital and high tech way that we're voting nowadays
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:46.860]  and uh and and i bet that happens a lot all across the country uh you know the
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.220]  older folks they're just not used to the the equipment and the technology
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:53.740]  and they don't know they should check it before they leave and it's very possible
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:57.340]  that we've had uh you know hundreds hundreds of thousands of people across
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.540]  this country in this election and in previous elections
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:04.540]  where what they thought they were voting on just didn't come out in the end
[01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:08.460]  it just wasn't accurate for them and therefore their vote didn't count
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:11.580]  it counted for somebody else or something else and and this is true not
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.500]  just in you know political races but bond package races you know various
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:19.980]  things we vote on at the polls well there you have it at the end of the day
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:24.460]  whoever you're voting for check the ballot make sure you're getting
[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:28.460]  what it is you're voting for and if not bring it to the attention of the people
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:32.620]  working there whether this is a scam this is a computer glitch
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:37.660]  or this is personal error make sure that you get the person you want
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:42.060]  so we don't have the wrong person in charge of our country this has been
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.780]  Jill Biggs with infowars.com that's right and some purists say oh don't vote it's
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.180]  all fraud we vote to show where the frauds are to keep them honest
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:54.300]  and to ferret out what's happening and that process is ongoing you can't just
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.180]  give up i'm going to play the jacari jackson piece
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:02.540]  of the next and and it's even more revealing uh so so that is coming up
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.420]  and then uh john McAfee who's running for presence
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:07.980]  is going to be joining us i got some really bad news you know it was going
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:10.380]  to be happening i'm going to try to get roger stone to
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:14.460]  pop on today to talk about this this just broke cnn
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.900]  met romney to speak on state of the 2016 presidential race
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:24.220]  tomorrow and the word is he's looking at throwing his hat into the ring or he'll
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:27.900]  create hysteria about is he going to run
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:31.660]  and that's the equivalent of an internal third party run to bring him in
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:36.460]  to make sure that the delegates are all broken up
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:40.860]  where he gets 300 400 500 trump only gets 300 400 500 the others get a couple
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:43.900]  hundred a piece and then they can steal it from him
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:46.620]  or make trump put romney in as the vp and then
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.700]  trump gets shot like reagan that romney will speak thursday on the state of the
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:54.860]  2016 presidential race he said in a press release 2012 republican nominee
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:58.220]  will speak at 11 30 a.m eastern time that's 12 30 tomorrow we'll be covering
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:00.620]  it live at the university of utah's hinkley
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:03.420]  instituted political forum the same day the remaining g.o.p.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:07.740]  presidential candidates are scheduled to debate in detroit
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:10.220]  romney's remarks come to the time of deep soul searching for the republican
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.580]  establishment as they consider ways to take on front runner donald trump who
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:18.140]  dominated super tuesday oh and they go on because of the clan stuff where he
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:21.020]  keeps repudiating and they keep saying he didn't
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:26.620]  and again they knew he'd repudiated more than 10 times
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:29.900]  by the time paul ryan came out all angry at trump and said you better
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:35.260]  repudiate hoaxing with cnn and fox and msnbc
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:39.500]  these people are the trash of the earth and the republicans that support them
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.980]  are the types that just want to feel like they're with a winner and part of
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:44.700]  the establishment and want their neighbors to think they're cool
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:48.220]  you people are worse than benedict arnold worse than the tories at the
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:53.260]  founding of this country you make me truly want to vomit
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:58.140]  every foreign globalist government every world globalist leader like larry
[01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.940]  summers and all of them are against trump
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:04.460]  because he's a nationalist and he's against unfair foreign trade deals
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:08.300]  they go oh we don't want to isolationist we don't want to protectionist
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:12.300]  that's not what it is when china has internal tariffs on our goods and we
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:14.860]  don't we don't have container ships going to

[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:46.700]  all the people who are running um and i think she would be she's worked hard
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.620]  for children for schools and i think our nation is
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:54.540]  failing in terms of its education for everyone you have reports of ballot
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:57.900]  switching people are calling into k lbj saying that they have their ballot
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:00.860]  switch does that concern you at all miss it angers me
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:05.740]  it that it's even possible and it worries me that people think it's possible
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.740]  um sometimes rumors have a basis for belief
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:13.900]  and so yeah that's troubling i hope whoever
[02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:17.260]  can get in to stop that stops that we do not need fraud
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:22.460]  anywhere anytime uh and i appreciate you know whoever
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:26.060]  is out there fighting to keep the process honest you guys like the next
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:29.340]  presidential election i like john casick
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:34.060]  john case yep okay um not only he's from my hometown and he's also very
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:39.260]  practical so um he's not you know uh doesn't
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:42.220]  throw a lot of frills out there and i think he's no nonsense but he wants to
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:45.260]  attack russia well carcin been cars
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:51.500]  okay so why do you like being cars because
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:58.380]  he's got the christian perspective but i know he's not gonna win so my next
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:03.180]  favorite is rubio because i think he really knows what's going on next
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.220]  president bernie sanders already feeling the burn
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:10.940]  i'm feeling it okay so i hope we have that much of a possibility in the united
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:15.740]  states to turn back all the crap can i say that you say whatever you want
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:19.900]  that's been going on and you know have uh somebody who's really
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:23.340]  committed to change i mean i don't know if a president can do anything anyway
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:29.100]  but if he can or she can and i would love there to be a woman but i got a
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:33.740]  respecter and i don't respect miss can i ask you who your favorite
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:38.940]  presidential candidates are uh hillary clinton like hillary
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:43.100]  sir quite honestly i love both of them for different reasons i think they'll
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:46.780]  both be fantastic whichever one wins bernie or hillary
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:50.380]  hillary feeling the burn okay oh donald j trump
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:53.020]  well i'll tell you sir i don't know if you heard the reports people are calling
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:56.860]  into k lbj they're saying that their ballots have been switched they wrote
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:00.380]  down trump when they got it back and had rubio on it same thing happened to me
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:04.940]  several years back i got voted uh all republican
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:08.700]  and at the end of the machine it said i voted democrat
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:12.780]  and they turned the machine back and sure enough i voted republican and they
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:15.420]  said well we're having trouble with these machines
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:20.060]  matter of fact it was right here oh yeah yeah is there any kind of remedy for
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:25.660]  that that you know of it's just everything's out of control
[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:29.180]  it's all deceitful everything's deceitful
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:36.220]  tell you what donald trump i'm not building a fence
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:43.740]  tell him that the wall just got 10 feet taller okay tell him
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:48.140]  jacar always puts something funny in his piece this great piece by jacar jackson
[02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:51.340]  i'm your host alex jones will be right back with
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:54.940]  mr mackinvey who's also running for president can talk about the apple iphone
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.540]  situation the nsa and take your calls
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:01.900]  we are quickly approaching the five year anniversary of osama bin laden's
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:05.100]  supposed death at the hands of navy seals and to commemorate this the
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.340]  obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:12.300]  may 2nd 2011 raid and if you read the myriad of
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:15.660]  articles at daily mail he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:19.420]  multimillion dollar fortune to the global jihad he also worried that his wife
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:22.540]  had been implanted with a tracking chip but he doesn't sign any of the
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:26.300]  documents in his name he signs one syed bin usama another
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:31.500]  usama bin muhammad and another abu abdala but i ask why didn't he use his cia
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:33.980]  codename of tim osman in any of these letters
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:37.740]  remember it was c bill edmunds the fbi translator who broke a gag order and said
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:41.340]  that the us had been working with usama bin laden right up until 9 11 and they
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.140]  were outsourcing him to conduct terror operations all over the world
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:47.500]  there's one final note he was calling on americans to help president obama
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:50.860]  fight climate change so using liberal logic if you don't
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:54.700]  disavow climate change then you were for osama bin laden

[02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:04.060]  wins or if hillary is the presumptive as well he is a trump fans he knows him
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:07.100]  personally and says he's the real deal doesn't mean he agrees everything he's
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:10.140]  saying i'm glad john mackinvey's running because it's
[02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:13.260]  he can always get media attention he's interesting fellow obviously in a
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:18.620]  smart guy on computer uh systems but he's running also for president to help
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:21.660]  expose what's going on and happening and he's been from day one talking about
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.980]  what's happening with the apple phone the rest of it
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:26.940]  of course the fbi just wants to set the case to get rid of all encryption and
[02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:30.540]  they pretty much admit that now it wasn't this one case it was a total stunt so
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:33.660]  mackinvey's going to be here to talk about that with us uh here's really the
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:37.980]  big news mitt romney to speak on state of the
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:41.740]  2016 presidential race tomorrow and the word is he's going to say he's
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:46.060]  thinking about running to create all this hype and then he'll come in and get
[02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:50.460]  enough of the delegates to make sure that that's the master plan
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:53.500]  to make sure that they get enough of the delegates that uh
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.380]  donald trump doesn't get half of them because we don't get half in the
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:59.660]  republican party system at the convention they can give it to
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:03.500]  basically whoever they want with the super delegates they control
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:07.340]  trump sits at 365 at super tuesday delegates
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.940]  and uh the other four candidates together respectively sit
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.300]  excuse me trump is at 316 the other candidates together
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:18.540]  are at 365 so they now already have more than half
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:22.060]  uh of of the delegates they intend to try to keep it
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:28.780]  that way going in to this entire situation so that is a big deal uh and so if
[02:10:28.780 --> 02:10:32.380]  you look at it go to rogerport.com seven and seven brutal
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:36.700]  battle bruise dims warren hillary of trump threat
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:39.980]  well they know he's the big threat in the polls they act like he can't be
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:43.020]  elected to manipulate weak-minded people it's like
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:46.220]  he's been saying he's against the klan since 2001 when he left the reform
[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:51.660]  party on his own because david duke got involved
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:55.100]  and then he said it four times before they cut his audio off and he didn't
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:59.340]  hear what they said and then he said it well what is it six more times
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.300]  and then last night in his press conference they said three times three
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:04.940]  different reporters why won't you decry the klan
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:07.500]  he said i just did it again right after he decried the other would say why won't
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.820]  you decry he goes i just decried it two minutes ago
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:12.860]  that said we ought to go into his press conference and just get that and put that
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:16.780]  together because the spectacle of that forget trump forget
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:19.980]  john maccabee forget jessie ventura forget illy clinton forget alex
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:24.060]  jones forget matt drudge forget the easter bunny
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:28.380]  what is this tactic where forever they went the nsa does not operate
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.300]  domestically when they knew when we knew it was or
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:33.660]  you can keep your doctor under obama care and it's totally secure and totally
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:37.820]  safe as a giant screw job or all the selection fraud that's
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:42.540]  going on who is maccabee.com is one of his websites
[02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:48.700]  maccabee m-c-a-f-e-e 2016.com future tense central.com i'm not
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:53.180]  going to go over his whole background at nasa and engineer and computer
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:55.820]  pioneer and the inventor of the most popular software for
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:00.380]  antivirus ever or his legendary escape being made into three major motion
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:03.180]  pictures and two or three other tv shows right now
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:06.620]  out of beliefs or the fact that he claimed it was riason and terrorist and
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:09.980]  muslim radicals coming into the u.s with fake passports i
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.460]  i actually said i didn't believe that at the time i mean i said i don't think
[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:16.140]  you're a liar but this is too crazy this is right when he got out
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:19.740]  and got back into the u.s well he talked to us from from guatemala actually
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:23.180]  before he was in guatemala he came on our show first recommended by his friends
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:26.380]  even though we were but i just couldn't buy it all i thought he was a good guy
[02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:28.220]  but then it all came out when he said it was true
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:36.780]  so the real life captain morgan uh meets uh i don't know
[02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:42.700]  i don't know captain morgan meets uh another swashbuckler let's say from the
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:47.580]  future han solo it's good to have you with us mr maccabee
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:51.020]  thank you allis i'm glad to be here and i i know you're a trump supporter and i
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:55.420]  i regret to say that um when i come out of the gate says the libertarian nominee
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:13:00.460]  and in uh in may i will mop the floor with vinal trump my apologies sir but
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:04.460]  that's just the way hey let me be clear let me be clear you're such a maverick
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:07.820]  and a real wild man i won an ace of spades in there
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:13.180]  that'll trump pun intended the establishments to globalist takeover so
[02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.900]  if you had a big shot of winning i before him maybe he's a libertarian you
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:19.340]  will you're gonna get liberals and conservatives and libertarians all i'm
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:22.460]  saying is separate from that your your quotes on trump
[02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:25.820]  if you want to say he's bad somewhere he's fine go ahead but isn't he scaring
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:28.700]  the whole power structure isn't that refreshing
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:32.540]  it is absolutely and and i hope i actually make it to the election
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:37.580]  uh yesterday on cnn i debated the fbi rep um
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:42.140]  mr james gordon a very slick uh a gentleman i actually is a goon but a
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:47.500]  gentleman from uh from the fbi um on their uh their attempt to force
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:51.420]  apple to put uh a master key in their software
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:55.500]  and uh i've been trashing the fbi and the nsa for the past week and i claimed
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:14:00.620]  in business insider that the um that the nsa by forcing a backdoor
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:03.820]  on a piece of software illegally by planting a programmer
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:07.740]  um in of a major computer manufacturer
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:10.940]  allowed the government to be hacked by foreign agents because the foreign
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:14.300]  agents got that backdoor so i fully expect any moment my door to be
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:17.980]  burst in and and a joint fbi uh and so you're saying you've
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:22.860]  released some classified info i did yes sir i did and and it was
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:26.380]  absolutely true uh it was first released by anonymous um
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:29.340]  but totally verified through a number of different ages well we know this keeps
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:33.580]  happening it's why apple is aren't saints but uh they're saying we put
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:35.980]  backdoors in everyone's going to get them and then we're
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:41.740]  going to be a crap platform like pc well the fbi agent last night had
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.340]  the nerve alex to say we are trying to protect you
[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:48.860]  you have to give up privacy and personal freedoms in order to get that
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:52.700]  it's like someday you may be right so we're going to gang rape you with 300
[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:56.380]  you know men absolutely so
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.460]  so but i think by the end of that interview i had i had completely trashed
[02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:06.220]  him uh the the my first interview on uh rt of about the apple fbi
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:09.500]  thing got over a half million views on my youtube channel i want to get into
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:11.900]  you're the computer expert i want to hear what you think about this obama
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:13.900]  care i want to i'm supporting you for president
[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:16.140]  because you'll educate folks i just hope you don't take too much away from
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:18.620]  trump but i support both of you i support mavericks
[02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:21.420]  that doesn't mean i got to support one person i mean that's why you're on but
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:24.700]  but getting into trump it's newsworthy give us your take on donald trump and
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:26.380]  why you say you're going to mop the floor with him
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:29.500]  john macafe yeah i'm actually i will mop the floor with whoever is the
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:33.180]  democratic nominee first alex because they they they deserve to uh to be
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:37.100]  mopped with um but there's a couple things you know i i like
[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:41.340]  trump uh trump is a is a nice guy and he's certainly uh galvanized and
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:46.460]  solidified a a massive base of americans um but there's certain things that
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:49.580]  he wants to build his wall and build his higher but look at the truth of this
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:54.380]  alex you're wanting to build a wall between our country and a nation of the
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:58.540]  finest tunnel builders on the planet this is the facts of it
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:03.260]  don't make it obsolete overnight i mean it it is a stunt him saying build a wall
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:07.900]  it is uh other than that i mean and and actually i don't like the style of the
[02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:11.260]  the politics in in either the the democratic or the republican party i
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:14.620]  mean donald trump and and ted crews are up there pointing fingers to each
[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:18.780]  other about the way they apply their makeup before they do the debate well
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.220]  honest to god alex we have problems in this country and ruby is talking about
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:27.420]  trumps wee wee not being big i'm sorry uh ruby is talking about uh donald
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:30.700]  trump's package yeah right his fingers are his fingers are
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:34.620]  short and stuffy i agree but both of them are doing the same thing and so
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:39.820]  honestly do you think other nations in the world are respecting us by the way
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:43.660]  the democrats and the republicans are doing their political machine no i don't
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:47.980]  think so we look like fools alex and forget the other nations i think the
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:51.420]  american people you know the fact that that we are putting up with it why don't
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:54.700]  we demand some seriousness i want to know i want to know what everybody stands
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:17:00.460]  for what are you going to do about uh cyber security about immigration about
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:04.300]  the economy what what are you going to do about our bloated government
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:08.780]  almost four trillion dollars a year down the tubes i mean i spent over 40
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:12.220]  million dollars paid over 40 million dollars in taxes in my life
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:15.660]  i received nothing from that 40 million i don't think you have either alex
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:19.260]  what are we doing here so let's walk through it let's walk through it
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:22.940]  let's start out with the apple situation i have a clip of one of the fbi folks
[02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:26.380]  actually out there putting on this info and i'm not even bashing the fbi but
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:29.340]  they're lying they want apple to make a piece of
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.020]  software as you said that doesn't exist isn't that indentured servitude and
[02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:36.860]  sets an incredible precedent yes it's a violation of the 13th
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.780]  amendment but beyond that alex what they're asking for is a master key when
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:43.500]  they don't need one they just have one phone that says please give us the
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:47.100]  information i offered to do it for the fbi for free assuming
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:53.580]  they could not and i did it on cnn on cnbc uh on cbs on larry king live
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:57.660]  on rt i wrote i wrote an article for business insider they had two million
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:01.660]  readers and i said i'll do this for free and explain to people you just go around
[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:03.980]  it you don't go through the encryption for those that don't
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:07.180]  know or understand this they could also get the data from the phone company in
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:10.460]  the isp so it's a total red herring from the fbi
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:14.700]  completely and then james comey lied under oath to congress yesterday when
[02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:18.780]  they asked him directly have you contacted everybody who has
[02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:22.540]  offered assistance with this problem well if he didn't know i've offered
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:26.060]  assistance then he's either living in a barn
[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:29.340]  or his is the people working for him have not notified him because i had a
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:33.260]  discussion with an uh with a an fbi agent last night where i said
[02:18:33.260 --> 02:18:36.780]  your your director lied under oath to congress
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:40.940]  no one contacted me and if he did not know that i was offering assistance and
[02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:44.460]  i i'm not believing it alex the rest of the world's scores held new
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:48.700]  the fbi was you were on every news channel out there it was huge
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:54.860]  yes so so he lied under oath to congress now that's how badly they want this key
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.460]  alex now lying under oath to congress it doesn't matter why you're lying
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:01.580]  this is so let's be clear they don't want to get warrants to go to the phone
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:04.780]  company of the isp or have computer people break up on the phones
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.380]  individually they want the master quick key to do it remotely to millions of
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:10.860]  phones at once every it's not remotely
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:14.380]  necessarily but but this is the beginning alex if they give them the key
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:17.500]  to break into every iphone on the planet
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:20.300]  then actually go to google and they say we want to do the same thing with
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:24.300]  android which is 95 percent of the market and the next thing you know we have no
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:26.940]  safety we have no privacy we have no security
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:30.140]  and once you've given that key or what we created that key
[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:33.020]  the fbi can't keep it like i bought out last night
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:36.540]  one month ago two fifteen old boys hacked into the fbi
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:39.820]  and walked off with exactly stay there come back with that
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:42.700]  exactly you have the federal government with tens of millions of employees
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:46.940]  full of foreign asset moles everything the feds have they give the communist
[02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:50.540]  chinese everybody else so why don't we just give the apple
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:53.020]  key to the chinese government i mean how about that because that's
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.900]  that's what the fbi is asking for john macabee he's the expert

[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:34.220]  and for helping us all talk about an issue that i believe is the hardest
[02:24:34.220 --> 02:24:37.660]  issue i've confronted in government which is how to balance
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:43.100]  the privacy we sow treasure that comes to us through the technology that we love
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:46.460]  and also achieve public safety which we also all very much treasure
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:51.340]  two terrorists in the name of isil killed 14 people and wounded 22 others
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:55.340]  at a office gathering and left behind three phones

[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:04.700]  beyond use and the third was left locked in any investigation is done
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:09.260]  competently the fbi would try to get access to that phone
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:12.700]  it's important that it's a live ongoing terrorism investigation but in any
[02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:15.660]  criminal investigation a competent investigator would try and use all
[02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:19.180]  lawful tools to get access to that device there are no
[02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:22.140]  demons in this debate the companies are not evil the
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:24.700]  government's not evil you have a whole lot of good people
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:28.700]  who see the world through different lenses who care about things
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:31.740]  all care about the same things in my view sure potentially
[02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:34.940]  because at any decision of a court about a matter
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:38.620]  is potentially useful to other courts which is what a precedent is
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:42.140]  i happen to think having talked to experts there are technical limitations
[02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:45.420]  to how useful this particular san Bernardino technique will be
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:49.660]  given how the phones have changed but sure other courts other prosecutors other
[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:53.180]  lawyers for for companies will look to that for guidance or to try and
[02:25:53.180 --> 02:25:55.820]  distinguish it is already a door on that iphone
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:59.420]  essentially we're asking apple take the vicious guard dog away let us try and
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:03.980]  pick the lock we're gonna go back to james
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:07.580]  clappers comments other people you know claiming that you know there is no nsa
[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:10.540]  spying domestically and just you know other ridiculous lies we have those
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:13.100]  clips that's the longer segment your phone calls are coming up
[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:17.340]  john mackafee of mackafee 2016 dot com running for presidents our
[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:20.460]  guest is a short segment long segment coming up
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:23.980]  technically going through the lies there he's either super ignorant
[02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:27.420]  and then is it qualified to be fbi director he's lying to everyone
[02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:30.780]  i'm not a computer person i knew day one they could go to the phone company go
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:33.500]  to the isp get all the records of where they went
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:37.100]  um you claim something smashed it can be reconstructed but this other phone
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:41.180]  isn't and now they admit to congress no we just want to make all the companies
[02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:45.420]  constantly give us the keys or make keys to all the encryption
[02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:50.060]  i mean this is such deception well they're trying to make it an issue of
[02:26:50.060 --> 02:26:53.580]  privacy versus security and and privacy is certainly an issue
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:57.100]  but i knew that's what they would say so i never mentioned privacy i talked
[02:26:57.100 --> 02:27:00.540]  about the insecurity they would create to the american citizens
[02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:04.940]  like making apple create a master key which is going to get into the public
[02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:08.300]  within a matter of weeks and if the public has a master key then
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:11.740]  while your daughter is showering if her phone is on the console
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:15.340]  the chinese or black hat hackers can be watching her they're going to steal our
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:18.380]  credit cards their mtr bank accounts they will steal our
[02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:21.420]  identities this is what you're asking us to accept
[02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:25.020]  and the fbi agent i was talking to last night kept repeating
[02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:28.780]  well it's you know you have to give up some privacy to get secured i said sir i
[02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:31.740]  haven't mentioned privacy so he came prepared to talk about
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:36.300]  privacy not about an issue which is far more urgent
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:39.500]  which is he's making us far more insecure
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:43.500]  by asking apple to do this it is absurd we're doing this to help you and make
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.780]  you secure but now your entire lives are going to be
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:52.220]  monitored by the entire world that's not making me anymore secure elix
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:56.300]  imagine what will happen if master encryption keys start getting made as
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:59.180]  apple points out they don't even have this to get into the phone itself
[02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:02.620]  they just have it on the encryption for communication if this president said
[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:05.900]  it's a pandora's box what is the fbi thinking by the way
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:09.420]  france has come out today and wants to find apple one million euros
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.580]  each time it refuses to decrypt an iphone
[02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:17.020]  well you know this is this is the problem with politics this is a problem
[02:28:17.020 --> 02:28:20.540]  with bureaucrats is that everybody's taking more and more power
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:25.500]  and how can the fbi gain more power it can gain more power elix by knowing
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:30.380]  everything about everybody in america at all times this is the power that they
[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:33.100]  want well i don't want them to have that power i'm sorry
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:37.020]  they don't deserve it uh and and it's an unconstitutional
[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:41.820]  and it violates our own individual here i mean i'm not a master computer
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:45.260]  hacker and programmer like you why that hacker but in fact in the government
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:49.740]  you've name and exposed what happened in police isn't it the apps
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:54.140]  and things like that uh is how people can still get these phones
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:58.060]  and most apps have already been broken uh and so somebody has a bunch of apps the
[02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:00.940]  fbi has systems to break into those apps they've
[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:04.220]  also worked with app companies to put back doors in i mean isn't this a red
[02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:07.980]  herring on top of that well it's a huge red herring
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:11.660]  they want the information on the one phone i can hack into that one phone
[02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:15.260]  it'll take me some time okay and it'll take a team of people so it's not
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:18.460]  something everybody can use all the time to break into iphone's
[02:29:18.460 --> 02:29:22.060]  however i can do it i believe the fbi can do it why
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:25.580]  why can ten thousand people in the world not working for the fbi be able to get
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:29.340]  into that phone but they can't get into it get real elix
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:32.860]  they don't really want just that one phone they want the key
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:36.060]  give me the key they probably not not even gonna use it on that phone
[02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:40.060]  the keys to the kingdom stay there my friend john mackafee's our guest i'm
[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:44.140]  alex jones the tip of the spear is in faux wars dot
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:47.820]  com the enemy doesn't like that site spread the word
[02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:51.660]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:56.540]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:56.540 --> 02:30:01.980]  we are quickly approaching the five year anniversary of osama bin laden's
[02:30:01.980 --> 02:30:05.260]  supposed death at the hands of navy seals and to commemorate this the
[02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:09.420]  obama administration released 113 documents that were seized in the
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:12.860]  may 2nd 2011 raid and if you read the myriad of articles at
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:16.460]  daily mail he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million
[02:30:16.460 --> 02:30:19.740]  dollar fortune to the global jihad he also worried that his wife had been
[02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:23.180]  implanted with a tracking chip but he doesn't sign any of the documents in
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:27.740]  his name he signs one sayid bin usama another usama bin muhammad
[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:31.580]  and another abu abdallah but i ask why didn't he use his cia
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:35.340]  codename of tim osman in any of these letters remember it was c bell edmunds
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:38.860]  the fbi translator who broke a gag order and said that the us had been working
[02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:42.300]  with usama bin laden right up until 9 11 and they were outsourcing him to
[02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:44.300]  conduct terror operations all over the world
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:47.900]  there's one final note he was calling on americans to help president obama fight
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:50.940]  climate change so using liberal logic if you don't
[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:54.780]  disavow climate change then you were for osama bin laden

[02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:33.500]  monday through friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central we're here live
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:37.260]  david night's host in the fourth hour utah sheriff says he will deputize every
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:41.420]  citizen of necessary to stop forest service abuse
[02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:45.420]  rubio claims he fought trump to a draw
[02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:50.780]  talk about laugh out loud or is he hinting at a strategy
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:55.340]  we're also going to get into a host of other big news and the election
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:58.780]  hopefully he'll get to the clip to a van jones blowing up at people and
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:02.620]  race baiting on msnbc i haven't gotten to that yet i want to go to the callers
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:05.020]  like adam and others that have been holding about the election mac if he
[02:34:05.020 --> 02:34:09.020]  obviously is a presidential candidate he can speak to that john macAfee
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:15.020]  and he's getting into what's happening with the nsa the the fbi
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:20.380]  we also have election fraud going on classic hacking of voting machines
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:23.980]  we have all over the country we've interviewed election judges witnesses
[02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:29.420]  people have happened to it flips from trump to rubio or cruz and it's never
[02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:32.540]  the other way around and we had callers calling in about that so i want to go
[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:35.340]  to your calls here in a few minutes when john macAfee
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:38.700]  we also have a video with richard reeves saying most sanders supporters say
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:43.180]  they'll go trump instead
[02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:46.380]  getting into trump one of my biggest problems with him and i imagine this is
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:49.180]  yours because we're on the same page together
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:53.260]  is he doesn't know computers i know people that know him they say no
[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:56.620]  he doesn't even really look at computers everything's printed off for him
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.540]  he reads like six seven eight hours a day but everything's printed for him
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:04.700]  he didn't want to watch videos and what's transcripts he's a speed reader
[02:35:04.700 --> 02:35:08.940]  and he's just like they have a warrant let him in he doesn't understand
[02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:12.300]  so he needs to have somebody like you advising him if you don't win and he
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:17.180]  does but yeah he says things like that he
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:20.300]  just doesn't understand i'm not a tech guy but i understand
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:23.740]  and i understand the fbi is classically lying about this and plus the
[02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:27.180]  government's bringing in ices to attack us and then saying give our rights up
[02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:31.260]  just like europe's time what else is important for folks to know about this
[02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:34.300]  because you've done this on tv you can get into these phones you can get into
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:37.660]  iphones i've i've talked to people with ipads
[02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:40.540]  and iphones i've talked to the awesome police i know friends that have had
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:43.660]  their phones stolen iphones and the police go no they've got
[02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:47.260]  fencers that know how to basically get into it
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:50.860]  uh and they usually get through apps so i don't think it's 10 000 people that
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:54.300]  know i think it's more than that especially if it's an older version
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:57.340]  because these hacks get online it's now you're the one of the master hackers
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:01.100]  you're well known as a computer guru is in my layman's
[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:04.780]  uh moving around in the dark here am i right or wrong
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:07.820]  well you have to be right but let me let me explain something extremely
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:10.940]  important which most of the american public and all of our government seems
[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:14.140]  to have missed alex and that is the next war is not going to be fought with
[02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:18.300]  nuclear weapons and battleships and airplanes it will be a cyber war and
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:23.660]  it will be many times more devastating than anything imaginable in a nuclear
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:27.180]  war a report to congress last year by a group of
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:31.420]  cybersecurity professionals claimed that 90 percent of the american
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:37.580]  population would die yes would perish in a in a cyber war with china
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:41.020]  and why because china currently has the ability
[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:44.700]  to destroy our entire power infrastructure
[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:48.140]  and our chips were built there and they've been caught putting back doors
[02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:51.980]  even in defense chips why would our elite make everything smart
[02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:55.740]  have us adopted the chinese heaven and then now we're wide open to a sky that
[02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:59.980]  takeover because it's on purpose yes of course because the chips that they're
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:03.180]  you are that we're using are you're all right for all of our communication
[02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:06.380]  software is made by the chinese and it's firmware
[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:10.300]  so we can't even see what's inside of alex so so the chinese have back doors
[02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:13.260]  they can shut down our communications for less
[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:17.020]  but months the ukrainian power system was shut down for an entire day the
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:20.380]  entire country by two teenage hackers using a piece of
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:23.900]  software that was 35 years old and the teenagers are also breaking into the
[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:27.340]  fbi and they broke into the fbi just last month
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:31.660]  so the chinese have the ability to shunt our power in such a way
[02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:35.500]  that we burn out substation after substation until there's nothing left
[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:39.740]  and we will not have the power alex to rebuild here won't hillary save us then
[02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:44.140]  because of you i'm sorry a big sarcastic won't won't
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:46.380]  won't hillary save us won't political correctness
[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:50.780]  save us from that yeah that was a good joke
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:55.100]  no we won't we have to have someone who understands the at least the fundamental
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:59.340]  science the cyber science that glues our entire society
[02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:03.260]  and our industry together alex because everything is run on computers now
[02:38:03.260 --> 02:38:06.700]  the reason we would all die if there were cyber wars because we would starve to
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:10.780]  death without power we can't run our computers and computers
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:15.020]  for example control all food distribution in this country
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.540]  we can't we have no backups we fired the people that used to do it
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:21.500]  so if our computers are down we don't get food distribution
[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:25.820]  in three weeks uh the walmart food stores and and and
[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:29.420]  safeway and every other food store in the country will run out of food
[02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:33.340]  we can't distribute it we cannot produce it because all the packaging why would
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:36.380]  our government more than any other wire everything in to be dependent and put
[02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:39.660]  backdoors in it and buy chips from our enemies who've been caught
[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:43.420]  you know having shut off switches and the icbms i mean
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:46.460]  look the globalists moved everything to china on purpose they've double crosses
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:50.300]  we've been sold out we're being set up well you're right you're absolutely
[02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:53.340]  right because nobody seriously alex nobody not
[02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:56.060]  even our government officials could be that stupid
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:59.180]  exactly why do they badmouth the founding fathers why do they badmouth
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:03.100]  families why do they badmouth people that are into patriotism and sovereignty
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:07.740]  because we've already been taken over and they want to kill switch a heart plug
[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:10.940]  to destroy the country if we don't play ball with a new world order
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:14.860]  we have been totally taken over the most horrific thing i heard in the
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:17.980]  interview with the fbi representative last night was he said
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:22.380]  you have to give up freedom and privacy in order to get security
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:27.420]  i was flabbergasted and shocked us but that's the attitude those that give up
[02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:31.580]  liberty for security getting either that's well that's absolutely
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:34.380]  absolutely ben franklin i think was the first that's right but
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:39.100]  but absolutely uh but they don't really believe it they want us to believe it
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:42.140]  so that they already bought armoured doubts in other parts of the world
[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:45.740]  they're setting us up be destroyed they're actually foreign agents i'm
[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:49.500]  serious folks i'm not just saying that we are totally run by enemies preparing
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:53.180]  us down the road to be nuked shut down you name it i mean we are
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:56.540]  gone we are borders are wide open but they take our
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:00.060]  rights they ship and radical mobs but they take our rights we're wide open
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:03.660]  europe's going down too it's over this is world war four we were taken over by
[02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:07.100]  globalist but but you know we're still americans alex and
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:10.940]  i think the human spirit is indomitable and infinite and we're not stupid
[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:14.540]  we're not i mean i tried to tell the fbi agents of the representative last night
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:18.700]  now we aren't that stupid please we're not we're not going to buy it anymore
[02:40:18.700 --> 02:40:21.660]  we're not going to listen to it anymore i agree don't you think trump is a
[02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:26.300]  manifestation of the anger and the revolution that's happening right now
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:30.460]  absolutely i he's angry i'm angry you're angry we're all angry
[02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:34.300]  we have to be angry look what's look what has happened to us look what has been
[02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:37.740]  done to us by our government our government tells me
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:41.180]  that my body does not belong to me it belongs to them
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:44.860]  it tells me what i can put into it what i can do with it
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:48.140]  what new lifesaving drugs if i develop a terminal illness
[02:40:48.140 --> 02:40:52.380]  i'm allowed or not allowed to take because if i'm a dying man they're
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:55.580]  afraid that these drugs may harm me my god
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:59.180]  my body belongs to me alex your body belongs to you and we'd have the right
[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:02.460]  to kill yourself though but not treat yourself
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:07.660]  yes basically that's it absolutely what's that tell you what you did
[02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:10.860]  it's it's a horror that we're living in it's a nightmare but we let we need to
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:14.060]  wake up as americans and we can alex we can where we are
[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:17.020]  i agree john mackinvey i want to go to calls here on the presidential race
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:20.460]  you're an expert on hacking uh we know they flip the numbers and the rest of it
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:24.300]  i appreciate adam holding i appreciate bruce holding i appreciate uh
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:27.820]  mike and craig and wild in that order holding you're on the air with john

[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:50.540]  libertarian nomination absolutely there's no
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:54.540]  there's no question in my mind i mean i'm sure there's a question in governor
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:42:00.060]  uh johnson's mind but not mine what kind of dog is that back there is that a cat

[02:42:50.540 --> 02:42:53.820]  they would make better presidents than uh hillary or mark of course she is
[02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:57.100]  barking like a dog now adam in minnesota you're on the air with john macovie
[02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:00.940]  he's running for 2016 for the libertarian nomination uh adam you're on the air
[02:43:00.940 --> 02:43:05.340]  worldwide all right alex uh hey there mr maxi
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:09.260]  actually just got an email from macovie's uh spyware so i should probably
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:12.540]  renew that uh with the free trial ending but glad to be honest you got it yeah
[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:15.020]  macovie doesn't he hasn't been part of macovie's
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:18.780]  company for decades or how long since you got out of macovie
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:21.740]  it's been it's been 15 years or more alex and when i had the when i had the
[02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:24.940]  company the software was fantastic as soon as i left it went downhill so i've
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:27.500]  had nothing to do with it for 15 years yeah uh did you
[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:31.740]  adam what's your view on super tuesday and what you witnessed
[02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:35.660]  yeah so i have a couple uh two part question first about the election and
[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:38.620]  then the second part about the esoteric hive mind and i actually kind of want
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:42.220]  to get macovie's take on that as well uh but yeah with the election
[02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:45.740]  yesterday i'm from minnesota and surprisingly rubio his only
[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:49.500]  was here and i think it has to do with these mind games that the
[02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:53.420]  the establishment plays through the media you know marco mentham and and and
[02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:57.500]  this kkk disavowing question that really does get people into
[02:43:57.500 --> 02:44:01.980]  a locked mindset of of oh i'm gonna vote this way so i can be viewed this way or
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:04.940]  whatnot and yeah so i think you know like you said
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:07.740]  before with rubio's votes turning to or trump's
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:11.180]  votes turning to rubio it's a kind of a shaving kind of getting a close call
[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:14.380]  because if you want texas crews would have been out of the race and i think he
[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:18.140]  probably potentially did win texas did win all yes but it's beyond that it's
[02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:21.740]  beyond that they can't have him having 50% of the delegates
[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:25.340]  when he goes into the nomination process they're allowed to vote then
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:28.700]  amongst themselves and the delegates and steal it and they said they will
[02:44:28.700 --> 02:44:32.300]  so this is a hundred percent proof going on all over the place
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:36.060]  they're setting it up yet again uh because they're so scared of him and
[02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.900]  how are we ever going to get a libertarian elected
[02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:42.940]  you know if these two party systems continue to engage in all this jury
[02:44:42.940 --> 02:44:46.540]  rigging well there's no suspension that you
[02:44:46.540 --> 02:44:50.060]  mentioned earlier i think i think the press has a huge part in this whole
[02:44:50.060 --> 02:44:53.420]  issue for example you mentioned donald trump and and his
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:57.260]  relationship to the kkk leader they purposely set that up he's many times
[02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:00.940]  before disavowed this gentleman uh david duke many times
[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:04.140]  but they set this entire thing up so they could make it look like
[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:08.300]  he was a kkk sympathize and then even though he disavows at 10 14 times they
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:11.820]  keep saying why won't you disavow in the same press conference last night
[02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:14.940]  we got to put this together three different reporters say disavow he goes
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:17.740]  well i already did disavow much but i disavow again next thing
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:21.420]  we just why won't you disavow the kkk i did just disavow but okay this is again
[02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:24.380]  third guy and he goes wait a minute when are you gonna stop this
[02:45:24.380 --> 02:45:28.060]  and see they'll use that to say he didn't disavow so macabre let me ask you
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:31.740]  now as a joke will you disavow the kkk even though you have
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:36.540]  nothing to do with it i i know no one within the kkk at
[02:45:36.540 --> 02:45:40.300]  least to my knowledge alex and i will definitely disavow the kkk
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:44.060]  i'm against anyone why won't you disavow him i'm sorry
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:49.980]  why won't you disavow him why why do i
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:55.100]  you get it now go ahead and disavow again i've got the moral authority
[02:45:55.100 --> 02:45:59.740]  disavow again i point made you've got it this is how it works alex
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:03.500]  no wait a minute you won't disavow why are you disavow

[02:46:14.620 --> 02:46:18.540]  the kkk you you're seeing him not disavow folks
[02:46:18.540 --> 02:46:21.180]  i'm gonna ask you one more time or paul ryan's gonna have to come out give a
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:24.540]  speech now he done it 10 times by paul ryan's
[02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:27.980]  speech he's done it over 14 as of last night and i want you to

[02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:44.060]  disavow
[02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:47.980]  seriously right duke is my best friend we hang out together and drink beers
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:53.340]  now if you actually okay why won't you disavow the kkk
[02:46:53.980 --> 02:46:57.420]  now seriously i'm gonna take this piece and edit together with him disavowing
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:47:00.460]  over and over again at the same press conference disavowing and they go
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:05.260]  why won't you disavow it's that crazy what are these people thinking john
[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:09.500]  the abc and nbc and cnn are going to take that cut where i said
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:12.540]  david duke is my best friend and they're going to use that you know this for a
[02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:16.060]  fact this is how it works this is just how it works
[02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:19.980]  but you know the good news is people aren't buying it anymore john
[02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:23.500]  yet we're not we're getting smarter elix we really are thank god for that
[02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:26.620]  uh or at least at least you can fool some of the people
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:29.820]  all of the time all the people some of the time but you just can't fool all of
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:32.540]  us forever and we're getting smart and we're looking through it and we're
[02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:35.820]  seeing through this nonsense the government wants to look into my life
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:39.180]  no i want to look into the government's life it's our money that you're spending
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:42.380]  how are you spending it what are you doing with it i want to know well that
[02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:47.580]  makes a lot of sense but you wouldn't disavow the kkk
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:52.220]  all right hey adam anything else from minnesota
[02:47:52.220 --> 02:47:55.580]  yeah so uh the second part i had was about the esoteric knowledge you're
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:58.940]  talking about and something about a scatology the study of end times because
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:02.780]  honestly when we do get to the robin hole and the father of all lives the devil
[02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:06.620]  we do see you know the coming of the antichrist and and one big sigh up i think
[02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:10.140]  that people are not really realizing is that you know when they come in with
[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:13.180]  these you know virtual realities and and these alternatives
[02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:17.100]  uh worlds for us to just kind of delve into and and get sucked into
[02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:20.060]  and really i think what drudge said about you know feeling the air feeling
[02:48:20.060 --> 02:48:23.340]  the water is important but when the antichrist comes he
[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:27.420]  will come in the place of saying he is jesus that all the people around the
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:29.740]  world the billions of christians will flock to him
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:32.700]  and see that you know man god being one in the same
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:35.980]  but i think in in terms of when jesus returns he will
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:39.340]  you know he will disavow that and say you know there's only one god the father
[02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:41.980]  and heaven you know he says why do you call me good
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:45.900]  and and and when you see in the in the old testament the the uh
[02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:49.100]  moses and his brother erin washing their feet washing their hands and praying
[02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:53.180]  and bowing and prayer you see these indigenous spiritual practices
[02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:56.220]  continued by the orthodox jews by the orthodox christians
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:59.500]  and and and by the muslims so at the end of the day i think what they're really
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:03.180]  trying to do is is continue these mind games and this brainwashing
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:06.380]  i hear you i appreciate your call well i've always said this whether the bible's
[02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:10.780]  right or god's real or whatever the elite is using as a template of control
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:13.740]  and they act just like the devil would so it's real regardless
[02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:17.500]  so end of debate i hear you bruce in new york you're on the air with john mackafee
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:21.820]  go ahead hey uh alex and john the
[02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:25.020]  pleasure to be on the air i need to disavow the kkk
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:27.900]  first bruce can you disavow that for me
[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:31.420]  absolutely okay wait a minute i gotta let races go bruce
[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:38.060]  you didn't disavow the kkk i did i said absolutely not in america
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:41.260]  wow bruce you won't disavow the kkk i'm gonna have paul ryan call a press
[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:47.260]  conference well maybe uh you're working for cnn
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:51.340]  i want to hear you disavow their practices cnn actually said that
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:56.220]  disavow it i i disavow every practice oh and you know
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:50:02.620]  it's a shame that cnn has been riding this dead horse
[02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:06.860]  for three days i'm so pissed i hear you it's pure propaganda what's your view
[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:11.980]  on what's happening brother well i just wanted to call and say uh
[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:16.220]  thank you and thank your staff for everything they do
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:22.380]  well it choked up here because uh i understand because you've been exposed
[02:50:22.380 --> 02:50:25.260]  for for being a bad person obviously i have moral authority
[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:28.460]  because i accuse you of being one of the clans so i'm i'm good
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:32.140]  by the way i have a show starting next week on msnbc
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:35.500]  i should say that i originally called to talk about trump but
[02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:39.100]  go ahead i want you and your i want you and your viewers to know that
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:45.260]  uh i served in our military for almost eight years
[02:50:45.260 --> 02:50:52.220]  and your current cia the cia for 23 years after that and uh
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:59.660]  you know i had to veil over my eyes but uh you know after 9 11 everything else
[02:50:59.660 --> 02:51:05.500]  happened uh my eyes opened and uh i can only
[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:09.260]  say that you know there's there's uh bad things
[02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:12.860]  happening in our country i agree would you agree
[02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:16.380]  that we've pretty much been taken over that this is an occupation
[02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:20.380]  that's why they have us doing bad things they wanted to moralize all of us
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:24.540]  well here's the one here's one of the worst things we've done here alex and
[02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:29.020]  that is uh we treat our veterans like they're aliens
[02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:32.860]  you know we ask a young man and a young woman to go overseas and risk their
[02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:35.100]  life and say look you may not come back alive
[02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:38.700]  and if you do come back you may come back missing an arm or a leg or both
[02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:42.060]  and when they do come back missing an arm or a leg we say thank you and we
[02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:45.180]  discard them it's a tragedy we have a contract with
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:48.220]  these people it may not be a written contract but it's a it's a
[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:51.980]  an uh an unknown contract if we ask you
[02:51:51.980 --> 02:51:55.820]  to risk your life for the country but then good god alex we owe you something
[02:51:55.820 --> 02:51:59.580]  when you come back and you're maimed we owe it to you and we we're not giving
[02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:03.260]  us they're persecuting them because these wars aren't good but these are at
[02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:06.300]  least people that are willing to sacrifice the parasite class
[02:52:06.300 --> 02:52:10.140]  the donor class is scared of them sir you say you were in the cia that's where
[02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:13.580]  they recruit out of the military obviously it's a huge organization
[02:52:13.580 --> 02:52:15.980]  uh but specifically you were probably i don't know what you were involved in
[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:19.260]  analyst humet whatever it was but back then we were really dealing with the
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:20.780]  russians and others and we'd have all the
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:24.460]  electronic surveillance so that's why the missions i know were a lot different
[02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:28.700]  but the mission today is domestic and a lot of really bad stuff's happening
[02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:32.140]  what is your view or what ended up waking you up and where do you think this is
[02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:35.980]  all going well when i when i uh when i started on
[02:52:35.980 --> 02:52:41.820]  with the agency it was uh i served in the european theater
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:46.780]  for 20 years uh traveled almost every month
[02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:51.260]  and uh you know we're fighting the soviet union
[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:56.940]  so in my viewpoint you know that was the the greatest thing we could do as a
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:53:01.820]  country but uh you know there are a lot of you
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:06.300]  know there there's a lot happening behind the curtain
[02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:11.100]  that people don't realize and uh
[02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:16.860]  you know after you know after 9 11 when 9 11 happened i'm not i'm not a
[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:20.700]  conspiracy theorist but you know a lot of things
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:23.980]  happened with 9 11 with the two buildings coming down
[02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:27.180]  and then building seven dropping like you know it was uh
[02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:33.020]  you know a uh a demo
[02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:39.580]  uh project sure uh you know yeah yeah let me guess i i bet you weren't a
[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:43.020]  analyst or a paper pusher or a bureaucrat in the CIA were you a guy on the
[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:45.980]  ground yeah it was a guy in the ground but
[02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:52.380]  but not not uh not ground not the ground force you know i wasn't
[02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:56.780]  toting guns or anything yeah uh but uh you know i served my country
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:54:00.220]  no no i understand i you just sound like a regular guy but also smart
[02:54:00.220 --> 02:54:03.420]  and uh it's it's pretty amazing folks don't know what went on during the cold
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:07.580]  war with people on the ground in europe uh pretty wild stuff from what i've
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:10.300]  read in books and and also heard from some people that were there
[02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:14.380]  uh just daily killings fighting the soviets uh just amazing stuff and a
[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:16.220]  lot of that's heated back up in ukraine today
[02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:20.380]  god bless you sir i appreciate your call uh john maccafee i want to hit
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:25.660]  a call or two here in the next segment i really appreciate you coming on with us
[02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:28.620]  other tidbits of knowledge as you run for president
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:32.780]  people getting behind you obviously libertarian uh vote
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:35.740]  i don't really see you hurting trump or hillary i see you kind of equally
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:38.780]  drawing from liberals and conservatives and libertarians and
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:42.220]  certainly educating people so i support your run for the presidency
[02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:45.980]  because i hope you get it you know to to to use as a bully pulpit to educate
[02:54:45.980 --> 02:54:49.500]  because resistance is victory even if you don't win it's a win so i would
[02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:52.300]  challenge folks to get involved in supporting it i know jacari jackson is
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:55.340]  a supporter of you that's who he says he's voting for president for so he hopes
[02:54:55.340 --> 02:55:00.300]  you get the nomination well you know i i will win if we get the american support
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:03.420]  and and we need support alex we're a very small party
[02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:08.620]  um and please go to maccafee 2016.com if you can volunteer your time
[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:11.580]  or even donate 50 cents it would help us tremendously
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:15.340]  we are up against the two major machines that basically chew up people
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:19.900]  the soul and the body of of of mankind and make them cogs in a wheel
[02:55:19.900 --> 02:55:23.260]  i hate to say that but it is the truth and it has to change and this is the
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:25.340]  only year i think we have where this will happen
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:29.420]  we can change we can actually become make a president from the libertarian
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:31.660]  party this year i believe i will be the nominee
[02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:34.860]  and you have to believe me i'm 70 i do not do things lightly i'm not doing this
[02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:38.540]  to make a statement or to try to to raise the awareness for a topic no i'm
[02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:41.180]  doing this to win i can't afford to waste just
[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:44.460]  a year doing nothing i will win this this this presidential election i
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:47.500]  promise you but we need your help well john maccafee i know you'll win the
[02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:50.060]  info we're getting the word out regardless so god bless you look forward to

[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:01.580]  hour because i also want to air this piece
[02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:05.100]  with with richard reeves uh where the bernie folks are saying they're not
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:09.020]  going to vote for hillover they're going to vote uh for uh trump if she wins
[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:12.700]  that is a big game changer trump is unstoppable unless they
[02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:15.980]  steal the election from him that that is a no-brainer or unless he goes out
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:19.420]  and starts saying really bad things which are meant to destroy himself and if he
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:22.460]  does that it's the biggest siobh i've ever witnessed and i've been
[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:25.820]  suckered and that hadn't really ever happened on something big like this
[02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:28.780]  where i've studied it in depth i get you know i get stuff wrong all the time when
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:31.980]  i go too quick or don't think about something and i make mistakes
[02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:36.780]  my gut tells me this is historic i agree with uh people
[02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:39.980]  like the governor uh former governor of arkansas
[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:42.700]  how can we come out saying this is an overthrow of this corrupt government
[02:56:42.700 --> 02:56:45.820]  that this is a movement well that's what we've been saying but it's not overthrow
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:49.980]  the u.s government it's an overthrow of the donor class the foreign interest
[02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:53.100]  the special interest that say they're setting up a world government and
[02:56:53.100 --> 02:56:56.860]  conquering nation states and have already done it in most places
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:00.620]  briefly you don't know the power you have a spread the word about info wars

[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:19.500]  all together ben karson is telling supporters he sees no
[02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:22.860]  path forward for presidential campaign and is signaling obviously that he's
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:27.020]  ready to throw his support for somebody uh so uh look for that and i hope he
[02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:30.860]  goes behind trump because that'll put us over the top and may even be able to
[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:35.100]  override the fraud finally ladies and gentlemen

[03:00:20.300 --> 03:00:24.140]  richard reeves talks to bernie sanders supporters who are they going to support
[03:00:24.140 --> 03:00:29.020]  if he loses their answers are very important
[03:00:29.020 --> 03:00:34.220]  oh you already voted well come here come here
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:39.660]  here what's your name sir why it tackle why tell us who you voted for
[03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:45.420]  uh i voted for bernie sanders bernie sanders so a lot of your
[03:00:45.420 --> 03:00:49.100]  comrades here on campus voted for bernie sanders evidently right that
[03:00:49.100 --> 03:00:53.180]  is the impression i get yes so when you talk to your comrades what do they
[03:00:53.180 --> 03:00:56.940]  think about don j trump that he's their second choice
[03:00:56.940 --> 03:01:00.780]  really second choice yeah no this is a new thing here now
[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:04.300]  explain to us why they would that don j trump would be the second choice for
[03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:10.300]  bernie sanders supporters because they uh value that he's not an establishment
[03:01:10.300 --> 03:01:14.060]  candidate and then he doesn't take big money from other people
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:18.380]  and his name is hillary clinton wow so folks there's something i've been
[03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:21.340]  talking about for a while is i think the number two
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:24.940]  guy for a lot of bernie sanders folks is don j trump and here we have
[03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:29.260]  confirmation from a young man here at ut so
[03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:33.340]  you already voted or you're going to vote i already voted okay so
[03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:37.340]  besides bernie sanders and trump who did you look at who did you
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:42.460]  consider um that was really pretty much it
[03:01:42.460 --> 03:01:45.820]  so that makes a breeze so pretty much anti-establishment absolutely that's
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:49.740]  all right important to me reports up at info wars dot com and we should do more
[03:01:49.740 --> 03:01:52.700]  of these but the polls are showing a lot of them are going to go
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:55.420]  trump and then they ask well would you go for
[03:01:55.420 --> 03:01:59.420]  crews or rubio and they say no and and that's what the numbers are showing
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:03.100]  it's an anti-establishment revolt against the donor class
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:06.620]  which is the globalist and of course they're freaked out at trump saying he'll
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.300]  bypass him he's already bypassed him spending a
[03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:14.380]  fraction in the campaign of what others have and not spending money on radio and
[03:02:14.380 --> 03:02:18.540]  tv ads and newspaper ads so the whole system the whole
[03:02:18.540 --> 03:02:22.620]  stinking system that has hijacked the country and maneuvered us to this point
[03:02:22.620 --> 03:02:28.060]  is so upset the big bad news is though looks like
[03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:30.460]  they're getting ready he's got a big announcement he's making tomorrow
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:33.420]  it'll probably be that he's looking to run for president to try to make it look
[03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:35.420]  like you know people begging to do it
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:39.900]  mit romney and uh karson says he's just about to get out so we'll follow all of
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:43.340]  that very very closely i want to jam in one more
[03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:45.820]  call the folks want to hold it i'll probably talk tonight
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:51.020]  craig in california thanks for holding craig you're on the air go ahead
[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:54.060]  hey alex pleasure to get to talk to you thanks so much for having me on the air
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:02:57.660]  please don't thank me thank you okay well i want to thank you for the
[03:02:57.660 --> 03:03:00.780]  discount on the stuff because i did take advantage of the sale this weekend
[03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:04.940]  thank you and i was it i was a skeptical supporter of the products just to
[03:03:04.940 --> 03:03:08.300]  support the show and i got the mail vitality and it
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:12.380]  really does make the blood flow and i then i ordered three new products this
[03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:15.100]  night by the way i'm not somebody i don't want to
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:18.620]  get graphic but this is medical here and i'm being honest i'm
[03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:21.980]  i mean i don't have a problem let's just say that but i forgot what was like to
[03:03:21.980 --> 03:03:24.700]  be 18 uh so i already had you know good
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:28.300]  your stamina and vitality but it's like whoa 40 something i really
[03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:34.060]  forgot man uh wow i didn't realize that uh
[03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:37.260]  and it's not even really designed for that it's just a libido
[03:03:37.260 --> 03:03:41.100]  how many days did it take you to notice something different in the morning
[03:03:41.100 --> 03:03:44.940]  like six days and i'm 50 years old and i feel like a teenager in the morning
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:50.140]  so but let's talk about trump uh because i feel like he's already my president
[03:03:50.140 --> 03:03:55.500]  and we're living in super exciting times and i'm watching the cheating going on
[03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:58.220]  because i'm not someone who watches a lot of television
[03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:01.980]  but i obviously am interested in the election so i'm paying attention
[03:04:01.980 --> 03:04:06.060]  and i'm seeing a lot of nlp neuro linguistic programming going on
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:09.020]  to make trump look bad and to make rubio look good
[03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:12.780]  sure well he doesn't put all the he doesn't do all the polish stuff like
[03:04:12.780 --> 03:04:17.020]  they do in the way they talk to you like you're five and do all that yeah
[03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:20.380]  well neuro linguistic programming is deeper than that it's actually trying to
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:24.780]  program people with words and anchoring um you know you can google it and you
[03:04:24.780 --> 03:04:28.620]  can actually change people's and no i know all these tricksters study all
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:32.220]  these things i mean i know and delphi techniques and all that but it
[03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:35.100]  just can't stand up against old-fashioned primal instincts
[03:04:35.100 --> 03:04:37.740]  in common sense but god bless you craig sorry amount of time
[03:04:37.740 --> 03:04:40.700]  day but night is coming up and he has got a lot of stuff
[03:04:40.700 --> 03:04:43.980]  he's going to be covering so in three minutes when we come back out of the
[03:04:43.980 --> 03:04:47.980]  gates we've got the relief stallion uh
[03:04:47.980 --> 03:04:52.140]  here on the pony express coming out of the gates to finish up the transmission
[03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:55.340]  day but night and then lord willing i'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m.
[03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:59.660]  plus the night seven we are quickly approaching the
[03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:02.300]  five-year anniversary of osama bin laden's supposed
[03:05:02.300 --> 03:05:05.420]  death at the hands of navy seals and to commemorate this the obama
[03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:09.180]  administration released 113 documents that were seized in the
[03:05:09.180 --> 03:05:13.420]  may 2nd 2011 raid and if you read the myriad of articles at daily mail
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:17.100]  he supposedly writes he wants to leave his vast multi-million dollar fortune
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:20.220]  to the global jihad he also worried that his wife had been implanted with a
[03:05:20.220 --> 03:05:23.580]  tracking chip but he doesn't sign any of the documents in his name
[03:05:23.580 --> 03:05:27.580]  he signs one syed bin usama another usama bin muhammad
[03:05:27.580 --> 03:05:32.300]  and another abu abdallah but i ask why didn't he use his cia code name of tim
[03:05:32.300 --> 03:05:35.660]  osman in any of these letters remember it was c bell edmunds the fbi
[03:05:35.660 --> 03:05:38.780]  translator who broke a gag order and said that the us had been working with
[03:05:38.780 --> 03:05:42.380]  osama bin laden right up until 9 11 and they were outsourcing him to conduct
[03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:45.580]  terror operations all over the world there's one final note he was calling
[03:05:45.580 --> 03:05:48.540]  on americans to help president obama fight climate change
[03:05:48.540 --> 03:05:52.620]  so using liberal logic if you don't disavow climate change then you
[03:05:52.620 --> 03:05:56.860]  were for osama bin laden robert reporting for info wars dot com and info wars

[03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:07.660]  our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a
[03:07:07.660 --> 03:07:10.780]  chance to organize and prepare a defense
[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:16.460]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they
[03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:21.180]  had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century
[03:07:21.180 --> 03:07:26.140]  there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water
[03:07:26.140 --> 03:07:29.420]  and the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality

[03:08:24.620 --> 03:08:28.860]  got a lot to talk about we're going to talk about cnn and the
[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:31.980]  mainstream media continuing to beat the dead horse of the kkk
[03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:34.300]  accusations but we're also going to talk about the
[03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:38.380]  stalking horse well i think is marco rubio a stalking horse
[03:08:38.380 --> 03:08:42.060]  permit romney we're going to talk about that aspect ever we're also going to
[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:46.060]  talk about a very interesting story that rob Jacobson brought to my attention
[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:49.900]  about a utah sheriff who says that he will deputize
[03:08:49.900 --> 03:08:54.460]  every citizen in his county if necessary to stop the abuses
[03:08:54.460 --> 03:08:58.300]  of the forest service we're going to talk about what's going on
[03:08:58.300 --> 03:09:04.380]  we have to remember that this pushback the sage brush rebellion
[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:08.700]  is something that is going on across america it's going on from texas to
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:14.380]  oregon to utah to nevada many different places and these are people government
[03:09:14.380 --> 03:09:18.860]  you don't want to mess with okay these are real men who will stand up and fight
[03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:22.220]  for their living they work hard they have been there on the land for a long
[03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:25.820]  time and they don't take this kind of stuff from tyrants okay
[03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:28.460]  this is where this is going to break down so we're going to talk to you about
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:31.900]  that first but i want to talk about the local
[03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:36.140]  situation because we had a caller earlier today that was talking to alex and
[03:09:36.140 --> 03:09:38.940]  alex was talking about how we need to get delegates we need to fight this at
[03:09:38.940 --> 03:09:43.580]  the local level and we do we need to take over control of the local parties
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:47.340]  we need to make sure that we have control of the delegates we need to rest
[03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:50.700]  this thing away from the establishment party
[03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:54.540]  i've played that video over and over again of rites pre best saying
[03:09:54.540 --> 03:09:57.980]  this isn't an election essentially i'm paraphrasing him that the
[03:09:57.980 --> 03:10:01.260]  cnn correspondent allison camarado was
[03:10:01.260 --> 03:10:04.940]  absolutely amazed at the way he was spot was responding to things this is you
[03:10:04.940 --> 03:10:07.020]  have to understand what the process is here
[03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:12.220]  these guys are auditioning to join us and motioning with his hands like they're
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:16.140]  going to join us and she says well yeah kind of but we have an election going
[03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:19.340]  on here voters and goes no no no no no no you're not hearing me
[03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:24.700]  they are auditioning to join us okay it's their private country club
[03:10:24.700 --> 03:10:29.260]  uh you aren't a member okay just going back to the george carlin thing
[03:10:29.260 --> 03:10:32.780]  you know it's a club and you ain't in it folks that's their attitude
[03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:36.620]  we can take this thing from them there's more of us than there are of them
[03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:39.340]  and we can push them out of the way if we know the right things to do now here's
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:43.260]  one of the right things to do here's an article from the texas tribune
[03:10:43.260 --> 03:10:47.340]  came out today talking about what's going on here in travis county
[03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:50.620]  the county where the texas capital is involved
[03:10:50.620 --> 03:10:55.420]  uh a fight for control of the gop a newly elected chair of the republican
[03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:58.060]  county or the public party here in travis county
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:11:01.980]  they say he was tweeting on election night about former governor rick perry's
[03:11:01.980 --> 03:11:05.820]  sexual orientation also insisting that members of the bush family should be in
[03:11:05.820 --> 03:11:09.820]  jail this is the guy who is now the newly elected chair of the gop
[03:11:09.820 --> 03:11:13.820]  they say he also found time to call hillary hillary clinton an angry bulldike
[03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:18.300]  and accused his county vice chair of betraying the values of republican party
[03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:21.900]  but he said the people have spoken his name is robert morris he won the helm
[03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:25.260]  of the travis county gop he got 54 percent of the vote
[03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:28.780]  he said my friends and neighbors and political supporters wanted
[03:11:28.780 --> 03:11:32.220]  robert morrow now his election as republican chair of the fifth largest
[03:11:32.220 --> 03:11:36.700]  county in texas they say left several members of the travis county gop
[03:11:36.700 --> 03:11:42.540]  apoplectic particularly matt mcow mcowag mcowag i guess that's how he
[03:11:42.540 --> 03:11:45.980]  pronounced his name but this is the guy who has
[03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:49.820]  is the vice chair and he is something of an establishment man
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:55.100]  listen to what he said he said we will explore every single option that exists
[03:11:55.100 --> 03:12:00.220]  whether it be persuading him to resign trying to force him to resign
[03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:03.820]  constraining his power removing his ability to spend money
[03:12:03.820 --> 03:12:09.340]  resisting any attempt for him to access data or our social media account he said
[03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:13.980]  i'm treating this as a coup as a hostile takeover oh yeah understand that it is
[03:12:13.980 --> 03:12:17.260]  and when you do that it's going to get more hostile
[03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:20.780]  you want to fight you got one okay right here in travis county
[03:12:20.780 --> 03:12:23.900]  and so the response of robert morris he said he told the tribune tell them they
[03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:26.620]  can go f themselves okay he's not backing down
[03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:32.540]  and he says even as mcowag attempts to unseat morrow morrow has called mcowag's
[03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:36.460]  own conservative credentials into question especially because of recent tweets
[03:12:36.460 --> 03:12:39.660]  from him that included the hashtag hashtag never
[03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:44.220]  trump okay he says i don't even think mcowag and i don't know if i'm
[03:12:44.220 --> 03:12:48.060]  pronouncing his name properly is going to support the republican nominee
[03:12:48.060 --> 03:12:50.620]  who is probably going to be trump said morrow
[03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:56.140]  what kind of traitor to the party is mcowag the incredible amount of damage
[03:12:56.140 --> 03:13:01.500]  someone like him does to the party and he's a well i won't repeat it
[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:05.660]  okay he says the republican party i would hope is about limited government
[03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:08.540]  with a libertarian perspective but it's a big tent
[03:13:08.540 --> 03:13:12.300]  there are many factions in it and that's okay with me said morrow well you know
[03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:16.700]  what morrow the gop sees itself as a closed
[03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:21.500]  country club we're all auditioning to join them and you know you just didn't
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:25.180]  use the right kind of language you didn't kiss the ring
[03:13:25.180 --> 03:13:29.420]  you don't understand that this is not a libertarian perspective but a globalist
[03:13:29.420 --> 03:13:33.180]  perspective but i think mark morrow does understand
[03:13:33.180 --> 03:13:36.780]  that and i think there is going to be a fight and there needs to be a fight at
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:40.140]  the local level we don't need to use a lot of foul language
[03:13:40.140 --> 03:13:43.340]  but we don't need to bow down to these guys either
[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:48.300]  okay this was a takeover and they may not like it but it is not their private
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:50.540]  country club we have to understand that's the way
[03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:54.460]  they've been running this two-party system and we have to understand that
[03:13:54.460 --> 03:13:58.380]  i don't believe that a two-party system is something that we need to have
[03:13:58.380 --> 03:14:01.820]  pretty much every other country in the world even russia you know which went
[03:14:01.820 --> 03:14:03.980]  from a one-party system to a multi-party system
[03:14:03.980 --> 03:14:08.140]  they have multiple parties can you make a decision when you go into the grocery
[03:14:08.140 --> 03:14:12.140]  store are you threatened when you see multiple choices for peanut butter or
[03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:16.460]  for corn flakes no you can handle it you really can
[03:14:16.460 --> 03:14:20.220]  and we can really handle multiple choices in the establishment and you know
[03:14:20.220 --> 03:14:23.180]  what it would really clean up these races as well
[03:14:23.180 --> 03:14:26.940]  because if you start attacking everybody you know like a marco rubio or
[03:14:26.940 --> 03:14:29.820]  something then people start looking at you as the
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:32.940]  one with the problem it doesn't really have an effect at that point
[03:14:32.940 --> 03:14:37.340]  i think when you have multiple parties it forces people to talk about issues
[03:14:37.340 --> 03:14:41.020]  more than personalities and that's what we want to get to
[03:14:41.020 --> 03:14:44.060]  and even if you're going to have two parties the question is
[03:14:44.060 --> 03:14:48.140]  do we really want it to be the democrats and the republicans
[03:14:48.140 --> 03:14:52.140]  one of the things that we can do is take these guys over from the inside
[03:14:52.140 --> 03:14:55.740]  and change the republican party we don't necessarily have to change the name or
[03:14:55.740 --> 03:14:59.740]  the branding or whatever we just take the thing over but we have to do it
[03:14:59.740 --> 03:15:03.820]  at the grassroots level we have to do it from the ground up
[03:15:03.820 --> 03:15:07.340]  now before i go to this important story about what's going on with the sage
[03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:10.460]  brush rebellion let's talk a little bit about last night's
[03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:13.420]  election and the fact that i talked about how marco rubio is
[03:15:13.420 --> 03:15:16.700]  increasingly becoming transparent as a stalking horse for the
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:19.500]  establishment if not for mit romney for somebody else
[03:15:19.500 --> 03:15:22.620]  here's a interesting article that i thought was really funny last night
[03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:27.260]  from the huffington post headline marco rubio loses nine more states falls to
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:30.780]  one in 13 on the election season actually uh after this was written it
[03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:34.380]  went to one in 14 because he didn't win in alaska either
[03:15:34.380 --> 03:15:38.780]  they said senator marco rubio lost primaries or caucuses and at least nine
[03:15:38.780 --> 03:15:41.660]  states on tuesday moving his record in the race republican
[03:15:41.660 --> 03:15:45.100]  presidential nomination to one in 14 that's a worse record
[03:15:45.100 --> 03:15:49.740]  through the first 14 contests than the worst teams in the nfl last year
[03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:53.980]  the cleveland browns and the tennessee titans at least managed to win three
[03:15:53.980 --> 03:15:59.260]  of their first 14 games they say rubio whom the media proclaimed the real winner
[03:15:59.260 --> 03:16:02.620]  of three of the first four presidential primaries after he finished behind
[03:16:02.620 --> 03:16:07.180]  donald trump and all four yeah he had a uh he had a second place a third place
[03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:10.780]  uh or two third places i think in a fifth place
[03:16:10.780 --> 03:16:16.300]  rubio lost even more on tuesday they say despite this impressive burst of losing
[03:16:16.300 --> 03:16:20.300]  some people remained eager to spend the news for rubio and against trump and
[03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:23.020]  they've got some tweets in here from various people
[03:16:23.020 --> 03:16:26.220]  some of them you may recognize like hu hu it
[03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:31.020]  one of the moderators how moderate is that okay you know a moderator means
[03:16:31.020 --> 03:16:34.780]  somebody that doesn't have sides do you see that in the debates
[03:16:34.780 --> 03:16:39.180]  or do you see viciously partisan questions on the same
[03:16:39.180 --> 03:16:43.500]  issues over and over again with these debates that's what i see
[03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:48.140]  so here's hu hu it he says arkansas was also too close to call wow another
[03:16:48.140 --> 03:16:50.780]  surprise momentum tonight is flowing against donald
[03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:54.540]  trump even as he racks up most of the wins
[03:16:54.540 --> 03:17:00.300]  desperate desperate to try to spend this in a way that it is not going even as
[03:17:00.300 --> 03:17:03.500]  he ranks up most of the wins the momentum is flowing against him
[03:17:03.500 --> 03:17:06.940]  yeah well okay he won arkansas too i believe anyway
[03:17:06.940 --> 03:17:10.460]  ben white nobody is talking about it but wouldn't rubio winning minnesota be
[03:17:10.460 --> 03:17:14.380]  kind of a big deal at least to end the he hasn't won anything
[03:17:14.380 --> 03:17:17.340]  line okay there you go he got one he got one
[03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:20.860]  caucus and another one from tim alberta if rubio doesn't win
[03:17:20.860 --> 03:17:25.180]  anywhere tonight the story will be casick playing the spoiler in virginia
[03:17:25.180 --> 03:17:29.500]  he's in double digits in fairfax ludon and prince william well no actually
[03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:34.220]  casick wasn't the spoiler he didn't spoil anything in virginia
[03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:37.260]  he didn't spoil anything in vermont he didn't even
[03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:41.100]  win there okay now actually the story is that the candidate of the republican
[03:17:41.100 --> 03:17:44.380]  establishment is still losing this is a huffington post good for them good for
[03:17:44.380 --> 03:17:47.420]  them for pointing this out rubio showed tuesday that he can
[03:17:47.420 --> 03:17:51.260]  beat trump in one or two out of every 15 tries
[03:17:51.260 --> 03:17:55.340]  there you go that's our guy that's the establishment champion right there
[03:17:55.340 --> 03:17:59.980]  mr bronze medal and they go on and say in january rubio's team said he'd
[03:17:59.980 --> 03:18:03.180]  finished third in iowa second in new hampshire and first in south carolina
[03:18:03.180 --> 03:18:07.100]  they called it the 321 strategy well rubio actually finished
[03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:11.500]  fifth in new hampshire second in south carolina where he didn't get a single
[03:18:11.500 --> 03:18:14.700]  delegate where every one of the delegates went to donald trump
[03:18:14.700 --> 03:18:19.020]  and so they say after tuesday night maybe we should rename the 321 strategy
[03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:24.860]  something like 3 5 2 2 3 2 3 2 3 3 3 1 3 2 3
[03:18:24.860 --> 03:18:29.500]  strategy yeah mr bronze medal and they say sadly
[03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:33.340]  he's not even the tennessee titans so he can't even count
[03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:40.140]  on a first pick and next year's draft okay but it doesn't stop rubio here's
[03:18:40.140 --> 03:18:44.220]  the headlines from cnn rubio rejoices we fought
[03:18:44.220 --> 03:18:47.740]  trump to a draw this is what he actually said on cnn
[03:18:47.740 --> 03:18:52.540]  talking to jay tapper uh he says uh his his numbers trump's numbers are coming
[03:18:52.540 --> 03:18:57.980]  down our numbers are going up really really by what measure marco i mean
[03:18:57.980 --> 03:19:02.220]  you're absolutely in fantasy land by percentages by the number of people who
[03:19:02.220 --> 03:19:07.660]  voted by delegates one you're losing big time your numbers are going
[03:19:07.660 --> 03:19:11.100]  down relative to his that's important that yeah you got a couple of delegates
[03:19:11.100 --> 03:19:14.300]  okay great but that doesn't mean your numbers are going up and they certainly
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:16.860]  aren't going up at a faster rate and so tom brokow
[03:19:16.860 --> 03:19:20.380]  actually trolls him and says oh marco rubio looked like a guy who was running
[03:19:20.380 --> 03:19:24.940]  for student council president who didn't have a date to the prom
[03:19:24.940 --> 03:19:29.180]  yeah well you know what here's the deal rubio doesn't have
[03:19:29.180 --> 03:19:33.900]  a chance is he crazy is he delusional or
[03:19:33.900 --> 03:19:37.660]  when he says that you don't win by winning states
[03:19:37.660 --> 03:19:41.980]  is that crazy or is it really a revelation of the method
[03:19:41.980 --> 03:19:45.820]  is he really just being set up as a stalking horse stay with us when we come
[03:19:45.820 --> 03:19:58.300]  back we're going to talk about that angle

[03:25:21.900 --> 03:25:26.860]  uh conversation starter t-shirt idea uh i'm sure you're
[03:25:26.860 --> 03:25:30.940]  familiar with uh bad hour or uh or french malia
[03:25:30.940 --> 03:25:35.100]  rescue situation that we just had oh yeah oh yeah we're going to be talking
[03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:39.420]  about something related to that coming up in the next segment yeah go ahead
[03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:43.100]  i'm not sure if i would be bold enough to wear it but on the front i was thinking
[03:25:43.100 --> 03:25:48.460]  to have his name was levoie finnecombe his name was levoie finnecombe
[03:25:48.460 --> 03:25:51.180]  his name was levoie finnecombe like over and over
[03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:54.380]  yeah and then like 11 kids on the back or
[03:25:54.380 --> 03:25:59.580]  hands up don't shoot yeah yeah exactly yeah or maybe like the spartakus thing you
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:04.220]  know i am levoie finnecombe uh i i really am angry about what happened
[03:26:04.220 --> 03:26:07.420]  there it was totally unjustified in my opinion we've talked about that we've
[03:26:07.420 --> 03:26:11.660]  looked at the uh the shooting and in terms of the way it was handled
[03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:16.460]  uh you've got uh one officer who comes out there exposes himself potentially
[03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:19.340]  to a threat from that vehicle that's parked if it's
[03:26:19.340 --> 03:26:22.940]  such a threat that they need to kill him and then after he's dead
[03:26:22.940 --> 03:26:27.180]  spend a very long time hurling flash grenades and shooting the people
[03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:30.780]  shooting at the people in that van that he shouldn't have pulled himself out
[03:26:30.780 --> 03:26:33.900]  behind it to come after levoie finnecombe then the other guy who comes in the
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:37.180]  other direction is shooting at levoie finnecombe
[03:26:37.180 --> 03:26:41.020]  and uh he has his own officers in the crosshairs kind of what we're seeing
[03:26:41.020 --> 03:26:45.020]  with the fbi and what they're doing with the iphone i mean this stuff is not
[03:26:45.020 --> 03:26:49.180]  only uh evil but it's incredibly incompetent it's
[03:26:49.180 --> 03:26:52.700]  absolutely amazing i agree with you uh let's go quickly to another call let's
[03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:56.140]  take uh steven and florida steven go ahead
[03:26:56.140 --> 03:27:00.300]  yeah hey uh david uh first of all i wanted to say that i disavow
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:06.220]  alexis calls for disavowel and so i think that should about cover it um
[03:27:06.220 --> 03:27:10.140]  yeah we're not gonna beat that dead horse anymore go ahead
[03:27:10.140 --> 03:27:14.780]  um as far as this whole election situation there's something i still got
[03:27:14.780 --> 03:27:19.260]  nagging thought in the back of my mind and that is that uh
[03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:23.740]  larry nichols has alluded to this in his interviews with alex
[03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:29.420]  i'm still not coming out obama pulling the national emergency slash
[03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:33.340]  marshal law trigger so he can declare himself
[03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:38.700]  king and dictator and staying power um i'm not going to be surprised at all if
[03:27:38.700 --> 03:27:42.780]  we don't end up having an election because the way everything is being set
[03:27:42.780 --> 03:27:47.100]  up and going uh mr mackafee just alluded to it
[03:27:47.100 --> 03:27:51.420]  are the possibility very real possibility of an emp attack and with the way
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:54.780]  we're goading and provoking our enemies that have the
[03:27:54.780 --> 03:27:59.660]  capability to do that that i really see that coming for one thing and then of
[03:27:59.660 --> 03:28:03.340]  course with the economy and everything else and i'm not a pessimist
[03:28:03.340 --> 03:28:07.100]  i'm a realist and i can't help but look at everything
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:10.780]  and think that you know there's a very real possibility
[03:28:10.780 --> 03:28:14.700]  even with momentum trump scott that you know
[03:28:14.700 --> 03:28:18.300]  that may be the way they decide to stop him ultimately is
[03:28:18.300 --> 03:28:22.220]  just not allow the election to take place whatsoever people need to keep that
[03:28:22.220 --> 03:28:24.940]  in mind well you know i wouldn't be surprised
[03:28:24.940 --> 03:28:30.300]  anything that happens and and if we have a massive event of some sort
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:35.020]  whether it's real or a false flag uh you can imagine that the
[03:28:35.020 --> 03:28:38.860]  the government is just ready to unleash on everybody when you look at the way
[03:28:38.860 --> 03:28:41.500]  they conducted themselves at the oscars the other day
[03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:45.100]  but we had some footage that was sent to us uh by
[03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:48.940]  somebody on the scene and uh we have that article you can see that info
[03:28:48.940 --> 03:28:51.900]  wars.com it was absolutely amazing what they were
[03:28:51.900 --> 03:28:56.460]  doing to people therefore the oscars and it's every event now
[03:28:56.460 --> 03:29:00.140]  they ramp it up and it's more and more martial law so you can imagine if there
[03:29:00.140 --> 03:29:03.020]  is some real event and of course again this
[03:29:03.020 --> 03:29:06.620]  shooting by uh these these individuals in San Bernardino
[03:29:06.620 --> 03:29:09.900]  that's now being used as justification to come after everybody's
[03:29:09.900 --> 03:29:14.060]  iPhones to demand a back door to demand that apple create software that
[03:29:14.060 --> 03:29:16.940]  doesn't exist it never ends this is what we're seeing
[03:29:16.940 --> 03:29:20.460]  constantly so yeah nothing about that would surprise me thank you
[03:29:20.460 --> 03:29:23.500]  steven and of course we've got some footage uh right there when we come
[03:29:23.500 --> 03:29:26.540]  back i'm going to continue with what i was talking about
[03:29:26.540 --> 03:29:32.060]  in terms of the stalking horse why is rubio there
[03:29:32.060 --> 03:29:36.860]  what is behind uh all the overtures about mit romney we're going to take a
[03:29:36.860 --> 03:29:39.260]  look at that and then we're also going to take a look at this
[03:29:39.260 --> 03:29:43.340]  situation in utah where the sheriff threatens to deputize
[03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:47.340]  every single citizen to hold off the militarized federal government stay
[03:29:47.340 --> 03:29:51.580]  with us to be right there we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:51.580 --> 03:29:56.140]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.460 --> 03:30:02.380]  two roman catholic bishops who led a central pennsylvania diocese
[03:30:02.380 --> 03:30:06.620]  helps cover up the sexual abuse of hundreds of children by over 50 priests
[03:30:06.620 --> 03:30:10.380]  or religious leaders over a 40 year period according to a
[03:30:10.380 --> 03:30:17.020]  grand jury report issued tuesday reports fox news the 147 page report on sexual
[03:30:17.020 --> 03:30:19.660]  abuse in the local diocese was based partly on
[03:30:19.660 --> 03:30:23.500]  evidence from a secret archive uncovered through a search warrant executed
[03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:26.860]  in august said pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane
[03:30:26.860 --> 03:30:30.220]  who announced the findings these predators desecrated a
[03:30:30.220 --> 03:30:33.980]  sacred trust and prayed upon their victims in the very places where they
[03:30:33.980 --> 03:30:38.140]  should have felt most safe kane said in a statement just as troubling
[03:30:38.140 --> 03:30:41.820]  is the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders that allow this abuse to
[03:30:41.820 --> 03:30:45.260]  continue for decades no criminal charges are being
[03:30:45.260 --> 03:30:49.580]  filed in the case because some abusers have died the statute of limitations has
[03:30:49.580 --> 03:30:54.220]  expired and in some cases the victims are too traumatized to testify she said

[03:33:20.140 --> 03:33:23.260]  we're going to take some more calls and i want to go back to this uh
[03:33:23.260 --> 03:33:27.500]  the story that we're talking about i mean why is rubio here we pointed out the
[03:33:27.500 --> 03:33:32.140]  huffington post was laughing about his record saying his record falls to
[03:33:32.140 --> 03:33:37.980]  one and fourteen he's worse than the worst nfl team at this point uh it's
[03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:41.740]  pretty amazing it's pretty ridiculous and you have to ask yourself when he says
[03:33:41.740 --> 03:33:47.340]  you don't win by winning states is he crazy is he delusional or is he really
[03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:52.860]  kind of in an offhand way telling us something is marco rubio
[03:33:52.860 --> 03:33:56.700]  a stalking horse now these metaphors that we use like stalking horse think
[03:33:56.700 --> 03:34:00.060]  about this i think if you've ever seen the movie jeremiah johnson
[03:34:00.060 --> 03:34:03.580]  there's one scene where the two of them are going out to hunt a grizzly
[03:34:03.580 --> 03:34:09.180]  okay the experienced hunter and the green guy at that point jeremiah johnson
[03:34:09.180 --> 03:34:12.460]  and they get behind a horse and they start
[03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:15.660]  uh they they get close to where the uh the bear is
[03:34:15.660 --> 03:34:19.260]  and um they're using this stalking horse technique
[03:34:19.260 --> 03:34:23.340]  and they're on the other side of the horse so when the bear looks over at them
[03:34:23.340 --> 03:34:27.340]  it just sees the horse and jeremiah johnson says to the guy who's showing
[03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:29.740]  him how to do this he goes wait me he's going to see our legs
[03:34:29.740 --> 03:34:34.060]  he says a bear don't know how many legs a horse has got
[03:34:34.060 --> 03:34:39.180]  okay maybe you don't know how many candidates the establishment has got
[03:34:39.180 --> 03:34:43.580]  and what candidates are they hiding behind marco rubio
[03:34:43.580 --> 03:34:47.740]  now let's take a look at mitt romney because uh this is something that we
[03:34:47.740 --> 03:34:50.860]  broke last week we're going to talk about that in a moment let's go back to
[03:34:50.860 --> 03:34:54.540]  september 30th of last year washington post story
[03:34:54.540 --> 03:34:59.820]  mitt romney weighs in on 2016 says trump quote will not be the nominee
[03:34:59.820 --> 03:35:02.940]  they go on to say romney said he was surprised at how the election was
[03:35:02.940 --> 03:35:05.580]  unfolding he said he's seriously considered
[03:35:05.580 --> 03:35:09.100]  entering himself and what would have been his third quest for the presidency
[03:35:09.100 --> 03:35:12.780]  but he decided against it back in january now this is
[03:35:12.780 --> 03:35:19.020]  january of 2015 this is september 2015 and then he goes out and says after he
[03:35:19.020 --> 03:35:22.380]  speaks to everybody a washington post reporter
[03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:27.180]  noted the continuing calls from romney's friends to draft him into the race and
[03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:30.300]  they asked whether his answer was a definitive no
[03:35:30.300 --> 03:35:34.140]  and this is what he said he said you know the unavailable
[03:35:34.140 --> 03:35:37.180]  is always the most interesting the most attractive
[03:35:37.180 --> 03:35:42.220]  haha he says romney said laughing as he made his way out of the auditorium
[03:35:42.220 --> 03:35:46.700]  there you go say it makes him more attractive to play this cat and mouse
[03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:50.620]  game then two months later november 16th 2015
[03:35:50.620 --> 03:35:55.340]  a romney run for president fox asks so you're saying there's a chance quote
[03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:59.260]  unquote another sign of hope that romney might run
[03:35:59.260 --> 03:36:03.260]  his use of the present tense he says i'm not running
[03:36:03.260 --> 03:36:07.820]  rather than i will not run say that romney continues to capture the
[03:36:07.820 --> 03:36:10.780]  imagination of at least a portion of the republican electorate
[03:36:10.780 --> 03:36:14.700]  the 2016 presidential primaries reports fox
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:18.460]  their salt lake city establish uh establishment affiliate
[03:36:18.460 --> 03:36:22.460]  yeah it's establishment affiliate okay they say it's increasingly marginalized
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:26.540]  group whose typical monitor becomes ironic by the day
[03:36:26.540 --> 03:36:30.140]  the establishment yeah that's the people that he runs for even
[03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:34.300]  fox news uh people in utah point that out
[03:36:34.300 --> 03:36:39.180]  they say card carrying establishment republican john senunu of course he was
[03:36:39.180 --> 03:36:42.460]  with the george uh h.w. bush administration from new hampshire
[03:36:42.460 --> 03:36:46.700]  former governor there calls trump the big mouth and says he has no idea if
[03:36:46.700 --> 03:36:50.380]  romney will run but it could happen it could happen
[03:36:50.380 --> 03:36:54.940]  that guy is a bush insider he says look it's a crazy season anything
[03:36:54.940 --> 03:36:58.940]  as possible said senunu in a live interview on cnn
[03:36:58.940 --> 03:37:02.220]  right then let's go another couple of months we go from november then to
[03:37:02.220 --> 03:37:06.620]  january january 4th 2016 the desert news in
[03:37:06.620 --> 03:37:10.060]  utah mitt romney says he's still being begged i'm
[03:37:10.060 --> 03:37:15.660]  so asked to run for president even by another presidential candidate
[03:37:15.660 --> 03:37:19.340]  oh this is interesting very interesting he says you know every day he tells
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:23.900]  washington post every day i get calls or letters
[03:37:23.900 --> 03:37:27.420]  he says i get harangued at church he says oh you've got to run
[03:37:27.420 --> 03:37:31.340]  he says look i even had one person who is running for president i won't tell you
[03:37:31.340 --> 03:37:34.780]  who okay he says that person called me and said
[03:37:34.780 --> 03:37:38.540]  i hope you don't close the door we may need you
[03:37:38.540 --> 03:37:41.500]  that's a person who's running for president that's a person who's a candidate
[03:37:41.500 --> 03:37:44.940]  now a republican but i'm not giving it a second
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:48.540]  thought he says yeah we shall see we shall see so
[03:37:48.540 --> 03:37:53.020]  against that backdrop of every couple of months throwing the bait out there and
[03:37:53.020 --> 03:37:56.620]  playing coy with the public and then saying there are presidential candidates
[03:37:56.620 --> 03:37:59.580]  in the establishment that would really like to see him run
[03:37:59.580 --> 03:38:03.180]  and of course they're playing this delegate game trying to take this up to
[03:38:03.180 --> 03:38:07.500]  a brokered convention and we know who the brokers want
[03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:10.540]  i was listening to npr and they said well let's talk about a brokered
[03:38:10.540 --> 03:38:14.540]  convention haha there are no more power brokers and it's like
[03:38:14.540 --> 03:38:18.940]  are you serious are you serious i mean you just consider the source
[03:38:18.940 --> 03:38:26.300]  nationalist proletariat radio okay npr telling us that there's no brokers at
[03:38:26.300 --> 03:38:30.380]  the conventions okay seriously seriously all right
[03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:33.980]  so now we have this story that was on info wars i come on monday it was by
[03:38:33.980 --> 03:38:38.460]  michael snider and it references what roger stone was saying on
[03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:42.460]  friday last friday republican establishment is absolutely
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:46.140]  desperate to keep donald trump out of the white house will do anything to do
[03:38:46.140 --> 03:38:49.100]  that say at this point there's two different plans being put forward on
[03:38:49.100 --> 03:38:52.780]  how to proceed if trump continues to roll on one is to have marco rubio exit the
[03:38:52.780 --> 03:38:55.580]  race so that mit romney can run against trump the other
[03:38:55.580 --> 03:38:58.220]  is to run a third party candidate against trump and clinton
[03:38:58.220 --> 03:39:01.980]  in the fall okay maybe like michael bloomberg although that wouldn't really
[03:39:01.980 --> 03:39:06.220]  work out uh too well for uh for them i think that
[03:39:06.220 --> 03:39:09.340]  in that situation i think that would hurt clinton i don't think it would hurt
[03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:12.940]  trump but this is what roger stone said last friday said in a bitter fight for
[03:39:12.940 --> 03:39:16.060]  its life establishment geop leaders have decided to block donald trump's
[03:39:16.060 --> 03:39:19.420]  nomination at all costs even if it means losing the presidency to
[03:39:19.420 --> 03:39:23.020]  hillary clinton now why would they do that why would they do that you know
[03:39:23.020 --> 03:39:26.460]  this very first article that i had back in uh september
[03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:29.020]  one of the things that mit romney was saying to the washington post at the
[03:39:29.020 --> 03:39:33.660]  time was he said uh we are harangued as the party of the rich
[03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:38.620]  and of course he is the poster child for that uh uh mr uh fighting whitey is
[03:39:38.620 --> 03:39:41.580]  what he looks like if you've uh if you're familiar with those t-shirts
[03:39:41.580 --> 03:39:46.140]  he just doesn't have the the pipe there uh but he says uh
[03:39:46.140 --> 03:39:49.180]  the rich have gotten richer under president obama
[03:39:49.180 --> 03:39:52.220]  let me explain to you in case you don't know we've talked about this in detail
[03:39:52.220 --> 03:39:57.820]  about nafta and other things okay it is not that it's obama's policies it's
[03:39:57.820 --> 03:40:02.060]  these globalist trade treaties like nafta that were put in
[03:40:02.060 --> 03:40:05.420]  by the republicans and the democrats and if you go back and look at this if you
[03:40:05.420 --> 03:40:08.700]  go back and look at that race they wanted to make sure that they had a
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:12.060]  candidate whether it was going to be george bush hw bush or whether it's
[03:40:12.060 --> 03:40:15.900]  going to be bill clinton both of them supported nafta
[03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:20.300]  and you had the rise of uh ross perot saying we can't do this it will destroy
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:23.420]  the country and he's been proven right in the 23 years that that's
[03:40:23.420 --> 03:40:29.020]  happened but they would let everything else go on the margins they had to get
[03:40:29.020 --> 03:40:32.220]  that through so they made sure they had two candidates who were going to run
[03:40:32.220 --> 03:40:36.220]  that through regardless same thing happened with mit romney and obama
[03:40:36.220 --> 03:40:40.620]  four years ago they needed somebody who is going to push through obama care or
[03:40:40.620 --> 03:40:43.660]  romney care because mit romney had already done obama care in
[03:40:43.660 --> 03:40:47.580]  massachusetts with ted kennedy so they wanted two candidates who are going
[03:40:47.580 --> 03:40:51.580]  to push that through what they want now is two candidates if they can't get two
[03:40:51.580 --> 03:40:54.860]  candidates they will close in behind hillary clinton
[03:40:54.860 --> 03:40:58.860]  because they want somebody who is going to open the borders who's going to push
[03:40:58.860 --> 03:41:02.060]  through the climate treaty who is going to push through the trade treaties
[03:41:02.060 --> 03:41:06.380]  that are going to destroy not only the economy of this country but the sovereignty
[03:41:06.380 --> 03:41:09.740]  of this country jeff sessions senator sessions knows
[03:41:09.740 --> 03:41:13.660]  that he's been schooling donald trump tutoring him on the details
[03:41:13.660 --> 03:41:17.420]  of the tpp because he's the only person who bothered
[03:41:17.420 --> 03:41:21.660]  to read it the only person who was allowed and only the
[03:41:21.660 --> 03:41:25.260]  senators and congressmen had access to look at it
[03:41:25.260 --> 03:41:29.500]  they couldn't talk about it but senator sessions saw it and he's talking about
[03:41:29.500 --> 03:41:33.340]  it and he's educated donald trump on it and donald trump says not only is he
[03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:38.140]  going to stop that he's going to reverse NAFTA as well so that's what's
[03:41:38.140 --> 03:41:41.820]  going on here so in the backdrop of all this now we see that mit romney is
[03:41:41.820 --> 03:41:46.300]  becoming increasingly visible having more and more press
[03:41:46.300 --> 03:41:49.100]  conferences and again part of that revelation from
[03:41:49.100 --> 03:41:54.460]  roger stone was that they're going to pull up 25 million dollars a group of
[03:41:54.460 --> 03:41:59.580]  coke brothers and other GOP millionaires and billionaires met last thursday night to pull
[03:41:59.580 --> 03:42:04.940]  together 75 million dollars to stop trump he said they're going to use mit romney as plan b if rubio
[03:42:04.940 --> 03:42:09.900]  fails to gain traction on super tuesday they gave him 25 million dollars but said hey if you
[03:42:09.900 --> 03:42:15.820]  can't pull it through mr. bronze medal then we're going to pull the guy who has consistently lost
[03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:21.420]  in these presidential elections mit romney the loser they're going to pull up another loser
[03:42:21.420 --> 03:42:26.620]  as the other champion of the establishment and so now we see that he's going to be speaking now in
[03:42:26.620 --> 03:42:31.660]  a public forum university utah on thursday the washington post says GOP has two weeks to take
[03:42:31.660 --> 03:42:37.260]  down donald trump because that is the establishment why would they want to take down somebody who has
[03:42:38.140 --> 03:42:45.180]  done the best geographically of any candidate since 1960 you've never had a GOP candidate who has
[03:42:45.180 --> 03:42:50.540]  won over such a broad geographical range usually they have a very narrow geographical power base
[03:42:50.540 --> 03:42:57.660]  he's winning every demographic he's winning every geographical area and yet they have to take him out
[03:42:57.660 --> 03:43:03.260]  because he opposes these trade deals that's the real issue let me give you a chance to weigh in
[03:43:03.260 --> 03:43:11.500]  let's go to some of your calls tem in wyoming go ahead tem are you there all right let's go to
[03:43:11.500 --> 03:43:18.940]  jim in west virginia jim hello am i there yes you're there oh very well okay i think we need
[03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:24.460]  to call things what they are these primary elections are not elections let me explain
[03:43:25.260 --> 03:43:32.620]  they are customer surveys yes republican party was formed in the 1850s is incorporated in 1860
[03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:39.580]  by a law corporation must do what its owners tell it to do not what the employees or customers
[03:43:39.580 --> 03:43:45.340]  tell it to do so basically that's what explains brokered conventions super delicates everything
[03:43:45.340 --> 03:43:51.420]  else they are not elections the and the and the thing that the rnc chair priva said you
[03:43:51.420 --> 03:43:58.060]  they're they're auditioning to join us it was pretty creepy but it was very candid very candid
[03:43:58.060 --> 03:44:03.100]  amazingly candid yeah go ahead i agree with you from now on i think we need to refer to both parties
[03:44:03.100 --> 03:44:10.220]  as the republican party corporation yeah well this gets back to the whole thing about you know
[03:44:10.220 --> 03:44:13.420]  whether we're operating under corporate rules or whether constitution is still in effect look we
[03:44:13.420 --> 03:44:17.100]  understand that they are rigging everything we understand they're rigging these elections we
[03:44:17.100 --> 03:44:24.300]  understand they completely ignore the constitution but let's go with the assumption that the legitimate
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:31.100]  authority okay is the constitution and we are going to enforce legitimate authority and i think
[03:44:31.100 --> 03:44:35.500]  that's the basis on which we need to proceed we need to call their bluff on this they've been
[03:44:35.500 --> 03:44:39.820]  using these things you know swearing obedience to the constitution and so forth uh let's let's
[03:44:39.820 --> 03:44:44.540]  say okay yeah that's right you talk about that that is legitimate authority and if you're not going
[03:44:44.540 --> 03:44:48.940]  to obey it you are not legitimate and we are going to have legitimate authority i think that's the
[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:55.260]  way that we move forward go ahead jim because basically very very simply it's we the people
[03:44:55.260 --> 03:45:02.380]  have to enforce our right yes our constitution turned us into a landslide put a lot of observers
[03:45:02.380 --> 03:45:08.460]  at the polls exit pollers makes them nervous keep it up thanks or thank you yeah exactly like the
[03:45:08.460 --> 03:45:14.460]  story that i had about robert morrow who just had a hostile takeover and and it wasn't by himself
[03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:20.220]  he had 54 percent of the people who voted him in as the republican chair of the travis county g.o.p
[03:45:20.220 --> 03:45:25.340]  that's the county here in austin very important uh to do that let's take another call and i
[03:45:25.340 --> 03:45:29.020]  before i run out of time i do want to talk about what's going on in utah but go ahead let's take
[03:45:29.020 --> 03:45:38.540]  one more call uh mike in south carolina go ahead mike hi david hi i just wanted to talk about
[03:45:38.540 --> 03:45:43.900]  you're talking about rubio is the stalking horse and i'm talking about the mainstream media absolutely
[03:45:43.900 --> 03:45:51.420]  trying to vilify trump today i'm looking at cnbc and every story that they've got is uh why trump
[03:45:51.420 --> 03:46:00.620]  can't be president trump is like a kindergartner on china uh also uh unbeknownst to nobody's made
[03:46:00.620 --> 03:46:06.700]  mention of it that uh wholesale gasoline went up 30 cents a gallon over the weekend i didn't notice
[03:46:06.700 --> 03:46:14.060]  down as low as it was down as low as 86 cents a gallon uh over the week on friday it was a dollar
[03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:22.380]  two it went up to a dollar 32 and nobody ever mentioned it and cnbc changed their charts so
[03:46:22.380 --> 03:46:29.420]  that it doesn't reflect the fact that it ever went under a dollar and also aubrey aubrey mclendon the
[03:46:29.420 --> 03:46:37.020]  former ceo of chest peak energy supposedly just suicided himself yesterday wow that's interesting
[03:46:37.020 --> 03:46:42.940]  dr carsten yeah dr carsten suspended his campaign he just suspended his campaign
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:47.820]  he just did okay i don't see that i don't have a news feed up here at the moment yeah well i'm
[03:46:47.820 --> 03:46:52.860]  sad to see him go out i think he did an honorable campaign i think on pretty much everything though
[03:46:52.860 --> 03:46:57.340]  outside of obama care he was really kind of out of his depth you know he really i don't think had
[03:46:57.340 --> 03:47:02.780]  prepared enough on a lot of different issues but what we would hear from him in many cases was uh
[03:47:02.780 --> 03:47:08.540]  the same thing we were from a lot of candidates well i will talk to uh i'll i'll get the experts
[03:47:08.540 --> 03:47:13.500]  around me and i will rely on their advice it's like well actually we're looking to you for some
[03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:17.900]  leadership on some issues you know what what are your core issues why are you running so i'm sorry
[03:47:17.900 --> 03:47:23.660]  to see that happen uh everybody in the campaign was very very pessimistic last night uh he was a
[03:47:23.660 --> 03:47:29.420]  he was a real nice guy and so we wish him well uh before we go to some more phone calls i want to
[03:47:29.420 --> 03:47:36.140]  talk about uh this situation that's going on in utah you know you hear the phrase possecomitatis
[03:47:36.140 --> 03:47:42.300]  and typically we think of the possecomitatis act which is an act that limits the power of
[03:47:42.300 --> 03:47:46.700]  the federal government to use the federal military to enact domestic policy think about that we
[03:47:46.700 --> 03:47:55.020]  don't want a military coming into our communities we don't want soldiers we don't want martial law
[03:47:55.020 --> 03:48:02.140]  okay that's why we have the possecomitatis act but what does possecomitatis really mean it literally
[03:48:02.140 --> 03:48:09.980]  means the power of the county the sheriff of the county would call a posse we've all seen the westerns
[03:48:09.980 --> 03:48:16.060]  right you have the sheriff who was elected not appointed by some kind of law enforcement bureaucracy
[03:48:16.060 --> 03:48:22.780]  not appointed by some distant federal government that is as far distant geographically as the
[03:48:22.780 --> 03:48:27.580]  british government was geographically from the american colonies at the time of the revolutionary
[03:48:27.580 --> 03:48:34.940]  war not as distant from us in terms of political goals as the british were from the americans at
[03:48:34.940 --> 03:48:39.660]  the time of the revolutionary war but they did not want to have a standing military they didn't
[03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:45.820]  want to have a military that was going to come in and enforce policy in the area so law enforcement
[03:48:45.820 --> 03:48:51.660]  was centered around one elected official and some of his permanent deputies but when something big
[03:48:51.660 --> 03:48:58.540]  would happen they would deputize people and they would create a posse to keep the peace in the county
[03:48:58.540 --> 03:49:03.900]  okay that was the plan not that we would have a permanent standing army and you understand i've
[03:49:03.900 --> 03:49:12.620]  mentioned this before if you look at law enforcement in the united states there are only three countries
[03:49:12.620 --> 03:49:19.820]  that have a larger military than the law enforcement military that we have in this country one of them
[03:49:19.820 --> 03:49:26.860]  is the united states military so we have two of the largest four militaries in the world when
[03:49:26.860 --> 03:49:31.740]  you look at it that way we have the real military and we have the military of law enforcement and
[03:49:31.740 --> 03:49:37.100]  the military of the federal bureaucracy where we have even the department of education creating
[03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:43.900]  SWAT teams and coming after people for delinquent student loans now against this backdrop against
[03:49:43.900 --> 03:49:48.220]  the backdrop of things that we've seen at the bundy ranch at oregon and the many other cases
[03:49:48.220 --> 03:49:54.700]  that we've talked about here's one in utah pahute county utah the second smallest county by population
[03:49:54.700 --> 03:50:01.020]  utah is making a lot of noise in the western land movement these days this is a story out of from
[03:50:01.020 --> 03:50:06.860]  fox 13 out of utah so a longtime rancher stanton gleve is at the center of a conflict that includes
[03:50:06.860 --> 03:50:12.860]  the county sheriff on one side the us force service on the other he wore his cowboy hat he held up a
[03:50:12.860 --> 03:50:18.300]  pocket constitution as he spoke with the rural caucus of the utah state legislature on february
[03:50:18.300 --> 03:50:24.860]  the 12th he said these federal people have no right to be here if you follow the constitution
[03:50:24.860 --> 03:50:30.860]  and the pahute county sheriff marty gleve said we're not taking no more cuts on the mountain

[03:54:59.340 --> 03:55:05.340]  about the story that rob Jacobson showed me about this sheriff out in utah who is upset with the
[03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:10.220]  force service just like others have been upset with the blm these different federal government
[03:55:10.220 --> 03:55:16.620]  agencies that are uh essentially militarizing uh the law enforcement in these areas exceeding
[03:55:16.620 --> 03:55:22.620]  their authority talking about how he is going to deputize every single man woman and child in
[03:55:22.620 --> 03:55:27.820]  the county if necessary to stop what they're doing to them understand that is the authority of the
[03:55:27.820 --> 03:55:34.380]  sheriff to constrict conscript able-bodied men to assist in keeping the peace and to underscore
[03:55:34.380 --> 03:55:39.420]  the power of the community that's what posse comatatus means we have the posse comat posse
[03:55:39.420 --> 03:55:45.660]  comatatus act that said the federal government will not be allowed to use the military to enact
[03:55:45.660 --> 03:55:52.060]  federal policies domestically okay let's go back to this report again from utah the desert news
[03:55:52.060 --> 03:55:58.300]  back in june of 2014 this is another sheriff garfield county sheriff dandy perkins he's talking
[03:55:58.300 --> 03:56:04.300]  about the frustrations that he has out there working with the blm he said we have absolutely
[03:56:04.300 --> 03:56:09.020]  no relationship with the blm we've tried they seem to want to do their own thing they do
[03:56:09.020 --> 03:56:13.980]  not respect the authority of the sheriff at all it's hard for them to accept that the sheriff
[03:56:13.980 --> 03:56:18.620]  is the chief law enforcement officer in this county he says we've got many examples of abuse
[03:56:18.620 --> 03:56:25.260]  and this listen militarization of the government agencies as a real problem said garfield county
[03:56:25.260 --> 03:56:30.380]  commissioner leland pollock who also traveled to washington dc to talk about this he says
[03:56:30.380 --> 03:56:36.060]  if this guy does something that blows up we're all going to be on tv this is a scary scenario
[03:56:36.060 --> 03:56:42.140]  especially in rural areas well the guy he's referring to is guess who special agent in charge
[03:56:42.140 --> 03:56:48.380]  dan love remember that name when the bundy ranch standoff dan love was the guy who was in charge
[03:56:48.380 --> 03:56:53.660]  and there they're saying that he they accused him in that county in utah of spreading a culture of
[03:56:53.660 --> 03:56:58.940]  dismissiveness and arrogance towards his co-workers they say and this is a quote from pollock the
[03:56:58.940 --> 03:57:04.940]  county commissioner is create a situation where they thumb their noses at us and this starts at
[03:57:04.940 --> 03:57:10.060]  the top starts at the top okay and they're talking about the anxiety over armed federal
[03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:15.500]  regulatory agencies is not unique to utah they say representative chris steward from utah
[03:57:15.500 --> 03:57:20.620]  points out incidences that have happened in los angeles as well as to mining operations all the
[03:57:20.620 --> 03:57:27.100]  way up to alaska he unveiled a legislation that aimed to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies
[03:57:27.100 --> 03:57:31.580]  prevent them from having armed swat teams he says i understand they need to be able to protect
[03:57:31.580 --> 03:57:38.460]  themselves but this goes way way beyond that let's go back to the charges against clavin bundy
[03:57:38.460 --> 03:57:42.140]  when he was arrested the new american had an article at the time and i've been meaning to
[03:57:42.140 --> 03:57:46.220]  talk about this for quite some time but so many other pieces of news come in clavin bundy was
[03:57:46.220 --> 03:57:52.380]  charged with multiple counts of conspiracy but what about when the court charges a blm with
[03:57:52.380 --> 03:57:57.740]  conspiracy you've got the sheriff in clark county who was the sheriff when this standoff was going
[03:57:57.740 --> 03:58:03.260]  on talking about how the blm lied to him he said that in february and then there's this
[03:58:03.260 --> 03:58:08.380]  situation from chief judge robert c jones a federal court who charged officials of the
[03:58:08.380 --> 03:58:16.300]  blm with criminal conduct engaging in a decades-long conspiracy against another novata rancher
[03:58:17.020 --> 03:58:24.700]  those conspiracies go unheeded just as the crimes by hillary clinton go unheeded as the fbi
