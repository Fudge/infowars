[00:00.000 --> 00:07.640]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:07.640 --> 00:15.000]  radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:16.240 --> 00:22.080]  Well, this is a big Wednesday broadcast lined up for you. There's been all this
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.240]  news in the UK and the US where they're saying, if you hug your child, kiss your
[00:27.240 --> 00:31.560]  child in public, the police are going to come arrest you. You're going to have a
[00:31.560 --> 00:37.680]  license to have children. All of this is in the US government PhD training. All of
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.120]  this goes on in the Department of Education. This is in mainline textbooks
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.080]  used at universities everywhere. So I thought we'd have Charlotte Isherby on.
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.040]  Her husband just died a few months ago and she had been doing interviews, but
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.200]  she's back doing interviews again. And she was number two, Department of
[00:54.200 --> 01:01.320]  Education. And that, of course, was under Ronald Reagan. So for those that
[01:01.320 --> 01:05.000]  want to directly from the source, directly from the horse's mouth, how
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.080]  they're dumbing you down, how they've dumbed multiple generations down, how
[01:09.080 --> 01:13.920]  it's done scientifically, we're also going to line John Taylor Gatto up next
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.680]  week to get more into this because it's so important and it's so
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.240]  unbelievable when you read the actual quotes where they say, the US government
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.880]  job, Department of Education, is to destroy the family and break individuals
[01:27.880 --> 01:33.880]  into individual cells so they can be controlled by the state. The family is
[01:33.880 --> 01:40.800]  an enemy. The family belongs to ancient squalor. The state is civilization. The
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.560]  family is a disease on and on and on. Hundreds and hundreds of quotes and
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.800]  textbooks. So that's coming up in one hour after I cover all the news. Then
[01:50.800 --> 01:57.360]  we've never had him on the show before. Richard C. Hogan has quite a pedigree.
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.040]  He, of course, co-hosted shows for many years with Walter Cronkite on CBS News,
[02:03.040 --> 02:11.200]  former NASA consultant to NASA and CBS News anchor Richard C. Hogan. And I was
[02:11.200 --> 02:14.280]  in an airport coming back from Bilderberg and I bought his book, New York
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.160]  Times bestseller, Dark Mission in the airport. Ended up reading it. And I have
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.320]  to admit, you know, I would hear Hogan 10 years ago, 12 years ago on art balance
[02:24.320 --> 02:31.560]  stuff and just roll my eyes. But reading over the book, so much of it is stuff
[02:31.560 --> 02:35.760]  that I already knew and could prove and had separately learned. A lot of it is
[02:35.760 --> 02:41.080]  growing up in Texas, having friends, family, you know, that have worked in and
[02:41.080 --> 02:47.800]  around NASA. And it gets into the masons. It gets into how they put up a flag. The
[02:47.800 --> 02:51.740]  Supreme Council of 33, Southern Jurisdiction, when they were on the
[02:51.740 --> 02:58.960]  moon. So I know a lot of what Hogan talks about can be proven. A lot of the
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.840]  other stuff gets pretty wild. But now NASA's been caught coloring. I remember
[03:02.840 --> 03:08.560]  we're here in Hogan 10, 12 years ago, say it. Now NASA's been caught shading the
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.760]  Martian landscape red with a filter and saying, Oh, that was an accident. But
[03:12.760 --> 03:16.760]  really Mars does have greenish blue skies. It does have oxygen. It does have
[03:16.760 --> 03:23.080]  ice. Why are they trying to cover that up? So down a push in the envelope here
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.640]  for this show, we always stay focused on what we can prove. But if it gets people
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.840]  thinking, I think it's a healthy thing. And so Richard C. Hogan will be joining
[03:30.840 --> 03:34.600]  us for an hour and a half. We then have that former Giants NFL player coming on
[03:34.600 --> 03:39.920]  who walked across the country and wore out like 20 something pairs of shoes to
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.640]  raise $2 million for 911 first responders. He's gonna be on with us the
[03:43.640 --> 03:48.760]  last 30 minutes today. Got another big guest tomorrow that'll be a surprise
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.800]  guest and an even bigger guest next week. We'll just surprise you with all of
[03:54.800 --> 03:56.480]  that coming up.
[03:58.440 --> 04:04.920]  After the break. Here's some of the news I have Starbucks to close 600 US
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.320]  stores rain in growth. I'd say that's more than raining in growth. Utility
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.240]  workers hired a Stasi informants in Colorado, California, Arizona. That's
[04:14.240 --> 04:19.640]  from prisonplanet.com out of PC MAG and already seen this in a Texas paper.
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.480]  Texas PC repair now requires private investigator license and part of
[04:25.480 --> 04:29.680]  paying to have your computer looked at is they look at your bills, they look for
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.840]  illegal gambling, they look for porn. Then they file reports to the police.
[04:35.840 --> 04:43.960]  I mean the Stasi weren't this bad. So I thought I'd go over that for you and
[04:43.960 --> 04:48.560]  just a lot more on the war on the economy. It's a big important transmission

[07:52.080 --> 08:00.280]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:04.280 --> 08:08.800]  Charlotte Isherby head of policy number two position under Ronald Reagan
[08:08.800 --> 08:15.080]  Department of Education in 58 minutes from now. Richard C. Hoagland top
[08:15.080 --> 08:23.680]  consultant to NASA. CBS News correspondent and then George Martin,
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.560]  all-American NFL football player walked across the nation, raised two million
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.720]  dollars for first responders. He's going to be popping in at the end of the
[08:33.720 --> 08:43.200]  broadcast. Hoagland should be very interesting coming up in the, what,
[08:43.200 --> 08:49.440]  third hour into the fourth hour. Richard C. Hoagland was science advisor
[08:49.440 --> 08:54.280]  Walter Cronkite and CBS News and the Apollo program former current curator at
[08:54.280 --> 08:59.800]  the Hayden Planetarium and consultant to NASA. He is the co-originator along with
[08:59.800 --> 09:04.280]  Eric Burgress of the British Interplanetary Society of the pioneer plaque
[09:04.280 --> 09:09.280]  currently carrying a message for mankind on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft. It goes on
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.520]  and on. Never had Hoagland on. Always saying nice things about me on radio and
[09:14.520 --> 09:22.560]  I finally read his book Dark Mission. Pretty interesting stuff to say the least
[09:22.560 --> 09:30.360]  so that is coming up the secret history of NASA in about two hours from now. And
[09:30.360 --> 09:35.200]  then we have again ex-giant Inns cross-country walk for 9-11 workers. I
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.000]  wonder if he'll be demonized. Other people that try to raise money for 11
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.600]  workers are shouted down by neocon blogs and called traders and by the way I'm
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.400]  not kidding because see that's implying something's wrong with them and our
[09:48.400 --> 09:54.640]  gracious leader, Herr Busch, does not lie. He only tells the truth. I remember
[09:54.640 --> 09:58.680]  hearing a Christian station about 6 months after 9-11 say that George Bush
[09:58.680 --> 10:04.160]  may be God. Now they're not quite to that worshipful level. You think I'm
[10:04.160 --> 10:11.600]  kidding? I'm not joking. I heard this promo on Kixle before they sold out to
[10:11.600 --> 10:19.800]  another outfit. Not Kixle that we're on in Kansas City but it's got a similar
[10:19.800 --> 10:28.960]  call letters here in Austin. Kixle not KCXL and every time I talk about this
[10:28.960 --> 10:32.360]  story I only told a few times people call in and say what do you mean they're
[10:32.360 --> 10:42.640]  saying that in case CXL no KIXL in Austin, Texas. I'll never forget driving
[10:42.640 --> 10:49.560]  and it was like he is our father. He loves his children. He is good. He protects
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.800]  the weak and it kept cutting in in between with George Bush saying things
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.160]  about fighting terrorists and then at the end it goes he is our Lord and Savior
[10:59.160 --> 11:07.920]  then Bush speaks some more and it goes Jesus Christ. But I mean who would
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.680]  ever think Pastor Haguey would be saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah, wasn't the Son
[11:12.680 --> 11:19.720]  of God, that Israel that he was an evil rebel in Israel and they all say Hale,
[11:19.720 --> 11:26.560]  Hale, Hale. Now Haguey did pull back that book, the case for Israel. He did in
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.840]  defense of Israel was the name. He did pull that book back after a few months.
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.320]  He arrogantly blustered and there was a big split in his church. I mean even
[11:35.320 --> 11:41.720]  those zombies went wait a minute. This guy got horns and a tail and then this
[11:41.720 --> 11:49.920]  is not a religious radio show. The point is I just digressed off into the
[11:49.920 --> 11:57.160]  fact that you don't question your Lord, George W. Bush. Okay let me just go
[11:57.160 --> 12:03.560]  ahead and get into the news. The surveillance East German Stasi society
[12:03.560 --> 12:09.720]  that we live in. Before I get into this latest developments I want to just set
[12:09.720 --> 12:19.720]  the table here briefly with what we're currently under. In Europe, in England,
[12:19.720 --> 12:26.920]  in Australia, in New Zealand, for at least a decade, US launched spy
[12:26.920 --> 12:30.520]  satellites. The US has launched most of the spy satellites that are quote
[12:30.520 --> 12:36.520]  allies. England, Australia, New Zealand and Europe use and they have there a
[12:36.520 --> 12:42.840]  lot of time on those spy satellites that in the 60s could read in God we trust
[12:42.840 --> 12:46.040]  on a penny. You know the famous photograph of the guy laying out
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.880]  suntanning in Central Park and you can read the text of his book and sitting
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.480]  on top of another book is a penny and you can read it clearly that was taken in
[12:55.480 --> 13:01.880]  1968. Well they got stuff a lot better than that. On a clear day they can zoom
[13:01.880 --> 13:08.720]  in like a microscope into the you know little scratches on the surface of the
[13:08.720 --> 13:15.080]  penny. They have ground penetrating radar satellites. They've got ground
[13:15.080 --> 13:18.760]  penetrating radar aircraft. They're looking through your walls. I don't mean
[13:18.760 --> 13:22.160]  the stuff cops had 20 years ago in police helicopters that looks through
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.080]  your walls and sees heat signatures. I mean the feds have stuff that can look
[13:27.080 --> 13:30.640]  through your wall. They can then tune it and if you're not moving they can look
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.640]  into your heart. They can look into your guts. They can look right through your
[13:34.640 --> 13:43.160]  body. Okay so that's what's going on here. Now they've now announced that they
[13:43.160 --> 13:47.840]  are surveilling the American people with this and they're going to have the local
[13:47.840 --> 13:53.000]  police dialed into the spy satellites watching you in your town.
[13:57.960 --> 14:04.720]  Now again there are thousands of facets to this. That's the overt
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.440]  surveillance. We're having a national debate about what is the FISA law they're
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.000]  trying to pass due. Well we know it gives immunity for telecoms that violated
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.120]  federal law each and every case without warrants and allowed criminal rogue
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.320]  elements of the government to spy on US citizens. There were millions of these
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.680]  blanket warrants that just allow them to surveil anybody they want. They're not real
[14:27.680 --> 14:33.600]  warrants. It's just a letter a national security letter from the president or
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.000]  any of his designates in a host of agencies to surveil. Just like they said
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.040]  Patriot Act is only for terrorists and when it violated at least five of the
[14:44.040 --> 14:47.320]  first ten amendments to the Bill of Rights and then you can type in the
[14:47.320 --> 14:53.080]  headline states and local governments using Patriot Act and non-terror. Our
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.040]  Patriot Act used against US citizens and it'll say West Virginia 20,000 times
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.640]  Florida 40 some thousand. I mean I've seen literally hundreds of articles in the
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.080]  last six years where they're just using it on everybody. But you've got a general
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.280]  public that many people don't even know what electricity is. They don't know
[15:14.280 --> 15:18.600]  where the sun goes when it sets. I'm not joking. What you see on J walking on J
[15:18.600 --> 15:25.840]  Leno is accurate. In fact a lot of the public are not not brain dead. They're
[15:25.840 --> 15:31.800]  just totally distracted, diverted, so self-absorbed, so thinking about what
[15:31.800 --> 15:34.440]  they're gonna eat for dinner, who they're gonna have sex with, what fancy clothes
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.800]  they want, how they want to wax their car to look cool at a red light, that they
[15:38.800 --> 15:44.800]  know nothing else. It's just they just accept the society around them. But let
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.880]  me hear them get through all these points.
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.400]  But the biggest surveillance issue isn't the fact that every major phone company
[15:54.400 --> 15:59.600]  has entire NSA floors in it. Everything is wired through the NSA or that through
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.120]  FEMA. All the radio and TV stations have, by law FEMA comes in and puts in their
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.000]  own equipment to control all of yours by remote control, by radio, by shortwave
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.560]  they can dial in and take over. That was done in 96 as well, EAS. You've got this
[16:17.560 --> 16:20.960]  whole grid set up. The police have been trained and prepared to block off all the
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.400]  highways. If you try to evacuate or run,
[16:25.400 --> 16:31.640]  you know about the 26,000 preachers they've got trained to give their flock
[16:31.640 --> 16:35.600]  sermons about handing their guns in, going to forced labor camps, letting the
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.680]  government take your children. The sermons are all being given right now
[16:38.680 --> 16:45.040]  everywhere. You know about the 23,000 executives trained in infra-guard, you
[16:45.040 --> 16:51.280]  know about the 500,000, it was 490 something thousand truck drivers and
[16:51.280 --> 16:54.440]  that was in the first three years of the program. They've already trained another
[16:54.440 --> 16:57.880]  half million, so it's really close to a million, but let's just say five hundred
[16:57.880 --> 17:02.560]  though. Trained to spy and tattle and look for things everywhere and of course
[17:02.560 --> 17:05.480]  they're not going to find it. You go to these anti-terror training meetings, we've
[17:05.480 --> 17:10.880]  seen full videos online because they're public and you know the first two days
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.960]  is about looking for al-Qaeda and truck bombs and then next the next three days
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.720]  it's a week-long course is, by the way, did you see a parent spank their child at
[17:19.720 --> 17:24.000]  a rest stop? Go ahead and call the cops. Did you see somebody throw a beer can in
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.600]  a trash can? Then of course it's not really a beer can, but the cops still
[17:26.600 --> 17:29.840]  pull you over. You've got your prescriptions out of their box, you
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.720]  go ahead and go to jail for that. You know we've read those cases. Did you hug
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.920]  your child? Did it look like pedophilia? Go ahead and call the cops. Do you see a
[17:39.920 --> 17:44.720]  person walking with a bag on their back? Go ahead and call the cops. Did you see
[17:44.720 --> 17:48.480]  somebody filming? Go ahead and call the cops. To our now, the cops just walk up
[17:48.480 --> 17:50.840]  and say, turn your camera off. Don't videotape anything. You're not allowed to
[17:50.840 --> 17:57.560]  America. There's no law. They don't care. But the real spying goes on when you go
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.120]  into the big computer store, when your computer's broken and you then, it's
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.600]  factored into what you pay for because they have to spend hours spying on you
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.800]  and under quote regulations now under law and so you pay to be spied on and
[18:12.800 --> 18:15.320]  have your fourth and fifth amendment violated and they don't even tell you
[18:15.320 --> 18:19.160]  you're being spied on. Or when you have the computer guy at your house, they
[18:19.160 --> 18:24.440]  spy on you. Now they all get money for what do they look for? They look for
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.600]  illegal gambling. They go and look at any porn that might have even accidentally
[18:29.600 --> 18:32.840]  and Lord knows it's all over the web where somebody just look might have
[18:32.840 --> 18:36.760]  looked young. You know there are millions of these sites and it's on the
[18:36.760 --> 18:42.240]  hotel TVs but that doesn't matter. The point is they see something that just
[18:42.240 --> 18:50.320]  might look like she's under 18. You're getting a SWAT team visit. All dying
[18:50.320 --> 18:53.360]  course flying kidnap children out every day publicly and they don't get in
[18:53.360 --> 18:58.160]  trouble. They have congressional hearings about it. Now when the carpet
[18:58.160 --> 19:04.520]  cleaners in your house, remember these guys are morons. They think that your
[19:04.520 --> 19:08.800]  girlfriends are going to botany school at UT. This is a real story. That
[19:08.800 --> 19:12.560]  matter, she's growing orchids. There's a grow light. That must be illegal. You get
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.280]  SWAT team. Happened to the apartment next to me. That was 13 years ago, 14
[19:18.280 --> 19:26.720]  years ago. I don't know, like 95. So that goes on. So when we get back, I'm gonna
[19:26.720 --> 19:33.960]  give you the new news. By law in Texas, they are gonna spy on you. No judge, no
[19:33.960 --> 19:39.080]  jury, no warrant. It's more East German than East Germany. It's more pathetic
[19:39.080 --> 19:45.280]  than anyone on earth. Of course, it's us. It's gotta be. I mean, we're the worst. We
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.880]  kill 50 million of babies. I mean, you know, we're scum.
[19:51.880 --> 19:59.880]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[19:59.880 --> 20:02.480]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[20:02.480 --> 20:06.480]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you,
[20:06.480 --> 20:09.480]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[20:09.480 --> 20:16.200]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[20:16.200 --> 20:21.480]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[20:21.480 --> 20:31.480]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[20:31.480 --> 20:34.480]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[20:34.480 --> 20:37.480]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[20:37.480 --> 20:43.480]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[20:43.480 --> 20:49.480]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[20:49.480 --> 20:52.480]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[20:52.480 --> 20:58.480]  Jim Newcomer from Midas, July 2, 2008. Gold opened at 9.37 an ounce. Gold coins can be purchased
[20:58.480 --> 21:03.480]  for $9.6390, $474.70 for a half ounce, or $237.35 for quarter ounce.
[21:03.480 --> 21:08.480]  That's $9.6390, $474.70, $237.35.
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.480]  Edjafond is caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies. The bond market continues to slump.
[21:13.480 --> 21:18.480]  J.P. Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler. Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[21:18.480 --> 21:23.480]  Mortgage giant countrywide showed mortgage payment was spreading to the middle and upper class.
[21:23.480 --> 21:28.480]  Investors cast out on investment banks' credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders
[21:28.480 --> 21:33.480]  and skyrocketing due to the increased risk. The US dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies
[21:33.480 --> 21:37.480]  and countries that previously financed the US are now seeking safer alternatives.
[21:37.480 --> 21:41.480]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report bubble leaking. Call for the report today,
[21:41.480 --> 21:47.480]  800-686-2237. The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[21:58.480 --> 22:05.480]  that endorsed Ron Paul for president. American Free Press, written by patriots, for patriots.
[22:05.480 --> 22:11.480]  Standing firm for our Constitution. Standing firm against the New World Order.
[22:11.480 --> 22:16.480]  Hammering the enemies of freedom. Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[22:16.480 --> 22:22.480]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and trilateralists, and the whole Council
[22:22.480 --> 22:27.480]  on Foreign Relations gang head-on. Here's your chance to catch up with the news from

[22:51.480 --> 22:55.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[22:55.480 --> 23:00.480]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[23:00.480 --> 23:05.480]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[23:05.480 --> 23:10.480]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete
[23:10.480 --> 23:17.480]  fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full.
[23:17.480 --> 23:21.480]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.480]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[23:25.480 --> 23:30.480]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[23:30.480 --> 23:33.480]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[23:33.480 --> 23:43.480]  Call triple-eight, use SFR-1. That number again is triple-eight, use SFR-1, or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.480]  That's OilCompanySecret.com.
[23:45.480 --> 24:04.480]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[24:04.480 --> 24:11.480]  Gold is up again today at over $945 an ounce. Wow.
[24:11.480 --> 24:21.480]  In the middle of a vacation week, speaking of that, Jason Burmes is back in Austin working on his film, Fabled Macy Birds.
[24:21.480 --> 24:23.480]  I'm just teasing him.
[24:23.480 --> 24:29.480]  Fabled enemies, he'll be sitting in Friday. I'm going to go visit family. I appreciate him doing that.
[24:29.480 --> 24:36.480]  He wants to work. He's back. He's had his vacation. Went to a wedding back in New York, and he wants to sit in.
[24:36.480 --> 24:44.480]  I have to say that, or I'll get mean emails. You're making him work on 4th of July. I swear that's how it works.
[24:44.480 --> 24:50.480]  Okay, let me get back to the police state. Let me get back to the spying.
[24:50.480 --> 24:59.480]  You need to know, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to hide. These spokes, the little spies that are everywhere make money.
[24:59.480 --> 25:07.480]  I mean, most of them aren't carpet cleaners to get the 15 bucks an hour. They're there to get the rewards.
[25:07.480 --> 25:14.480]  And I've seen news reports of where you'll have a carpet cleaner who's making 80 grand a year, 120 grand a year,
[25:14.480 --> 25:22.480]  or a plumber who's making 100 grand a year, 50 grand a year, depending on how energetic they are, just spying on people.
[25:22.480 --> 25:31.480]  Exterminators, air conditioned people, they're in your house and they're there to spy on you. Most companies.
[25:31.480 --> 25:39.480]  And they want that money so bad that if they see gun cases, they're going to go ahead and call the cops.
[25:39.480 --> 25:45.480]  This has happened to me. Legal guns. They don't know. They move it from California. They believe TV is reality.
[25:45.480 --> 25:51.480]  They watch dramas like NYPD Blue, where they find a gun in your house, you go to jail, where they've been disarmed.
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.480]  They think it's in Washington, DC. You need to know the danger, folks.
[25:55.480 --> 26:03.480]  I mean, a woman in Phoenix drank a glass of water and a wine glass and the cops were called and they went ahead and took her to jail
[26:03.480 --> 26:10.480]  because she had just been to the dentist and she had a bottle of painkillers.
[26:10.480 --> 26:16.480]  They don't stop, folks. They're here to put you in the system. They're here to throw you into its jaws.
[26:16.480 --> 26:21.480]  And I don't want to hear you're here to keep us safe. Again, the illegal aliens can have DWIs.
[26:21.480 --> 26:26.480]  They can now have cocaine and heroin and are not arrested or released in San Francisco.
[26:26.480 --> 26:32.480]  They don't have to have IDs, but citizens are arrested. We are scum. They are gods. You are God.
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.480]  We're just going to admit to everyone that government is now God and we're not like it and we're going to rebel.
[26:37.480 --> 26:40.480]  You have to admit what we become.
[26:40.480 --> 26:47.480]  So, all of this is happening and there's hundreds of ways you're spied on.
[26:47.480 --> 26:52.480]  You think, oh, my public school, you know, it has a counselor for my child.
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.480]  The counselor there is looking for dirt to give the police and the CPS.
[26:58.480 --> 27:03.480]  Okay? And I see the cases all the time here locally. I see them all over the country.
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.480]  A child skins their arm on the playground in front of witnesses. It doesn't matter.
[27:08.480 --> 27:11.480]  The teacher asks, what is that? Did your mommy do that?
[27:11.480 --> 27:15.480]  And, you know, does mommy spank you? And the child says, yeah, mommy spanks me sometimes when I'm bad.
[27:15.480 --> 27:18.480]  Oh, that's it. Mommy did that. It's over.
[27:18.480 --> 27:22.480]  You don't hand your kid over to the child rape squads and that's who they are.
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.480]  The CPS, literally. Then SWAT team's coming.
[27:27.480 --> 27:31.480]  I mean, let's just admit what we are. Let's admit how bad it really is.
[27:31.480 --> 27:38.480]  You know, you pull up, you've got your 14-year-old, your 10-year-old, and your two-year-old in the car.
[27:38.480 --> 27:49.480]  You pull up and you walk nine feet on Walmart surveillance camera to throw eight and a half dollars into the Salvation Army Cup.
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.480]  It's over, folks. You're arrested. You're taken down. Your children are taken. Done.
[27:54.480 --> 27:59.480]  You understand? This is who we are. You mean to list hundreds of cases here?
[27:59.480 --> 28:03.480]  Predatory state everywhere making you the criminal.
[28:03.480 --> 28:06.480]  And they haven't even gotten started yet. Now, Paul Lawson did a great article,
[28:06.480 --> 28:10.480]  utility workers hired a stasi informants in Colorado, California, and Arizona.
[28:10.480 --> 28:15.480]  Now, these are just federalized is why you're hearing about it. This is nothing, folks.
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.480]  Hundreds of police, firefighters, paramedics, utility workers have been trained.
[28:19.480 --> 28:25.480]  And recently dispatched as terrorism liaison officers in Colorado, Arizona, California to watch for suspicious activity.
[28:25.480 --> 28:31.480]  And I remember that means all crime, folks. There's no real terror, which is later fed into a secret government database.
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.480]  See, they're starting the databases now on everybody.
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.480]  According to the Denver Post, it is a tactic intended to feed better data into terrorism early warning systems.
[28:41.480 --> 28:48.480]  No, all the real experts say it floods everything with chatter and BS to where real intelligence can't stop attacks.
[28:48.480 --> 28:54.480]  But see, that's the whole point. The NSA is there to make sure that the black ops were able to carry out the attack.
[28:54.480 --> 29:00.480]  And to spy on other government agencies that are trying to do the right thing or other compartments.
[29:00.480 --> 29:06.480]  Warning systems to uncover intelligence that could help fight any U.S. forces.
[29:06.480 --> 29:14.480]  But the vague nature of the TLO mission and their focus on reporting both legal and illegal activity has generated objections.
[29:14.480 --> 29:20.480]  Do you remember the some of the heads of the federal marshals, air marshals saying,
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.480]  look, we're ordered every day to put innocent people in a terror database.
[29:24.480 --> 29:29.480]  Little kids taking pictures, moms laughing on the plane.
[29:29.480 --> 29:33.480]  This is ruining their lives. That's the whole point.
[29:33.480 --> 29:39.480]  By the way, you know there's over 8 million of you in the database. It's not a million anymore.
[29:39.480 --> 29:42.480]  We're all terrorists.
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[30:54.480 --> 31:05.480]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[31:05.480 --> 31:09.480]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[31:09.480 --> 31:16.480]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[31:16.480 --> 31:20.480]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[33:17.480 --> 33:23.480]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:23.480 --> 33:26.480]  Finishing up with the Stasi.
[33:26.480 --> 33:28.480]  Here's an example.
[33:28.480 --> 33:36.480]  Remember, the father-top archeologist isn't even a drinker, no criminal record.
[33:36.480 --> 33:41.480]  He's had a baseball game up in Michigan.
[33:41.480 --> 33:46.480]  And his 7-year-old son orders a lemonade.
[33:46.480 --> 33:52.480]  And the idiot near-do-well brings him a, quote, hard lemonade that looks like a bottle of lemonade.
[33:52.480 --> 33:54.480]  And the child took one drink.
[33:54.480 --> 33:57.480]  And by the time that had happened, the police were there.
[33:57.480 --> 34:01.480]  They took the dad to jail, CPS the child, freaked out, called an ambulance.
[34:01.480 --> 34:05.480]  They always overdo their crimes, make it look like they care about the kid.
[34:05.480 --> 34:07.480]  No alcohol in the child's blood.
[34:07.480 --> 34:09.480]  Doesn't matter.
[34:09.480 --> 34:10.480]  They took the child.
[34:10.480 --> 34:12.480]  They said, doesn't matter.
[34:12.480 --> 34:16.480]  So it was my wife's birthday last night, I'm out at dinner with my parents and the children.
[34:16.480 --> 34:21.480]  My mother has a margarita, and there's a straw in the top of it.
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.480]  And my daughter reaches over, gets it, and I barely stopped her from touching it to her mouth.
[34:26.480 --> 34:28.480]  Of course, everybody knows me in Austin.
[34:28.480 --> 34:29.480]  There's people watching my every move.
[34:29.480 --> 34:30.480]  You know, just normal folks.
[34:30.480 --> 34:31.480]  It doesn't matter.
[34:31.480 --> 34:33.480]  Most of them are probably little tattletail types.
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.480]  And if my daughter would have just touched that straw to her, who knows what hell would have been released.
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.480]  This is the sick, hyper-wicked demon society.
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.480]  Abort babies all day, but take somebody's child away of the moron at the ballpark,
[34:47.480 --> 34:55.480]  brings a alcohol drink to the child that looks like a regular lemonade.
[34:55.480 --> 35:00.480]  You see, just attack everybody, savage everyone, throw the book at everyone,
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.480]  accept illegal aliens and real criminals, and John McCain publicly goes for fundraisers in Mexico illegally,
[35:06.480 --> 35:12.480]  publicly goes to illegal fundraisers in France and England, raises millions of dollars,
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.480]  and they say it's illegal, and he just says, I don't care.
[35:16.480 --> 35:18.480]  Lawless criminal government.
[35:18.480 --> 35:26.480]  By the way, the only country during the Iraq sanctions that would sell oil-filled equipment to Saddam was, of course, Halliburton.
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.480]  It's always, and then they strut around wrapped in American flags and are worshiped by all the shaved head fools
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.480]  who don't understand the very countries being destroyed.
[35:36.480 --> 35:40.480]  By the way, you think I'm joking here as to how extreme all this is?
[35:40.480 --> 35:42.480]  This is really happening.
[35:42.480 --> 35:49.480]  Utility workers hired as Stasi informants in Colorado, California, and Arizona.
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.480]  Hundreds of police firefighters, paramedics, utility workers have been hired,
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.480]  and they are putting all of you in databases for anything.
[35:56.480 --> 36:02.480]  Now, you think that's bad by Paul Watson with links to the Denver Post?
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.480]  This is Mainline PC Magazine.
[36:06.480 --> 36:08.480]  Brian Heeter.
[36:08.480 --> 36:10.480]  I want to get him on.
[36:10.480 --> 36:12.480]  I had seen this in a blurb about a month ago.
[36:12.480 --> 36:14.480]  Texas legislature passed this.
[36:14.480 --> 36:18.480]  Texas PC repair now requires PI license.
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.480]  I mean, even if you don't want to spy on people in their PCs when they bring them in to get them fixed.
[36:24.480 --> 36:30.480]  Not to mention all the mental patients that are out there and might plant stuff on you.
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.480]  Now they have to spy with no judge, no jury, no warrant, no nothing.
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.480]  It's for Al-Qaeda, I'm sure, of course.
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.480]  From its Texas Rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty,
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.480]  the Lone Star State has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement.
[36:49.480 --> 36:53.480]  Thanks to a strange new law, and they have a link to the state legislature,
[36:53.480 --> 37:01.480]  it's a sting that may soon be felt by a number of the state's computer repair people.
[37:01.480 --> 37:03.480]  Thought it's a right to work state.
[37:03.480 --> 37:04.480]  No, it's not.
[37:04.480 --> 37:11.480]  A recently passed law requires that Texas computer repair technicians have a private investigator license
[37:11.480 --> 37:15.480]  according to a story post in the Dallas-Fort Worth CW affiliate.
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.480]  In order to obtain the license, technicians must receive a criminal justice degree
[37:19.480 --> 37:21.480]  or participate in a three-year apprenticeship.
[37:21.480 --> 37:23.480]  You understand, they must become minions.
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.480]  You see, I told you 10% of the college graduates are Homeland Security related.
[37:27.480 --> 37:35.480]  But now, from the technical schools, you see ITT technical, it's not IT technical, it's ITT law enforcement.
[37:35.480 --> 37:39.480]  And it's all to fight terror, but then you learn terror is spying on your neighbor.
[37:39.480 --> 37:41.480]  Freedom is terrorism.
[37:41.480 --> 37:43.480]  You understand, folks?
[37:43.480 --> 37:45.480]  And by the way, this is built into the bill.
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.480]  You're paying to have your fourth and fifth violated.
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.480]  But see, it'll be in the small policy thing you sign that they're spying on.
[37:53.480 --> 37:58.480]  In order to obtain a license, said license, technicians must receive a criminal justice degree
[37:58.480 --> 38:00.480]  or participate in a three-year apprenticeship.
[38:00.480 --> 38:03.480]  Those shops refused to participate will be forced to shut down.
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.480]  Violators of the new law can be hit with a $4,000 fine and up to a year in jail,
[38:09.480 --> 38:13.480]  penalties that apply to consumers and customers who seek out their services.
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.480]  Some of the area's larger companies already employ technicians with PI licenses,
[38:18.480 --> 38:22.480]  a fact that generally doesn't apply to small computer repair shops.
[38:26.480 --> 38:31.480]  Note, the story's been updated July 1st of the link to the law that serves as a source for the story.
[38:31.480 --> 38:33.480]  People couldn't believe it.
[38:33.480 --> 38:35.480]  Now, let me explain something.
[38:35.480 --> 38:45.480]  Every week, I see a mother who takes a picture of their naked newborn baby laying on a couch.
[38:45.480 --> 38:49.480]  In the photos you see in black and white photos, the photos used to be on Christmas cards.
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.480]  Not anymore. You got a SWAT team visit for that.
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.480]  This is, and of course, the government's a bunch of pedophiles. This is the sickness of it.
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.480]  And they love feeding on the normal population. It's a big, sick joke to them.
[39:01.480 --> 39:06.480]  Yes, folks, this is the dark side. This is crazy land. You're just not aware of it.
[39:06.480 --> 39:08.480]  Look under the rock, you'll find it.
[39:10.480 --> 39:17.480]  You see, you're saying, well, I just won't take my photos into Walmart that has my son or daughter playing in the bathtub.
[39:19.480 --> 39:22.480]  You know, they're just nuts. They're a bunch of perverts, dirty minds.
[39:22.480 --> 39:24.480]  I got my own computer. I'll just have one here.
[39:24.480 --> 39:26.480]  Nope, it's over, folks.
[39:26.480 --> 39:28.480]  And all the time, you hear about the arrest.
[39:28.480 --> 39:32.480]  Well, they had indecent photos on their computer. It's their one-year-old.
[39:38.480 --> 39:41.480]  You're all terrorist. You understand? You're all child molesters now.
[39:45.480 --> 39:51.480]  This is how it works, folks, and they are spying on you and you're going to pay for it, and there's no freedom.
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.480]  I mean, you've got to have a, and they're now saying, well, you got a thumbprint if you want to be a schoolteacher.
[39:56.480 --> 39:59.480]  Oh, you got a face print and thumbprint if you want to be a realtor.
[39:59.480 --> 40:02.480]  Oh, if you want to be an auto repair guy.
[40:02.480 --> 40:12.480]  And they're telling every agency, every, they've got to go around bossing every other type of company and private group into being spies.
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.480]  Unless it's illegal aliens running a meth house next to you, the cops just won't come.
[40:19.480 --> 40:23.480]  I mean, I had the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday where they're allowed to have cocaine and heroin.
[40:23.480 --> 40:25.480]  The cops have been told, leave them alone.
[40:25.480 --> 40:28.480]  You can't, and I'm not bashing the illegal aliens.
[40:28.480 --> 40:31.480]  My point is, I'm showing here that there's two standards.
[40:31.480 --> 40:35.480]  This has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[40:39.480 --> 40:43.480]  And a bunch of states have passed these laws where they have to spy on you by law.
[40:44.480 --> 40:46.480]  It's indentured servitude.
[40:48.480 --> 40:51.480]  You have to work for them, but see, they're just going to pass it on to you.
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.480]  You pay to be spied on.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.480]  Just like it violates your fourth amendment and fifth amendment.
[40:57.480 --> 40:59.480]  Everywhere you go, they're scanning.
[40:59.480 --> 41:01.480]  They're running your plates.
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.480]  No due process, no reasonable suspicion.
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.480]  You're just all run in the database and where you go and what you do.
[41:08.480 --> 41:12.480]  And maps of everywhere all of us go are already made and put in the computer.
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.480]  That's the computing space and the computing power they have.
[41:16.480 --> 41:23.480]  One of these companies, cameras can read up to a thousand license plates a minute.
[41:23.480 --> 41:25.480]  The biggest highways.
[41:25.480 --> 41:28.480]  And that's the computing power a few years ago, last time I checked.
[41:28.480 --> 41:31.480]  They're surveilling it all, maps of everywhere you go.
[41:31.480 --> 41:33.480]  Everything you do is tracked and traced.
[41:35.480 --> 41:37.480]  They just don't want to announce it to you yet.
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.480]  First, they're announcing they listen to you only when bin Laden calls you.
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.480]  Of course, you read the FISA rulings and the rest of it, of course, it's the complete opposite.
[41:46.480 --> 41:50.480]  But they talk to you like lobotomized monkeys.
[41:53.480 --> 41:55.480]  And I could go on for hours.
[41:55.480 --> 41:59.480]  This is just two articles out of literally 50 or so and I'll never get to them.
[41:59.480 --> 42:01.480]  But I just wanted you to know.
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.480]  I wanted you to understand that when you go to the big computer store and they say,
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.480]  hey, you want to pay 30 bucks extra and get a discount when you come in to get your computer repaired,
[42:15.480 --> 42:18.480]  you're sitting there looking at hungry wolves.
[42:19.480 --> 42:26.480]  You're looking at spies that are going to diligently with three-year law enforcement degrees
[42:26.480 --> 42:31.480]  that are going to spy on you and that are going to look for one thing.
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.480]  And if a maid or repair worker or your cousin that was staying with you
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.480]  visits some barely legal site that's totally legal, I read the cases all the time.
[42:39.480 --> 42:42.480]  People go to jail for going to legal sites.
[42:42.480 --> 42:49.480]  You think these moron juries, when they show them some picture of a 20-year-old that looks like she's 16,
[42:49.480 --> 42:51.480]  you can go pull the cases up.
[42:51.480 --> 42:52.480]  You go to jail for what's legal.
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.480]  I'm not defending all that porn.
[42:54.480 --> 42:55.480]  That's what's so dangerous about it.
[42:55.480 --> 42:57.480]  It's a trap, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:59.480 --> 43:00.480]  Oh, God help us.
[43:00.480 --> 43:04.480]  It's so incredible.
[43:05.480 --> 43:07.480]  But it's all selectively enforced.
[43:07.480 --> 43:14.480]  They can have the barely legal stuff on every major hotel television set advertised to you
[43:14.480 --> 43:22.480]  when you open the menu up right next to the gay porn and all the rest of it.
[43:22.480 --> 43:24.480]  That's fine.
[43:24.480 --> 43:27.480]  This is only for you, the isolated schmuck.
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.480]  It's not for the big hotel companies.
[43:31.480 --> 43:40.480]  It's only for you because when they're dragging you off to jail because the repair guy saw a
[43:40.480 --> 43:46.480]  barely legal picture or because there was a picture of your one-year-old son playing in a
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.480]  water puddle and his pants were coming down a little bit and they could see one inch of
[43:51.480 --> 43:52.480]  butt crack.
[43:52.480 --> 43:53.480]  It's over.
[43:53.480 --> 43:54.480]  Your life's over.
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.480]  Guys with shaved heads on roids with devil tats are coming with fat little pedophiles in
[43:59.480 --> 44:06.480]  their toe, the CPS, to hand your kids over.
[44:06.480 --> 44:07.480]  You think I'm joking?
[44:07.480 --> 44:08.480]  This is America.
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.480]  We've gone further than the Stasi anybody, but there's still remnants of liberty.
[44:12.480 --> 44:17.480]  Radio shows like this, people waking up.
[44:17.480 --> 44:21.480]  So you don't have a completely passive population bombed out at the end of World War II to
[44:21.480 --> 44:23.480]  go into this new tyranny.
[44:23.480 --> 44:26.480]  Again, articles about how they're installing the scanners that show your naked body.
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.480]  They're going to scan your naked children through them.
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.480]  That's Boston Globe.
[44:30.480 --> 44:34.480]  ACLU prepares lawsuit against Denver DNC plans for free speech.
[44:34.480 --> 44:38.480]  Zones restricting free speech, putting you miles away in a cage.
[44:38.480 --> 44:40.480]  All part of your enslavement.
[44:40.480 --> 44:43.480]  Telecom amnesty flip floppers got more telecom money.
[44:43.480 --> 44:46.480]  Yeah, of course, Senator Barack Obama flip flopped.
[44:46.480 --> 44:47.480]  He got money.
[44:47.480 --> 44:50.480]  I mean, this guy's got Dan Quayle endorsing him.
[44:50.480 --> 44:53.480]  You think Obama's going to give you change?
[44:53.480 --> 44:55.480]  Yeah, it's going to get worse.
[44:55.480 --> 44:59.480]  It doesn't matter that the election doesn't mean anything.
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.480]  Group Sue US for data on tracking by cell phone.
[45:03.480 --> 45:07.480]  Obama National Security Group teaming with globalist.
[45:07.480 --> 45:10.480]  Midwest floods show signs of global warming.
[45:10.480 --> 45:16.480]  No, it's called the Mississippi that's always been flooding as long as humans have lived on this continent 15,000 years.
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.480]  Doesn't matter.
[45:17.480 --> 45:19.480]  You tell the idiot public something, they'll believe it.
[45:19.480 --> 45:21.480]  They just want to be abused.
[45:21.480 --> 45:25.480]  Provocateurs planning violence at DNC, bunch of war news.
[45:25.480 --> 45:29.480]  But right now I want to get into finance.
[45:29.480 --> 45:35.480]  Gold's up 945 today.
[45:35.480 --> 45:38.480]  This is in the doldrums in the deadest part of the summer.
[45:38.480 --> 45:40.480]  This is the deadest week in the summer.
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.480]  Normally gold is low at this time.
[45:42.480 --> 45:47.480]  All these foreign big banks and brokerage houses are saying we're going into depression in the next month.
[45:47.480 --> 45:48.480]  I'm not.
[45:48.480 --> 45:49.480]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[45:49.480 --> 45:52.480]  But I do think it's going to happen within three years.
[45:52.480 --> 45:56.480]  But it is moving faster than most of the experts have thought and it's deteriorating.
[45:56.480 --> 45:58.480]  I mean, here's an example.
[45:58.480 --> 46:02.480]  Ford and GM are both moving to Mexico and they may go bankrupt.
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.480]  That's in the news.
[46:03.480 --> 46:07.480]  Starbucks closing 600 US stores.
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.480]  See, that's a major sign.
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.480]  Over 100 other major chains are just going bankrupt.
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.480]  AP for a decade it appeared there was no such thing as too many Starbucks for US coffee drinkers.
[46:18.480 --> 46:26.480]  His willingness to buy $4 lattes and dark drip brews rationalizes second green and white mermaids.
[46:26.480 --> 46:28.480]  It's a goddess, folks.
[46:28.480 --> 46:31.480]  Just down the street and sometimes even a third.
[46:31.480 --> 46:43.480]  But in a sign that those days are over, Starbucks Corporation announced that it will close 600 company operated stores in the next year as the faltering US economy hastened the pain caused by the company's own rapid expansion.
[46:43.480 --> 46:50.480]  Yeah, they cut their coffees in price in half three months ago, didn't help them.
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.480]  I go in restaurants that were full any time you went in now and there's 10 people on them.
[46:55.480 --> 46:58.480]  You go up to Dallas and San Antonio, half the billboards are empty.
[46:58.480 --> 46:59.480]  Well, they were empty.
[46:59.480 --> 47:03.480]  Now it's all tattle on your neighbor government signs with our tax money.
[47:03.480 --> 47:04.480]  Oh, God help us.
[47:04.480 --> 47:07.480]  I wanted to bring Ted up just for three minutes.
[47:07.480 --> 47:10.480]  He's got gold at the price it was on Monday.
[47:10.480 --> 47:12.480]  And I'm told in a day or two it's going to go up again.
[47:12.480 --> 47:14.480]  He has it at below spot.
[47:14.480 --> 47:16.480]  He has silver at below spot.
[47:16.480 --> 47:20.480]  And these are even coins that have collector value on top of them.
[47:20.480 --> 47:26.480]  You can't be getting a collector coin, a semi numismatic or somewhat collectible and by that they're not hyper collectible.
[47:26.480 --> 47:33.480]  But these are old coins, nice coins, Swiss and French Franks and British sovereigns, beautiful coins.
[47:33.480 --> 47:36.480]  And of course, silver US dollars and half dollars.
[47:36.480 --> 47:38.480]  You can't beat this type of deal.
[47:38.480 --> 47:40.480]  This is exactly the type of stuff I buy when I can afford it.
[47:40.480 --> 47:46.480]  And just with all this news, I mean, Ted, last week we're telling people buy, get into gold when it was at 880.
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.480]  And now it's 945 and going straight up and you've got it at basically 920 price.
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.480]  I don't know how listeners wouldn't take advantage of this right now, Ted.
[47:56.480 --> 47:58.480]  Well, Alex, that's the way you put it.
[47:58.480 --> 48:01.480]  I mean, we've got the 4th of July coming up.
[48:01.480 --> 48:02.480]  This market is usually dead.
[48:02.480 --> 48:03.480]  It's active.
[48:03.480 --> 48:09.480]  People are getting into the precious metals market even when we're in the dead doldrums of summer.
[48:09.480 --> 48:12.480]  Definitely at this time to be, to be getting involved.
[48:12.480 --> 48:15.480]  We were looking at 926 when I locked in on all this stuff.
[48:15.480 --> 48:20.480]  And I've got the British sovereigns and they're currently right now at a great value.
[48:20.480 --> 48:23.480]  They're at $257 each.
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.480]  I have the Franks right now at 205 and I also have those walking liberties.
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.480]  And they're a real good way to get into smaller pieces of silver, $189.20.
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.480]  I mean, people have to realize that, you know, Starbucks, GM, Ford.
[48:38.480 --> 48:41.480]  I mean, there are so many companies right now that are on the verge of bankruptcy.
[48:41.480 --> 48:45.480]  It's going to affect every asset in the economy.
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.480]  And people need to take a look at their retirement accounts.
[48:49.480 --> 48:51.480]  They need to take a look at the money that they have in the bank.
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.480]  And see, people don't want to admit that they've already had all of the false gains they were told.
[48:56.480 --> 49:03.480]  I mean, you're told you're getting a 6, 7, 8, 10% gain when you've got 15% compounded annual inflation.
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.480]  Folks, this is a fraud and it's a diminishing asset.
[49:08.480 --> 49:16.480]  I mean, it's a no-brainer to aggressively move out of other paper investments into precious metals.
[49:16.480 --> 49:19.480]  Physically hold them. Get it in your hand, folks.
[49:19.480 --> 49:25.480]  I mean, a lot of you, I know, are wealthy or are well-to-do and you're sitting on nothing but paper.
[49:25.480 --> 49:30.480]  And if you really think about it, you don't have anything other than your furniture and your house and your jet boat.
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.480]  I mean, what do you have that's real?
[49:33.480 --> 49:39.480]  You've got all this capital in these paper markets and I'm telling you, it's going to hell in a handbasket.
[49:39.480 --> 49:40.480]  Well, you can see it there, Alex.
[49:40.480 --> 49:46.480]  And as a matter of fact, if you think about it, in the last three years, people just sat there and watched their money melt away.
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.480]  Their purchasing power of their assets melt away by the tune of 40%.
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.480]  And if you're in the market, in the stock market, not only are you losing on the dollar purchasing power,
[49:55.480 --> 50:00.480]  but you're losing on the fact that your portfolio is going down.
[50:00.480 --> 50:04.480]  By the way, that's 45% with Euro parity. If you look at Euro open at 84, it's more like 65%.
[50:04.480 --> 50:07.480]  Ted, real fast. Tell them the coins. Give them the number.
[50:07.480 --> 50:12.480]  Yeah, the coins are going to be the Franks at 205, the British sovereigns at 257,
[50:12.480 --> 50:16.480]  and the rolls of walking Liberty halves at 189.20.
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.480]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.480]  Call us today because the prices will go up because spots went up.
[50:25.480 --> 50:27.480]  I can't buy them for this anymore.
[50:27.480 --> 50:30.480]  Ted, how long can you hold at the 926 level?
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.480]  I will hold this clean through the weekend.
[50:32.480 --> 50:35.480]  But after that, the market's going to have to take over.
[50:35.480 --> 50:40.480]  1-800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Thank you, Ted.
[50:40.480 --> 50:41.480]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[50:41.480 --> 50:51.480]  1-800-686-2237. Stay with us.
[51:12.480 --> 51:16.480]  It was World War II and a naval night battle was raging in the Pacific.
[51:16.480 --> 51:20.480]  On one side, Japanese ships, 20 destroyers, one battleship,
[51:20.480 --> 51:24.480]  six cruisers against the other side, four cruisers, seven destroyers.
[51:24.480 --> 51:26.480]  It was Guadalcanal.
[51:26.480 --> 51:29.480]  At the time, Dr. Martin was 19 years old, a naval pilot.
[51:29.480 --> 51:32.480]  His battle station that night was near the bridge,
[51:32.480 --> 51:37.480]  which was destroyed in an explosion, sending him overboard with shrapnel throughout his body.
[51:37.480 --> 51:42.480]  The 19-year-old sailor was blown off ship into shark-infested waters,
[51:42.480 --> 51:45.480]  waters that would be his home for the next 74 hours.
[51:45.480 --> 51:47.480]  The first night, he was not alone,
[51:47.480 --> 51:51.480]  for there were the screams of other sailors being devoured by sharks.
[51:51.480 --> 51:54.480]  Blood oozed from the flesh hanging from his legs,
[51:54.480 --> 51:58.480]  and at one point he counted over 100 sharks circling him.
[51:58.480 --> 52:01.480]  How he survived it? It's a miracle story.
[52:01.480 --> 52:04.480]  A miracle story of a voice speaking to him at the right time,
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.480]  and for time being saved and protected by a great white shark 18 feet long.
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.480]  It's a miracle story, and that's just part of it.
[52:12.480 --> 52:15.480]  What caused the shark to do what it did? Don't know.
[52:15.480 --> 52:19.480]  But what caused the captain of another ship that was on a secret mission
[52:19.480 --> 52:22.480]  with strict orders to do what he did?
[52:22.480 --> 52:24.480]  It's all quite a story.
[52:24.480 --> 52:28.480]  And when you hear it, you'll understand why the man became a world evangelist.
[52:28.480 --> 52:35.480]  Hear him tell the story himself at www.anotheruntoldstory.com.
[53:01.480 --> 53:04.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[53:04.480 --> 53:08.480]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[53:08.480 --> 53:17.480]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:17.480 --> 53:20.480]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[53:20.480 --> 53:24.480]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[53:24.480 --> 53:27.480]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:27.480 --> 53:33.480]  He takes his hand off, and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:33.480 --> 53:36.480]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[53:36.480 --> 53:40.480]  Download Truth Rising at www.prisonplanet.tv
[53:40.480 --> 53:45.480]  and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at www.infowars.com.
[53:45.480 --> 53:48.480]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[53:48.480 --> 53:51.480]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[53:51.480 --> 53:56.480]  Don't Worry
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.480]  This show is documented.
[53:58.480 --> 54:01.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:01.480 --> 54:07.480]  Look, the criminals that run our society and they aren't consciously criminal.
[54:07.480 --> 54:10.480]  Criminals come in and tie you up with a gun to your head.
[54:10.480 --> 54:13.480]  They want their slaves under control.
[54:13.480 --> 54:15.480]  And that's what's happening.
[54:15.480 --> 54:18.480]  They've trained their minions that criminal activity is normal.
[54:18.480 --> 54:21.480]  They're spying on people without warrants.
[54:21.480 --> 54:24.480]  Having informants of the cop can't do that, but they're little minions.
[54:24.480 --> 54:26.480]  They can all spy on you.
[54:26.480 --> 54:29.480]  And after all, it's to get the bad people.
[54:29.480 --> 54:32.480]  No, it's to throw the book and make stuff up against the slaves.
[54:32.480 --> 54:35.480]  And I went into that earlier, but these are key articles.
[54:35.480 --> 54:43.480]  We need another story written in the next few days by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron, Kurt Nemo, somebody about this PC world thing.
[54:43.480 --> 54:46.480]  Texas PC Repair now requires PI license.
[54:46.480 --> 54:48.480]  They're spying on you.
[54:48.480 --> 54:58.480]  And it's just like how it started in Texas and a few other states, law and order states that when you go in to get cold medicine, you got to sign a piece of paper and see your ID.
[54:58.480 --> 55:03.480]  Well, then now it's registered by law and, you know, getting a database to stop the drugs.
[55:03.480 --> 55:06.480]  Let me give me a break.
[55:06.480 --> 55:07.480]  And it's just going to get worse, folks.
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.480]  It's going to get worse, worse and worse and worse and worse.
[55:11.480 --> 55:17.480]  Yesterday when I said breathalyzers in your cars, I mean all cars, people who don't drink.
[55:17.480 --> 55:23.480]  It's going to be in them by standard by 2011 with Toyota and Ford have announced.
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.480]  And by the way, those are hooked into the police department through the on-star, through the cell phone.
[55:28.480 --> 55:38.480]  And just like it happens all the time, a drunk girlfriend or somebody gets in the car and plays with a breathalyzer on somebody's at a DWI and then immediately it calls the cops and you go to jail.
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.480]  Well, see, the new system is you go out and you've been drinking and you're just going to get something out of your car.
[55:43.480 --> 55:45.480]  You're going to jail.
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.480]  The minute your insurance is up unless you're an illegal alien, they'll be selectively ignored.
[55:49.480 --> 55:54.480]  The minute your insurance is out, that's going to be tracked by the license plate off the cameras.
[55:54.480 --> 55:56.480]  Cops are coming.
[55:56.480 --> 56:00.480]  This is a life of being ruled, being bossed around, being told what to do.
[56:00.480 --> 56:02.480]  I saw it in D.C. out in the middle of a park.
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.480]  Cops will just walk over to a family and just boss them around and say, why are you photographing that statue?
[56:07.480 --> 56:09.480]  And they'll be like, huh?
[56:09.480 --> 56:11.480]  Well, we're not allowed to. We won't.
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.480]  And the guy's like, good, don't.
[56:13.480 --> 56:15.480]  And I'd pull my cameras out and he'd walk over.
[56:15.480 --> 56:17.480]  Don't do that. I'd say, are you crazy?
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.480]  This is America. They tell you to do that.
[56:20.480 --> 56:22.480]  He's like, what's it for? Let me see it.
[56:22.480 --> 56:25.480]  And I'm just like, my God, you're sick.
[56:25.480 --> 56:28.480]  Sick degenerate filth.
[56:28.480 --> 56:30.480]  Just loving to boss.
[56:30.480 --> 56:34.480]  I mean, we are already prisoners, ladies and gentlemen, in many cities.
[56:34.480 --> 56:38.480]  I mean, they're already just bossing us just like it's downtown Havana.
[56:38.480 --> 56:40.480]  Downtown Havana isn't this bad.
[56:40.480 --> 56:43.480]  I've talked to tourists that have gone there when you got your cameras out.
[56:43.480 --> 56:45.480]  Only here, only in England.
[56:45.480 --> 56:48.480]  I mean, just light years into tyranny.
[56:48.480 --> 56:51.480]  Light years into despotism.
[56:51.480 --> 56:53.480]  And I just keep freaking out.
[56:53.480 --> 56:57.480]  I wish we had a bigger voice when we reached millions of people, but that's not enough, folks.
[56:57.480 --> 57:02.480]  That's why I want you to, by the way, on infowars.com or prisonplanet.com,
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.480]  there are the two final sneak peeks, the police state sneak peek,
[57:06.480 --> 57:11.480]  about two minutes long from, it's not a trailer, it's a sneak peek from the film,
[57:11.480 --> 57:13.480]  from Truth Rising is up there.
[57:13.480 --> 57:16.480]  And then there's another one, another sneak peek up on prisonplanet.
[57:16.480 --> 57:19.480]  You know, in the top corner where we post YouTubes every day, brand new,
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.480]  just went up there in the last hour for anybody that wants to see those two new sneak peeks.
[57:24.480 --> 57:27.480]  One sneak peek is on infowars, the other sneak peek is on prisonplanet.
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.480]  There's another article Paul Watson wrote today about Truth Rising coming out.
[57:34.480 --> 57:41.480]  We have a super quality DivEx, not just QuickTime and Windows and Flash.
[57:41.480 --> 57:46.480]  You can stream download, you can download, there's like five different formats,
[57:46.480 --> 57:52.480]  multi-quality versions of it, but I just looked at the DivEx on our big screen plasma screen.
[57:52.480 --> 57:54.480]  It just looks awesome.
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.480]  And it's less than a gig, right, Jason?
[57:58.480 --> 57:59.480]  And we've got instructions.
[57:59.480 --> 58:03.480]  I mean, everybody else will be easy to watch at prisonplanet.tv, just click and watch it.
[58:03.480 --> 58:08.480]  But there's going to be instructions on how to burn it to regular CDs,
[58:08.480 --> 58:15.480]  not just DVDs, but cheat CDs, and then about 60% of your new players have DivEx.
[58:15.480 --> 58:18.480]  And so you can just ask people, hey, I got a copy of regular DVD,
[58:18.480 --> 58:20.480]  or for young people, I got a DivEx.
[58:20.480 --> 58:23.480]  I mean, we're talking 20 cents to make a copy.
[58:23.480 --> 58:25.480]  I want you to go in there and just burn copies,
[58:25.480 --> 58:28.480]  and we're going to ram them down the throat of the New World Order.
[58:28.480 --> 58:54.480]  We launch in 24 hours, truth rising.
[59:07.480 --> 59:10.480]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[59:10.480 --> 59:14.480]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,
[59:14.480 --> 59:18.480]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[59:18.480 --> 59:23.480]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[59:23.480 --> 59:25.480]  While you're visiting the online video store,
[59:25.480 --> 59:28.480]  be sure to check out The Huge Distance on films like Endgame,
[59:28.480 --> 59:33.480]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[59:33.480 --> 59:36.480]  We're in a no-holds-far information war.
[59:36.480 --> 59:56.480]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[59:56.480 --> 1:00:06.480]  Big government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:12.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:21.480]  You know the private corporations that own our government that use behavioral psychology to brainwash the population?
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:27.480]  You know, they brag in hundreds of textbooks how they've got their children as captives,
[1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:30.480]  and they propagandize them to hate humanity.
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.480]  For decades, they've played spaceship under Department of Education grants.
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:37.480]  Spaceship or lifeboat, they get 8 to 10 kids around a round table.
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:40.480]  In the third or fourth grade is their favorite time for that.
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:45.480]  They indoctrinate them how to be spies in the seventh and eighth all over the nation.
[1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:50.480]  You write dossiers on your parents, what's in the medicine cabinet, that's even on the news now.
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:53.480]  That's totally German society.
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:58.480]  But they have things like the spaceship game where they say,
[1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:05.480]  okay, there's 10 of us on the spaceship, there's only enough air and water and food to get to the planet we're going to for seven.
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  Who is going to have to die? Who's going to be thrown out of the spaceship?
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:15.480]  And they teach them to imagine that their resources are based on limiting the number of humans.
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:20.480]  And that's a key now false logic circuit or anchor in their mind.
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:27.480]  Nothing else intellectuals taught to them, but how to be racially conscious of themselves in the name of not being racist,
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:32.480]  but really it creates racism and everyone looking at each other and noticing who's different.
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:38.480]  And the minorities who are the majority feeling sorry for themselves and attacking whites is generally what it turns into,
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:44.480]  but only because they're the middle class and the minorities are teamed up with the state while they're having eugenics carried out against them.
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:51.480]  They're actually the main target. They're only also used in the dual access in that warfare system.
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:58.480]  And in the lifeboat or spaceship game, they also act like they're a lifeboat at sea.
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:04.480]  They say, okay, we need a policeman. The policeman gets to live. Who's a policeman?
[1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:12.480]  But then the troublemaker or the person who's the rich man, he has to die.
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:18.480]  Of course, that just means anybody middle class owning their own business, they have to be pulled down by the other crabs in the bucket.
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:21.480]  The crab tries to climb out of a bucket if you're fishing for crabs.
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:25.480]  The others pull him down instead of working together, kind of like the Patriot movement does.
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:30.480]  With a little help from the COINTELPRO people getting the ball rolling.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.480]  And so introduces in your mind, people have to die.
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:39.480]  And I've read a bunch of reviews. It's already out on the file sharing networks, but I'm going to watch it and review it.
[1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:43.480]  I'm actually going to go see it. WALL-E. Looks real cute. Looks real friendly.
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:46.480]  Humans have destroyed the Earth because of the combustion engine.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:53.480]  WALL-E has been here for 700 years, and it's all about bringing life back to Earth, and now humans are bad.
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:58.480]  Now, what's going to destroy or mess up our lives is genetic engineering.
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:07.480]  Cross species. What's going to hurt things is things like fish infusion, artificial black holes, nuclear weapons, antimatter weapons.
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:14.480]  They admit they have. That's the type of stuff that has a good chance of destroying us or really hurting us bad.
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.480]  And potentially destroying the planet.
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:19.480]  Carbon dioxide is what plants breathe. It's the life driver.
[1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:24.480]  Carbon dioxide has been as much as 14 times higher in the past. That's all the major ice core studies.
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:29.480]  It was higher during the hiberian maxim, which caused the bronze age to begin.
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:34.480]  And for us to develop civilization 8,000 years ago, doesn't matter.
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:39.480]  They lie and hoax everyone, and there are well-meaning people everywhere, adults going around.
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:44.480]  It has the highest IMDB rating I've ever seen, what, a 9.7 or something?
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:46.480]  And it's like a religion.
[1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:49.480]  The guy at the restaurant we were at last night was telling us, have you seen WALL-E?
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:52.480]  And it was a, you know, it wasn't a guy who wasn't even nerdly.
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:58.480]  It was like, you know, the waiter at a nice restaurant from my wife's birthday was telling us, we must see WALL-E.
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:00.480]  It is an important message.
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.480]  And they're like running around like cult members, teaching us how to play lifeboat or spaceship and how we have to die.
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:11.480]  And that's what the film is. I've already read reviews of it and it teaches us that.
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:17.480]  And the children will sit there being brainwashed. The parents will be brainwashed and you will all learn how to die.
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:23.480]  So the global masters can have all the resources for themselves to control the future while they play God and probably destroy us.
[1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:28.480]  I mean, God forbid we have any real environmental fixes or anything.
[1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:31.480]  No, no, no, no. That's not going to happen.
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.480]  Oh my gosh.
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:39.480]  We'll be right back speaking of education with Charlotte Izabee, former head of policy department of education.
[1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:42.480]  We're going to break down all of this. Stay with me.
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:57.480]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:00.480]  You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:05:00.480 --> 1:05:03.480]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:07.480]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CIFR.
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:09.480]  Please sit down and shout out.
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:16.480]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:22.480]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:26.480]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:32.480]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:35.480]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:57.480]  As the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:12.480]  You've heard that the honey bees are dying off.
[1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:16.480]  You know there's a national and international food shortage.
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:19.480]  Prices are skyrocketing in the marketplace.
[1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:22.480]  And it's not your fault, but if you think gasoline prices have gone up,
[1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:25.480]  wait until you'll see what food is going to do in the next couple of years.

[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:33.480]  and plan ahead and save thousands and thousands of dollars on your food bills tomorrow

[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:54.480]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:59.480]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:04.480]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here. Why not go back to Basics and be safe with Calben Pure Soaps?

[1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:20.480]  Charlotte Israbe, she was the head of policy, Department of Education, number two position,
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:26.480]  directly underneath the head of the Department of Education.
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:30.480]  We're going to be talking to her in just one moment before we go to her.
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:35.480]  We are in uncertain times and a lot of dangerous things are happening as you know.
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  And I believe that patriots more than anybody else because we need to carry on liberty through a depression or whatever happens
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:45.480]  or World War III, now need to get prepared.
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:47.480]  And we have a great sponsor.
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:54.480]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com, the longest continually operating storeable foods company in the nation.
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:09:02.480]  High quality food that is non-GMO, clean and healthy, non-GMO, freeze dried and dehydrated.
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:08.480]  That means a lot of food that fits in very small cans and stores in very small areas.
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.480]  In climate control, it lasts more than 10 years.
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:15.480]  If you stored it in your hot garage, it lasts, it's guaranteed for 10 years.
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:18.480]  This is where I've gotten my storeable foods multiple times.
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  I believe in them, so give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:28.480]  They also have a free DVD and audio CD about what they do and a catalog.
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:32.480]  If you just want to call and get that, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:38.480]  And unlike a lot of the other companies, they deliver in a week to two weeks, not six or eight.
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:40.480]  And that's because they've bought tons of food.
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:41.480]  They have their own factory.
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.480]  They do it themselves.
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:49.480]  1-800-409-5633 are huge banners at the top of mfoldwars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:54.480]  Her website, deliberatedumbingdown.com, and you can get her book there,
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:00.480]  deliberatedumbingdownofamerica, and I wanted to get her on when I saw this article
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:03.480]  last week Paul Watson did, but it was out of the London Telegraph.
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:04.480]  You can go read it.
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.480]  Government permission required for parents to kiss or hug their children
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:10.480]  to take your son or daughter to the pool.
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  You'll have to have a license.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:16.480]  They already have it in all of England, but now it's federal law there.
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:22.480]  And they will come up and ask for your card, even as a parent, to be able to touch your child.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.480]  Licenses to change diapers.
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:25.480]  That's pedophilia.
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:28.480]  See, they're making normal action.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.480]  I guess they'll give bluebirds a license to feed worms to their babies
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:35.480]  or for a mother cat to, you know, clean their baby.
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:38.480]  I mean, this is a, this is, this is sick.
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:40.480]  And you see the statistics in the U.S.
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  Government child workers five times more likely to be pedophiles or to physically abuse children.
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:48.480]  They are the group that everyone should be watching and tracking.
[1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:51.480]  And look how many of them do get busted in jail and go to jail.
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:54.480]  We're good people and government do stop them.
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:56.480]  So I wanted to talk about this.
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:59.480]  I wanted to go over the, her book's the size of a Dallas phone book.
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:01.480]  And it weighs, I don't know how many pounds.
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:05.480]  And it's just all government documents where they say we want to eradicate the family.
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  And so I wanted to just rattle off all the facts and have the expert on.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:10.480]  We really love her to death.
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:12.480]  It's, it's Charlotte Isherbet.
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:14.480]  I'm always mispronouncing it.
[1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:16.480]  And Charlotte, you're just a darling.
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:18.480]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.480]  Thank you, Alex, always. It's always a pleasure to be on with you.
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:27.480]  And you know, I just, I was going, I guess, I was in Europe for a couple of weeks.
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:29.480]  And we talked about that too. That's interesting.
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:34.480]  And so, and I didn't know about this article out of the British press.
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:37.480]  But I'm not, not one bit surprised.
[1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:41.480]  It does seem that the UK leads, leads every country.
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:44.480]  I mean, it's always the worst things come out of there, believe it or not,
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:51.480]  because most people do not understand how the role of England in bringing us down into this monstrous system.
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  And it's a pliable nation.
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:12:01.480]  They were wild barbarians and they were domesticated and have imperial conditioning to go along with it.
[1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:02.480]  That's right.
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.480]  And I mean, if people are really surprised when I mentioned to them that that wretched program,
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.480]  whole language, which was deliberate, you know, to dumb down the children,
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  you don't have to spate, read or you don't have to be able to spell.
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:16.480]  You don't have to know grammar or anything.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:17.480]  That went on for about 12 years.
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:20.480]  And that initially came out of, I believe, New Zealand.
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:22.480]  And people say, oh, really?
[1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:27.480]  You know, and then a lot of bad things do come out of these squirts of New Zealand and Australia
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:30.480]  where everybody who has money wants to go away and go.
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:31.480]  Well, those are common wells.
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:36.480]  Those are under Crown Imperial Lord Milner conditioning ops.
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  Absolutely.
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:42.480]  So I'm not surprised, but what it all boils down to, Alex, and you know me,
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.480]  I usually get to the heart of the matter and people get upset with me
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:49.480]  because I don't go through a lot of the middle stuff.
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:50.480]  I did all of that in my book.
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:51.480]  I went through that.
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:52.480]  That's right.
[1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:53.480]  I did.
[1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:59.480]  I did because I was told at one time, they kept saying, that's your opinion.
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.480]  And that's why I wrote my book.
[1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:02.480]  That's exactly why.
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  It's 700 pages and it's all there.
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:11.480]  But initially, a lot of us understand what we see right in front of our face.
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.480]  You know, it's right in our face.
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:20.480]  And if you have just the slightest bit of history, if you understand the ism forms of government,
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:25.480]  which were not meant to be, fascism, communism, socialism, whatever it is,
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:29.480]  then you're going to recognize that this is an essential part.
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:32.480]  I mean, what's coming out of England now is absolutely essential.
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.480]  They can't run the world if they have a bunch of free-wheeling parents
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:42.480]  making decisions about their children's health and welfare and whatever, whatever.
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:44.480]  So they have to get the kids.
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:46.480]  And they've been trying for a long time.
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:48.480]  And of course, Hitler did that.
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:49.480]  The Soviets did that.
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:50.480]  That's right.
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:51.480]  It's all the same thing.
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:52.480]  Exactly.
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  And again, your book is just full of official quotes where they call the family a disease.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:57.480]  It's got to be eradicated.
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:58.480]  Yes.
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:01.480]  Christianity, the rotten corpse of Christianity.
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:03.480]  The humanist donkeys called.
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:06.480]  But you know, since I posted this in the message board, they've been linking.
[1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:11.480]  And in the info or comment area, they've been linking to all these cases where social workers come.
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:16.480]  And even when they're taking, say, the five-year-old CPSS, the mother will hug the son or daughter
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:18.480]  and they say, ooh, that's improper.
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:22.480]  Well, this, you know, remember this was going on about 15 years ago.
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  This business of poor grandpa, you know, he's got his first grandchild
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:28.480]  and he's not allowed to have the little granddaughter on his lap.
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:31.480]  I mean, this is the part of the women's movement, too.
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.480]  They're training us to separate men from women.
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:35.480]  Absolutely.
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:37.480]  And people can't see it.
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:40.480]  It's simply because they don't want to see it because they're too busy
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:42.480]  and that's all been created.
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:45.480]  Well, I see these modern mothers now.
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:46.480]  They're the boss.
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:47.480]  They're stomping around.
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:48.480]  They're totally unhappy.
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:50.480]  They have a domesticated, bent-back husband.
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:54.480]  And they'll let a cop in a black scheme ask with a gun.
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:55.480]  They feel safe.
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:57.480]  But then grandpa, he's evil.
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:00.480]  I know.
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:01.480]  I know.
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:05.480]  And these people who are not upset whatsoever with the Real ID Act
[1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:08.480]  or the Office of Homeland Security,
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:10.480]  what's going on taking our freedoms,
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.480]  the merger of the federal and state police,
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:18.480]  because, after all, you know, they're afraid they need to be protected.
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:22.480]  And if only they could realize that there is hardly anything
[1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:25.480]  that could be out on the street or in your house or anything
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:29.480]  that is as dangerous as the federal government coming in your house.
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:30.480]  They don't get it.
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:32.480]  Well, have you heard the latest in Texas?
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:33.480]  They passed a law.
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:35.480]  I have it here in front of me.
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:40.480]  And it's in PC Magazine where all computer technicians by law
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:42.480]  have to have a three-year law enforcement degree.
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:44.480]  And when you bring your computer in, they don't tell you.
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.480]  They download your whole computer and spy on you.
[1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:52.480]  Well, I guess that was sort of something that we were expecting.
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:55.480]  Let me ask you a question, if you've heard about this, Alex,
[1:15:55.480 --> 1:15:59.480]  because it relates to the British media coverage there as well.
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:03.480]  And I tried to get information this morning because I got back.
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:05.480]  I didn't know about this bill.
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:09.480]  There's a bill that evidently passed the Congress.
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:12.480]  But I'm not sure that's what I'm asking you.
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.480]  That does exactly what the British article says.
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:21.480]  I mean, it's in regard to parents who refuse to give certain medications
[1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:25.480]  or medical care to their children that it is OK
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:28.480]  if the Congress passed it for them to be taken from their homes.
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:30.480]  Now, I don't want everybody else...
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:32.480]  Well, yes, I believe that passed the House.
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:34.480]  I don't believe that's passed the Senate.
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.480]  OK, this is terribly important.
[1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:37.480]  Do you have the number of it?
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:39.480]  No, I don't have it in front of me.
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:40.480]  They're hitting us from so many angles.
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:42.480]  Well, that's a pretty important one.
[1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:46.480]  I really wanted someone from your office could get that information to me
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:48.480]  and your listeners.
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:49.480]  I'll try to dig it out.
[1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:52.480]  Charlotte, do you agree that more is happening now in a month?
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:53.480]  It used to happen in 10 years.
[1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:55.480]  I mean, they are pulling the stops up.
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:56.480]  Well, absolutely.
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:59.480]  What they're doing is they're implementing the Soviet system.
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:02.480]  And I've been talking about it since 1975.
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.480]  And you can call it Hitler, too, because a lot of the parts are both the same.
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.480]  But what I see, and I've been following,
[1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:12.480]  is the creation of the new Soviet man.
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:15.480]  And if you go into my book and you look at the research,
[1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:21.480]  if you look, for instance, in regard to a visit that was made by American educators
[1:17:21.480 --> 1:17:22.480]  who were OK.
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:23.480]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:26.480]  You're not just saying this, and the big banks are behind it.
[1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:29.480]  People get confused that the big banks are, quote, communists.
[1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:32.480]  They want to make us slaves, communisms, not for the people.
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:33.480]  Absolutely.
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:34.480]  Then they get the wealth.
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:35.480]  That's right.
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:36.480]  And for those that don't...
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:38.480]  See, the terms mean nothing, folks.
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:44.480]  For those that don't understand, they are stating that they're here to break up the family,
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:46.480]  that they're here to do all this.
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:49.480]  I mean, when Charlotte says the new Soviet man,
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:52.480]  they're the ones that are saying this.
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.480]  And they are now carrying it out.
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:55.480]  Go ahead.
[1:17:55.480 --> 1:17:56.480]  They're right.
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:02.480]  And the top corporations and associations for business have made it very clear
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.480]  that what they want is kindergarten to age 80 workforce training, OK?
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:10.480]  And this is a Soviet system.
[1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:11.480]  It's really slavery.
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:16.480]  Now, when you hear that exactly, it's the teachers, and then it's the police,
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:20.480]  and then it's the PC repair people, and then it's carpet cleaners and plumbers.
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:22.480]  And then you have to be a spy.
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:24.480]  You have to work for them.
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:27.480]  You have to go spend months a year in, quote, training, which is brainwashing.
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:28.480]  Well, absolutely.
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:33.480]  And any organization or association or church or whatever entity that takes the penny,
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:35.480]  this is why the faith-based...
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:39.480]  And they now recruited 26,000 preachers to be spies, exactly.
[1:18:39.480 --> 1:18:40.480]  Yes.
[1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:41.480]  And when people...
[1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:46.480]  The faith-based initiative of George Bush, and they really want to go to my website
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:49.480]  and look for my article, Walk Like a Doc, Talk Like a Doc,
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:53.480]  because that tells you exactly what George Bush has put in,
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:56.480]  with, of course, the help of 100 years before him,
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:00.480]  but the system, the Soviet system, has been implemented here.
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:03.480]  And you have to...
[1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:05.480]  For instance, the faith-based initiative.
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:07.480]  That sounds good, doesn't it?
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:10.480]  But that's a merger of the churches with the government.
[1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:16.480]  So the churches and the private sector are going to have to conform to what the government wants.
[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:19.480]  And you've got now Obama.
[1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:23.480]  People could say to me before Obama opened his mouth, say before yesterday,
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:26.480]  that I was wrong on Bush and faith-based initiative.
[1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:27.480]  It's wonderful.
[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:29.480]  Well, now Obama's come out in favor of it, folks.
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:31.480]  So he has three...
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.480]  You know, his little prongs are really nice.
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:34.480]  Charlotte, let me stay there.
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:36.480]  Charlotte, stay right there.
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:37.480]  Let me come back.
[1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:39.480]  She was the head of the Department of Education.
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:41.480]  She was the head of policy where she ran it.
[1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:44.480]  Number two position during Ronald Reagan's administration,
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:45.480]  and she would be...
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:48.480]  It was a political appointment, and she was well-qualified,
[1:19:48.480 --> 1:20:07.480]  and they would just tell her this.
[1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:30.480]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.480]  can be found in this online video library.

[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:11.480]  And I found 80 years ago all these top British bioethics people, the eugenicists, said we're going to shoot them up with mercury and brain damage to the public.
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:17.480]  We won't take it and then they'll be our subservants because they'd already found how bad it attacked brain tissue.
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:22.480]  And they're just going to do it to you and you're going to roll your sleeve up and heap a salt in your kids with it.
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:25.480]  You got mothers who were five foot five and their daughter six one.
[1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:31.480]  That isn't genetics folks. It's all the growth hormone and the meat and poultry, the milk you give them.
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:39.480]  You don't care. The fact that women have got seven times increase in lung cancer, more than a dozen times increase in breast cancer.
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:43.480]  It's what's in the environment. You're under eugenics attacks.
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:49.480]  Charlotte, as you're closing, Charlotte, you're just a great resource in your time at the Department of Education.
[1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:53.480]  Witnessing all this, enclosing their whole eugenics angle.
[1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:57.480]  How much of your research brought you into the fact that that's the overarching system?
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:06.480]  Well, it's very scary now what's happening and I am informed about a lot that's going on that I really can't make public right now.
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:10.480]  Oh, excuse me? Excuse me?
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:14.480]  Boy, that put my interest. Tell me what's going on.
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:20.480]  Well, bad stuff and I could tell you later, Alex, once we get more involved, but it's very, very dangerous what's going on.
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:23.480]  Well, give us a hint. Tell us what you found out from government.
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:30.480]  Well, their goal is to, no, not really from government. If you get killed, it's the same old crowd.
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:37.480]  They want the perfect Soviet man and if they can't do it through education, they're probably going to do it through genetic engineering.
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:45.480]  And I think you know that. I would like to point out that for your listeners, you know, my website's great.
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:55.480]  You can go to AmericanDeception.com. You've got the one copy that was left available. I bought of the Reef Committee hearings in regard to the role of the
[1:55:55.480 --> 1:56:03.480]  tax exempt foundation in changing our country to where we are now so we can be merged in quotes with the Soviet Union.
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:10.480]  That's official. You go to AmericanDeception.com. You've got the one copy that was left available.
[1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:21.480]  I bought of the Reef Committee hearings in regard to the role of the foundations in changing our country through the schools and through war, et cetera.
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:29.480]  Please, folks, go there. Read those hearings. AmericanDeception.com. Just type in Reef Committee or Norman Dodd.
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:35.480]  Yeah, that's right. For people in the system, don't roll your eyes. Go read how you're being savaged, how this is being done.
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:42.480]  Hey, Charlotte, you've got to tell me more. I know you have a lot of sources. You know, your dad was sculling bones and bohemian grove.
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:50.480]  I mean, you're not a lightweight yourself there in the Foreign Service. I mean, you're saying you have sources about how they plan the genetic engineering.
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:57.480]  They're already saying they're not going to let you have kids if your, quote, genetics aren't right. They know that they're saying behaviorally they're going to say
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:03.480]  aggression, resistance to tyranny is a mental illness, screening out the embryos. Is that what you're talking about?
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:10.480]  I think it's very important that you keep hanging in there with that one, Alex, and I will definitely be in touch with you about it.
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:18.480]  Okay? It's simply that there's no way we can go out with any information like this until we've got all our ducks in a row.
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:23.480]  But is this, I mean, when did you learn about this?
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:29.480]  I've been watching it for many years, but just recently I've become very concerned.
[1:57:29.480 --> 1:57:33.480]  Well, as soon as you're ready, will you call us first and come on and break it here?
[1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:38.480]  You know it. I'd like to be able to do it now, but I can't, but I will. I will call you first.
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:40.480]  How long, Charlotte, do you think?
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:42.480]  Couple of months, probably.
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:47.480]  Okay. Charlotte, Israbeet, deliberatedimmingdown.com. Give out the other one that has all those documents.
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:50.480]  AmericanDeception.com. That's easy.
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:56.480]  Well, Charlotte, we can only thank you with a great debt. I want to have you back up for longer today. Call soon.
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.480]  For putting out the deliberatedimmingdown, the e-book there for folks, for all the research.
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:06.480]  It's all there, folks. What we've told you is incontrovertible. They are matters of fact.
[1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:14.480]  This is not, you know, any flight of fancy. This is the reality. You are under scientific, military genius attack.
[1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:16.480]  You are being slaughtered.
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  Charlotte, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:20.480]  You're welcome. Thank you, Alex.
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:21.480]  Take care.
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:23.480]  And call your listeners. Bye-bye.
[1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:27.480]  She's the best. Okay, get her book right now on infowars.com. We'll be right back.
[1:58:31.480 --> 1:58:37.480]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:47.480]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:47.480 --> 1:58:50.480]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:55.480]  The American people know that 9-11 was the state. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:57.480]  the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[1:58:59.480 --> 1:59:06.480]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:11.480]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:16.480]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:22.480]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:25.480]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:25.480 --> 1:59:48.480]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:59:57.480 --> 2:00:03.480]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:08.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:14.480]  Richard C. Hogan made a voyage with us. Dark Mission, the secret history of NASA.
[2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:20.480]  We'll be joining us coming up in the next segment for an hour and a half.
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:27.480]  Then we have the NFL football player that walked across the nation, raised $2 million for firemen and police,
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:33.480]  emergency workers on 9-11 who didn't get treatment for the toxic dust inhalation.
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:38.480]  That is coming up. A few plugs right now. Truth rising.
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:43.480]  Truth rising, ladies and gentlemen, costs me, I don't know, around $70,000 to make,
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:50.480]  printing out the DVDs and other $10,000 or so. And all I want is it to be seen.
[2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:55.480]  That's our goal. And it seems it's kind of a reverse psychology.
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:01:01.480]  You say, hey, you know, get a prisonplanet.tv membership, get my weekly TV report,
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:07.480]  get my in-studio live interviews we do. We're about to do one with Richard C. Hogan,
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:10.480]  the next hour and a half in the NFL football player.
[2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:14.480]  That'll be live streaming video for prisonplanet.tv members.
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:23.480]  And then we'll also, of course, post that on prisonplanet.com within an hour.
[2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:29.480]  So you can watch it at your leisure. You get extended extras that aren't on the DVDs of all my films,
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:33.480]  like in-game 1.5. But the reverse psychology is sometimes I say, you know,
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:36.480]  hey, just burn all the copies you want, make all the copies you want.
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:40.480]  And then it's like, oh, well, that didn't have any value. Well, why should I care?
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:47.480]  The value is waking people up. That's the whole goal here. Don't take this for granted.
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:54.480]  Tomorrow night, we always put stuff out a few hours early. We're going to release truth rising.
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:02:01.480]  So just watch prisonplanet.tv, watch that space. We're going to have a DivX version with simple instructions.
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:06.480]  If you want to burn it to disc, not just DVD, and it's high quality.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:11.480]  It's good quality to give to people. And most DVD players now have DivX on them.
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:16.480]  But you'll be able to watch it in a bunch of other formats. It'll be simple. Just click on it and play it.
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:23.480]  Just if you want to burn copies, we're designing it to be a factory of resistance to really get the word out.
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.480]  We're doing everything we can to wake up as many people as we can.
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:35.480]  I'm really proud of this film. It's an amazing documentary. It's Cinema Verité, which in French means the cinema of truth.
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:39.480]  And by that, just the camera lens, there's no voiceover.
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:45.480]  And the film has a lot of evidence of how 9-11 was an inside job. I'd say 20% of the film is about that.
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:51.480]  30% is about the first responders and the cover-up. And the rest, the other half is about activism and tyranny.
[2:02:51.480 --> 2:02:58.480]  You see the police coming up and saying, we're going to say you have bombs. It's illustrating that incredible tyranny that they want to violate the First Amendment.
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:04.480]  This is a very important film and it's going to wake a lot of people up and it needs to be seen.
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  So please order the DVD right now at infowars.com. They'll be shipping out Saturday and Monday.
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:15.480]  They are now here with us. We need to get them out to people.
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:21.480]  Or starting tomorrow night and into the 4th of July at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:27.480]  And please get it out to everyone and get a prisonplanet.tv membership and see it in super high quality.
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:31.480]  Obviously, in a few days afterwards, it'll be on the web and that's fine. We want it to be.
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:39.480]  But high quality. This deserves to be seen in full quality. Plus, we need some capital so we can continue to make films.
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.480]  But the main goal is getting it out.
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:45.480]  In closing for this little segment, come back with Richard Hoagland.
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:51.480]  I want to tell you about something that really is getting the word out and that's New World Order Trading Cards.
[2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:57.480]  I'm holding in my hand New World Order Trading Cards, the Bilderberg Group, Henry Kissinger, Queen Beatrix, Dick Cheney,

[2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:17.480]  Truth Rising comes out in a little more than 24 hours on July 4th.

[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:25.480]  Very excited about that.
[2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:28.480]  My first Cinema Verite film turned out better than I thought it would.
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:30.480]  It's excellent.
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:34.480]  I was coming back from Bilderberg Group about a month ago.
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:39.480]  There in Virginia and I was in the airport and there were all these mindless neocon books
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  and mainline stuff and nothing interesting.
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:45.480]  And I saw Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:50.480]  And I had a friend who was an engineer at NASA and actually on the flight line,
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:52.480]  you know, there in Michigan Troll for some of the Apollo missions.
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:56.480]  And he said, running some of the RCA cameras, he said, you ought to read Dark Mission.
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:08:58.480]  I'll just leave it at that, years ago.
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:00.480]  A few years ago.
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:02.480]  And I picked it up and I read it.
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:07.480]  And so much, everything that I had done my own separate research or run into
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:13.480]  or seen historically in mainline history, you know, the occult, you name it,
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:16.480]  everything Richard Hogan was saying was accurate.
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:19.480]  And then there are a lot of areas in there that's his original research.
[2:09:19.480 --> 2:09:24.480]  And so if everything you know checks out, then it really freaks you out.
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:27.480]  You say, this sounds credible.
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:33.480]  And really a frightening book because having a shadow government,
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:36.480]  having an elite where they have suppressed advanced technologies.
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:37.480]  We know they have that.
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:38.480]  They've been caught many times.
[2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:40.480]  Who knows what's really going on?
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:43.480]  You know, that's the bigger issue is we can't trust them.
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:45.480]  And they've been caught lying so much.
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:48.480]  And his book gets into Alistair Crowley and all these people being involved
[2:09:48.480 --> 2:09:51.480]  in the founding of NASA, which is really mainline history.
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:55.480]  The average person doesn't know and JPL and the rest of it.
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:59.480]  That I couldn't put the book down dark mission New York Times bestseller.
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:01.480]  I guess other people couldn't put it down either.
[2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:03.480]  And he's got a new edition of it out.
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:05.480]  And I'm telling you, this is just an amazing book.
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:08.480]  By the way, I'm not selling the book and we have a bookstore online,
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.480]  but I'm not selling the book.
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:12.480]  I'm saying you really should get the book.
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:16.480]  And, you know, whether it's all true or whether all of his ideas are right,
[2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:17.480]  I don't know.
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:21.480]  But, you know, he's got quite a pedigree and he's a really nice fellow too.
[2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:24.480]  Richard C. Hogan was science advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS News.
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:29.480]  He's in the Apollo program, former curator of the Hayden Planetarium and consulted NASA.
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:35.480]  He is the co-originator along with Eric Burgress of the British Interplanetary Society
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:38.480]  of the pioneer plaque, you know, that gold plaque they sent out,
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:42.480]  currently carrying a message for mankind on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft.
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:47.480]  And it goes on and on and on all the things he's done in the Enterprise Institute.
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:48.480]  He heads up.
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:53.480]  And, of course, he's one of the most popular long-term guests on Coast to Coast AM.
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:56.480]  So we go to Richard C. Hogan right now.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:01.480]  Richard Hogan, it is just wonderful to have you on the show with us, sir.
[2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:03.480]  Alex, thank you so much for inviting me.
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:06.480]  And I must say I'm really happy to be here.
[2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:08.480]  Well, I'm happy to have you, sir.
[2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:09.480]  You're the expert on this.
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:11.480]  First, tell us a little bit about Richard Hogan.
[2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:13.480]  Believe it or not, some of my audience may not know who you are.
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:14.480]  You're Saga.
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:15.480]  You're Awakening.
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:17.480]  And then I want to get into the crazy admitted.
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:18.480]  This is something you can prove.
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:24.480]  History of NASA, skip forward to the kidnappings and what would be murders and crazy women
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.480]  running around and the wheels coming off NASA, as you put it.
[2:11:29.480 --> 2:11:36.480]  And then we'll go back into the secret government, the Masonic flags and all the really crazy stuff.
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:42.480]  Well, you know, you and I and a lot of other people have had an evolution, kind of a maturing.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.480]  You know, we both grew up.
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:47.480]  I'm absolutely convinced, even though I don't know your story chapter by chapter,
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:54.480]  but I'm convinced you grew up like me believing in, you know, a truth justice in the American way.
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:12:01.480]  And that we lived in the best country in the world and it was founded by people that had some amazing ideas.
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:06.480]  And it was the freest and it allowed people the widest diversity.
[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:12.480]  And it's only as you grow older and you start asking difficult questions.
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:16.480]  And you pull up the corners of the rug and you kind of look under.
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.480]  But you realize that that is a very carefully kept facade.
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:28.480]  That in fact, society we live in now, there's no resemblance to what we were taught in school.
[2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:32.480]  And about all the silly and stupid things just were free.
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:35.480]  About all the important things Alex, we're not free.
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:40.480]  And the thing that will make you free is to not believe what you're told.
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:42.480]  It's as simple as that.
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:49.480]  And so when I started out, Squeaky Clean Main Street, you know, Cronkite, NASA, Museum, Science and all that.
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:56.480]  And I came through a series of deep penetrating questions to the belief that not only have we been lied to by NASA
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:12:59.480]  about almost everything that they've told us that's out there,
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:04.480]  but we've been told lies about everything that means everything to anybody.
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:09.480]  And there's almost no limit. I mean, the kind of watchword, the mantra of dark mission,
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:13.480]  is the lie is different at every level.
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:20.480]  And I was given that by an intel officer who has been one of my dark, deep sources for years and years,
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:22.480]  who has never steered me wrong.
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:26.480]  So you're saying wheels within wheels, lies within lies piled on the next one.
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.480]  To maintain the illusion.
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:32.480]  And of course, this audience is well familiar with your work.
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:37.480]  So we can skip all the stuff that I normally have to do to bring people up the curve.
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.480]  And today it might be useful to explore why.
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:44.480]  What the hell's the end game? What's the point?
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:49.480]  Why lead people down the primrose path? Where did we go off the path?
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:55.480]  And how can we get back on the path? Because I firmly believe that we are not powerless,
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:14:01.480]  that we actually can change this curve, that we are masters of our own fate, captains of our destiny.
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:04.480]  But we have to wake up a lot more people.
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:07.480]  It really only takes about two percent, Alex, to change history.
[2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:10.480]  Well, you're right, Richard Hugglin. Can we go back, though, to your first awakenings?
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:18.480]  I mean, when did you start at NASA and at CBS and a big curator designing what's sent off in spacecraft?
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:22.480]  You know, a big conceptual guy. When did you start going? Something's wrong here.
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:26.480]  Okay. Oh, gosh. And how many hours have we got?
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:31.480]  I started out, you know, school and the museum.
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.480]  And I was, you know, kind of a prodigy. And I was the youngest curator in the United States for a while.
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:38.480]  Of course, I grew out of that one.
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:44.480]  And I, you know, when you're 18 in a museum and the mayor is calling you in for advice
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:49.480]  and how to increase, you know, revenues in the city through cultural diversity and all that,
[2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:52.480]  it gives you kind of a heavy feeling you can do anything.
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:55.480]  So I would pick up the phone. I would call anybody in the country.
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:57.480]  I'd call people at NASA. I'd call people in the government.
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:01.480]  I'd call people in the military at the Pentagon.
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:05.480]  And they would answer and they would give me answers and they would return calls and all that.
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.480]  And I finally went to a couple of museums.
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:12.480]  And I was an assistant curator in Hartford, West Harvard, Connecticut.
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:16.480]  And one day I got a call and the voice at the other end of the line said,
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:22.480]  my name is Frank Manitas. I'm an associate producer of CBS News Special Events.
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:25.480]  We'd like you to help us go to the moon.
[2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:30.480]  And like that great mind and Bill Cosby's routine, I said, come on, who is this?
[2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:35.480]  Really? And it turned out to be Frank Manitas from CBS News.
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:43.480]  And so I went and had the most extraordinary education at CBS News from 1968,
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:49.480]  just before the first Apollo 8 mission around the moon, to the early 1970s.
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:55.480]  1971, I believe. And I'm sure I learned far more than I imparted,
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:59.480]  because I saw how big media works.
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:07.480]  I saw how the Tiffany Network, the legendary legacy of Murrow,
[2:16:07.480 --> 2:16:12.480]  actually worked in its heyday when Walter came back from Vietnam,
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:15.480]  looked into the camera and said, it's lost.
[2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:20.480]  And Nixon and Agnew said to each other, well, we've lost them.
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:24.480]  The war has to end. If we've lost Walter, we've lost the country.
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:27.480]  I was so privileged to work with a man of integrity,
[2:16:27.480 --> 2:16:33.480]  a guy who actually believed the things that he was writing about and reporting on.
[2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:37.480]  Remember when Walter was the one dissident voice during the First Gulf War?
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:40.480]  Yes.
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:48.480]  How he was a voice of reason, saying all we're seeing is basically a scripted television plot.
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:51.480]  We're not allowed, you know, remember the media?
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:54.480]  That was before they came up with the idea of embedding reporters
[2:16:54.480 --> 2:16:57.480]  so that they basically could watch them 24-7.
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:00.480]  And there were a couple of guys that struck out across the desert
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:04.480]  and tried to find independent information and got caught by Sadam and all that.
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:09.480]  Well, Walter was one of the only voices that basically raised questions about this rah-rah.
[2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:13.480]  We're going to go beat this bad guy, you know, the new Neo Hitler.
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:18.480]  Anyway, so back when I was working for him, I learned about sourcing.
[2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:21.480]  You know, I learned the journalism side.
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:24.480]  I knew the science side, but I really learned journalism
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:30.480]  at the feet of a guy who really was a master.
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:34.480]  And I started looking around, and I remember one vivid day.
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.480]  You want to know the moment, Alex, when I began to realize
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:41.480]  that the facade was not what it was supposed to be?
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:43.480]  Yeah, tell me that light bulb moment.
[2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:45.480]  It was very early on.
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:48.480]  It was critical, and if I hadn't been asked by the Cronkite people
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:54.480]  to be there and help them create this extravaganza
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:56.480]  to show people what it was like to go to the moon,
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:58.480]  I wouldn't have had anything like the light bulb moment.
[2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:00.480]  It would have come a lot later.
[2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:03.480]  It was on a Sunday afternoon.
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:07.480]  There were a bunch of us sitting around in Bob Wessler's office.
[2:18:07.480 --> 2:18:10.480]  Bob Wessler was the executive producer of CBS Special Events.
[2:18:10.480 --> 2:18:14.480]  He went on to become president of CBS News for a while.
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:17.480]  Then he went and helped Ted Turner set up his network,
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:20.480]  which was called CNN.
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:23.480]  Anyway, Wessler was a child prodigy.
[2:18:23.480 --> 2:18:26.480]  He was a brilliant guy, very egocentric, very...
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:29.480]  I mean, in order to be in that position, you've got to be, right?
[2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:32.480]  And we were sitting around in his office, you know,
[2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:36.480]  he had the cabinet open and there was some liquor flowing around.
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:38.480]  We were just kind of watching the news conference
[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:44.480]  that was supposed to be coming in from Houston by satellite.
[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:50.480]  From the astronauts, I forget which crew it was coming back from the moon.
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:52.480]  I think it was Apollo 8. It had to be Apollo 8.
[2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:55.480]  So it was December of 1968.
[2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:58.480]  And we're sitting around, and there's a couple of producers
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:00.480]  and our researcher and me and Wessler
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:04.480]  and, you know, some people, coupling papers and bringing in stuff
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:06.480]  from the rest of the office.
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:08.480]  And we're just kind of, you know, we're kind of laid back
[2:19:08.480 --> 2:19:10.480]  because our correspondent there in Houston
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:13.480]  was going to ask the questions during the uplink.
[2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:17.480]  It was the first time they were going to actually allow correspondents
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:19.480]  to talk to astronauts directly.
[2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:23.480]  Okay, I want to hear about this on the other side of the break
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:25.480]  with Richard C. Hogan.
[2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:27.480]  We're going to skip the break after that.
[2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:30.480]  We're behind the scenes at presidentplanet.tv.
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:32.480]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with Richard C. Hogan.
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:35.480]  Then we're going to get into the beginning of NASA.
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:40.480]  The three groups that made up the founding of NASA,
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:42.480]  which is a creature of the president,
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:45.480]  a creature of the executive branch.
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:50.480]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:52.480]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:56.480]  investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[2:19:56.480 --> 2:19:57.480]  That's right.
[2:19:57.480 --> 2:20:00.480]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:04.480]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[2:20:04.480 --> 2:20:07.480]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:09.480]  The truth be told, gold and silver
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:11.480]  has outperformed paper investments,
[2:20:11.480 --> 2:20:13.480]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs,
[2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:15.480]  yet no word about IRAs.
[2:20:15.480 --> 2:20:17.480]  Perhaps the financial institutions
[2:20:17.480 --> 2:20:19.480]  want to maintain control of your assets
[2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:21.480]  by keeping you in paper.
[2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:23.480]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:26.480]  call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:29.480]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[2:20:29.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  and low return on your paper investments.
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:34.480]  Call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:36.480]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:40.480]  Call 800-686-2237.
[2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:44.480]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:49.480]  On September 11th, 2001,
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:51.480]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:54.480]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do,
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:56.480]  or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.480]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:03.480]  to tell their story.
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:07.480]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th,
[2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:12.480]  made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:15.480]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth,
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:17.480]  as brave souls throughout the world
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:19.480]  take action against their global masters.
[2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:22.480]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:25.480]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1,
[2:21:25.480 --> 2:21:28.480]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:31.480]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:35.480]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:37.480]  and aggressively spread it worldwide
[2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:40.480]  or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:42.480]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:46.480]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:49.480]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:52.480]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:55.480]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:21:58.480]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:00.480]  Finalized the contract in London
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:02.480]  and demoed our new product in Boston.
[2:22:02.480 --> 2:22:05.480]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:08.480]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:10.480]  I just talk to clients on the phone
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:13.480]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:17.480]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:05.480]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[2:23:05.480 --> 2:23:14.480]  You gotta be kidding me.
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:16.480]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:18.480]  They make the secure sleeve.
[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:21.480]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[2:23:21.480 --> 2:23:24.480]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:25.480]  No way.
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:29.480]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:31.480]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[2:23:31.480 --> 2:23:32.480]  I already got some.
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:34.480]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:39.480]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:41.480]  idstronghold.com?
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:24:07.480]  Right, or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:15.480]  Dark Majesty.
[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:22.480]  It's Tech's Mars book getting into the whole secret government available at infowars.com
[2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:28.480]  and a book that gets even more in depth into NASA and how this whole empire hooks together is Dark Mission,
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  the secret history of NASA.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:33.480]  Richard C. Hoagland, who was a consultant to NASA,
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:38.480]  curator of a major museum, designed some of the things that were sent out on deep space aircraft,
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:41.480]  came up with conceptual ideas for it.
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:46.480]  Then of course, Walter Cronkite there at CBS News is our guest.
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:52.480]  We've gotten to the point where you're sitting in there the first time your correspondent is going to be allowed,
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:57.480]  or correspondent period, to talk to the astronauts when they're on the moon.
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:24:58.480]  Go ahead.
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.480]  Yeah, I think you meant deep space spacecraft, not aircraft, right?
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:03.480]  Yes.
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:04.480]  No, deep space aircraft.
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:06.480]  Deep space odd air balloons.
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:12.480]  Anyway, so we're sitting around in the executive producer's suite because he had a big office in a suite
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:14.480]  and we're just kicking back.
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:16.480]  It's on a Sunday afternoon and we're watching our guy.
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:21.480]  Remember, NASA used to jealously guard any access to the astronauts.
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:26.480]  During the Mercury program, they had what they called a capsule communicator, the CAPCOM,
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:28.480]  who was usually another astronaut.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:33.480]  And even the flight directors or the head of NASA normally would go through the CAPCOM
[2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:37.480]  to talk to the crews in orbit as opposed to picking up the phone
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:39.480]  or picking up the mic and talking to the director.
[2:25:39.480 --> 2:25:42.480]  So this was a real break with this tradition.
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:49.480]  It was the first time that ordinary reporters were going to be allowed to ask questions directly
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:53.480]  of a NASA crew in space during a live mission.
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  So it was a big deal for the network and it was a big deal for our unit and all that.
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:00.480]  So we're sitting there watching to see how it was going to play out.
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:04.480]  And NASA comes on and says, I think it was Paul Haney in those days,
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:07.480]  well, we're having a small delay.
[2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:12.480]  The press conference will be in 15 minutes or something like that.
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:14.480]  So we had another round, right?
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:20.480]  And then he comes on again, well, the press conference is where we're having a small technical problem.
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:29.480]  The spacecraft has not yet risen over the horizon at Goldstone, Goldstone was on the big tracking station.
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:32.480]  So we have to wait for acquisition of signal.
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  Something about that kind of bothered me.
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:42.480]  So I literally, Alex, I literally took a, I was sitting in a chair by Wester's desk,
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:47.480]  so I took the back of an envelope on his desk and I started to do some scribbling, some calculation.
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:51.480]  And I looked at my numbers and I thought, this is nuts.
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:57.480]  And I shoved the paper over to Wester and I said, Bob, I said, NASA's lying.
[2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:04.480]  If that's true, if what they're saying is true, those damn mountains have to be five miles high.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:06.480]  And they're not.
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:09.480]  And that was the first time two things hit.
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  One was that this agency that I believed was the agency was for some stupid reason,
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:19.480]  not telling us the truth, couldn't figure out what the agenda was.
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:26.480]  And then the reaction from my own guy who had hired me was, oh, come on, you've got to be wrong.
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  NASA would not lie.
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:33.480]  And this had persisted down to the present, the mainstream media,
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:37.480]  even when this agency has killed people.
[2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  I'm talking Challenger, I'm talking Columbia, I'm talking bizarreness like the Lisa Nowak case,
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:48.480]  which makes no sense at all, unless you start asking deeper questions.
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:55.480]  NASA is a, we can do no wrong agency, even when they're blatantly, flagrantly doing wrong.
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  And that, to me, has been a mystery that still fascinates me because it's like with so much demonstrable,
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:10.480]  not only just error, but deliberate malfeasance, deliberate, you know, skull-duggery, deliberate lying.
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:18.480]  Why does this agency maintain this pristine example of the, you know, as Reagan used to say, the shining city on the hill?
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:23.480]  And that's another question that I don't have a good answer for, but I want a lot of people to think about it,
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:28.480]  because unless we crack the facade, I mean, there are other institutions in this society
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:33.480]  where no matter what you lay out, people will not believe that your data is right
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:40.480]  and the institutional facade or persona or manufactured image is wrong.
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:41.480]  Well, here's an example.
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:42.480]  That happened first.
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:49.480]  I mean, a good example is at first they would bust high-level Catholic priests, cardinals, fathers,
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:56.480]  monsignors, raping children, and for decades, the police wouldn't even investigate or prosecute
[2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:58.480]  because you don't go after a cardinal.
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:00.480]  You don't go after a bishop.
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:02.480]  You don't go after a bigwig.
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:04.480]  You mean, that's impossible.
[2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:05.480]  It can't be true.
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:11.480]  And now we know about a third of them, it turned out, were, you know, involved or involved in the cover-up.
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:13.480]  I mean, is that a good analogy?
[2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.480]  It's an actual analogy.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:19.480]  In fact, I was kind of in the back of my mind, being a reformed Catholic, that was kind of what was on my mind.
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:20.480]  Wow.
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:21.480]  Okay, well, stay there.
[2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:24.480]  We're going to talk behind the scenes about some of the things you want to bring up.
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:29.480]  When we get back, the basic history of NASA, all verifiable, but still just amazing.
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:31.480]  Then we'll get into mind control.
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:35.480]  Are they covering up artifacts on the moon and Mars?
[2:29:35.480 --> 2:29:37.480]  A lot more.
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:38.480]  We're on the march.
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:41.480]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:44.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:51.480]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:55.480]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:29:55.480 --> 2:30:02.480]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:05.480]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[2:30:05.480 --> 2:30:14.480]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:19.480]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:22.480]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[2:30:22.480 --> 2:30:29.480]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[2:30:29.480 --> 2:30:35.480]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.

[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:53.480]  Big John. Big John.
[2:32:53.480 --> 2:33:02.480]  Every morning at the mine, you could see him arrive. He stood six foot six and waited 245, kind of broad at the shoulder, narrowed the hip.
[2:33:02.480 --> 2:33:07.480]  The book is a New York Times bestseller, Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:14.480]  For folks watching in prisonplanet.tv, you can see the cover of the book with the grand masonic flag on it there.
[2:33:14.480 --> 2:33:18.480]  You can talk about that later. You can get the book at bookstores everywhere.
[2:33:18.480 --> 2:33:29.480]  Or, Mr. Hugglin, what's the best site to visit to get your booker to learn more about the huge overarching things that you're doing?
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:33.480]  DarkMission.net. We've set up a website for the book.
[2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:35.480]  But then you also have the Enterprise group.
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:40.480]  I have the Enterprise mission, yes, but that's basically a huge panoply of everything.
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:44.480]  If you're focused on the book and how to get it, then the discussion is going on.
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:52.480]  Mike Barrow, my co-author, has a blog over there, and we published new events around the book. DarkMission.net is the place to go.
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:55.480]  DarkMission.net. But go ahead and plug your other sites while we're at it.
[2:33:55.480 --> 2:34:05.480]  EnterpriseMission.com. Everything you ever wanted to know about the space program that you were afraid to ask, or didn't know to ask, is at EnterpriseMission.com.
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  Well, let's start getting into the history of NASA. You've got connections to Elron Hubbard, Alistair Crowley, Nazis, occultists.
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:23.480]  And then we see all the occultism in their symbols, their names. Break that down for us, Richard.
[2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:29.480]  Well, once you start asking questions, you know, one question leads to another, leads to another, leads to another.
[2:34:29.480 --> 2:34:42.480]  And when I realized that NASA had covered up this momentous press conference event, basically stalled it for half an hour to cover for a hungover correspondent for ABC News,
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:55.480]  I then realized that this agency, which was to be exploring space for the benefit of all mankind, was basically not above doing anything lying to protect one individual,
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:03.480]  or in this case, probably to Curry's favor, because if Bergman, who was going to ask the question for ABC, had not been there when this historic thing happened,
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:14.480]  there would have been wholly held to pay. And NASA was obviously, in retrospect, skewing its entire public affairs program for this correspondent,
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:19.480]  so that he would give them favorable coverage in future missions and future years.
[2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:29.480]  I understand, but it shows a culture of backscratching and lying. Let's go back. Well, that gets into how are these missions covered.
[2:35:29.480 --> 2:35:37.480]  You know, we think of the Fourth Estate, Alex, as the kind of fourth part of government. You have the three branches, then you have the press,
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:48.480]  which is supposed to be the watchdog group. You know that press people rate somewhere down around Congress and lawyers in terms of public opinion, public perception.
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:55.480]  And I do it because they just sit there in little sequestered rooms drinking coffee as they're given press releases, and they're kept creatures,
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:36:04.480]  more and more domesticated creatures, by the government. And you have the president setting up his own private agency with massive funding,
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:12.480]  running all these covert operations. And that's what I want to get into in dark mission. And again, I'd separately learn this in my own historical research.
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:19.480]  It's documented, but it's so bizarre. Tell us how and why NASA got founded, and because that's such an important part of your book.
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:27.480]  Well, the key thing, of course, goes back to World War II. You know, we have this huge war between us and the bad guys, the Nazis,
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:36.480]  or the fascists, and it involved, you know, the world involved. Japan involved. You know, Mussolini involved.
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:46.480]  Hitler involved huge armies and millions of deaths and billions of dollars. And it was basically, you know, kind of look at it archetypally,
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:55.480]  it was the forces of dark against the forces of light. Well, one of the things you got to realize is the forces of light were operating on the same wavelength
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:37:05.480]  as the forces of darkness. FDR was a 33rd degree Mason. And I started realizing that history itself, mainstream history, not just NASA,
[2:37:05.480 --> 2:37:14.480]  but mainstream history, with the help of one of my friends, Ron Nicks, who's a geologist, but also has done a tremendous amount of work in this area,
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  appears to be manipulating the conventional calendar, conventional historical events, according to a cult and astrological signs and times and dates and moments of eventuality.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:38.480]  And an everyday example of that would be Ronald Reagan, to the minute when he gave a speech, what day, what he was wearing,
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:45.480]  now, of course, Hitler designed it all, the modern Olympics, they're going to have it on 888 at 888 in the morning.
[2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:49.480]  I mean, they are really into numbers, numerology, please continue.
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:56.480]  Well, as I was investigating, you know, as I went through the rest of my career with NASA and the networks,
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:04.480]  given that big lie on that Sunday morning, I started looking at how the press dealt with NASA, and I noticed a favoritism.
[2:38:04.480 --> 2:38:12.480]  You know, certain people were courage, certain people were given favor, certain people were given special things, other people were kind of excluded.
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  You know, there was a pecking order, and those that were given favor were always writing favorable stories or doing favorable coverage or favorable pieces on the network.
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:27.480]  Be it ABC, NBC or CBS.
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:30.480]  So I realized there was this incestuous relationship.
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:41.480]  So years later, when I began to ask the questions about fundamental things, like, why did we land on the moon on July 20, 1969?
[2:38:41.480 --> 2:38:49.480]  And the answer was, and you could actually do this with a computer, which was accessible then, was not accessible during my, you know,
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:56.480]  as a surgeon with NASA. We didn't have personal computers, we didn't have laptops, we didn't have, you know, Macs, we didn't have anything that gives us,
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:03.480]  certainly didn't have the internet. The tools to combat this, this, you know, lies different at every level problem we're dealing with now,
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:07.480]  we basically were on our own, we're going to libraries.
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:13.480]  So I started, when we got the internet, we got the computers, I started looking at launch dates and landing times,
[2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:23.480]  and I noticed this bizarre pattern. This was in the mid-90s, which was that there appeared to be some kind of astrological,
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:30.480]  calendrical timekeeping behind the most important and major events in NASA's history.
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:39.480]  And more than that, certain key events, like landings on the moon with unmanned spacecraft, and then later with manned spacecraft,
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:45.480]  the Apollo program, actually rescued to land on Hitler's birthday.
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:52.480]  And another blightbow went off, bing, because everybody knows, you know, it's almost, almost on school,
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:40:02.480]  that NASA was formed of the nucleus of the German scientist in Operation Paperclip, including the big one,
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  the superstar, Werner von Braun, brought over to the United States, you know, as our pet Nazis, after World War II,
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:12.480]  after we quote, one, World War II.
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:22.480]  Well, bottom line in dark mission, Mike and I lay out the case that the pet Nazis basically rose up and ate NASA for lunch.
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:29.480]  And everything that NASA's been doing has been on some kind of bizarre Nazi ritual,
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:32.480]  you know, truly society calendar.
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  But you talk about, and then even the maps, the official ball caps, the patches, you know, then fit into all this.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:46.480]  There's symbology, the patches are designed to reflect these philosophies.
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:50.480]  Now, what was interesting, you see, is you had three groups we discovered.
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:52.480]  That's the case, you've got the Salish or Crowley group.
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  I mean, this is admitted, folks, go through it.
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:41:02.480]  You have three groups that ultimately were buying for power in the creation of NASA when Eisenhower did it in 1958.
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:08.480]  You had the Nazis, who of course were the big, you know, A.O.N.Garilla.
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:10.480]  You had the Masons.
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:18.480]  I mean, the Masons are kind of the good guys in this scenario, because James Webb, who was a 33rd degree Mason,
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:30.480]  basically tried to set up NASA to do amazingly important things to uplift education, to uplift technology, to uplift blacks in the south.
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  I mean, there's a huge swath of democratization that goes on in the United States by means of Webb using NASA and NASA as a tool
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  to help Kennedy, you know, create a social renaissance in this society to break out of the Ku Klux Klan and all the stuff that was going on in the south.
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:56.480]  And then, farm out, use it as a unification tool, also farm out the new technologies to American industry, but then meanwhile...
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:41:58.480]  And to the university system.
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:05.480]  And then you've got the third group, which we call the Magicians, which is the Crowley group, which was based out of JPL,
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:11.480]  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. How many times have you heard over the last 30, 40 years, Alex?
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:19.480]  New stories. JPL, the last laboratory in Pasadena, California, which is a laboratory basically under Caltech.
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:25.480]  So you had these three power bases, the Nazis, the Masons, and the Magicians,
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:32.480]  and Dark Mission goes through how they applied for power for each of their overlapping reasons
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:37.480]  and how the program, the space program that we all have seen,
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  is the result of the inside feudal wars between these three groups inside NASA who only have agreed on one thing, Alex,
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  and that is that we should not ever get to see what's really out there.
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:58.480]  Exactly. And, Richard, that's the nature of the New World Order. You're looking at one big pyramid,
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  and as you know, when you pull back, it's hundreds of big pyramids that come together in that compartmentalization,
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:11.480]  and that's all it is, is these sun cults, snake cults, devil cults, sex cults.
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:16.480]  They run every major agency, and there are wars. They fight amongst themselves,
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  but they always keep the dumb cattle in the dark, and they're all into the occult,
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:25.480]  and that's why at certain levels they get along, they recruit each other.
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:29.480]  They're super globalists, you'll find. I'll be a member of dozens of these groups.
[2:43:29.480 --> 2:43:34.480]  That is your Illuminati. It's the Babylon Mystery Religions, but your book has the evidence.
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:38.480]  Again, separately in my own research, folks, I've seen, as I can tell you, it's accurate.
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:43.480]  The parts that we're getting into now, I'm not saying the other stuff isn't accurate.
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:46.480]  I just am not knowledgeable about some of the stuff in the book.
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:50.480]  Let's talk about the magicians first. I mean, you've got chapter after chapter on it,
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:55.480]  but that's the part that most people, they know about the Masons, they know about the Nazis,
[2:43:55.480 --> 2:44:00.480]  and again, all following basically the same esoteric stuff, but a little bit different.
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:02.480]  Let's talk about the magicians.
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:08.480]  Well, the magicians go back. This is my name for what's in NASA.
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:13.480]  This group, go back to Aleister Crowley, who was the self-proclaimed,
[2:44:13.480 --> 2:44:20.480]  the big beast, 666, et cetera, et cetera, the vilest man in the world, all that.
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:28.480]  He was trying to practice literal magic in the 19th and 20th centuries,
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:34.480]  using mind over matter, using rituals, using esoteric rights, using sex magic,
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:40.480]  using anything he could get his hands on to basically try to change the world around him
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  to bend it to his will.
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:47.480]  He was one of those super guys. He was Ian or the head of a whole bunch of groups.
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:49.480]  Well, he was in and out of a lot of different groups.
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  He stole freely, mixed it all together.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:57.480]  There's even now a new book out which claims that he was part of the British intelligence community
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:01.480]  fighting both in World War I and World War II.
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:08.480]  Be that as it may, he found a young neophyte in California named Jack Parsons,
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  who was a genius. He was an experimenter back in the 20s and 30s,
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:17.480]  when every kid wanted to build rockets and blow things up.
[2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  And Jack eventually went on to help create with a guy named Molina,
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.480]  and a guy named Von Karman, who was a Caltech,
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:31.480]  what we now call today the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL.
[2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:37.480]  In the in-crowd, JPL is actually known by another acronym, Jack Parsons Lab.
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:42.480]  Because what Jack Parsons did, this young kid, again, another prodigal,
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:49.480]  he was able to create a solid fuel mixture that literally launched the space program.
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:53.480]  It wasn't Goddard. It wasn't the Germans.
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:58.480]  It was Jack Parsons, who in his day job was this brilliant chemist
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:04.480]  creating amazing rocket fuel mixtures that ultimately were powerful and stable
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:10.480]  that became the baseline for JPL in various rocket series.
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:14.480]  And then, meanwhile, in mainline history about Crowley and all these people,
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:17.480]  and Parsons and, of course, the founder of Scientology,
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:22.480]  Parsons is involved in sex cult rituals to channel entities,
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:25.480]  to tell him, I don't know if you know about this, you probably do,
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:28.480]  to tell him how to make all these things. I mean, I'm not saying it's real folks.
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  The point is, they believe it.
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:36.480]  So no way, what Parsons did in his day job was separate from what he did with Crowley.
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:41.480]  He became part of the Palema cult, the OOTO,
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:44.480]  which was Crowley's organization in Southern California.
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:47.480]  He ultimately wound up leading it.
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.480]  He became the head of it in Southern California, simultaneous
[2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:56.480]  with working on the foundations of rocket technology,
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:46:59.480]  which would bootstrap NASA into space.
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:02.480]  The founder of Scientology, Tyon.
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  Ed, what's his name? Elron Hubbard.
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:11.480]  He became also a member of the Palema group there in Pasadena, with Hubbard.
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:15.480]  And he and Parsons.
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  And then they kind of swapped lives.
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:21.480]  I mean, it's a huge, really interesting soap opera,
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:24.480]  an incredible soap opera that no one knows,
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:27.480]  underlying the whole Western contingent of what is now today NASA,
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:29.480]  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[2:47:29.480 --> 2:47:32.480]  Yeah, we have this gleaming white image of, you know, handsome,
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:34.480]  go get him, America.
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:38.480]  You know, perfect people who just are totally mom and apple pie.
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:40.480]  And meanwhile, it's a bunch of Nazis,
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:42.480]  a bunch of lunatic 33rd degree Masons,
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:44.480]  and a bunch of psycho...
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:46.480]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Alex, Alex,
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:49.480]  the 33rd degree Masons founded the United States.
[2:47:49.480 --> 2:47:54.480]  You have to separate the Masons from the other two groups.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:57.480]  You know as well as I, I mean, let's be clear.
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  I know that a lot of the founders were Masons.
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:02.480]  They also then wrote about how they didn't like that their Masons
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:04.480]  was being taken over by...
[2:48:04.480 --> 2:48:09.480]  Masonry in the 1800s was taken over by a guy who created the Ku Klux Plan,
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  whose name was...
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:11.480]  Albert Pike.
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:12.480]  Albert Pike.
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  So I want to be clear that the Masons today...
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.480]  So Albert Pike, the born Masonry,
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:18.480]  the ordinary Masons today have a clue.
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  We're talking about the Inkraut.
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:22.480]  I mean, I have some very good friends that are Masons.
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:24.480]  Sure, the porch Masons are nice guys,
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:26.480]  and join it because George Washington was in it.
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:27.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:28.480]  And that's my point with any intelligence.
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:29.480]  And they want to do good work.
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:32.480]  Remember, remember, the lie is different at every level.
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:33.480]  Yes, so I'm saying...
[2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:34.480]  You know, put that...
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  I'm going to make that as a bumper sticker.
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:37.480]  That has got to be a bumper sticker,
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:40.480]  because that is such a key to figuring all this out,
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:43.480]  because each level, Alex, as you and I know,
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:47.480]  is told just enough to keep them going in the same direction,
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:50.480]  but they're not told the big story, the big story.
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:51.480]  Exactly.
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:52.480]  I'm saying all Masons are bad.
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:54.480]  I'm saying at the top.
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:56.480]  But they think they're told the full truth.
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:48:58.480]  That's the way to control the crowd.
[2:48:58.480 --> 2:48:59.480]  Well, here's an example.
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:03.480]  Every major Masonic lodge of both arms of it,
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:04.480]  they...
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:06.480]  You know, the Grand Orient and the Scottish Rite,
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:09.480]  they have pictures of Albert Pike at every building,
[2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  and they have statues of Mendy C. right by the Supreme Court.
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  But meanwhile, do they read his book saying he's possessed by Lucifer
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:19.480]  and that Jesus isn't God?
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:22.480]  Do they read Manly P. Hall saying they worship?
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:24.480]  I mean, these are the head Masons,
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:27.480]  and then a Mason will argue with you and say it's not Lucifer
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:29.480]  when their own grand supreme masters are saying,
[2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:33.480]  yes, I am possessed by Lucifer, sweet Lucifer.
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:37.480]  Anyway, we both agree that the Masonic,
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:40.480]  you know, the ancient tradition were the good guys,
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:42.480]  and we're trying to enlighten humankind.
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:45.480]  That's why the founders were doing this incredible experiment
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:47.480]  called the United States.
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:49.480]  Since this country was formed,
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:53.480]  we've had group after group and conspiracy after conspiracy.
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:55.480]  Trying to get control of that engine.
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:57.480]  To tear it down, to take control,
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:02.480]  to divert it from whatever its historical destiny was
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:03.480]  and is supposed to be.
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:07.480]  Remember, Lincoln, the last best hope of mankind.
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:08.480]  I still believe that.
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:13.480]  That's why it's important to return it to its original path.
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:16.480]  Critical, if we're going to survive what's coming.
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:18.480]  All right, we've got a break,
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:20.480]  but I want to talk behind the scenes
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:22.480]  for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, also internet listeners
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:24.480]  who are listening to the infowars.com
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:26.480]  or PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  You'll be able to hear this three minutes behind the scenes.
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:30.480]  I've got to have Richard D. Hogan up for three, four hours
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:32.480]  if he'll do it the next month or so,
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:36.480]  because it's clear we've got about an hour and five minutes left
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:39.480]  and less than an hour, about 40 minutes left,
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:42.480]  and there's just millions of questions I want to ask,
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:43.480]  points I want to bring up.
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:45.480]  Let's get into what's happening right now at NASA.
[2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:47.480]  When we get back.

[2:53:56.480 --> 2:53:58.480]  Richard C. Hoakland is our guest,
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:00.480]  the book Dark Mission,
[2:54:00.480 --> 2:54:03.480]  the secret history of NASA,
[2:54:03.480 --> 2:54:05.480]  and we've hardly covered any of what's in it.
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:07.480]  I'm not having it back up in the near future.
[2:54:07.480 --> 2:54:09.480]  We've got him into the middle of the next hour
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:11.480]  and then we have that NFL player
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:13.480]  who walked across the country to raise
[2:54:13.480 --> 2:54:16.480]  money for 9-11 first responders
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:18.480]  who've been forgotten,
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:21.480]  part of focusing in on the release of Truth Rising
[2:54:21.480 --> 2:54:23.480]  coming up on July 4th,
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:26.480]  money of film that gets into that and other subjects.
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:28.480]  Richard C. Hoakland,
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:30.480]  skipping ahead now, we looked at the founding of it,
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:33.480]  weird secret agency controlled by the president,
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:36.480]  then to today,
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:38.480]  and I know people from Houston,
[2:54:38.480 --> 2:54:40.480]  I know a Hollywood producer who's very serious,
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:42.480]  doesn't make stuff up,
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:44.480]  saying that there were magnet programs run by NASA
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:46.480]  and that he was really in a mind control program
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:48.480]  with NASA.
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:50.480]  I looked that up, turns out they did it.
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:52.480]  They are associated with that over and over again.
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:54.480]  What about mind control?
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:57.480]  Did you ever, do you have any info on that?
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:54:59.480]  Well, let me back up.
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:02.480]  You've made a statement that I wanted to agree with,
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:04.480]  gently, politely, with all due respect as they say.
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  That's fine, go ahead.
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:08.480]  You said NASA control by the president.
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:10.480]  That's the big lie.
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:12.480]  From the get go, from the beginning,
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:14.480]  when Eisenhower created this agency,
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:16.480]  he thought he was in charge.
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:18.480]  And then, by the time he is,
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:20.480]  term was edited, second term.
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:22.480]  Remember his famous speech?
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:24.480]  Well, that's what I mean, it's a standalone agency
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:26.480]  outside government.
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:28.480]  Well, it's part of a series of agencies
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  that are controlled from
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:32.480]  some quarter.
[2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:34.480]  It's the shadow government, sure, sure.
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:36.480]  Well, but is it really even the shadow government?
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  I'm beginning to suspect it.
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:40.480]  Do you know Joseph Ferrell?
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:42.480]  Yes.
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:44.480]  Have you had him on?
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:46.480]  No, I don't believe so.
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.480]  You need to have Joseph Ferrell on.
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:50.480]  Joseph is working with me on the sequel to Dark Mission.
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:52.480]  Joseph is a genius.
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:54.480]  He's a PhD Oxford.
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:56.480]  He is a genius.
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:55:58.480]  What he has done is he has with documents
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:00.480]  and meticulous reasoning and research
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:02.480]  and doing it the old fashioned way.
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:04.480]  You know, science,
[2:56:04.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  actually documenting what you think
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:08.480]  you found,
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:10.480]  he has discovered the most extraordinary
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:12.480]  antecedents
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:14.480]  to the genesis of NASA in the
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:16.480]  end of the Third Reich in Germany
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:18.480]  and a series of black
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:20.480]  projects that were brought here
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:22.480]  and seem to form
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:24.480]  the nucleus of a secret
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:26.480]  hidden space program.
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.480]  You see, it's not like a religion.
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:30.480]  Absolutely, I mean, we know NASA is
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:32.480]  the cover for the real program.
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:34.480]  NASA is not, is a false front-western town,
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  as I say, over and over and over again.
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:38.480]  And part of the reason why there is
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:40.480]  such disarray now,
[2:56:40.480 --> 2:56:42.480]  where they can't seem to get their act together,
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:44.480]  why we're building this thing in orbit
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  that's going nowhere and sucking billions of dollars.
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:48.480]  They want to suppress technology.
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:50.480]  They don't want the public to know
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  what's really been developed.
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:54.480]  Here's an example, Raymond Teague, NASA engineer,
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:56:56.480]  Air Force intelligence before that.
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:58.480]  He's on the Apollo program
[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:00.480]  in Michigan for all these pictures of him.
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:02.480]  Good friend of mine, he's come in
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:04.480]  from the RCA on the cameras on the moon.
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:06.480]  He was working on RCA with the stuff in Skylab
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:08.480]  after that.
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:10.480]  And he said, he believes they went to the moon,
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:12.480]  but a lot of it was even covered up from them
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:14.480]  what they were really doing.
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:16.480]  And he said, the Van Allen radiation belt
[2:57:16.480 --> 2:57:18.480]  does fry the film.
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:20.480]  He saw canisters and capsules that were tested.
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:22.480]  He said they were on the moon,
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:24.480]  but that they fake the photos,
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:26.480]  and he says he doesn't know why. What do you say to that?
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  Well, I think he's wrong.
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:30.480]  There is some film degradation,
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:32.480]  and he went through the belt so quickly,
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:34.480]  and those canisters were put in lead
[2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:36.480]  for exactly that purpose.
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:38.480]  We've got a stunning artifact on the moon.
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:40.480]  I mean, you can't fake what we've got in these pictures
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:42.480]  that are NASA pictures.
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:44.480]  What's interesting is we've had some NASA sources
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:46.480]  ourselves.
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:48.480]  Ken Johnston is a key guy,
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:50.480]  who by the way is a 32nd degree Mason,
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:52.480]  and it was his Masonic tradition
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:54.480]  as one of the good guys
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:56.480]  when he started asking his own questions
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  of his own experience in NASA
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:00.480]  with Mars, my first book.
[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  He met me in Seattle,
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:04.480]  and he gave me access to an incredible archive
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:06.480]  of NASA photography
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:08.480]  that he had been ordered to destroy
[2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:10.480]  in Houston, and he had disobeyed orders
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:12.480]  and kept it for 30 years.
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:14.480]  Kind of like I've talked to the people
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:16.480]  for time-lapse books that were told
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:18.480]  to destroy the evidence of the back of Kennedy's head blown off,
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:20.480]  and I've seen those photos.
[2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:22.480]  They need to release them. I tell you what,
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:29.480]  stay there back in 60 seconds.
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:58:56.480]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken
[2:58:56.480 --> 2:58:58.480]  and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:00.480]  In the Info War,

[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:10.480]  Got to have him back up sooner rather than later.
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:16.480]  Okay, Richard.
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:18.480]  There's so much to cover.
[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:20.480]  Obviously we're scratching the surface of dark mission.
[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:22.480]  Very impressive book.
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:24.480]  No doubt NASA is covering up a lot.
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:26.480]  And then we, I guess all bets are
[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:28.480]  off then.
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:30.480]  We can speculate all day.
[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:32.480]  But there are some things
[3:00:32.480 --> 3:00:34.480]  that we can prove they're covering up.
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:36.480]  What about my question about
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:38.480]  NASA or the real program behind it
[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:40.480]  in mind control?
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:42.480]  Because in government documents,
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:44.480]  in government hearings, NASA keeps
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:46.480]  popping up over the years.
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:48.480]  And then from separate sources it keeps popping up.
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:50.480]  You're one of the foremost experts
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:52.480]  on NASA outside of its system now.
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:54.480]  Does that ever come across your radar screen?
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:56.480]  Well, it certainly did
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:00:58.480]  in a very curious way.
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:00.480]  First of all, let me say that there are,
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:02.480]  if you go to Google,
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:04.480]  Google is your friend.
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:06.480]  You know, size of the lies different at every level.
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:08.480]  The other mantra is Google is your friend.
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:10.480]  Use Google liberally, freely.
[3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  It's an amazing tool.
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:14.480]  The Internet.
[3:01:14.480 --> 3:01:16.480]  You realize that we wouldn't have a prayer if we didn't have the Internet.
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:18.480]  The Internet, you know, thank God
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:20.480]  for Bill Gates and DARPA,
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:22.480]  the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency,
[3:01:22.480 --> 3:01:24.480]  which gave us the Internet,
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:26.480]  has given us the tools to fight
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:28.480]  and fight effectively because information is power.
[3:01:28.480 --> 3:01:30.480]  So what you do is you go to Google
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.480]  and you start looking at
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:34.480]  all the patents from Mind Control.
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:36.480]  They're right out there.
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:38.480]  This is not airy-fairy,
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:40.480]  you know, doing their thing.
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:42.480]  Speaking of Google, they're now in bed with NASA, but go ahead.
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:44.480]  Well, they've been in bed for
[3:01:44.480 --> 3:01:46.480]  quite a while with certain
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:48.480]  interesting agencies, but
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:50.480]  the information is there
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:52.480]  if you go look for it.
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:54.480]  Google Mind Control Technologies.
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:56.480]  Mind Altering Technologies.
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:01:58.480]  We all know, or most of this audience
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:00.480]  probably knows about MKUltra,
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:02.480]  it looks like they've been at
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:04.480]  the idea of manipulating
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:06.480]  and mind-controlling other people,
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:08.480]  the other side,
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:10.480]  whoever the enemy is,
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:12.480]  and we're in their eyes the enemy
[3:02:12.480 --> 3:02:14.480]  for a long, long time.
[3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:16.480]  20, 30, 40 years.
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:18.480]  The question is how good are they?
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:20.480]  I think that NASA,
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:22.480]  if they themselves did not have the technology,
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:24.480]  were allied with those agencies
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:26.480]  that did have the technology,
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:28.480]  out of World War II,
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:30.480]  the Nazis were back to the Nazis
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  and those weird medical experiments
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:34.480]  again that we've all heard about.
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:36.480]  I ran into this first person
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:38.480]  when I was invited to
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:40.480]  Wyoming
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:42.480]  back in the
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:44.480]  early 90s
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:46.480]  to do a series of programs
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:48.480]  for the school district in
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:50.480]  one of the southern towns, I think it was Billings.
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:52.480]  And I would have been invited
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:54.480]  by a former CIA guy
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:56.480]  who was married to
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:02:58.480]  a doctor, a medical doctor.
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:00.480]  And what I decided
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:02.480]  is because they wanted me to come out
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:04.480]  and talk about the Mars stuff
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:06.480]  based on what I talked about at the UN.
[3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  And instead,
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:10.480]  I unveiled a surprise
[3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:12.480]  because at this Billings conference,
[3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:14.480]  for the first time,
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:16.480]  I talked about the structures
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:18.480]  we had found upon the moon.
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:20.480]  Well, Alex,
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:22.480]  you would have thought I had taken
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:24.480]  my own nuclear weapon
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:26.480]  and detonated it in the middle of the conference.
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:28.480]  I literally
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:30.480]  was manhandled by this guy
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:32.480]  and put up against a wall
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:34.480]  and browbeat
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:36.480]  for not following
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:38.480]  what I had said I was going to talk about it,
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:40.480]  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:42.480]  Now, you know that Wyoming is one of the places
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:44.480]  where they put these CIA guys out to pasture,
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:46.480]  that buy them all ranches,
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:48.480]  and they live like kings
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:50.480]  and basically it's CIA country.
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:52.480]  It's not just that they're putting them in,
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:54.480]  FBI, CIA,
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:56.480]  almost every major sheriff.
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:03:58.480]  Well,
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:00.480]  this was a retired intel guy
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:02.480]  who of course never retired,
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:04.480]  but here's the number of the story.
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:06.480]  When we were doing this conference,
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:08.480]  we were setting it up
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:10.480]  with this guy and his wife,
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:12.480]  and his wife was a medical doctor.
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:14.480]  And at one point,
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:16.480]  one of the people that I was with
[3:04:16.480 --> 3:04:18.480]  was trying to get her to talk
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:20.480]  about her experiences.
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:22.480]  And she revealed
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:24.480]  that she had been part of the
[3:04:24.480 --> 3:04:26.480]  quarantine team
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:28.480]  debriefing the astronauts
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:30.480]  when they came back from the moon.
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:32.480]  Wow, stay there. Let's tell all this together
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:34.480]  after the break. A quick break.
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  We're going to talk behind the scenes as well,
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:38.480]  but we'll finish up with that story
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:40.480]  and we'll get back to the main audience. Stay with me.
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:46.480]  Life has changed.
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:48.480]  We're not 21 anymore.
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:50.480]  We have responsibilities.
[3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:52.480]  That's why
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:54.480]  there's Drink and Maid Hangover Defense.
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:56.480]  Sure, we've done our sheriff partying,
[3:04:56.480 --> 3:04:58.480]  now kicking back with the neighbors
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:00.480]  and a few beers as more our style.
[3:05:00.480 --> 3:05:02.480]  But let's face it, as we get
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:04.480]  older, even that can leave
[3:05:04.480 --> 3:05:06.480]  us feeling run down the next morning.
[3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.480]  With Drink and Maid,
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:10.480]  you can have a few drinks tonight
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:12.480]  without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[3:05:12.480 --> 3:05:14.480]  Drink and Maid's patented
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:16.480]  and proven formula of guava leaf extract
[3:05:16.480 --> 3:05:18.480]  has antioxidants and other
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:20.480]  unique properties that help prevent
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:22.480]  the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:24.480]  even a few drinks can leave behind.
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:26.480]  Just dissolve one Drink and Maid
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:28.480]  in water and take it before bed.
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:30.480]  It's that easy. The next morning
[3:05:30.480 --> 3:05:32.480]  bring on the responsibilities.
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:34.480]  Drink and Maid Hangover Defense
[3:05:34.480 --> 3:05:36.480]  is available at retailers nationwide.
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:38.480]  Pick up some today.
[3:05:38.480 --> 3:05:40.480]  Remember your Drink and Maid
[3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:44.480]  and wake up feeling great.
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:46.480]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:48.480]  to the disaster of food costs
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:05:50.480]  from shortages already destroying
[3:05:50.480 --> 3:05:52.480]  millions of American families.
[3:05:52.480 --> 3:05:54.480]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive
[3:05:54.480 --> 3:05:56.480]  than it was about a year ago.
[3:05:56.480 --> 3:05:58.480]  Food costs continue to double because
[3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:00.480]  there's no food worldwide.
[3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:02.480]  The only solution is to use now
[3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:04.480]  and store for later
[3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:06.480]  great flavored super bulk foods
[3:06:06.480 --> 3:06:08.480]  that cost half as much
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:10.480]  what these groceries cost last year.
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:12.480]  Get on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:14.480]  and find a two month grab and go kit.

[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:20.480]  great meals a day. The cost
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:22.480]  about five dollars a day.

[3:06:26.480 --> 3:06:28.480]  super food at half the cost

[3:06:34.480 --> 3:06:36.480]  but what happens in your piece of America
[3:06:36.480 --> 3:06:38.480]  is up to you. Call
[3:06:38.480 --> 3:06:40.480]  800-409-5633
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:44.480]  On September 11th, 2001
[3:06:44.480 --> 3:06:46.480]  along with hundreds
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:48.480]  of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero
[3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:50.480]  and we knew what to do
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:52.480]  or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:52.480 --> 3:06:54.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[3:06:54.480 --> 3:06:56.480]  that finally gives first responders
[3:06:56.480 --> 3:06:58.480]  a platform to tell their story.
[3:06:58.480 --> 3:07:00.480]  Whitman
[3:07:00.480 --> 3:07:02.480]  EPA director
[3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:04.480]  on the 18th made a statement
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:06.480]  that the air
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:08.480]  was safe to breathe.
[3:07:08.480 --> 3:07:10.480]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11
[3:07:10.480 --> 3:07:12.480]  Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:07:12.480 --> 3:07:14.480]  take action against their global masters.
[3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:16.480]  He had his hand over the radio
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:18.480]  while he was getting the countdown.
[3:07:18.480 --> 3:07:20.480]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one
[3:07:20.480 --> 3:07:22.480]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:24.480]  This is an emergency
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:26.480]  transmission worldwide.

[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:40.480]  they're going to commit more acts
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:42.480]  and bring in martial law.

[3:08:10.480 --> 3:08:12.480]  with Richard C. Hoagland.
[3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:14.480]  Really thankful for him being with us.
[3:08:14.480 --> 3:08:16.480]  DarkMission.net
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:18.480]  is the website of the book.
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:20.480]  Consultant of NASA
[3:08:20.480 --> 3:08:22.480]  curator of a major museum
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:24.480]  helped design the gold tablet
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:26.480]  message to the stars
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:28.480]  sent out on one of the more famous spacecraft
[3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:30.480]  worked with
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:32.480]  CBS News and Walter Cronkite
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:34.480]  and now the biggest whistleblower
[3:08:34.480 --> 3:08:36.480]  out there on NASA corruption
[3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:38.480]  and so much what I already talked about 15 years ago
[3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:40.480]  has now come out.
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:42.480]  That's what blows me away
[3:08:42.480 --> 3:08:44.480]  because I try to just focus in on what I can prove
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:46.480]  and reading his books
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:48.480]  so much of it I can prove and that's what scares me.
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:50.480]  Mind Control
[3:08:50.480 --> 3:08:52.480]  You were finishing up with Mind Control
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:54.480]  so you're out at this event, you bring up cover-ups
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:08:56.480]  of things on the moon
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:08:58.480]  literally bulls up against you, shoves you up
[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:00.480]  against a wall, his wife's some
[3:09:00.480 --> 3:09:02.480]  government physician
[3:09:02.480 --> 3:09:04.480]  that works with the astronauts, finish that up
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:06.480]  and then I want to get into these
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:08.480]  official videos they've shown on the news
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:10.480]  from the space shuttle
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:12.480]  with these craft flying around
[3:09:12.480 --> 3:09:14.480]  and Richard
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:16.480]  again we don't talk about little green men here
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:18.480]  these are official government footage
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:20.480]  and Hoagland
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:22.480]  believes it's all
[3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:24.480]  part of a larger government program
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:26.480]  get back to the Mind Control first, sir.
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:28.480]  Well, we were having this dinner one night
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:30.480]  and you know, basically
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:32.480]  when you go into a new town
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:34.480]  you meet new people, your host
[3:09:34.480 --> 3:09:36.480]  and we were staying there and all that
[3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:38.480]  it was very social and very protocol
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:40.480]  and all that
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:42.480]  they did not know yet what I was going to talk about
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:44.480]  so it was kind of
[3:09:44.480 --> 3:09:46.480]  you're a friend, you're a friend of a friend of ours
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:48.480]  you're going to do this thing for the school
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:50.480]  the next couple of days
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:52.480]  and so I would just start
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:54.480]  and you know, what are you doing here
[3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:56.480]  and what you used to do
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:09:58.480]  and what did you do and I discovered
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:00.480]  that his wife
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:02.480]  this intel agent's wife, CIA guy,
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:04.480]  was a doctor, medical doctor
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:06.480]  and that she had been part
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:08.480]  of the team debriefing
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:10.480]  in the quarantine the astronauts
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:12.480]  coming back from the moon
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:14.480]  and
[3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:16.480]  I'm trying to be very diplomatic
[3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:18.480]  and not give away what I'm going to talk about the next day
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:20.480]  well, the next day
[3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:22.480]  when I laid my bombshell on everybody
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:24.480]  that we found structures on the moon
[3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:26.480]  from the Apollo program and the other programs
[3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:28.480]  and showed the photographs
[3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:30.480]  the reaction was so bizarre
[3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:32.480]  because not only was I
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:34.480]  slammed up against the wall by this guy
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:36.480]  and basically threatened
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:38.480]  but his wife never
[3:10:38.480 --> 3:10:40.480]  would come to the conference
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:42.480]  she orbited around
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:44.480]  she would go to a coffee shop down the street
[3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:46.480]  and have coffee or she would go to the supermarket
[3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:48.480]  or she would go and
[3:10:48.480 --> 3:10:50.480]  back to the house but she would never came to the hold
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:52.480]  two or three days, she never came
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:54.480]  to the conference. One of my
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:56.480]  associates
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:10:58.480]  who had kind of gotten friendly with her
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:00.480]  because I was there with several other people
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:02.480]  kind of got her aside at one point
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:04.480]  and was asking her some questions
[3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:06.480]  and it turns out that even though she
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:08.480]  remembered that she had been part of the team
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:10.480]  to debrief the astronauts
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:12.480]  she couldn't remember a thing
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:14.480]  that they said
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:16.480]  she couldn't remember why
[3:11:16.480 --> 3:11:18.480]  she no longer was working with NASA
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:20.480]  she couldn't remember
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:22.480]  her memory lapses were enormous
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:24.480]  and I don't think they were feigned
[3:11:24.480 --> 3:11:26.480]  because we now found the same pattern
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:28.480]  in all the flight crews
[3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:30.480]  starting with Ed Mitchell
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:32.480]  Ed Mitchell when he and I
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:34.480]  did the debate with Art
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:36.480]  some years ago, live coast to coast
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:38.480]  admitted freely
[3:11:38.480 --> 3:11:40.480]  that he was very troubled when he came back
[3:11:40.480 --> 3:11:42.480]  to Earth after Apollo 14
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:44.480]  and a young kid at one of these school events
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:46.480]  because they all did school events
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:48.480]  excited the next generation
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:50.480]  one of the kids asked him, what did he feel like
[3:11:50.480 --> 3:11:52.480]  Dr. Mitchell to walk on the moon
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:54.480]  and he realized he admitted
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:11:56.480]  in his own book, The Way of the Explorer
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:11:58.480]  Ed Mitchell's book
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:00.480]  and he admitted again on the air with Art
[3:12:00.480 --> 3:12:02.480]  and me that night that what troubled him
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:04.480]  immensely is he could not remember
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:06.480]  what it
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:08.480]  felt like
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:10.480]  to walk on the moon
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:12.480]  now Ed is a very emotional guy
[3:12:12.480 --> 3:12:14.480]  he's a scientist
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:16.480]  but he's one of the more emotional
[3:12:16.480 --> 3:12:18.480]  he's not repressing his emotions
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:20.480]  so for him not to remember
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:22.480]  the emotions
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:24.480]  really bothered him and it got so bad
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:26.480]  that he actually went to a therapist
[3:12:26.480 --> 3:12:28.480]  to try to have post-apnotic regression
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:30.480]  to see why it was he couldn't remember
[3:12:30.480 --> 3:12:32.480]  the feelings
[3:12:32.480 --> 3:12:34.480]  he remembered the mission plan
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:36.480]  we did this, we did that
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:38.480]  station A, station B
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:40.480]  we tried to turn this on
[3:12:40.480 --> 3:12:42.480]  to remember the emotions
[3:12:42.480 --> 3:12:44.480]  and when he got in the therapy session
[3:12:44.480 --> 3:12:46.480]  it turned out that there was a block
[3:12:46.480 --> 3:12:48.480]  so big
[3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:50.480]  that he literally could not
[3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:52.480]  be regressed through it
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:54.480]  he could not penetrate the block
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:56.480]  he would say things like oh that's not important
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:12:58.480]  I don't need to know that
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:00.480]  so this is one clue
[3:13:00.480 --> 3:13:02.480]  the major clue I had that the astronauts
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:04.480]  probably when they look into the camera
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:06.480]  and they say there's nothing there
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:08.480]  they say that Hogan's nuts or whatever
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:10.480]  from their perspective the truth
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:12.480]  because the awful truth Alex is
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:14.480]  they have been brainwashed
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:16.480]  they have been mind controlled
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:18.480]  they have had a technology
[3:13:18.480 --> 3:13:20.480]  a very sophisticated technology
[3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:22.480]  which took away the real
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:24.480]  missions that they experienced
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:26.480]  now we have had a few of the astronauts
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:28.480]  come out and say that they did see craft
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:30.480]  on the moon, around the moon and around the air
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:32.480]  those are lies, those are lies, that's more digression
[3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:34.480]  that's more disinformation
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:36.480]  that's absolutely not true
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:38.480]  they saw there were structures
[3:13:38.480 --> 3:13:40.480]  what they saw there was technology
[3:13:40.480 --> 3:13:42.480]  they were sent there
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:44.480]  the mission of Apollo I believe
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:46.480]  and we lay this out in dark mission
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:48.480]  was to bring back technology
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:50.480]  that the in-crowd
[3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:52.480]  the controllers, whoever they are
[3:13:52.480 --> 3:13:54.480]  the people behind NASA
[3:13:54.480 --> 3:13:56.480]  want desperately from the 1960s
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:58.480]  let me stop you right there
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:00.480]  because in the second interview I want to spend two hours
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:02.480]  on that but here's what I have to say about the issue
[3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:04.480]  you mentioned during the last segment
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:06.480]  we had behind the scenes for president planet.tv viewers
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:08.480]  and folks on the info wars.com streams
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:10.480]  and I've seen those footage
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:12.480]  I remember back in the 90s or whenever it was
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:14.480]  seeing it on the news
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:16.480]  and NASA released and why would they release it
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:18.480]  footage
[3:14:18.480 --> 3:14:20.480]  which shows
[3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:22.480]  get into that now
[3:14:22.480 --> 3:14:24.480]  and then you told me that you believe that that is
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:26.480]  human, terrestrial
[3:14:26.480 --> 3:14:28.480]  it's our craft, it's our spacecraft
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:30.480]  regardless
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:32.480]  we have to talk about that
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:34.480]  on the tape and laser shooting up
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  I mean it's crazy
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:38.480]  well it's not laser, it looks like particle beams
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:40.480]  or some kind of test
[3:14:40.480 --> 3:14:42.480]  where the objective of the test is
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:44.480]  directed energy weapons
[3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:46.480]  directed energy and
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:48.480]  I mean just go ahead and get into that for me
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:50.480]  well the spacecraft whatever it is
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:52.480]  nimbly dances out of the way
[3:14:52.480 --> 3:14:54.480]  I mean this is a technology which can control gravity
[3:14:54.480 --> 3:14:56.480]  controls inertia
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:14:58.480]  does not use something
[3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:00.480]  primitive as rock
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:02.480]  particle beams, huge ones
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:04.480]  firing at things that are
[3:15:04.480 --> 3:15:06.480]  200,000 Gs
[3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:08.480]  I mean go over that
[3:15:08.480 --> 3:15:10.480]  well because I think it's part of a test
[3:15:10.480 --> 3:15:12.480]  for
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:14.480]  if there are bad guys out there
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:16.480]  or maybe they're doing preparations
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:18.480]  for factions
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:20.480]  maybe looking at more than one faction
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:22.480]  remember these groups tend to fragment
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:24.480]  they fractally fragment
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:26.480]  so that you have wars
[3:15:26.480 --> 3:15:28.480]  within wars within wars
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:30.480]  but why would NASA
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:32.480]  release that footage
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:34.480]  well remember you've got
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:36.480]  all the good guys in NASA
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:38.480]  and then you've got a few who are not good guys
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:40.480]  the good guys don't know
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:42.480]  that there's something to keep secret
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:44.480]  they remember the lies different than whatever
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:46.480]  they believe the lies they've been told
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:48.480]  so when you set up a structure, an institution
[3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:50.480]  which is supposed to be open and above board
[3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:52.480]  and it's supposed to present live TV
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:54.480]  of the shuttle missions
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:56.480]  they present live TV
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:15:58.480]  so scholars can't say oh well
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:00.480]  you can broadcast this but you can't broadcast that
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:02.480]  because the honest guys will then say
[3:16:02.480 --> 3:16:04.480]  why can't we rush our stuff?
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:06.480]  so people always say if this was happening
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:08.480]  it would come out and it is
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:10.480]  coming out well I mean I agree with you
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:12.480]  when you've got the Catholic Church saying
[3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:14.480]  we need to love the aliens they're our brothers
[3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:16.480]  when you've got every major denomination saying it
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:18.480]  when you've got all the movies
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:20.480]  and you've got
[3:16:20.480 --> 3:16:22.480]  in the 80's huge
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:24.480]  programs at the Olympics with aliens landing
[3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:26.480]  fake aliens and you've got huge things
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:28.480]  the size of three football fields
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:30.480]  floating over Dallas
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:32.480]  and stuff all over the place
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:34.480]  something's going on
[3:16:34.480 --> 3:16:36.480]  and then our government documents about fake
[3:16:36.480 --> 3:16:38.480]  extraterrestrial landings
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:40.480]  you know any of this why
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:42.480]  I mean you believe it's fake
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:44.480]  remember Operation Northwoods
[3:16:44.480 --> 3:16:46.480]  yes okay or
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:48.480]  we can go to the you know September 11th
[3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:50.480]  governments do
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:52.480]  huge big things to sway
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:54.480]  populations at key
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:16:56.480]  nodal points in history they love hoaxes
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:16:58.480]  yeah well they they manufacture
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:00.480]  history is what it is
[3:17:00.480 --> 3:17:02.480]  we are building I mean all my UFO
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:04.480]  friends I need to
[3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:06.480]  shake them because they're so
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:08.480]  frankly they're extremely naive
[3:17:08.480 --> 3:17:10.480]  Alex they really believe
[3:17:10.480 --> 3:17:12.480]  we're building toward disclosure
[3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:14.480]  I believe we're building
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:16.480]  toward a mass carefully
[3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:18.480]  manufactured
[3:17:18.480 --> 3:17:20.480]  fake event where
[3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:22.480]  ETS who are really human
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:24.480]  who are really part of this secret
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:26.480]  clique who are probably Nazis
[3:17:26.480 --> 3:17:28.480]  you know who develop a perfect
[3:17:28.480 --> 3:17:30.480]  their technology from World War II
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:32.480]  which is why you gotta get you know
[3:17:32.480 --> 3:17:34.480]  Joseph on they are
[3:17:34.480 --> 3:17:36.480]  going to basically fake out
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:38.480]  the world well the now that's been
[3:17:38.480 --> 3:17:40.480]  declassified the Nazis already had a bombs
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:42.480]  right they call them radiation weapons
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:44.480]  they already had broken the sound barrier
[3:17:44.480 --> 3:17:46.480]  barrels research and the reason he's got
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:48.480]  access to this documentation
[3:17:48.480 --> 3:17:50.480]  is that when the when east
[3:17:50.480 --> 3:17:52.480]  and west Germany reunited after
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:54.480]  the wall fell a huge
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:56.480]  number of documents from
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:17:58.480]  the Polish secret
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:18:00.480]  service came out
[3:18:00.480 --> 3:18:02.480]  and in in German of course which they
[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:04.480]  had perloined and taken back
[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:06.480]  after World War II was part of their
[3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:08.480]  their spoils from the war
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:10.480]  they have been declassified
[3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:12.480]  and there's an incredible
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:14.480]  window on
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:16.480]  the Nazi black ops
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:18.480]  program the compartmentalized
[3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:20.480]  incredible high technology
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:22.480]  efforts that were being funded by the
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:24.480]  Nazi war machine particularly toward
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:26.480]  the end of the war in a desperate effort to win the war
[3:18:26.480 --> 3:18:28.480]  and they fastened their hopes on
[3:18:28.480 --> 3:18:30.480]  several key technologies
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:32.480]  some of which
[3:18:32.480 --> 3:18:34.480]  appear to be the control
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:36.480]  of gravity itself
[3:18:36.480 --> 3:18:38.480]  which again is a
[3:18:38.480 --> 3:18:40.480]  separate piece of data from my
[3:18:40.480 --> 3:18:42.480]  work which came at this from a
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:44.480]  hyper dimensional perspective I mean we
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:46.480]  know there's a lot of suppressed technology I mean
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:48.480]  20 years after the B2 bomber
[3:18:48.480 --> 3:18:50.480]  was already in service they declassified
[3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:52.480]  so we have a lot of cases
[3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:54.480]  of that we know there's a whole shadow government
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:56.480]  many technology and physics
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:58.480]  Alex that would make anything you think you
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:00.480]  know like a candle flame compared to
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:02.480]  hydrogen bomb this is a
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:04.480]  physics that literally allows you to rearrange
[3:19:04.480 --> 3:19:06.480]  time well here's an example
[3:19:06.480 --> 3:19:08.480]  I mean
[3:19:08.480 --> 3:19:10.480]  three years ago the Air Force General
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:12.480]  had a press conference have a Cisco Chronicle
[3:19:12.480 --> 3:19:14.480]  picked it up then they came out and said
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:16.480]  forget that information admitted they have any
[3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:18.480]  matter weapons I mean is that
[3:19:18.480 --> 3:19:20.480]  those pale decide what
[3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:22.480]  I'm talking about which is
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:24.480]  torsion field physics
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:26.480]  which is another whole program
[3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:28.480]  yeah well final segment Richard
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:30.480]  see Hogan when we come back I want to talk about
[3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:32.480]  what we know about this giant
[3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:34.480]  shadow reality I mean imagine
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:36.480]  the elites they get to know the reality
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:38.480]  know what's going on we're down here
[3:19:38.480 --> 3:19:40.480]  caring about Angelina Jolie and Brad
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:42.480]  Pitt and
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:44.480]  what they're trying to build what their end game is
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:46.480]  Jim Newcomer from Midas July 2
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:48.480]  2008 gold opened at 937
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:50.480]  an ounce gold coins can be purchased
[3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:52.480]  for at 96390 474
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:54.480]  70 for half ounce or 237
[3:19:54.480 --> 3:19:56.480]  35 for quarter ounce that's
[3:19:56.480 --> 3:19:58.480]  96390 474
[3:19:58.480 --> 3:20:00.480]  70 237 35
[3:20:00.480 --> 3:20:02.480]  I just found it's caught in the
[3:20:02.480 --> 3:20:04.480]  malaise of mortgage bankruptcies the bond market continues
[3:20:04.480 --> 3:20:06.480]  to slump JP Morgan gets caught
[3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:08.480]  in a 10 billion bad deal for Chrysler
[3:20:08.480 --> 3:20:10.480]  housing sales fell 6.6%
[3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:12.480]  mortgage giant countrywide showed
[3:20:12.480 --> 3:20:14.480]  mortgage payment woes spreading to the
[3:20:14.480 --> 3:20:16.480]  middle of an opera class investors cast
[3:20:16.480 --> 3:20:18.480]  out on investment banks credit protection
[3:20:18.480 --> 3:20:20.480]  insurance for mortgage lenders and skyrocketing
[3:20:20.480 --> 3:20:22.480]  due to the increased risk the US
[3:20:22.480 --> 3:20:24.480]  dollars free falling against foreign
[3:20:24.480 --> 3:20:26.480]  currencies and countries that previously
[3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:28.480]  financed the US are now seeking safer
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:30.480]  alternatives economists really boy published
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:32.480]  the report bubble leaking call for
[3:20:32.480 --> 3:20:34.480]  the report today 800 686
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:36.480]  2237 the value of your
[3:20:36.480 --> 3:20:38.480]  hard-earned money is being lost in a global
[3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:40.480]  game of chess call 800 686
[3:20:40.480 --> 3:20:42.480]  2237 that's 800
[3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:44.480]  686 2237
[3:20:44.480 --> 3:20:46.480]  it is a big idea
[3:20:46.480 --> 3:20:48.480]  a new world order
[3:20:48.480 --> 3:20:50.480]  in the near future
[3:20:50.480 --> 3:20:52.480]  earth is dominated by a powerful
[3:20:52.480 --> 3:20:54.480]  world government it's known as
[3:20:54.480 --> 3:20:56.480]  the builder bird
[3:20:56.480 --> 3:20:58.480]  could their objective be world
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:00.480]  domination or thousands of years
[3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:02.480]  their dark order grew
[3:21:02.480 --> 3:21:04.480]  now as they hail the birth
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:06.480]  of the new world order their great
[3:21:06.480 --> 3:21:08.480]  dream of exterminating 80%
[3:21:08.480 --> 3:21:10.480]  of humanity is at hand
[3:21:12.480 --> 3:21:14.480]  for the first time in history
[3:21:14.480 --> 3:21:16.480]  the elites plan for world
[3:21:16.480 --> 3:21:18.480]  government is blown wide open
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:20.480]  you will learn the secret that drives
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:22.480]  the entire new world order agenda
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:24.480]  the little bird is making great progress
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:26.480]  for the world government most people have no idea
[3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:28.480]  they're not after money they have all the money they need
[3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:30.480]  they're after power yes they're after these

[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:44.480]  and sleep you have been warned
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:46.480]  when I learned that the accumulation
[3:21:46.480 --> 3:21:48.480]  of acidic waste was the likely cause
[3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:50.480]  of my painful joints lack of energy
[3:21:50.480 --> 3:21:52.480]  and weight gain I knew I would have to change
[3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:54.480]  to a more alkaline diet but it just seems
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:21:56.480]  so difficult then a friend suggested
[3:21:56.480 --> 3:21:58.480]  I try a Jupiter water ionizer from
[3:21:58.480 --> 3:22:00.480]  SnyderHealth.com and detox
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:02.480]  my body even before I changed my diet
[3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:04.480]  by drinking alkaline ionized water
[3:22:04.480 --> 3:22:06.480]  drinking water now that's
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:08.480]  something I can handle the guys at
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:10.480]  SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the
[3:22:10.480 --> 3:22:12.480]  different options and helped me choose the ionizer
[3:22:12.480 --> 3:22:14.480]  that was right for me I use my new Jupiter ionizer
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:16.480]  for everything for drinking
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:18.480]  for cooking and since I've been drinking the water
[3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:20.480]  I have more energy my joint
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:22.480]  pains are gone and I already lost
[3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:24.480]  seven pounds and my skin
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:26.480]  looks great give them a call today
[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:30.480]  at 877-356-2508
[3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:32.480]  to find out which ionizer is right for you
[3:22:32.480 --> 3:22:34.480]  they offer a full 30-day money back guarantee
[3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:36.480]  and free shipping so there's absolutely
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:38.480]  no risk you can visit them on the web
[3:22:38.480 --> 3:22:40.480]  at SnyderHealth.com
[3:22:40.480 --> 3:22:58.480]  you ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:23:10.480 --> 3:23:12.480]  so I can travel the world and still be here
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:40.480]  for my day tonight with Rachel
[3:23:40.480 --> 3:23:42.480]  and I'll see you in the next video
[3:23:42.480 --> 3:24:10.480]  thanks for watching
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:20.480]  I'll see you in the next video
[3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:46.480]  I want to teach people things I want to learn things
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:48.480]  I want to show people things
[3:24:48.480 --> 3:24:50.480]  I guess they love hoarding all the secret knowledge
[3:24:50.480 --> 3:24:52.480]  because it gives them the power
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:54.480]  but that's what Ray Kurzweil and all these
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:56.480]  futurists say and then transhumanists
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:24:58.480]  they say that they get to be the future
[3:24:58.480 --> 3:25:00.480]  and basically we don't
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:02.480]  because the elite's going to go forward into the future
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:04.480]  and the population isn't we're going to be
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:06.480]  reduced down to nothing
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:08.480]  the useless eaters
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:10.480]  the big picture Richard C. Hoagland
[3:25:10.480 --> 3:25:12.480]  well obviously this has been
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:14.480]  on my mind from the beginning
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:16.480]  when I started putting the dots together
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:18.480]  and realized there were two separate realities
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:20.480]  actually more than two but
[3:25:20.480 --> 3:25:22.480]  two were basically
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:24.480]  suffice for now
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:26.480]  and I've been trying to back engineer
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:28.480]  what's the end game
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:30.480]  what's the big picture
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:32.480]  well one big picture is
[3:25:32.480 --> 3:25:34.480]  that the human race is much older
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:36.480]  and more extraordinary
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:38.480]  but anyone who's ever been allowed to believe
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:40.480]  certainly in modern times
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:42.480]  if you go to ancient texts
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:44.480]  ancient wisdom
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:46.480]  ancient documents, ancient sacred writings
[3:25:46.480 --> 3:25:48.480]  you find ample evidence
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:50.480]  that the human race is
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:52.480]  millions and millions and millions of years old
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:54.480]  and that we used to have an incredibly fabulous
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:25:56.480]  high tech civilization
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:25:58.480]  that allowed human beings to live like gods
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:00.480]  and then something
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:02.480]  happened the fall
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:04.480]  as we term it in the western
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:06.480]  idiom you know Genesis
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:08.480]  and now we're basically living almost at
[3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:10.480]  a sustenance level
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:12.480]  we're being told now that we have
[3:26:12.480 --> 3:26:14.480]  to in the face of extraordinary physical
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:16.480]  crises of energy
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:18.480]  the lifeblood of civilization
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:20.480]  without which everybody becomes
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:22.480]  poor or dead quickly
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:24.480]  we're told we have to drill
[3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.480]  for something which is ridiculous
[3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:28.480]  and primitive is oil when they have
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:30.480]  plenty of advanced technologies
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:32.480]  incredible advanced technology
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:34.480]  the end game one of the end games
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:36.480]  is if you control people
[3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:38.480]  sustenance if you control the
[3:26:38.480 --> 3:26:40.480]  energy in which they live the resources
[3:26:40.480 --> 3:26:42.480]  which they utilize
[3:26:42.480 --> 3:26:44.480]  and the information under which they
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:46.480]  operate you control them
[3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:48.480]  totally so one of the games
[3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:50.480]  and that's it we're inside a bottle
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:52.480]  we're inside a matrix
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:54.480]  not an electronic matrix but
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:56.480]  garbage being fed into our cerebral
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:26:58.480]  cortexes and well listen
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:00.480]  I could tell you is that that's what all
[3:27:00.480 --> 3:27:02.480]  this fits into
[3:27:02.480 --> 3:27:04.480]  and that's what my instincts and all of my larger
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:06.480]  knowledge tells me is that if you look at humans
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:08.480]  we don't act or behave
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:10.480]  like anything we see
[3:27:10.480 --> 3:27:12.480]  Taren to say we're connected to monkeys
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:14.480]  and chimpanzees all the rest of it's a total
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:16.480]  joke and then you do look at Mars
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:18.480]  and all the legends and the rest of it it didn't
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:20.480]  Martians folks it's it's us
[3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:22.480]  I mean is that what you're saying
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:24.480]  that's what I'm saying now you have
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:26.480]  titled your one of your websites
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:28.480]  prison planet
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:30.480]  myself how it was Alex
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:32.480]  figure out but he realizes no that's it
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:34.480]  we're in a false reality I just don't know
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:36.480]  what it is I know they're building camps
[3:27:36.480 --> 3:27:38.480]  I know they're poisoning us dumbing us down
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:40.480]  genetic engineering us down
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:42.480]  that's all admitted and I'm trying to branch
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:44.480]  out now at least a people thinking
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:46.480]  about the next level because all my
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:48.480]  instincts tell me there's there's just
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:50.480]  unbelievable fabulous things being hidden from
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:52.480]  us okay number two
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:54.480]  if you get that they're keeping all the good
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:56.480]  stuff for themselves
[3:27:56.480 --> 3:27:58.480]  the reason is that if we got access to the good stuff
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:00.480]  if we got access to the technology
[3:28:00.480 --> 3:28:02.480]  the energy
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:04.480]  you know we wouldn't be worried about four
[3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:06.480]  dollar five dollar gallon gas or ten dollar
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:08.480]  gallon gas we would
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:10.480]  we would live like people are supposed to live
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:12.480]  all six billion of us
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:14.480]  who could live lightly on the earth Alex
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:16.480]  with this technology
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:18.480]  longer and live longer
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:20.480]  absolutely and better and
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:22.480]  you know you could live to two three
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:24.480]  hundred and have the have the virility
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:26.480]  of your twenties and thirties
[3:28:26.480 --> 3:28:28.480]  there's extraordinary medical breakthroughs
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:30.480]  there's extraordinary physics breakthroughs
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:32.480]  technology breakthroughs energy
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:34.480]  it's all been kept away
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:36.480]  because they are supposed
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:38.480]  to have it and we're not so we're
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:40.480]  aware of that that dichotomy come
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:42.480]  from and by the way folks don't roll your eyes
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:44.480]  at all this we know they're lying and suppressing
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:46.480]  we're just trying to find out what it is think
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:48.480]  about it we're already on a planet hurtling
[3:28:48.480 --> 3:28:50.480]  through space all these wonders
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:52.480]  around you and you've been taught it's
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:28:54.480]  a bizarre to question and that's because
[3:28:54.480 --> 3:28:56.480]  there's so many cooks in the
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:28:58.480]  alternative movement
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:00.480]  who do talk about ridiculous you know Hollywood
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:02.480]  style green men instead
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.480]  of really looking at the shadow government
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:06.480]  and all these crazy secret societies that are
[3:29:06.480 --> 3:29:08.480]  admittedly running NASA
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:10.480]  and the shadow government okay is different
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:12.480]  at every level the lies
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:14.480]  different every level and we're trying to expand
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  that and break through those different
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:18.480]  levels okay Richard C.

[3:32:04.480 --> 3:32:06.480]  the day that we stop asking questions
[3:32:06.480 --> 3:32:08.480]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds
[3:32:08.480 --> 3:32:10.480]  of despotism to grow at our own door
[3:32:10.480 --> 3:32:12.480]  seven years after the
[3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:14.480]  attacks of September 11
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:16.480]  a global awakening has taken place
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:18.480]  an inside job
[3:32:18.480 --> 3:32:20.480]  how dare you
[3:32:20.480 --> 3:32:22.480]  if you know that there's
[3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:24.480]  treason going on you can be held

[3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:42.480]  at infowars.com it's now time
[3:32:42.480 --> 3:32:44.480]  to take the revolution to the next level
[3:32:44.480 --> 3:32:46.480]  George Martin
[3:32:46.480 --> 3:32:48.480]  was the co-captain of the New York Giants
[3:32:48.480 --> 3:32:50.480]  and laid big blue to a Super Bowl victory
[3:32:50.480 --> 3:32:52.480]  today he accomplished another amazing feat
[3:32:52.480 --> 3:32:54.480]  finishing a walk all the way across the country
[3:32:54.480 --> 3:32:56.480]  to raise money for the forgotten heroes
[3:32:56.480 --> 3:32:58.480]  of 9-11
[3:32:58.480 --> 3:33:00.480]  heroes coming all shapes and sizes
[3:33:00.480 --> 3:33:02.480]  in statue George Martin's one of the larger ones
[3:33:02.480 --> 3:33:04.480]  but in his mind he shattered
[3:33:04.480 --> 3:33:06.480]  by the ones that ran towards the towers
[3:33:06.480 --> 3:33:08.480]  that day in September
[3:33:08.480 --> 3:33:10.480]  and that's why he walks now in June
[3:33:10.480 --> 3:33:12.480]  to me the mental part of it
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:14.480]  was more difficult than the physical aspect of it
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:16.480]  I think the cost of my athletic ability
[3:33:16.480 --> 3:33:18.480]  it made it a little bit easier but the mental
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:20.480]  challenge of doing this repetitively day in and day out
[3:33:20.480 --> 3:33:22.480]  that was the real grind
[3:33:22.480 --> 3:33:24.480]  3000 miles, 10 months, 24 pairs of shoes
[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:26.480]  and 80 sets of socks later
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:28.480]  he arrives in San Diego the hard way
[3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:30.480]  via the highway for Manhattan
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:32.480]  met by fireman Cops
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:34.480]  and his NFL brother
[3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:38.480]  George endured a lot during his trek
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:40.480]  which averaged 22 miles a day
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:42.480]  he dropped 40 pounds
[3:33:42.480 --> 3:33:44.480]  but also raised 2 million dollars
[3:33:44.480 --> 3:33:46.480]  for folks with health related problems
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:48.480]  linked to 9-11
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:50.480]  a journey to be sure of mind, body
[3:33:50.480 --> 3:33:52.480]  and soul
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:54.480]  I would encourage everyone who has moved
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:56.480]  by what they're experiencing today
[3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:02.480]  to make their presence known as well
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:04.480]  what a great guy
[3:34:04.480 --> 3:34:06.480]  not being self-centered
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:08.480]  thinking about other people
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:10.480]  walking across the country raising more than 2 million dollars
[3:34:10.480 --> 3:34:12.480]  a journey
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:14.480]  for 9-11.info
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:16.480]  and it all goes
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:18.480]  to the first responders
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:20.480]  2 million in 2031
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:22.480]  has already been raised
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:24.480]  can also call
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:26.480]  1-800-889-8038
[3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:28.480]  and give
[3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:30.480]  for the fireman, the police
[3:34:30.480 --> 3:34:32.480]  the other emergency workers that were there
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:34.480]  let's go ahead and go
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:36.480]  to our guest
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:38.480]  a lot of folks already know who he is
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:40.480]  because they're fans of the Giants
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:42.480]  and of course played with the Giants
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:44.480]  top player
[3:34:44.480 --> 3:34:46.480]  Mr. Martin it is great to have you on with us
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:48.480]  well thank you very much
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:50.480]  and please copy George
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:52.480]  George how did you first
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:54.480]  learn about the plight
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:56.480]  of the first responders from the deadly dust
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:34:58.480]  and how did this form in your mind
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:00.480]  how did this end up developing and happening
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:02.480]  well first of all
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:04.480]  I played all 14 of my NFL seasons
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:06.480]  right here in New York
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:08.480]  and I certainly consider myself a transplant
[3:35:08.480 --> 3:35:10.480]  of New Yorker so
[3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:12.480]  the event of 9-11 by and large
[3:35:12.480 --> 3:35:14.480]  took place right here in our backyard
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:16.480]  and when I witnessed the event
[3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:18.480]  and I go back in my mind's eye
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:20.480]  and I see that catastrophe unfolding
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:22.480]  which is rushing away from that catastrophe
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:24.480]  but I also see a small group
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:26.480]  of people who are actually running towards it
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:28.480]  and that always had a profound impact on me
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:30.480]  and when I
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:32.480]  found out later that post 9-11
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:34.480]  that because of their exposure to the toxic cloud
[3:35:34.480 --> 3:35:36.480]  down at
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:38.480]  ground zero
[3:35:38.480 --> 3:35:40.480]  that some of them had become ill
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:42.480]  and eventually some of them had died
[3:35:42.480 --> 3:35:44.480]  I decided at that point in time
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:46.480]  to use my celebrity
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:48.480]  for two distinct purposes
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:50.480]  to raise the awareness level
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:52.480]  of the plight of the first responders
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:54.480]  and rescue and recovery workers
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:56.480]  and secondly to raise funds for their medical treatment
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:35:58.480]  and that was the essence of a journey from 9-11
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:02.480]  well
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:04.480]  the way that the EPA knew the dust was deadly
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:06.480]  they said it was safe to breathe
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:08.480]  and then now they've been involved in a huge cover up
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  they gave Christina Todd Whitman
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:12.480]  liability protection a court did
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:14.480]  and then they still won't give them
[3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:16.480]  the health care they need
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:18.480]  and it's only the cost of four or five smart bombs
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:20.480]  just a few hundred million dollars
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:22.480]  to give them all the treatment they need
[3:36:22.480 --> 3:36:24.480]  why won't they give them the treatment
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:26.480]  I don't understand
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:28.480]  well it's perfect to me
[3:36:28.480 --> 3:36:30.480]  particularly when these individuals act
[3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:32.480]  to me rises to the level of being heroic
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:34.480]  and as you said
[3:36:34.480 --> 3:36:36.480]  they put their very health, their career
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:38.480]  their very lives on the line here
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:40.480]  why hasn't the
[3:36:40.480 --> 3:36:42.480]  America and Americans responded in kind
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:44.480]  to these brave men and women
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:46.480]  and it's so
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:48.480]  perfect to me that I think in many regards
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:50.480]  it angered me
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:52.480]  but not to the point where I would do
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:54.480]  what most of the government is doing
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:56.480]  local and state and federal
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:36:58.480]  and that's pointing at you the fingers
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:00.480]  I decided that I would take it upon myself
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:02.480]  to make a difference in these heroes' lives
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  and that's when I decided that I would walk
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:06.480]  across this great country of mine
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  and I have no regrets
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:10.480]  whatsoever
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:12.480]  so instead of just complaining about it
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  I would say and did some good
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:16.480]  in the process raising
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  more than two million dollars
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  explain to us where these funds are going to go now
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:22.480]  or how these are dispensed out
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  and who's getting them
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:26.480]  so other people can give
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:28.480]  because two million dollars is really
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:30.480]  just half of the story here
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:32.480]  the bigger story is
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:34.480]  that with the three participating hospitals
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:36.480]  that we have that are associated
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:38.480]  with the journey from 911
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:40.480]  and they are Mount Sinai
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:42.480]  University Medical Center
[3:37:42.480 --> 3:37:44.480]  and North Shore Long Island Jewish
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:46.480]  each one of those three participating hospitals
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:48.480]  have pledged that for every dollar we raise
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:50.480]  that they are going to contribute
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  an additional dollar of medical services
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  for these first responders
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:56.480]  well that's amazing that's amazing
[3:37:56.480 --> 3:37:58.480]  in fact Mount Sinai
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.480]  five years ago did the CAT scans
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:02.480]  and so they did have horrible lung disease
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:04.480]  and still
[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:06.480]  we have to focus on this because
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  you're doing this great thing to raise two million
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:10.480]  dollars of medical services
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:12.480]  and that will certainly help
[3:38:12.480 --> 3:38:14.480]  hundreds of these people we have over a thousand
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:16.480]  who've died from this
[3:38:16.480 --> 3:38:18.480]  50 something thousand that are sick from it
[3:38:18.480 --> 3:38:20.480]  I mean this could all be
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:22.480]  overnight I mean have the feds
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:24.480]  in all your investigations said why
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:26.480]  they won't give any treatment to these people
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:28.480]  or why the state's been doing that
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:30.480]  well I've not heard any reasons
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:32.480]  or any good reasons why they have not
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:34.480]  and again that kind of angered me because
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:36.480]  when you look at the cost
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:38.480]  that we are spending at this war
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:40.480]  I mean you're right for a fraction
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:42.480]  of what were involved
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:44.480]  in overseas we could take care of this problem
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:46.480]  I think and do it in grand fashion
[3:38:46.480 --> 3:38:48.480]  and I will commend
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:50.480]  some of the local congressman
[3:38:50.480 --> 3:38:52.480]  Carolyn Mahoney
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:54.480]  and some of her colleagues
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:56.480]  invited me to Washington where they did
[3:38:56.480 --> 3:38:58.480]  introduce the 9-11 legislation
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:00.480]  I understand
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:02.480]  that it did get out of committee
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:04.480]  but it has not been signed
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:06.480]  and Carolyn Mahoney did that
[3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:08.480]  and we had cameras there
[3:39:08.480 --> 3:39:10.480]  and that's in the film Truth Rising
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:12.480]  that comes out July 4th and you're right
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:14.480]  but again how could it be
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:16.480]  and then that congressman said
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:18.480]  just forget the first responders
[3:39:18.480 --> 3:39:20.480]  they don't need any money
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  and now he's in a lot of trouble
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  I just understand how the government will use their heroics
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:26.480]  to try to tie it to the war
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:28.480]  and all the things and their policies
[3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:30.480]  taking our liberties but then when it comes time
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:32.480]  to just give them some healthcare
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:34.480]  if they were cynical and evil
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:36.480]  they'd want to take care of them
[3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:38.480]  so they wouldn't look bad it's just like
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  it's just so bizarre
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:42.480]  well I think what it does
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:44.480]  it compounds an already disastrous situation
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  because here you are people who
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:48.480]  did not have healthcare
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:50.480]  or did not have adequate healthcare
[3:39:50.480 --> 3:39:52.480]  or these people who have expired
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:54.480]  the good healthcare that they did have
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:56.480]  these people are really hurting
[3:39:56.480 --> 3:39:58.480]  and when I've met some of these first responders
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:00.480]  who can't walk up a flight of stairs
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.480]  without losing their breath
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:04.480]  having only a quarter of their lung capacity
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:06.480]  many of them are suffering from internal diseases
[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:08.480]  they also have
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:10.480]  a post-traumatic shock syndrome
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:12.480]  I mean this is a
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:14.480]  a travesty and that's why
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:16.480]  I don't understand why it's allowed to continue
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:20.480]  well let's go back to the great work you did
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:22.480]  how did you raise two million plus dollars
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:24.480]  in this walk across the nation
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:26.480]  now that's a great question
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:28.480]  because when you talk about
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:30.480]  marching and resources
[3:40:30.480 --> 3:40:32.480]  and this was really a team effort
[3:40:32.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  there were so many people from
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:36.480]  the corporate side
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:38.480]  from the philanthropist side
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:40.480]  and also from the grassroots side
[3:40:40.480 --> 3:40:42.480]  and I'd like to acknowledge some of those individuals
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:44.480]  and first of all there were two outstanding
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:46.480]  philanthropists here in New York
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:48.480]  by the name of Joe and Carol Rich
[3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  who themselves alone donated and contributed
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:52.480]  $911,000
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:54.480]  for a journey from 911
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:40:56.480]  I mean kudos goes out to those
[3:40:56.480 --> 3:40:58.480]  individuals because that's putting your money
[3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:00.480]  where your mouth is
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:02.480]  and then we had such great corporate support
[3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:04.480]  particularly from my
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:06.480]  company that I work for Act the Equitable
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:08.480]  which is the 14th largest company in the world
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:10.480]  who allowed me to go out on this journey
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:12.480]  for the nine and a half months
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:14.480]  who also was our title
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:16.480]  sponsor because they
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:18.480]  marshaled all their resources among their
[3:41:18.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  their employees, both local
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:22.480]  nationally and local
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:24.480]  and they contributed mightily to this cause
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:26.480]  and of course we had Best Western
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:28.480]  Hotels which was the only hotel chain
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:30.480]  that stepped to the forefront
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:32.480]  as that was our greatest expense going across
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:34.480]  country. Best Western stood up
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:36.480]  as well as Roger Goodell who's the
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:38.480]  commissioner of the National Football League
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:40.480]  John Merrill who's the owner of the
[3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:42.480]  New York Giants as well as
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:44.480]  my good friend Gene Upshaw that at the NFL
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.480]  Players Association all contributed mightily
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:48.480]  to a journey from 911
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:50.480]  Well that's only going to make the world a better
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:52.480]  place and if the feds won't
[3:41:52.480 --> 3:41:54.480]  take our own tax money and help
[3:41:54.480 --> 3:41:56.480]  people that are dying literally
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:41:58.480]  I mean even fire captains
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:00.480]  and fire chiefs are
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:02.480]  dead and dying who were down there breathing
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:04.480]  this and the
[3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:06.480]  police and firemen should think about
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:08.480]  this and politically think
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:10.480]  about the fact that this is the type of
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:12.480]  government you have that won't even give you
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:14.480]  health care than a retired NFL
[3:42:14.480 --> 3:42:16.480]  player has to go out and walk across the country
[3:42:16.480 --> 3:42:18.480]  to try to get a few million dollars
[3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:20.480]  to help but then we see
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:22.480]  that you know being multiplied
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:24.480]  like the Lowe's and Fisher's now and turning
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:26.480]  into four million looking at
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:28.480]  that day 9-11 the 9-11
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:30.480]  commission admitted that
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:32.480]  there were prior warnings that were ignored
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:34.480]  so much that happened and then
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:36.480]  supposedly Saudi Arabians
[3:42:36.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  attack us so we attack Iraq
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:40.480]  I mean what's your larger
[3:42:40.480 --> 3:42:42.480]  view not just of the first responders and the
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:44.480]  tragedy but just of the entire 9-11
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:46.480]  event itself. Well first of all
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:48.480]  I'd like to say this because I think the
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:50.480]  ultimate irony is this here it is
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:52.480]  we've all come to an agreement that
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:54.480]  it's not a matter if
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:42:56.480]  we know that in the future that there's
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:42:58.480]  likely to be another attack on America
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:00.480]  and it's not a matter if it's only
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:02.480]  a matter of when. I did not
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:04.480]  want to give those brave men and women
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:06.480]  who now don the uniform
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  of police, fire and rescue and EMT
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:10.480]  a moment to pause
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:12.480]  because America
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:14.480]  would not stand behind them in their time
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:16.480]  of need and I thought it was important
[3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:18.480]  for someone to stand fast
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  and say well we're going to respond in
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:22.480]  kind the way these brave men and women
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:24.480]  have responded to us. Secondly
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:26.480]  when you look at the nation's economy
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:28.480]  when you look at how gas prices are just
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:30.480]  soaring through the roof, when you look at the
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:32.480]  housing meltdown, when you look at how
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:34.480]  it's costing more for the cost of living
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:36.480]  and with inflation tax on that
[3:43:36.480 --> 3:43:38.480]  here are people who are suffering
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:40.480]  you talk about Americans who are
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:42.480]  paying the ultimate price
[3:43:42.480 --> 3:43:44.480]  it's just
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:46.480]  questionable for me to understand
[3:43:46.480 --> 3:43:48.480]  how we haven't banded together
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:50.480]  as a government to help these people
[3:43:50.480 --> 3:43:52.480]  in their their their greatest
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:43:54.480]  darkest hour.
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:56.480]  Well at least you're stepping up
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:43:58.480]  you know
[3:43:58.480 --> 3:44:00.480]  myself in a group called We Are Change
[3:44:00.480 --> 3:44:02.480]  in New York when we've raised
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:04.480]  pittance compared to what you have about
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:06.480]  $50,000 for the Feel Good Foundation
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:08.480]  and a few other groups in New York
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  we sent thousands
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:12.480]  of gas masks and breathing apparatus
[3:44:12.480 --> 3:44:14.480]  the day after 9-11 we could see that concrete
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:16.480]  and mercury and arsenic
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:18.480]  and the asbestos
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:20.480]  would be bad when the media and the government
[3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:22.480]  were saying it was good for them
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:24.480]  and then it wasn't a problem
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:26.480]  so you know we've tried to do what we could
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:28.480]  and again
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:30.480]  people have got to ask themselves why
[3:44:30.480 --> 3:44:32.480]  could they could end the PR nightmare
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:34.480]  and they could have given them I mean even if the government
[3:44:34.480 --> 3:44:36.480]  was evil the people running it were bad
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:38.480]  they could have still taken care of the police, environment, emergency workers
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:40.480]  and then they wouldn't have this big
[3:44:40.480 --> 3:44:42.480]  nightmare
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:44.480]  this big public relations nightmare
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:46.480]  it just seems like such a
[3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  dumb move
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:50.480]  I mean I would imagine as you were walking
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:52.480]  for 10 months across the country
[3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:54.480]  boy what a way to see America
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:56.480]  that you were probably asking yourself that as you were walking
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:44:58.480]  weren't you?
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:00.480]  Oh absolutely and the thing that
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:02.480]  is ironic to me it's my understanding that there were
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:04.480]  funds that were allocated
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:06.480]  for the first responders and rescue and recovery workers
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:08.480]  but it's been held up
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:10.480]  I think because of the
[3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:12.480]  perceived litigation that's going to come down the pike
[3:45:12.480 --> 3:45:14.480]  because people are denying
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:16.480]  responsibility on the federal level
[3:45:16.480 --> 3:45:18.480]  and the state level
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:20.480]  That's right you just exactly you just answered it
[3:45:20.480 --> 3:45:22.480]  and that's the answer to all of it
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:24.480]  if they give them health care when all the hospitals say
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:26.480]  they're dead and dying and their lungs are full
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:28.480]  and 20% capacity like you said
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:30.480]  if they admit they're sick then there could be liability
[3:45:30.480 --> 3:45:32.480]  so they're just cutting them loose
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:34.480]  Exactly and although
[3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:36.480]  we realize this is a very litigious society
[3:45:36.480 --> 3:45:38.480]  it should not preclude
[3:45:38.480 --> 3:45:40.480]  people from doing what is right
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:42.480]  and it should not preclude the government from stepping up
[3:45:42.480 --> 3:45:44.480]  and fulfilling its obligation
[3:45:44.480 --> 3:45:46.480]  and its responsibility toward its citizens
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:48.480]  I don't feel that that's right
[3:45:48.480 --> 3:45:50.480]  Absolutely tell my listeners in closing
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:52.480]  sir in the few minutes we've got left with you
[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:54.480]  again we're talking a famous
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:45:56.480]  NFL player of course
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:45:58.480]  with the giants
[3:45:58.480 --> 3:46:00.480]  George Martin
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:02.480]  who walked across the entire
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:04.480]  country and raised more than 2 million
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:06.480]  that's been doubled up to 4 million dollars
[3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:08.480]  for first responders
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:10.480]  of the 9-11 deadly dust
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:12.480]  how people can give
[3:46:12.480 --> 3:46:14.480]  and again wear their donations
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:16.480]  how their donations
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:18.480]  I mean as you said it's going
[3:46:18.480 --> 3:46:20.480]  basically to health care at these hospitals
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:22.480]  and then they're going to double the care
[3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:24.480]  and I will share with them a quick story
[3:46:24.480 --> 3:46:26.480]  that always had a profound impact
[3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:28.480]  on me as I was traveling
[3:46:28.480 --> 3:46:30.480]  we were passed by this van
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:32.480]  and this grandmother got out of the van
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:34.480]  with her grandchildren
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:36.480]  four of them were males
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:38.480]  and she lined them up along the road
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:40.480]  and she pointed at us as we were walking toward us
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:42.480]  and she said I want my grandchildren
[3:46:42.480 --> 3:46:44.480]  to witness a part of history
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:46.480]  and I want them to see a real American hero
[3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:48.480]  and I want them to witness the selfless act
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:50.480]  of giving back to the community
[3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:52.480]  she then reached in her purse
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:54.480]  and she was a lady of very meager means
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:56.480]  she contributed
[3:46:56.480 --> 3:46:58.480]  10 of the 14 dollars that she had in her purse
[3:46:58.480 --> 3:47:00.480]  and we were so reluctant to take it
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:02.480]  but we realized that she was teaching her
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:04.480]  grandchildren a very valuable lesson
[3:47:04.480 --> 3:47:06.480]  that was worth more than the 10 dollars
[3:47:06.480 --> 3:47:08.480]  that she had contributed
[3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:10.480]  so for those individuals within the
[3:47:10.480 --> 3:47:12.480]  of our list and voice who would like their presence
[3:47:12.480 --> 3:47:14.480]  to be known and would like to make a difference
[3:47:14.480 --> 3:47:16.480]  in the lives of these heroes
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:18.480]  please go to our website which is
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:20.480]  www.ajourney4for911.info
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:26.480]  or go to our toll free number
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:28.480]  which is
[3:47:28.480 --> 3:47:30.480]  800-889-8038
[3:47:34.480 --> 3:47:36.480]  absolutely and again people think
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:38.480]  oh you can't save the world by giving
[3:47:38.480 --> 3:47:40.480]  when you give the good things like this
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:42.480]  it certainly does have an effect
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:44.480]  it also helps you because it softens your heart
[3:47:44.480 --> 3:47:46.480]  what was the route
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:48.480]  I mean I know you've got a map there
[3:47:48.480 --> 3:47:50.480]  but what was the route that you walked
[3:47:50.480 --> 3:47:52.480]  across the nation
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  well the thing that we wanted to do
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:56.480]  because of the time of the year
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:47:58.480]  we wanted to walk south
[3:47:58.480 --> 3:48:00.480]  so we could avoid any
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:02.480]  inclement weather coming from
[3:48:02.480 --> 3:48:04.480]  so we went south as far as we
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:06.480]  thought was possible so we started
[3:48:06.480 --> 3:48:08.480]  in New York went through New Jersey
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:10.480]  then Pennsylvania down through D.C. Delaware
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:12.480]  and then to Tennessee
[3:48:12.480 --> 3:48:14.480]  we walked across Tennessee
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:16.480]  we went across Arkansas
[3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:18.480]  into the Panhandle of Texas
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:20.480]  then New Mexico on into
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:22.480]  Arizona and eventually
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:24.480]  down into San Diego
[3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:26.480]  13 states including the District
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:28.480]  of Columbia and that was
[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:30.480]  just a marvelous
[3:48:30.480 --> 3:48:32.480]  marvelous excursion
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:34.480]  our first inclination was safety first
[3:48:34.480 --> 3:48:36.480]  and we did the entire 3,000
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:38.480]  3 miles without any incident whatsoever
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:40.480]  what was it like when you finally reached
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:42.480]  the sea there in San Diego
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:44.480]  well it was a moment of relation
[3:48:44.480 --> 3:48:46.480]  as you could probably understand
[3:48:46.480 --> 3:48:48.480]  but it was also a period of mixed emotions
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:50.480]  because here it is
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:52.480]  we had been doing this for nine months
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:54.480]  and it was something that we absolutely
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:56.480]  were thrilled about we did not have
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:58.480]  one single day where we missed
[3:48:58.480 --> 3:49:00.480]  a walking day due to injury
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:02.480]  or any injury
[3:49:02.480 --> 3:49:04.480]  whatsoever
[3:49:04.480 --> 3:49:06.480]  and at the same time we wanted to
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:08.480]  resume our regular lives to get back to
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:10.480]  our families and to get back to
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:12.480]  our standard of living
[3:49:12.480 --> 3:49:14.480]  and it was just so
[3:49:14.480 --> 3:49:16.480]  warm to see how San Diego rolled out
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:18.480]  the red carpet all of the local
[3:49:18.480 --> 3:49:20.480]  heroes there the firemen the police
[3:49:20.480 --> 3:49:22.480]  gave us a grand escort
[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:24.480]  through the city the mayor
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:26.480]  issued a mayoral proclamation
[3:49:26.480 --> 3:49:28.480]  it was just an outstanding experience
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:30.480]  and it was a once in a lifetime
[3:49:30.480 --> 3:49:32.480]  experience and I told them I beg to differ
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:34.480]  I don't think that something like this happens
[3:49:34.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  quite that often
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:38.480]  well I'll say this sir
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  it also exposes the fact
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:42.480]  that they're not getting the treatment they need
[3:49:42.480 --> 3:49:44.480]  not only does it get them some of the treatment
[3:49:44.480 --> 3:49:46.480]  it exposes the fact
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:48.480]  all over the country with a lot of local
[3:49:48.480 --> 3:49:50.480]  newspapers and TV on the way
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:52.480]  getting attention now national attention
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:54.480]  it's just an example
[3:49:54.480 --> 3:49:56.480]  of good people standing up
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:49:58.480]  and getting involved
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:00.480]  in closing how did you come up with the idea
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:02.480]  I mean to do this
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:04.480]  and then put it into motion
[3:50:04.480 --> 3:50:06.480]  well first that's a great question
[3:50:06.480 --> 3:50:08.480]  and to begin with it's a blending
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:10.480]  of two very distinct passions
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:12.480]  that I have first of all
[3:50:12.480 --> 3:50:14.480]  as a country boy growing up in the outbacks
[3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:16.480]  of Greenville, South Carolina
[3:50:16.480 --> 3:50:18.480]  I always had this wonderlust
[3:50:18.480 --> 3:50:20.480]  inherent in me and I always wondered
[3:50:20.480 --> 3:50:22.480]  what was the larger picture of this great America
[3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:24.480]  that we lived in because my exposure
[3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:26.480]  was limited to that little farm that I grew up on
[3:50:26.480 --> 3:50:28.480]  and I always wanted to see
[3:50:28.480 --> 3:50:30.480]  this country up close and personal
[3:50:30.480 --> 3:50:32.480]  I'll tell you one final segment coming up
[3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:34.480]  sir stay there I want to come back and finish up
[3:50:34.480 --> 3:50:36.480]  why you decided to do this
[3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:38.480]  how the idea finally popped into your head
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:40.480]  and how you did it on the other side
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:42.480]  with our guest George Martin
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:47.480]  and we'll be right back
[3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:49.480]  imagine walking down the street
[3:50:49.480 --> 3:50:51.480]  and hearing footsteps behind you
[3:50:51.480 --> 3:50:53.480]  they get closer and closer
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:55.480]  and suddenly you have a sense something bad
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:50:56.480]  is going to happen
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:50:59.480]  what are you going to do to defend yourself

[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:45.480]  Did you know that pH balance
[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:47.480]  is one of the most important factors
[3:52:47.480 --> 3:52:49.480]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[3:52:49.480 --> 3:52:51.480]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[3:52:51.480 --> 3:52:54.480]  should be at a pH level of 9 or higher
[3:52:54.480 --> 3:52:57.480]  plasma pH drops combine a unique formula

[3:53:24.480 --> 3:53:26.480]  disease organisms like bacteria and cancer

[3:54:19.480 --> 3:54:21.480]  and how he put that into action
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:23.480]  which is important you can think about things
[3:54:23.480 --> 3:54:25.480]  or talk about things all day but he took action

[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:29.480]  well yes as a country boy that said
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:32.480]  I've always had this inherent desire to do so
[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:34.480]  but if I ever did it I wanted to have a
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:36.480]  a cause associated with it
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:38.480]  and it took me and my friends a very short time
[3:54:38.480 --> 3:54:40.480]  to come up with
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:42.480]  what we think was the most appropriate cause
[3:54:42.480 --> 3:54:44.480]  and that's a journey for 9-11
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:46.480]  and we are just so delighted to have served
[3:54:46.480 --> 3:54:48.480]  as ambassadors for this wonderful cause
[3:54:48.480 --> 3:54:50.480]  and my dad always told me
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:52.480]  son make sure that you leave this world
[3:54:52.480 --> 3:54:54.480]  a little bit better than you found it
[3:54:54.480 --> 3:54:56.480]  and I hope that through those 3,000 miles
[3:54:56.480 --> 3:54:58.480]  I would attempt to do so
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:00.480]  well I think you've done that
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:02.480]  and again thank you for raising the money
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:04.480]  getting a medical care and drawing attention
[3:55:04.480 --> 3:55:06.480]  to the huge cover up of what's happened
[3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:08.480]  that is unraveling
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:10.480]  thanks people like you George Martin

[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:00.480]  I like to start it a little
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.480]  early knowing that only a fraction of our audience
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:04.480]  is tuned in at any one time
[3:56:04.480 --> 3:56:06.480]  so for the few of you listening now
