[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:19.978]  Well, this is a big Wednesday broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:28.122]  There's been all this news in the UK and the US where they're saying if you hug your child, kiss your child in public,
[00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:31.073]  The police are going to come arrest you.
[00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.835]  You're going to have a license to have children.
[00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:35.056]  All of this is in the U.S.
[00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.438]  government PhD training.
[00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.540]  All of this goes on in the Department of Education.
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.323]  This is in mainline textbooks used at universities everywhere.
[00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.904]  So I thought we'd have Charlotte Isserby on.
[00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:51.409]  Her husband just died a few months ago, and she hadn't been doing any interviews, but she's back doing interviews again.
[00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.752]  And she was number two, Department of Education.
[00:00:57.074 --> 00:00:59.957]  And that, of course, was under Ronald Reagan.
[00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:20.636]  So we'll, for those that want it directly from the source, directly from the horse's mouth, how they're dumbing you down, how they've dumbed multiple generations down, how it's done scientifically, we're also going to line John Taylor Gatto up next week to get more into this, because it's so important and it's so unbelievable when you read the actual quotes.
[00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:22.958]  Well, they say the U.S.
[00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:32.729]  government job, Department of Education, is to destroy the family and break individuals into individual cells so they can be controlled by the state.
[00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.851]  The family is an enemy.
[00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:39.216]  The family belongs to ancient squalor.
[00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:40.738]  The state is civilization.
[00:01:40.738 --> 00:01:42.080]  The family is a disease.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.941]  On and on and on.
[00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.683]  Hundreds and hundreds of quotes and textbooks.
[00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:50.664]  So that's coming up in one hour after I cover all the news.
[00:01:50.664 --> 00:01:53.606]  Then we've never had him on the show before.
[00:01:53.606 --> 00:01:57.668]  Richard C. Hoagland has quite a pedigree.
[00:01:57.668 --> 00:02:03.631]  He, of course, co-hosted shows for many years with Walter Cronkite on CBS News.
[00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.252]  Former NASA consultant to NASA and CBS News anchor.
[00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:08.273]  Richard C. Hoagland.
[00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:17.038]  And, uh, I was in an airport coming back from Bilderberg and I bought his book, New York Times bestseller, Dark Mission, in the airport.
[00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:18.798]  Ended up reading it.
[00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:25.560]  And I have to admit, you know, I would hear Hoagland 10 years ago, 12 years ago, on Art Bell and stuff and just roll my eyes.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.842]  Uh, but reading over the book, so much of it is stuff that I already knew and could prove and had separately learned.
[00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.722]  A lot of it just growing up in Texas.
[00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:54.481]  Having friends, family, you know, that have worked in and around NASA, and it gets into the Masons, it gets into how they put up a flag, the Supreme Council of 33 Southern Jurisdiction, when they were on the moon.
[00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:57.724]  So, I know a lot of what Hoagland talks about can be proven.
[00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:02.580]  A lot of the other stuff gets pretty wild, but now NASA's been caught coloring.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:12.643]  I remember here in Hoagland 10-12 years ago, say it now, NASA's been caught shading the Martian landscape red with a filter, and said, oh, it was an accident.
[00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:18.425]  But really, Mars does have greenish-blue skies, it does have oxygen, it does have ice.
[00:03:18.425 --> 00:03:20.066]  Why are they trying to cover that up?
[00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:23.727]  So, kind of pushing the envelope here for this show.
[00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:28.088]  We always stay focused on what we can prove, but if it gets people thinking, I think it's a healthy thing,
[00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:31.726]  And so Richard C. Hoagland will be joining us for an hour and a half.
[00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:42.836]  We then have that former Giants NFL player coming on, who walked across the country and wore out like 20-something pairs of shoes to raise $2 million for 9-11 first responders.
[00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:45.278]  He's gonna be on with us the last 30 minutes today.
[00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:56.367]  Got another big guest tomorrow that'll be a surprise guest and an even bigger guest next week, but we'll just surprise you with all of that coming up.
[00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:02.919]  After the break, here's some of the news I have.
[00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.120]  Starbucks to close.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.941]  Six hundred U.S.
[00:04:04.941 --> 00:04:06.722]  stores reign in growth.
[00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:08.944]  I'd say that's more than reigning in growth.
[00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:14.127]  Utility workers hired as Stasi informants in Colorado, California, and Arizona.
[00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:17.850]  That's from PrisonPlanet.com out of PCMag.
[00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.012]  I'd already seen this in a Texas paper.
[00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:27.237]  Texas PC repair now requires private investigator license and part of paying to have your computer looked at is
[00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:29.173]  They look at your bills.
[00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:30.854]  They look for illegal gambling.
[00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:33.756]  They look for porn.
[00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:39.180]  Then they file reports to the police.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.762]  I mean, the Stasi weren't this bad.
[00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.684]  So, I thought I'd go over that for you.
[00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.386]  And just a lot more on the war, on the economy.
[00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.288]  It's a big, important transmission.
[00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:53.011]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:54.352]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.484 --> 00:04:57.244]  A New World Order.
[00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:02.145]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:04.966]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:07.747]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:10.927]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:18.249]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:21.277 --> 00:05:26.721]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:30.643]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:35.146]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:37.368]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:38.789]  You have been warned.
[00:05:51.237 --> 00:05:53.680]  Yeah.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.346]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:01.969]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:08.577]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation.

[00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:39.809]  Ask yourself,
[00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.353]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:45.875]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:52.863]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:58.429]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:05.063 --> 00:08:10.586]  Charlotte Isserby, head of policy, number two position under Ronald Reagan, Department of Education.
[00:08:10.586 --> 00:08:21.191]  In 58 minutes from now, Richard C. Hoagland, top consultant at NASA, CBS News correspondent.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:31.244]  And then George Martin, All-American NFL football player, walked across the nation to raise two million dollars for first responders.
[00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:34.545]  He's going to be popping in at the end of the broadcast.
[00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:46.410]  Hoagland should be very interesting, coming up in the, what, third hour into the fourth
[00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:57.185]  Richard C. Hoagland with Science Advisor Walter Cronkite and CBS News and the Apollo Program former current curator at the Hayden Planetarium and consultant to NASA.
[00:08:57.185 --> 00:09:08.891]  He is the co-originator along with Eric Burgess of the British Interplanetary Society of the Pioneer plaque currently carrying a message for mankind on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft.
[00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:10.132]  It goes on and on.
[00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:11.153]  Never had Hoagland on.
[00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:13.694]  He's always saying nice things about me on radio.
[00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:20.636]  And, uh, I finally read his book, Dark Mission.
[00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:22.757]  Pretty interesting stuff, to say the least.
[00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:24.499]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:30.323]  The secret history of NASA in about two hours from now.
[00:09:30.323 --> 00:09:33.986]  And then we have, again, X-Giant ends cross-country walk for 9-11 workers.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.221]  I wonder if he'll be demonized.
[00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:42.702]  Other people that try to raise money for 9-11 workers are shouted down by neocon blogs and called traitors.
[00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:44.663]  And, by the way, I'm not kidding.
[00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:51.625]  Because, see, that's implying something's wrong with them, and our gracious leader, Hare Bush, does not lie.
[00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.066]  He only tells the truth.
[00:09:53.066 --> 00:10:01.449]  He is... I remember hearing a Christian station about six months after 9-11 say that George Bush, uh, may be God.
[00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:03.789]  Now, they're not quite to that worshipful level.
[00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:04.550]  You think I'm kidding?
[00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.230]  I'm not joking.
[00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:14.340]  I heard this promo on Kixel before they sold out to another outfit.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:22.206]  Not K-I-X-L that we're on in Kansas City, but it's got a similar call letters here in Austin.
[00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:26.669]  K-I-X-L, not K-C-X-L.
[00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:33.213]  And, because every time I talk about this story, I've only told it a few times, people call in and say, what do you mean they're saying that?
[00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:34.854]  K-C-X-L.
[00:10:34.854 --> 00:10:37.656]  No, K-I-X-L in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:44.828]  I'll never forget driving and it was like, he is our father.
[00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:46.848]  He loves his children.
[00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:48.629]  He is good.
[00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:50.189]  He protects the weak.
[00:10:50.189 --> 00:10:55.670]  And it kept cutting in in between with George Bush saying things about fighting terrorists.
[00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.831]  And then at the end it goes, he is our Lord and Savior.
[00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:02.832]  Then Bush speaks some more and it goes, Jesus Christ.
[00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:18.593]  But, I mean, who would ever think Pastor Hagee would be saying Jesus wasn't the Messiah, wasn't the Son of God, that he was an evil rebel in Israel?
[00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:20.134]  And they all say, Hail!
[00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:20.674]  Hail!
[00:11:20.674 --> 00:11:21.675]  Hail!
[00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:25.857]  Now, Hagee did pull back that book, The Case for Israel.
[00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:31.940]  He did, in defense of Israel was the name, he did pull that book back after a few months.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.601]  He arrogantly blustered, and there was a big split in his church.
[00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:36.942]  I mean, even those zombies went, wait a minute,
[00:11:38.126 --> 00:11:40.628]  Is this guy got a horns and a tail?
[00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:43.790]  Man, this is not a religious radio show.
[00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:55.557]  I'm not... The point is, is I just digressed off into the fact that you don't question your Lord, George W. Bush.
[00:11:55.557 --> 00:11:58.879]  Okay, let me just go ahead and get into the news.
[00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:04.203]  The surveillance East German Stasi society that we live in.
[00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:18.338]  Before I get into this latest developments, I want to just set the table here briefly with what we're currently under.
[00:12:18.338 --> 00:12:26.044]  In Europe, in England, in Australia, in New Zealand, for at least a decade, U.S.
[00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:27.725]  launched spy satellites.
[00:12:27.725 --> 00:12:28.246]  The U.S.
[00:12:28.246 --> 00:12:34.231]  has launched most of the spy satellites that our, quote, allies England, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe use.
[00:12:35.206 --> 00:12:44.128]  And they have their allotted time on those spy satellites that in the 60s could read, in God we trust, on a penny.
[00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:54.951]  You know, the famous photograph of the guy laying out suntanning in Central Park, and you can read the text of his book, and sitting on top of another book is a penny, and you can read it clearly.
[00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:58.052]  That was taken in 1968.
[00:12:58.052 --> 00:12:59.752]  Well, they got stuff a lot better than that.
[00:13:00.658 --> 00:13:11.289]  On a clear day, they can zoom in like a microscope into the, uh, you know, little scratches on the surface of the Penino.
[00:13:11.289 --> 00:13:14.452]  They have ground-penetrating radar satellites.
[00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:16.914]  They've got ground-penetrating radar aircraft.
[00:13:16.914 --> 00:13:18.396]  They're looking through your walls.
[00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:24.242]  I don't mean the stuff cops had 20 years ago in police helicopters that looks through your walls and sees heat signatures.
[00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:31.998]  I mean, the Feds have stuff that can look through your wall, they can then tune it, and if you're not moving, they can look into your heart.
[00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:33.319]  They can look into your guts.
[00:13:33.319 --> 00:13:37.480]  They can look right through your body.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.900]  Okay?
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.662]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:46.844]  Now, they've now announced that they are surveilling the American people with this.
[00:13:46.844 --> 00:13:51.066]  And they're gonna have the local police dialed into the spy satellites watching you and your town.
[00:13:58.843 --> 00:14:03.946]  Now, again, there are thousands of facets to this.
[00:14:03.946 --> 00:14:06.728]  That's the overt surveillance.
[00:14:06.728 --> 00:14:09.029]  We're having a national debate about what is the FISA
[00:14:09.927 --> 00:14:11.268]  Law they're trying to pass due.
[00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:13.429]  Well, we know it gives immunity for telecoms.
[00:14:13.429 --> 00:14:21.254]  It violated federal law, each and every case without warrants, and allowed criminal rogue elements of the government to spy on U.S.
[00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:22.254]  citizens.
[00:14:22.254 --> 00:14:27.137]  There were millions of these blanket warrants that just allow them to surveil anybody they want.
[00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:29.238]  They're not real warrants.
[00:14:29.238 --> 00:14:37.123]  It's just a letter, a national security letter, from the president or any of his designates in a host of agencies to surveil.
[00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:54.611]  Just like they said Patriot Act is only for terrorists, when it violated at least five of the first ten amendments to the Bill of Rights, and then you can type in the headline, states and local governments using Patriot Act in non-terror, or Patriot Act used against U.S.
[00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:59.513]  citizens, and it'll say, West Virginia 20,000 times, Florida 40-something thousand.
[00:14:59.513 --> 00:15:05.256]  I mean, I've seen literally hundreds of articles in the last six years where they're just using it on everybody.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:13.930]  But you've got a general public that many people don't even know what electricity is.
[00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.133]  They don't know where the sun goes when it sets.
[00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:17.094]  I'm not joking.
[00:15:17.094 --> 00:15:19.638]  What you see on Jaywalking on Jay Leno is accurate.
[00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:21.060]  In fact, a lot of the public
[00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:39.833]  Are not not brain-dead, they're just totally distracted, diverted, so self-absorbed, so thinking about what they're gonna eat for dinner, who they're gonna have sex with, what fancy clothes they want, how they want to wax their car to look cool at a red light, that they know nothing else.
[00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:44.475]  It's just, they just accept the society around them.
[00:15:44.475 --> 00:15:45.935]  But let me hurry and get through all these points.
[00:15:50.612 --> 00:16:13.065]  But the biggest surveillance issue isn't the fact that every major phone company has entire NSA floors in it, everything is wired through the NSA, or that through FEMA, all the radio and TV stations have, by law, FEMA comes in and puts in their own equipment to control all of yours by remote control, by radio, by shortwave, they can dial in and take over.
[00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:13.885]  That was done in 96 as well, EAS.
[00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.792]  You've got this whole grid set up.
[00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:27.320]  The police have been trained and prepared to block off all the highways if you try to evacuate or run.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:37.049]  You know about the 26,000 preachers they've got trained to give their flock sermons about handing their guns in, going to forced labor camps, letting the government take your children.
[00:16:37.049 --> 00:16:39.191]  The sermons are all being given right now everywhere.
[00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:44.927]  You know about the 23,000 executives trained in InfraGard?
[00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:47.289]  You know about the 500,000?
[00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:53.553]  It was 490-something thousand truck drivers, and that was in the first three years of the program.
[00:16:53.553 --> 00:16:57.696]  They've already trained another half million, so it's really close to a million, but let's just say 500,000.
[00:16:57.696 --> 00:17:03.740]  Uh, trained to spy and tattle and look for things everywhere, and of course, they're not going to find it.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.503]  You go to these anti-terror training meetings, we've seen full videos online, because they're public,
[00:17:09.563 --> 00:17:20.585]  And, you know, the first two days is about looking for Al-Qaeda and truck bombs, and the next, the next three days, it's a week-long course, is, by the way, did you see a parent spank their child at a rest stop?
[00:17:20.585 --> 00:17:22.185]  Go ahead and call the cops.
[00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:24.646]  Did you see somebody throw a beer can in a trash can?
[00:17:24.646 --> 00:17:27.906]  Then, of course, it's not really a beer can, but the cops still pull you over.
[00:17:27.906 --> 00:17:29.767]  You've got your prescriptions out of their box.
[00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:30.907]  You go ahead and go to jail for that.
[00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:34.207]  You know, we've read those cases.
[00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:35.528]  Did you hug your child?
[00:17:35.528 --> 00:17:36.928]  Did it look like pedophilia?
[00:17:36.928 --> 00:17:38.028]  Go ahead and call the cops.
[00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:41.942]  Do you see a person walking with a bag on their back?
[00:17:41.942 --> 00:17:44.423]  Go ahead and call the cops.
[00:17:44.423 --> 00:17:45.704]  Do you see somebody filming?
[00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:47.305]  Go ahead and call the cops.
[00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:49.466]  To where now the cops just walk up and say, turn your camera off.
[00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:50.306]  Don't videotape anything.
[00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:51.807]  You're not allowed to in America.
[00:17:51.807 --> 00:17:52.467]  There's no law.
[00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:54.828]  They don't care.
[00:17:54.828 --> 00:18:04.673]  But the real spying goes on when you go into the big computer store, when your computer's broken, and you then, it's factored into what you pay for.
[00:18:04.673 --> 00:18:06.574]  Because they have to spend hours spying on you.
[00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:33.537]  uh... and uh... under quote regulations now under law and so you pay to be spied on and have your fourth and fifth amendment violated and they don't even tell you're being spied on or when you have a computer guy at your house they spy on you uh... now they all get money for what they look for they look for illegal gambling uh... they go and look at any porn that might have even accidentally and lord knows it's all over the web where somebody just might have looked young
[00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:40.815]  You know, there are millions of these sites, and it's on the hotel, uh, TVs, but that doesn't matter.
[00:18:40.815 --> 00:18:50.043]  The point is, they see something that just might look like she's under 18, you're getting a SWAT team visit.
[00:18:50.043 --> 00:18:54.006]  All dying corps are flying kidnapped children out every day, publicly, and they don't get in trouble.
[00:18:54.006 --> 00:18:55.207]  They have congressional hearings about it.
[00:18:57.501 --> 00:19:01.744]  Now, when the carpet cleaner's in your house, remember, these guys are morons.
[00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:07.067]  They think that your girlfriend's going to botany school at UT.
[00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:08.708]  This is a real story.
[00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:10.088]  Doesn't matter if she's growing orchids.
[00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:11.349]  There's a grow light.
[00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:12.370]  That must be illegal.
[00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.171]  You get SWAT teamed.
[00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:16.292]  Happened in the apartment next to me.
[00:19:16.292 --> 00:19:18.333]  That was 13 years ago.
[00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.394]  14 years ago.
[00:19:19.394 --> 00:19:22.796]  I don't know, like 95.
[00:19:22.796 --> 00:19:24.357]  So, that goes on.
[00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:28.762]  So when we get back, I'm going to give you the new news.
[00:19:28.762 --> 00:19:33.346]  By law in Texas, they are going to spy on you.
[00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.528]  No judge, no jury, no warrant.
[00:19:35.528 --> 00:19:38.091]  It's more East German than East Germany.
[00:19:38.091 --> 00:19:41.254]  It's more pathetic than anyone on Earth.
[00:19:41.254 --> 00:19:42.755]  Of course, it's us.
[00:19:42.755 --> 00:19:43.816]  It's got to be.
[00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:44.797]  I mean, we're the worst.
[00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:46.619]  We killed 50 million babies.
[00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:47.800]  I mean, you know, we're scum.
[00:19:52.443 --> 00:19:54.586]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:19:54.586 --> 00:19:56.988]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.271]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:00.833]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:02.535]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:05.378]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:20:05.378 --> 00:20:09.082]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR...
[00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:18.712]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[00:20:18.712 --> 00:20:24.638]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:20:24.638 --> 00:20:25.960]  I'm an inside job.
[00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.814]  How dare you?
[00:20:29.814 --> 00:20:34.899]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:37.641]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:42.726]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[00:20:43.226 --> 00:20:44.246]  Truth Rising.
[00:20:44.246 --> 00:20:47.067]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:20:47.067 --> 00:20:49.348]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:52.269]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:53.489]  Jim Newcomer from Midas.
[00:20:53.489 --> 00:20:53.989]  July 2nd, 2008.
[00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:55.129]  Gold opened at $9.37 an ounce.
[00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:58.370]  Gold coins can be purchased for $9.63.90, $4.74.70 for a half ounce, or $2.37.35 for quarter ounce.
[00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.570]  That's $9.63.90, $4.74.70, $2.37.35.
[00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:11.216]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:13.117]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:21:13.117 --> 00:21:16.339]  JP Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:18.560]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.302]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:25.743]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:21:25.743 --> 00:21:30.345]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:30.765]  The U.S.
[00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:35.047]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:21:35.047 --> 00:21:36.788]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:40.113]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:21:40.113 --> 00:21:41.394]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.394 --> 00:21:46.862]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:47.123]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.123 --> 00:21:47.303]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.230]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.851]  American Free Press.
[00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:01.353]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for President.
[00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:03.093]  American Free Press.
[00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:06.075]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.856]  Standing firm for our Constitution.
[00:22:08.856 --> 00:22:11.857]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[00:22:11.857 --> 00:22:14.118]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[00:22:14.118 --> 00:22:16.399]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:17.840]  I don't think so.
[00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:40.280]  It's just like it sounds.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.722]  American Free Press, all one word, dot net.
[00:22:43.722 --> 00:22:47.064]  Once again, that's AmericanFreePress.net.
[00:22:47.064 --> 00:22:51.446]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[00:22:52.352 --> 00:22:56.113]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:22:56.113 --> 00:23:00.834]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:23:00.834 --> 00:23:06.136]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:23:06.136 --> 00:23:17.359]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:19.700]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.162]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:23:22.162 --> 00:23:23.082]  Let's face it.
[00:23:23.082 --> 00:23:25.925]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:23:25.925 --> 00:23:33.931]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:23:33.931 --> 00:23:36.233]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:39.855]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:39.855 --> 00:23:43.418]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:43.418 --> 00:23:45.600]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.962]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:23:48.422 --> 00:23:50.043]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:23:50.043 --> 00:23:50.483]  Act now.
[00:23:50.483 --> 00:24:05.132]  Gold is up again today at over $945 an ounce.
[00:24:05.132 --> 00:24:05.352]  Wow!
[00:24:05.352 --> 00:24:07.613]  In the middle of a vacation week.
[00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:20.760]  Speaking of that, Jason Burmiss is back in Austin working on his film, Fabled Mazy Birds.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.623]  I'm just teasing him.
[00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:26.383]  Fabled Enemies.
[00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:27.844]  He'll be sitting in Friday.
[00:24:27.844 --> 00:24:28.765]  I'm gonna go visit family.
[00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:29.886]  I appreciate him doing that.
[00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:30.986]  He wants to work.
[00:24:30.986 --> 00:24:31.727]  He's back.
[00:24:31.727 --> 00:24:33.368]  He's had his vacation.
[00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:36.210]  Went to a wedding back in New York and he wants to sit in.
[00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.691]  I have to say that or I'll get mean emails.
[00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:40.993]  You're making him work on 4th of July.
[00:24:40.993 --> 00:24:42.213]  I swear that's how it works.
[00:24:45.478 --> 00:24:47.058]  Okay, let me get back to the police state.
[00:24:47.058 --> 00:24:51.259]  Let me get back to the spying.
[00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:55.240]  You need to know, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to hide.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.781]  These spooks, the little spies that are everywhere, make money.
[00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:04.962]  I mean, most of them aren't carpet cleaners to get the 15 bucks an hour.
[00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:07.083]  They're there to get the rewards.
[00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:23.125]  And I've seen news reports of where you'll have a carpet cleaner who's making 80 grand a year, 120 grand a year, or a plumber who's making 100 grand a year, 50 grand a year, depending on how energetic they are, just spying on people.
[00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:24.646]  Exterminators.
[00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:26.427]  Air-conditioned people.
[00:25:26.427 --> 00:25:29.649]  They are in your house and they're there to spy on you.
[00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:32.631]  Most companies.
[00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:36.554]  And they want that money so bad that if they see gun cases,
[00:25:37.395 --> 00:25:39.917]  They're gonna go ahead and call the cops.
[00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:41.118]  And this has happened to me.
[00:25:41.118 --> 00:25:41.958]  Legal guns.
[00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:43.159]  They don't know.
[00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:44.340]  They move it from California.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.941]  They believe TV is reality.
[00:25:45.941 --> 00:25:49.544]  They watch dramas like NYPD Blue where they find a gun in your house.
[00:25:49.544 --> 00:25:51.585]  You go to jail where they've been disarmed.
[00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:54.087]  They think it's, you know, Washington D.C.
[00:25:54.087 --> 00:25:55.728]  You need to know the danger, folks.
[00:25:55.728 --> 00:26:05.835]  I mean, a woman in Phoenix drank a glass of water in a wine glass and the cops were called and they went ahead and took her to jail because she had just been to the dentist
[00:26:06.904 --> 00:26:11.187]  And, uh, she had a bottle of painkillers.
[00:26:11.187 --> 00:26:12.307]  They don't stop, folks.
[00:26:12.307 --> 00:26:14.709]  They're here to put you in the system.
[00:26:14.709 --> 00:26:17.090]  They're here to throw you into its jaws.
[00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.231]  And I don't want to hear you're here to keep us safe.
[00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:21.813]  Again, the illegal aliens can have DWIs.
[00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:26.776]  They can now have cocaine and heroin and are not arrested or released, uh, in San Francisco.
[00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:30.398]  Uh, they don't have to have IDs, but citizens are arrested.
[00:26:30.398 --> 00:26:31.178]  We are scum.
[00:26:31.178 --> 00:26:31.939]  They are gods.
[00:26:31.939 --> 00:26:32.519]  You are God.
[00:26:33.106 --> 00:26:38.290]  We're just gonna admit to everyone that government is now God, and we don't like it, and we're gonna rebel.
[00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.032]  You have to admit what we've become.
[00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:46.235]  So... All of this is happening.
[00:26:46.235 --> 00:26:47.877]  And there's hundreds of ways you're spied on.
[00:26:47.877 --> 00:26:52.960]  You know, you think, oh, my public school, you know, it has a counselor for my child.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.945]  The counselor there is looking for dirt to give the police and the CPS.
[00:26:58.945 --> 00:26:59.265]  Okay?
[00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:02.484]  And I see the cases all the time here locally.
[00:27:02.484 --> 00:27:03.705]  I see them all over the country.
[00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:06.806]  A child skins their arm on the playground in front of witnesses.
[00:27:06.806 --> 00:27:08.787]  It doesn't matter.
[00:27:08.787 --> 00:27:10.028]  The teacher asks, what is that?
[00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:11.969]  Did your mommy do that?
[00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:13.670]  And you know, does mommy spank you?
[00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.151]  And the child says, yeah, mommy spanks me sometimes when I'm bad.
[00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:16.671]  Oh, that's it.
[00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:17.352]  Mommy did that.
[00:27:17.352 --> 00:27:19.072]  It's over.
[00:27:19.072 --> 00:27:23.895]  You don't hand your kid over to the child rape squads, and that's who they are, the CPS.
[00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:26.169]  Um, literally.
[00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:28.210]  Then, um, the SWAT team's coming.
[00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.891]  I mean, let's just admit what we are.
[00:27:29.891 --> 00:27:31.872]  Let's admit how bad it really is.
[00:27:31.872 --> 00:27:34.053]  You know, you pull up.
[00:27:34.053 --> 00:27:38.476]  You've got your 14-year-old, your 10-year-old, and your 2-year-old in the car.
[00:27:38.476 --> 00:27:46.300]  You pull up and you walk 9 feet on Walmart surveillance camera to throw $8.50 into the Salvation Army cup.
[00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.690]  It's over, folks!
[00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.630]  You're arrested!
[00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.631]  You're taken down!
[00:27:52.631 --> 00:27:53.931]  Your children are taken!
[00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:54.911]  Done!
[00:27:54.911 --> 00:27:55.611]  You understand?
[00:27:55.611 --> 00:27:57.092]  This is who we are!
[00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:59.932]  You mean to list hundreds of cases here?
[00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:04.574]  Predatory state everywhere, making you the criminal.
[00:28:04.574 --> 00:28:05.914]  And they haven't even gotten started yet.
[00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:11.135]  Now, Paul Watson did a great article, Utility Workers Hired a Stasi Informant in Colorado, California, and Arizona.
[00:28:11.135 --> 00:28:13.336]  Now, these are just federalizes while you're hearing about it.
[00:28:13.336 --> 00:28:14.956]  This is nothing, folks.
[00:28:16.129 --> 00:28:25.631]  Hundreds of police, firefighters, paramedics, utility workers have been trained and recently dispatched as terrorism liaison officers in Colorado, Arizona, California to watch for suspicious activity.
[00:28:25.631 --> 00:28:27.332]  Now remember, that means all crime, folks.
[00:28:27.332 --> 00:28:28.852]  There's no real terror.
[00:28:28.852 --> 00:28:32.053]  Which is later fed into a secret government database.
[00:28:32.053 --> 00:28:36.134]  See, they're starting the databases now on everybody.
[00:28:36.134 --> 00:28:42.015]  According to the Denver Post, it is a tactic intended to feed better data into terrorism early warning systems.
[00:28:42.995 --> 00:28:48.760]  All the real experts say it floods everything with chatter and BS to where real intelligence can't stop attacks.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.462]  But see, that's the whole point.
[00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:56.588]  The NSA is there to make sure that the black ops were able to carry out the attack.
[00:28:56.588 --> 00:29:00.151]  And to spy on other government agencies that are trying to do the right thing.
[00:29:00.151 --> 00:29:00.952]  Or other compartments.
[00:29:03.155 --> 00:29:06.897]  Warning systems to uncover intelligence that could help fight any U.S.
[00:29:06.897 --> 00:29:10.139]  forces, but the vague nature of the T.L.O.
[00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:15.882]  mission and their focus on reporting both legal and illegal activity has generated objections.
[00:29:15.882 --> 00:29:26.088]  Do you remember the, some of the heads of the federal marshals, air marshals, saying, look, we're ordered every day to put innocent people in a terror database, little kids taking pictures,
[00:29:27.014 --> 00:29:30.077]  Mom's laughing on the plane.
[00:29:30.077 --> 00:29:31.438]  This is ruining their lives.
[00:29:31.438 --> 00:29:33.880]  That's the whole point.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.204]  By the way, you know there's over 8 million of you in the database.
[00:29:38.204 --> 00:29:39.766]  It's not a million anymore.
[00:29:39.766 --> 00:29:43.069]  We're all terrorists.
[00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:44.470]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.993]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.993 --> 00:29:49.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.055 --> 00:29:55.917]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:29:55.917 --> 00:29:57.478]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:29:57.478 --> 00:29:59.619]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:01.540]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.021]  The late great USA.
[00:30:03.021 --> 00:30:04.782]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:11.806]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:30:39.597 --> 00:30:45.059]  Knowledge is power, and the information you need to effectively wake up your fellow man and fight the New World Order
[00:30:45.739 --> 00:31:05.375]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution because of civil unrest and panic.
[00:31:06.354 --> 00:31:10.520]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:17.350]  It is estimated that 5 million acres of farmland will not be producing over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.715]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.

[00:31:26.939 --> 00:31:37.064]  Larry Matlack, President of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6th that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[00:31:53.464 --> 00:31:59.551]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:05.497]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:32:05.497 --> 00:32:09.642]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:32:09.642 --> 00:32:14.547]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:32:14.787 --> 00:32:23.293]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:23.612]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:26.694]  Finishing up with the Stasi.
[00:33:26.694 --> 00:33:28.455]  Here's an example.
[00:33:28.455 --> 00:33:31.857]  Remember the father top archaeologist?
[00:33:31.857 --> 00:33:36.320]  Isn't even a drinker, no criminal record.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.922]  He's at a baseball game up in Michigan.
[00:33:42.023 --> 00:33:46.487]  And his seven-year-old son orders a lemonade.
[00:33:46.487 --> 00:33:54.475]  And the idiot ne'er-do-well brings him a, quote, hard lemonade that looks like a bottle of lemonade, and the child took one drink.
[00:33:54.475 --> 00:33:57.397]  And by the time that had happened, the police were there.
[00:33:57.397 --> 00:33:58.919]  They took the dad to jail.
[00:33:58.919 --> 00:34:01.601]  CPS the child, freaked out, called an ambulance.
[00:34:01.601 --> 00:34:05.405]  They always overdo their crimes, make it look like they care about the kid.
[00:34:05.405 --> 00:34:06.686]  No alcohol in the child's blood.
[00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.110]  Doesn't matter.
[00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.190]  They took the child.
[00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.391]  They said, doesn't matter.
[00:34:12.391 --> 00:34:14.451]  So, uh, it was my wife's birthday last night.
[00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:17.172]  I'm out at dinner with my parents and the children.
[00:34:17.172 --> 00:34:26.493]  My mother has a margarita, and there's a straw in the top of it, and my daughter reaches over, gets it, and I barely stopped her from touching it to her mouth.
[00:34:26.493 --> 00:34:27.954]  Of course, everybody knows me in Austin.
[00:34:27.954 --> 00:34:29.714]  There's people watching my every move.
[00:34:29.714 --> 00:34:30.674]  You know, just normal folks.
[00:34:30.674 --> 00:34:31.394]  Doesn't matter.
[00:34:31.394 --> 00:34:33.535]  Most of them are probably little telltale types.
[00:34:33.535 --> 00:34:35.835]  And if my daughter would have just touched that straw to her,
[00:34:36.545 --> 00:34:39.066]  Who knows what hell would have been released?
[00:34:39.066 --> 00:34:43.489]  This is the sick, hyper-wicked demon society.
[00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:54.655]  Abort babies all day, but take somebody's child away if the moron at the ballpark brings a alcohol drink to the child that looks like a regular lemonade.
[00:34:56.474 --> 00:35:17.463]  You see, just attack everybody, savage everyone, throw the book at everyone, accept illegal aliens and real criminals, and John McCain publicly goes for fundraisers in Mexico illegally, publicly goes to illegal fundraisers in France and England, raises millions of dollars and they say it's illegal, and he just says, I don't care!
[00:35:17.463 --> 00:35:19.284]  Lawless criminal government.
[00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:25.767]  By the way, the only country during the Iraq sanctions that would sell oil-filled equipment to Saddam was, of course,
[00:35:26.621 --> 00:35:27.562]  Halliburton!
[00:35:27.562 --> 00:35:37.632]  It's always, and then they strut around wrapped in American flags and are worshipped by all the shaved head fools who don't understand the very country's being destroyed.
[00:35:37.632 --> 00:35:40.495]  By the way, you think I'm joking here as to how extreme all this is?
[00:35:40.495 --> 00:35:42.617]  This is really happening.
[00:35:42.617 --> 00:35:48.543]  Utility workers hired as Stasi informants in Colorado, California, Arizona.
[00:35:50.094 --> 00:35:53.475]  Hundreds of police, firefighters, paramedics, utility workers have been hired.
[00:35:53.475 --> 00:35:57.296]  And they are putting all of you in databases for anything.
[00:35:57.296 --> 00:36:02.657]  Now, you think that's bad by Paul Watson with links to the Denver Post.
[00:36:02.657 --> 00:36:07.518]  This is mainline PC Magazine.
[00:36:07.518 --> 00:36:09.178]  Brian Heater.
[00:36:09.178 --> 00:36:10.438]  I want to get him on.
[00:36:10.438 --> 00:36:12.599]  I had seen this in a blurb about a month ago.
[00:36:13.246 --> 00:36:15.388]  Texas legislature passed this.
[00:36:15.388 --> 00:36:19.111]  Texas PC repair now requires PI license.
[00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:25.035]  I mean, even if you don't want to spy on people on their PCs when they bring them in to get them fixed.
[00:36:25.035 --> 00:36:30.540]  Not to mention all the mental patients that are out there and might plant stuff on you.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.543]  Now they have to spy with no judge, no jury, no warrant, no nothing.
[00:36:35.543 --> 00:36:37.305]  It's for Al-Qaeda, I'm sure, of course.
[00:36:40.663 --> 00:36:49.308]  From its Texas Rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty, the Lone Star State has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement.
[00:36:49.308 --> 00:37:02.375]  Thanks to a strange new law, and they have a link to the state legislature, it's a sting that may soon be felt by a number of the state's computer repair people.
[00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:03.615]  Thought it's a right-to-work state.
[00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:04.776]  No, it's not.
[00:37:04.776 --> 00:37:06.657]  A recently passed law requires that
[00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:16.022]  Texas computer repair technicians have a private investigator license according to a story post in the Dallas-Fort Worth CW affiliate.
[00:37:16.022 --> 00:37:21.865]  In order to obtain the license, technicians must receive a criminal justice degree or participate in a three-year apprenticeship.
[00:37:21.865 --> 00:37:22.465]  You understand?
[00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:23.706]  They must become minions.
[00:37:23.706 --> 00:37:28.167]  You see, I told you 10% of the college graduates are Homeland Security related.
[00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:32.069]  But now, from the technical schools, you see ITT technical?
[00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:33.129]  It's not IT technical.
[00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:34.550]  It's ITT law enforcement.
[00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:40.095]  And it's all to fight terror, but then you learn terror is spying on your neighbor.
[00:37:40.095 --> 00:37:42.377]  Freedom is terrorism.
[00:37:42.377 --> 00:37:44.159]  You understand, folks?
[00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:45.760]  And by the way, this is built into the bill.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.243]  You're paying to have your fourth and fifth violated.
[00:37:49.243 --> 00:37:54.348]  But see, it'll be in the small policy thing you sign that they're spying on.
[00:37:54.348 --> 00:38:00.233]  In order to obtain a license, said license, technicians must receive a criminal justice degree or participate in a three-year apprenticeship.
[00:38:01.013 --> 00:38:04.375]  Those shops that refuse to participate will be forced to shut down.
[00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:09.437]  Violators of the new law can be hit with a $4,000 fine and up to a year in jail.
[00:38:09.437 --> 00:38:14.579]  Penalties that apply to consumers and customers who seek out their services.
[00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:19.181]  Some of the area's larger companies already employ technicians with PI licenses.
[00:38:19.181 --> 00:38:27.165]  A fact that generally doesn't apply to small computer repair shops.
[00:38:27.165 --> 00:38:29.846]  Note the story has been updated July 1st with a link to the law that
[00:38:30.763 --> 00:38:32.264]  Serves as a source for the story.
[00:38:32.264 --> 00:38:34.245]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:37.826]  Now, now let me explain something.
[00:38:37.826 --> 00:38:46.610]  Every week I see a mother who takes a picture of their naked newborn baby laying on a couch.
[00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:50.692]  You know, the photos you see in black and white photos, the photos that used to be on Christmas cards.
[00:38:50.692 --> 00:38:51.212]  Not anymore.
[00:38:51.212 --> 00:38:54.533]  You get a SWAT team visit for that.
[00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:56.734]  This is, and of course the government's a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:57.875]  This is the sickness of it.
[00:38:58.666 --> 00:39:00.807]  And they love feeding on the normal population.
[00:39:00.807 --> 00:39:04.870]  It's a big, sick joke to them.
[00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.151]  Yes, folks, this is the dark side.
[00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:08.192]  This is crazy land.
[00:39:08.192 --> 00:39:09.252]  You're just not aware of it.
[00:39:09.252 --> 00:39:13.595]  Look under the rock, you'll find it.
[00:39:13.595 --> 00:39:22.260]  You see, you're saying, well, I just won't take my photos into Walmart, you know, that has, you know, my son or daughter playing in the bathtub.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.121]  You know, they're just nuts.
[00:39:23.121 --> 00:39:25.342]  They're a bunch of perverts, dirty minds.
[00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:26.323]  I got my own computer.
[00:39:26.323 --> 00:39:27.143]  I'll just have them on here.
[00:39:27.143 --> 00:39:27.463]  Nope!
[00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:28.224]  It's over, folks!
[00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.953]  And all the time you hear about the arrest, well they had indecent photos on their computer.
[00:39:32.953 --> 00:39:39.957]  It's their one-year-old.
[00:39:39.957 --> 00:39:41.238]  You're all terrorists.
[00:39:41.238 --> 00:39:41.638]  You understand?
[00:39:41.638 --> 00:39:47.022]  You're all child molesters now.
[00:39:47.022 --> 00:39:53.006]  This is how it works, folks, and they are spying on you, and you're gonna pay for it, and there's no freedom.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.821]  I mean, you gotta have a- and they're now saying, well, you gotta thumbprint if you wanna be a school teacher.
[00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:01.263]  Oh, you gotta faceprint and thumbprint if you wanna be a realtor.
[00:40:01.263 --> 00:40:03.964]  Oh, if you wanna be an automobile repair guy.
[00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:16.008]  And they're telling every agency, every, uh, they've gotta go around bossing every other type of company and private group into being spies.
[00:40:16.008 --> 00:40:19.749]  Unless it's illegal aliens running a meth house next to you, the cops just won't come.
[00:40:20.737 --> 00:40:24.259]  I mean, I had the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday where they're allowed to have cocaine and heroin.
[00:40:24.259 --> 00:40:25.820]  The cops have been told, leave them alone.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.881]  You can't!
[00:40:26.881 --> 00:40:28.422]  And I'm not bashing the illegal aliens.
[00:40:28.422 --> 00:40:32.204]  My point is, I'm showing here that there's two standards.
[00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:39.948]  This has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[00:40:39.948 --> 00:40:44.891]  And a bunch of states have passed these laws where they have to spy on you by law.
[00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:46.052]  It's indentured servitude.
[00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:52.340]  You have to work for them, but see, they're just going to pass it on to you.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.921]  You pay to be spied on.
[00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:58.502]  Just like it violates your Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment.
[00:40:58.502 --> 00:41:02.283]  Everywhere you go, they're scanning, they're running your plates.
[00:41:02.283 --> 00:41:06.265]  No due process, no reasonable suspicion.
[00:41:06.265 --> 00:41:12.627]  You're just all run in the database and where you go and what you do, and maps of everywhere all of us go are already made and put in the computer.
[00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:17.434]  That's the computing space and the computing power they have.
[00:41:17.434 --> 00:41:24.319]  One of these companies cameras can read up to a thousand license plates a minute.
[00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:26.261]  The biggest highways.
[00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:29.023]  And that's the computing power a few years ago last time I checked.
[00:41:29.023 --> 00:41:30.263]  They're surveilling it all.
[00:41:30.263 --> 00:41:31.905]  Maps of everywhere you go.
[00:41:31.905 --> 00:41:35.988]  Everything you do is tracked and traced.
[00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:38.289]  They just don't want to announce it to you yet.
[00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:41.732]  First they're announcing they listen to you only when Bin Laden calls you.
[00:41:42.828 --> 00:41:45.631]  Of course, you read the FISA rulings and the rest of it.
[00:41:45.631 --> 00:41:47.072]  Of course, it's the complete opposite.
[00:41:47.072 --> 00:41:54.139]  But they talk to you like lobotomized monkeys.
[00:41:54.139 --> 00:41:55.900]  And I could go on for hours.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:06.410]  This is just two articles out of literally 50 or so, and I'll never get to them, but I just wanted you to know... I wanted you to understand...
[00:42:08.539 --> 00:42:20.008]  That when you go to the big computer store and they say, hey, you want to pay 30 bucks extra and, you know, get a discount when you come in to get your computer repaired, you're sitting there looking at hungry wolves.
[00:42:20.008 --> 00:42:26.913]  You're looking at spies that are going to diligently, with three-year law enforcement degrees,
[00:42:27.992 --> 00:42:40.622]  That are gonna spy on you, and that are gonna look for one thing, and if a maid, or a repair worker, or your cousin that was staying with you, visits some barely legal site that's totally legal, I read the cases all the time.
[00:42:40.622 --> 00:42:42.904]  People go to jail for going to legal sites!
[00:42:42.904 --> 00:42:51.691]  You think these moron juries, when they show them some picture of a 20 year old that looks like she's 16, you can go pull the cases up.
[00:42:51.691 --> 00:42:53.413]  You go to jail for what's legal!
[00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:56.415]  I'm not defending all that porn, that's what's so dangerous about it.
[00:42:56.415 --> 00:42:57.736]  It's a trap, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:00.254 --> 00:43:02.455]  Oh God help us.
[00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:06.557]  It's so incredible.
[00:43:06.557 --> 00:43:08.698]  But it's all selectively enforced.
[00:43:08.698 --> 00:43:20.083]  They can have the barely legal stuff on every major hotel television set advertised to you when you open the menu up.
[00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:23.364]  Right next to the gay porn and all the rest of it.
[00:43:23.364 --> 00:43:25.665]  That's fine.
[00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:28.066]  This is only for you, the isolated schmuck.
[00:43:28.797 --> 00:43:33.941]  It's not for, uh, the big hotel companies.
[00:43:33.941 --> 00:43:52.594]  It's only for you, because when they're dragging you off to jail, uh, because, uh, the repair guy saw a barely legal picture, or because there was a picture of your one-year-old son, uh, playing in a, uh, you know, water puddle, and his, you know, his pants were coming down a little bit, and they could see one inch of butt crack.
[00:43:52.594 --> 00:43:53.235]  It's over!
[00:43:53.235 --> 00:43:54.216]  Your life's over!
[00:43:54.216 --> 00:43:57.238]  Guys with shaved heads on roids with devil tats are coming!
[00:43:58.007 --> 00:44:06.653]  With fat little pedophiles in tow, the CPS to hand your kids over.
[00:44:06.653 --> 00:44:07.893]  You think I'm joking?
[00:44:07.893 --> 00:44:08.814]  This is America.
[00:44:08.814 --> 00:44:10.996]  We've gone further than the Stasi, anybody.
[00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:12.677]  But there's still remnants of liberty.
[00:44:12.677 --> 00:44:14.478]  Radio shows like this.
[00:44:14.478 --> 00:44:17.600]  People waking up.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.383]  So you don't have a completely passive population bombed out at the end of World War II to go into this new tyranny.
[00:44:23.835 --> 00:44:26.876]  Again, articles about how they're installing the scanners that show your naked body.
[00:44:26.876 --> 00:44:29.236]  They're gonna scan your naked children through them.
[00:44:29.236 --> 00:44:30.757]  That's Boston Globe.
[00:44:30.757 --> 00:44:34.878]  ACLU prepares lawsuit against Denver DNC plans for free speech.
[00:44:34.878 --> 00:44:36.438]  Zones restricting free speech.
[00:44:36.438 --> 00:44:39.179]  Putting you miles away in a cage.
[00:44:39.179 --> 00:44:40.559]  All part of your enslavement.
[00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:44.040]  Telecom Amnesty flip-floppers got more telecom money.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.221]  Yeah, of course, Senator Barack Obama flip-flopped.
[00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:47.681]  He got money.
[00:44:48.672 --> 00:44:51.093]  I mean, this guy's got Dan Quayle endorsing him.
[00:44:51.093 --> 00:44:53.614]  You think Obama's gonna give you change?
[00:44:53.614 --> 00:44:55.754]  Yeah, it's gonna get worse!
[00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:57.555]  New World Order's gonna get... It doesn't matter.
[00:44:57.555 --> 00:45:00.376]  The election doesn't mean anything.
[00:45:00.376 --> 00:45:03.937]  GroupSue US for data on tracking by cell phone.
[00:45:03.937 --> 00:45:06.438]  Obama National Security Group teaming with globalists.
[00:45:07.961 --> 00:45:10.583]  Midwest floods show signs of global warming?
[00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:17.330]  No, it's called the Mississippi that's always been flooding, as long as humans have lived on this continent 15,000 years.
[00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:20.332]  Doesn't matter, you tell the idiot public something, they'll believe it.
[00:45:20.332 --> 00:45:22.094]  They just want to be abused.
[00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:25.517]  Provocateurs planning violence at DNC, bunch of war news.
[00:45:25.517 --> 00:45:29.500]  But right now, I want to get into finance.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.421]  Gold's up 9.45 today.
[00:45:35.737 --> 00:45:38.219]  This is in the doldrums in the deadest part of the summer.
[00:45:38.219 --> 00:45:41.041]  This is the deadest week in the summer.
[00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:43.343]  Normally gold is low at this time.
[00:45:43.343 --> 00:45:48.066]  All these foreign big banks and brokerages are saying we're going into a depression in the next month.
[00:45:48.066 --> 00:45:50.088]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:45:50.088 --> 00:45:52.850]  But I do think it's going to happen within three years.
[00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.133]  But it is moving faster than most of the experts have thought, and it's deteriorating.
[00:45:57.133 --> 00:45:57.954]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:45:59.116 --> 00:46:02.677]  Ford and GM are both moving to Mexico, and they may go bankrupt.
[00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:03.757]  That's in the news.
[00:46:03.757 --> 00:46:05.538]  Starbucks closing 600 U.S.
[00:46:05.538 --> 00:46:08.199]  stores.
[00:46:08.199 --> 00:46:11.660]  See, that's a major sign.
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.521]  Over a hundred other major chains are just going bankrupt.
[00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:18.242]  AP, for a decade it appeared there was no such thing as too many Starbucks for U.S.
[00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:25.224]  coffee drinkers, whose willingness to buy $4 lattes and dark drip brews rationalizes second green and white
[00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:32.501]  Mermaid, it's a goddess, folks, just down the street, and sometimes even a third.
[00:46:32.501 --> 00:46:40.086]  But in a sign that those days are over, Starbucks Corporation announced that it will close 600 company-operated stores in the next year as the faltering U.S.
[00:46:40.086 --> 00:46:43.949]  economy hastens the pain caused by the company's own rapid expansion.
[00:46:43.949 --> 00:46:47.912]  Yeah, they cut their coffees in price in half three months ago.
[00:46:47.912 --> 00:46:48.512]  Didn't help them.
[00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.672]  I go in restaurants that were full anytime you went in now, and there's ten people in them.
[00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:58.914]  You go up to Dallas and San Antonio, half the billboards are empty.
[00:46:58.914 --> 00:46:59.594]  Well, they were empty.
[00:46:59.594 --> 00:47:03.877]  Now it's all tattle on your neighbor government signs with our tax money.
[00:47:03.877 --> 00:47:04.777]  Oh, God help us.
[00:47:04.777 --> 00:47:07.618]  I wanted to bring Ted up just for three minutes.
[00:47:07.618 --> 00:47:12.621]  He's got gold at the price it was on Monday, and I'm told in a day or two it's going to go up again.
[00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:14.242]  He has it at below spot.
[00:47:14.918 --> 00:47:21.165]  He has silver at below spot, and these are even coins that have collector value on top of them.
[00:47:21.165 --> 00:47:24.128]  You can't beat getting a collector coin, a semi-numismatic.
[00:47:24.128 --> 00:47:29.454]  They're somewhat collectible, and by that they're not hyper-collectible, but these are old coins, nice coins, Swiss and
[00:47:30.905 --> 00:47:35.410]  French francs and British sovereigns, beautiful coins, and of course silver, U.S.
[00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:37.111]  dollars and half dollars.
[00:47:37.111 --> 00:47:38.553]  You can't beat this type of deal.
[00:47:38.553 --> 00:47:41.336]  This is exactly the type of stuff I buy when I can afford it.
[00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:50.125]  And just with all this news, I mean, Ted, last week we were telling people to buy, get into gold when it was at $8.80, and now it's $9.45 and going straight up, and you've got it at
[00:47:50.856 --> 00:47:52.337]  Basically a $9.20 price.
[00:47:52.337 --> 00:47:56.661]  I don't know how listeners wouldn't take advantage of this right now, Ted.
[00:47:56.661 --> 00:47:58.723]  Well, Alex, that's the way you put it.
[00:47:58.723 --> 00:48:01.306]  I mean, we've got the 4th of July coming up.
[00:48:01.306 --> 00:48:02.887]  This market is usually dead.
[00:48:02.887 --> 00:48:04.008]  It's active.
[00:48:04.008 --> 00:48:09.894]  People are getting into the precious metals market, even when we're in the dead doldrums of summer.
[00:48:09.894 --> 00:48:15.339]  Definitely at this time, to get involved, we were looking at $9.26 when I locked in on all this stuff.
[00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:20.644]  And I've got the British Sovereigns, and they're currently right now at a great value.
[00:48:20.644 --> 00:48:23.326]  They're at $257 each.
[00:48:23.326 --> 00:48:31.974]  I have the Franks right now at $205, and I also have those Walking Liberties, and they're a real good way to get into smaller pieces of silver.
[00:48:31.974 --> 00:48:32.194]  $189.20.
[00:48:32.194 --> 00:48:33.175]  I mean, people have to realize that
[00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:42.027]  You know, Starbucks, GM, Ford, I mean there are so many companies right now that are on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:48:42.027 --> 00:48:46.354]  It's going to affect every asset in the economy.
[00:48:46.354 --> 00:48:51.922]  And people need to take a look at their retirement accounts, they need to take a look at the money that they have in the bank.
[00:48:52.042 --> 00:48:57.147]  And see, people don't want to admit that they've already had all of the false gains they were told.
[00:48:57.147 --> 00:49:04.413]  I mean, you're told you're getting a 6, 7, 8, 10 percent gain when you've got 15 percent compounded annual inflation.
[00:49:04.413 --> 00:49:09.317]  Folks, this is a fraud and it's a diminishing asset.
[00:49:09.317 --> 00:49:12.340]  I mean, it's a no-brainer to aggressively.
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.025]  Move out of other paper investments into precious metals.
[00:49:17.025 --> 00:49:18.666]  Physically hold them.
[00:49:18.666 --> 00:49:20.408]  Get it in your hand, folks.
[00:49:20.408 --> 00:49:30.278]  I mean, a lot of you, I know, are wealthy, or well-to-do, and you're sitting on nothing but paper, and if you really think about it, you don't have anything other than your furniture and your house and your jet boat.
[00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:34.059]  I mean, what do you have that's real?
[00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:39.421]  You've got all this capital in these paper markets, and I'm telling you, it's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:49:39.421 --> 00:49:40.782]  Well, you can see it there, Alex.
[00:49:40.782 --> 00:49:50.745]  And as a matter of fact, if you think about it, over the last three years, people just sat there and watched their money melt away, their purchasing power of their assets melt away by the tune of 40%.
[00:49:50.745 --> 00:49:57.948]  And if you're in the market, in the stock market, not only are you losing on the dollar purchasing power, but you're losing on the fact that your portfolio is going down.
[00:49:58.288 --> 00:50:00.630]  By the way, that's 45% with euro parity.
[00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.392]  If you look at euro open at 84, it's more like 65%.
[00:50:03.392 --> 00:50:06.974]  Ted, real fast, tell them the coins, give them the number.
[00:50:06.974 --> 00:50:14.579]  Yeah, the coins are going to be the francs at $2.05, the British sovereigns at $2.57, and the rolls of walking liberty halves at $1.8920.
[00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:15.180]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.160]  I'll say it slower, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:50:24.346 --> 00:50:25.626]  686-2237.
[00:50:25.626 --> 00:50:29.107]  Call us today because the prices will go up because spots went up.
[00:50:29.107 --> 00:50:30.347]  I can't buy them for this anymore.
[00:50:30.347 --> 00:50:33.128]  Ted, how long can you hold at the 926 level?
[00:50:33.128 --> 00:50:35.349]  I will hold this clean through the weekend.
[00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:38.250]  But after that, the market's going to have to take over.
[00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:38.350]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:38.530]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:38.990]  Thank you, Ted.
[00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.651]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[00:50:39.651 --> 00:50:39.731]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:39.731 --> 00:50:40.391]  Stay with us.
[00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:59.058]  Another Untold Story, here it comes.
[00:50:59.058 --> 00:51:03.584]  Another Untold Story, here it comes.
[00:51:03.584 --> 00:51:10.373]  Another Untold Story that you've not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:51:13.157 --> 00:51:17.180]  It was World War II, and a naval night battle was raging in the Pacific.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:22.464]  On one side, Japanese ships, 20 destroyers, 1 battleship, 6 cruisers against.
[00:51:22.464 --> 00:51:25.466]  The other side, 4 cruisers, 7 destroyers.
[00:51:25.466 --> 00:51:26.867]  It was Guadalcanal.
[00:51:26.867 --> 00:51:30.489]  At the time, Dr. Martin was 19 years old, a naval pilot.
[00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:38.595]  His battle station that night was near the bridge, which was destroyed in an explosion, sending him overboard with shrapnel throughout his body.
[00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:42.558]  The 19-year-old sailor was blown off ship into shark-infested waters.
[00:51:42.958 --> 00:51:43.479]  We're good to go.
[00:52:02.276 --> 00:52:11.002]  A miracle story of a voice speaking to him at the right time, and for time being saved and protected by a great white shark, 18 feet long.
[00:52:11.002 --> 00:52:13.203]  It's a miracle story, and that's just part of it.
[00:52:13.203 --> 00:52:15.645]  What caused the shark to do what it did?
[00:52:15.645 --> 00:52:16.425]  Don't know.
[00:52:16.425 --> 00:52:23.130]  But what caused the captain of another ship that was on a secret mission with strict orders to do what he did?
[00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.491]  It's all quite a story.
[00:52:24.491 --> 00:52:28.754]  And when you hear it, you'll understand why the man became a world evangelist.
[00:52:28.754 --> 00:52:31.736]  Hear him tell the story himself at AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:52:33.556 --> 00:52:58.705]  For another untold story, go to anotheruntoldstory.com Another untold story dot com Another untold story dot com Another untold story dot com On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:52:58.705 --> 00:52:59.946]  And we knew what to do.
[00:53:00.805 --> 00:53:02.007]  At least we thought we did.
[00:53:02.007 --> 00:53:09.055]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:53:09.055 --> 00:53:15.784]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[00:53:16.462 --> 00:53:17.623]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:53:17.623 --> 00:53:20.146]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:22.888]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:53:33.979 --> 00:53:37.061]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:53:37.061 --> 00:53:43.105]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:53:43.105 --> 00:53:46.027]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:53:46.027 --> 00:53:50.971]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:53:55.976 --> 00:53:56.957]  Don't worry.
[00:53:56.957 --> 00:53:58.998]  This show is documented.
[00:53:58.998 --> 00:54:02.780]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:11.086]  Look, the criminals that run our society, and they aren't consciously criminal, criminals come in and tie you up, put a gun to your head.
[00:54:11.086 --> 00:54:12.727]  They want their slaves under control.
[00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:18.582]  And that's what's happened, and they've trained their minions that criminal activity is normal.
[00:54:18.582 --> 00:54:29.465]  That spying on people without warrants, that having information of the cop can't do that, but their little minions, they can all spy on you, and after all, it's to get the bad people.
[00:54:29.465 --> 00:54:32.266]  No, it's to throw the book and make stuff up against the slaves.
[00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:35.263]  And I went into that earlier, but these are key articles.
[00:54:35.263 --> 00:54:43.789]  We need another story written in the next few days by Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron, Kurt Nemo, somebody about this PC World thing.
[00:54:43.789 --> 00:54:46.712]  Texas PC Repair now requires PI license.
[00:54:46.712 --> 00:54:47.893]  They're spying on you.
[00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:58.633]  And it's just like how it started in Texas and a few other states, law and order states, that when you go in to get cold medicine you gotta sign a piece of paper and see your ID.
[00:54:58.633 --> 00:55:03.857]  Well then now it's registered by law and, you know, get in a database to stop the drugs.
[00:55:03.857 --> 00:55:06.859]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:08.140]  And it's just gonna get worse, folks.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.781]  It's gonna get worse.
[00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:12.363]  Worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:55:12.363 --> 00:55:17.186]  Yesterday when I said breathalyzers in your cars, I mean all cars, people who don't drink.
[00:55:18.027 --> 00:55:24.129]  It's going to be in them by standard by 2011 with Toyota and Ford have announced.
[00:55:24.129 --> 00:55:39.415]  And by the way, those are hooked into the police department through the OnStar, through the cell phone, and just like it happens all the time, a drunk girlfriend or somebody gets in the car and plays with a breathalyzer on somebody who's at a EWI, and then immediately it calls the cops and you go to jail.
[00:55:39.415 --> 00:55:44.057]  Well, see, the new system is, you go out and you've been drinking, and you're just going to get something out of your car.
[00:55:44.057 --> 00:55:44.897]  You're going to jail!
[00:55:45.965 --> 00:55:50.288]  The minute your insurance is up, unless you're an illegal alien, they'll be selectively ignored.
[00:55:50.288 --> 00:55:55.270]  The minute your insurance is out, that's gonna be tracked by the license plate off the cameras.
[00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.172]  Cops are coming.
[00:55:57.172 --> 00:56:01.134]  This is a life of being ruled, being bossed around, being told what to do.
[00:56:01.134 --> 00:56:02.094]  I saw it in D.C.
[00:56:02.094 --> 00:56:07.618]  Out in the middle of a park, cops will just walk over to a family and just boss them around and say, why are you photographing that statue?
[00:56:07.618 --> 00:56:09.539]  And they'll be like, huh?
[00:56:09.539 --> 00:56:11.400]  Well, we're not allowed to, we won't.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.401]  And the guy's like, good, don't.
[00:56:14.105 --> 00:56:15.607]  I'd pull my cameras out and walk over.
[00:56:15.607 --> 00:56:16.127]  Don't do that.
[00:56:16.127 --> 00:56:17.729]  I'd say, are you crazy?
[00:56:17.729 --> 00:56:18.830]  This is America.
[00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:19.891]  They tell you to do that?
[00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:21.973]  He's like, what's it for?
[00:56:21.973 --> 00:56:23.275]  Let me see it.
[00:56:23.275 --> 00:56:26.398]  And I'm just like, my God, you're sick.
[00:56:26.398 --> 00:56:28.881]  Sick, degenerate filth.
[00:56:28.881 --> 00:56:34.507]  Just loving to... I mean, we are already prisoners, ladies and gentlemen, in many cities.
[00:56:35.365 --> 00:56:39.068]  I mean, they're already just bossing us just like it's downtown Havana.
[00:56:39.068 --> 00:56:40.370]  Downtown Havana isn't this bad.
[00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:43.712]  I've talked to tourists that have gone there when you got your cameras out.
[00:56:43.712 --> 00:56:44.753]  Only here!
[00:56:44.753 --> 00:56:46.435]  Only in England!
[00:56:46.435 --> 00:56:49.518]  I mean, just light years into tyranny.
[00:56:49.518 --> 00:56:52.220]  Light years into despotism.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.242]  And I just keep freaking out.
[00:56:54.242 --> 00:56:55.363]  I wish we had a bigger voice.
[00:56:55.363 --> 00:56:58.566]  I mean, we reach millions of people, but that's not enough, folks.
[00:56:58.566 --> 00:57:02.129]  That's why I want you to... By the way, on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:57:02.774 --> 00:57:04.855]  There are the two final sneak peeks.
[00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:13.121]  The police state sneak peek, about two minutes long from, it's not a trailer, it's a sneak peek from the film, from Truth Rising is up there.
[00:57:13.121 --> 00:57:16.363]  Then there's another one, another sneak peek up on Prison Planet.
[00:57:16.363 --> 00:57:18.945]  You know, in the top corner where we post YouTubes every day.

[00:57:24.488 --> 00:57:27.970]  One sneak peek is on InfoWars, the other sneak peek is on Prison Planet.
[00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.893]  There's another article Paul Watson wrote today about Truth Rising coming out.
[00:57:34.488 --> 00:57:41.795]  We have a super quality DivX, not just QuickTime and Windows and Flash.

[00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:52.884]  But I just looked at the DivX on our big screen plasma screen.
[00:57:52.884 --> 00:57:55.086]  It just looks awesome.
[00:57:55.086 --> 00:57:56.808]  And it's less than a gig, right Jason?
[00:57:58.797 --> 00:57:59.880]  And we've got instructions.

[00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:20.811]  And so you can just ask people, hey, I got a copy of a regular DVD, or for young people, I got a DIVX.
[00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:23.312]  I mean, we're talking 20 cents to make a copy.

[00:59:45.507 --> 00:59:47.908]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.908 --> 00:59:50.689]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.091]  Big government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.672]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:01.592]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:01.592 --> 01:00:06.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:12.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:26.145]  You know, the private corporations that own our government that use behavioral psychology to brainwash the population, you know, they brag in hundreds of textbooks how they've got their children as captives
[01:00:28.317 --> 01:00:30.498]  And they propagandize them to hate humanity.
[01:00:30.498 --> 01:00:34.421]  For decades, they've played spaceship under Department of Education grants.
[01:00:34.421 --> 01:00:38.163]  Spaceship or lifeboat, they get 8 to 10 kids around a round table.
[01:00:38.163 --> 01:00:40.844]  In the 3rd or 4th grade is their favorite time for that.
[01:00:40.844 --> 01:00:44.486]  They indoctrinate them how to be spies in the 7th and 8th.
[01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:45.427]  All over the nation.
[01:00:45.427 --> 01:00:48.429]  You write dossiers on your parents, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[01:00:48.429 --> 01:00:50.370]  That's even on the news now.
[01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.331]  But totally stern in society.
[01:00:53.991 --> 01:01:05.809]  But they have things, uh, like the, uh, uh, Spaceship Game, where they say, okay, there's ten of us on the spaceship, there's only enough air and water and food to get to the planet we're going to for seven.
[01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:07.071]  Who's gonna have to die?
[01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:08.353]  Who's gonna be thrown out of the spaceship?
[01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:16.079]  And they teach him to imagine that their resources are based on limiting the number of humans.
[01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:21.663]  And that's a key now false logic circuit or anchor in their mind.
[01:01:21.663 --> 01:01:36.295]  Nothing else intellectuals taught to them, but how to be racially conscious of themselves in the name of not being racist, but really it creates racism and everyone looking at each other and noticing who's different and the minorities who are the majority feeling sorry for themselves and attacking whites.
[01:01:37.255 --> 01:01:44.598]  Is generally what it turns into but only because they're the middle class and have and the minorities are teamed up with the state While they're having eugenics carried out against them.
[01:01:44.598 --> 01:01:45.819]  They're actually the main target.
[01:01:45.819 --> 01:01:59.664]  They're only also used in a dual access in that warfare system and In the lifeboat or spaceship game they also act like they're a lifeboat at sea They say okay.
[01:01:59.664 --> 01:02:03.746]  We need a policeman the policeman gets to live who's a policeman and
[01:02:04.568 --> 01:02:12.650]  But then the troublemaker, or the person who's the rich man, he has to die.
[01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:19.011]  Of course, that just means anybody middle class owning their own business, they have to be pulled down by the other crabs in the bucket.
[01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:26.172]  The crab tries to climb out of a bucket if you're fishing for crabs, the others pull him down instead of working together, kind of like the Patriot movement does.
[01:02:26.172 --> 01:02:28.433]  With a little help from the COINTELPRO people getting the ball rolling,
[01:02:31.239 --> 01:02:33.640]  And so it introduces in your mind, people have to die.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.380]  And I've read a bunch of reviews.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.621]  It's already out on the file sharing networks, but I'm going to watch it and review it.
[01:02:39.621 --> 01:02:40.801]  I'm actually going to go see it.
[01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:42.221]  WALL-E.
[01:02:42.221 --> 01:02:43.981]  Looks real cute, looks real friendly.
[01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:46.982]  Humans have destroyed the Earth because of the combustion engine.
[01:02:46.982 --> 01:02:54.303]  WALL-E has been there for 700 years, and it's all about bringing life back to Earth, and now humans are bad.
[01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:57.744]  Now, what's going to destroy or mess up our lives is genetic engineering.
[01:02:59.201 --> 01:03:00.422]  Cross-species.
[01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:08.949]  What's gonna hurt things is things like fish infusion, artificial black holes, uh, nuclear weapons, antimatter weapons they admit they have.
[01:03:08.949 --> 01:03:14.933]  Uh, that's the type of stuff that has a good chance of destroying us, or really hurting us bad.
[01:03:14.933 --> 01:03:17.275]  And potentially destroying the planet.
[01:03:17.275 --> 01:03:20.117]  Carbon dioxide's what plants breathe, it's the life driver.
[01:03:20.117 --> 01:03:25.341]  Carbon dioxide has been as much as 14 times higher in the past, that's all the major ice core studies.
[01:03:25.341 --> 01:03:27.123]  It was higher during the Herbarian Maxim,
[01:03:28.399 --> 01:03:34.444]  Which caused the Bronze Age to begin, and for us to develop civilization 8,000 years ago.
[01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:35.364]  Doesn't matter.
[01:03:35.364 --> 01:03:39.027]  They lie and hoax everyone, and there are well-meaning people everywhere.
[01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:40.468]  Adults going around.
[01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:42.950]  It has the highest IMDB rating I've ever seen.
[01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.472]  What, a 9.7 or something?
[01:03:45.472 --> 01:03:46.473]  And it's like a religion.
[01:03:47.389 --> 01:03:50.310]  The guy at the restaurant we were at last night was telling us, have you seen WALL-E?
[01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:53.170]  And it was a, you know, wasn't a guy, wasn't even nerdly.
[01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:59.031]  It was like, you know, the waiter at a nice restaurant for my wife's birthday was telling us we must see WALL-E.
[01:03:59.031 --> 01:04:00.791]  It is an important message.
[01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:07.152]  And they're like running around like cult members, teaching us how to play lifeboat or spaceship, and how we have to die.
[01:04:07.152 --> 01:04:08.133]  And that's what the film is.
[01:04:08.133 --> 01:04:11.573]  I've already read reviews of it, and it teaches us that.
[01:04:11.573 --> 01:04:16.774]  And the children will sit there being brainwashed, the parents will be brainwashed, and you will all learn how to die.
[01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:24.304]  So that the global masters can have all the resources for themselves to control the future, while they play God and probably destroy us.
[01:04:24.304 --> 01:04:28.426]  I mean, God forbid we have any real environmental fixes or anything.
[01:04:28.426 --> 01:04:28.986]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:04:28.986 --> 01:04:32.267]  That's not gonna happen.
[01:04:32.267 --> 01:04:33.408]  Oh my gosh.
[01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:39.690]  We'll be right back, speaking of education, with Charlotte Izzybee, former head of policy, Department of Education.
[01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.151]  We're gonna break down all of this.
[01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:41.571]  Stay with me.
[01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.066]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:04:52.066 --> 01:04:54.487]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:04:54.487 --> 01:04:56.748]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:04:56.748 --> 01:04:58.308]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:04:58.308 --> 01:05:00.009]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:05:00.009 --> 01:05:02.850]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:07.332]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the...
[01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:16.205]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:22.375]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:23.456]  An inside job.
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.491]  How dare you!
[01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:32.392]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:05:32.392 --> 01:05:35.273]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:05:35.273 --> 01:05:41.734]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[01:05:52.424 --> 01:05:53.384]  This is very important.
[01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:57.247]  It has to do with your food and the future of food in America.
[01:05:57.247 --> 01:06:07.595]  You know you've heard about the disasters, the floods, the tornadoes, the hurricanes, the typhoons, the tsunamis, the droughts.
[01:06:08.115 --> 01:06:10.417]  And of course, the different kinds of diseases.
[01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:12.838]  You've heard that the honeybees are dying off.
[01:06:12.838 --> 01:06:16.421]  You know there's a national and international food shortage.
[01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:19.383]  Prices are skyrocketing in the marketplace.
[01:06:19.383 --> 01:06:25.127]  And it's not your fault, but if you think gasoline prices have gone up, wait until you see what food's going to do in the next couple of years.

[01:06:54.336 --> 01:06:59.439]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:59.439 --> 01:07:00.940]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.543]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:54.886]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:54.886 --> 01:07:57.167]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:24.134]  Charlotte Isserby, she was the head of policy at the Department of Education, number two position, directly underneath the head of the Department of Education.
[01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:28.585]  We're going to be talking to her in just one moment.
[01:08:28.585 --> 01:08:35.570]  Before we go to her, we are in uncertain times, and a lot of dangerous things are happening, as you know.
[01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:46.016]  And I believe that patriots more than anybody else, because we need to carry on liberty through a depression or whatever happens, or World War III, now need to get prepared.
[01:08:46.016 --> 01:08:48.198]  And we have a great sponsor.
[01:08:48.198 --> 01:08:54.902]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation, high quality,
[01:08:55.762 --> 01:09:08.430]  Uh, food that is non-GMO, clean and healthy, non-GMO, freeze-dried and dehydrated, means a lot of food, fits in very small cans, uh, and stores in very small areas.
[01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.552]  In climate-controlled, it lasts more than 10 years.
[01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:15.432]  Uh, if you store it in your hot garage, it lasts, it's guaranteed for 10 years.
[01:09:15.432 --> 01:09:18.653]  This is where I've gotten my storable foods multiple times.
[01:09:18.653 --> 01:09:23.294]  I believe in them, so give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:09:23.294 --> 01:09:29.996]  They also have a free DVD and audio CD about what they do, and a catalog if you just want to call and get that.
[01:09:29.996 --> 01:09:30.736]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:09:30.736 --> 01:09:38.438]  And unlike a lot of the other companies, they deliver in a week to two weeks, not six or eight.
[01:09:39.398 --> 01:09:43.180]  And that's because they've bought tons of food, they have their own factory, they do it themselves.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:50.284]  1-800-409-5633 are huge banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:50.284 --> 01:09:57.587]  Her website's DeliberateDumbingDown.com and you can get her book there, Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[01:09:57.587 --> 01:10:00.329]  And I wanted to get her on when I saw this article
[01:10:01.329 --> 01:10:04.310]  Last week, Paul Watson did, but it was out of the London Telegraph.
[01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:05.451]  You can go read it.
[01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:12.353]  Government permission required for parents to kiss or hug their children, to take your son or daughter to the pool, you'll have to have a license.
[01:10:12.353 --> 01:10:17.075]  They already have it in all of England, but now it's federal law there.
[01:10:17.075 --> 01:10:23.537]  And they will come up and ask for your card, even as a parent, to be able to touch your child.
[01:10:23.537 --> 01:10:26.578]  Licenses to change diapers, that's pedophilia.
[01:10:26.578 --> 01:10:28.259]  See, they're making normal action.
[01:10:29.286 --> 01:10:33.308]  I guess they'll give bluebirds a license to feed worms to their babies.
[01:10:33.308 --> 01:10:36.390]  Or for a mother cat to, you know, clean their baby.
[01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.871]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:46.315]  And you see the statistics in the U.S., government child workers five times more likely to be pedophiles or to physically abuse children.
[01:10:46.315 --> 01:10:53.899]  They are the group that everyone should be watching and tracking, and look how many of them do get busted in jail and go to jail, where good people in government do stop them.
[01:10:54.737 --> 01:10:56.758]  Uh, so, uh, I wanted to talk about this.
[01:10:56.758 --> 01:11:10.346]  I wanted to go over the... Her book's the size of a Dallas phone book, and it weighs, I don't know how many pounds, and it's just all government documents where they say we want to eradicate the family, and so I wanted to just rattle off all the facts and have the expert on.
[01:11:10.346 --> 01:11:11.427]  We really love her to death.
[01:11:11.427 --> 01:11:13.728]  It's, it's, uh, Charlotte, uh, Iserbet.
[01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:15.149]  I'm always mispronouncing it.
[01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:16.710]  And, uh, Charlotte, you're just a darling.
[01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:17.891]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:20.276]  Thank you, Alex, always.
[01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:26.079]  It's always a pleasure to be on with you, and, you know, I just, I was gone, I guess.
[01:11:26.079 --> 01:11:29.000]  I was in Europe for a couple of weeks, and we could talk about that, too.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.962]  That's interesting in itself.
[01:11:30.962 --> 01:11:38.105]  And I didn't know about this article out of the British press, but I'm not one bit surprised.
[01:11:38.105 --> 01:11:41.747]  It does seem that the UK leads every country.
[01:11:41.747 --> 01:11:46.870]  I mean, it's always the worst things come out of there, believe it or not, because most people do not understand how
[01:11:47.586 --> 01:11:52.531]  The role of England in bringing us down into this monstrous system.
[01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:53.872]  And it's a pliable nation.
[01:11:53.872 --> 01:12:02.301]  They were wild barbarians and they were domesticated and have imperial conditioning to go along with it.
[01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:02.881]  That's right.
[01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:09.528]  And people are really surprised when I mention to them that wretched program, whole language, which was deliberate.
[01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:11.795]  Dumb down the children.
[01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:15.517]  I mean, you don't have to read or you don't have to be able to spell.
[01:12:15.517 --> 01:12:16.657]  You don't have to know grammar or anything.
[01:12:16.657 --> 01:12:18.118]  That went on for about 12 years.
[01:12:18.118 --> 01:12:21.540]  And that initially came out of, I believe, New Zealand.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.941]  And people say, oh, really?
[01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:30.665]  And then a lot of bad things do come out of these gorgeous New Zealand and Australia where everybody who has money wants to go away.
[01:12:30.665 --> 01:12:32.186]  Well, those are commonweals.
[01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:37.089]  Those are under Crown, Imperial, Lord Milner conditioning ops.
[01:12:37.089 --> 01:12:37.809]  Absolutely.
[01:12:37.809 --> 01:12:38.950]  So I'm not surprised.
[01:12:40.379 --> 01:12:50.184]  You know what it all boils down to, Alex, and you know me, I usually get to the heart of the matter and people get upset with me because I don't go through a lot of the middle stuff.
[01:12:50.184 --> 01:12:51.364]  I did all of that in my book.
[01:12:51.364 --> 01:12:52.064]  I went through that.
[01:12:52.064 --> 01:12:53.145]  That's right, I did.
[01:12:53.145 --> 01:12:57.207]  I did because I was told at one time, they kept saying,
[01:12:58.857 --> 01:12:59.797]  That's your opinion.
[01:12:59.797 --> 01:13:01.758]  And that's why I wrote my book.
[01:13:01.758 --> 01:13:02.998]  That's exactly why.
[01:13:02.998 --> 01:13:05.679]  It's 700 pages and it's all there.
[01:13:05.679 --> 01:13:11.660]  But initially, you, a lot of us, understand what we see right in front of our face.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.441]  You know, it's right in our face.
[01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:22.043]  And if you have just the slightest bit of history, if you understand the ism forms of government, which we're not meant to be.
[01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:29.623]  Fascism, communism, socialism, whatever-ism, then you're going to recognize that this is an essential part.
[01:13:29.623 --> 01:13:33.167]  I mean, what's coming out of England now is absolutely essential.
[01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:37.431]  They can't run the world if they have a bunch of freewheeling parents.
[01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:38.118]  I don't
[01:13:59.055 --> 01:14:03.957]  The rotten corpse of Christianity, that's the humanist, uh, Dunphy's quote.
[01:14:03.957 --> 01:14:19.044]  But you know, since I posted this in the message board, they've been linking, and in the InfoWars commentary, they've been linking to all these cases where social workers come, and even when they're taking, say, the five-year-old, CPS says the mother will hug the son or daughter, and they say, ooh, that's improper.
[01:14:19.564 --> 01:14:29.638]  Well, this, you know, remember this was going on about 15 years ago, this business of poor Grandpa, you know, he's got his first grandchild and he's not allowed to have the little granddaughter on his lap.
[01:14:29.638 --> 01:14:32.241]  I mean, this is a part of the women's movement, too.
[01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:35.065]  They're training us to separate men from women.
[01:14:35.525 --> 01:14:38.428]  Absolutely, and people can't see it.
[01:14:38.428 --> 01:14:43.713]  It's simply because they don't want to see it because they're too busy and that's all been created.
[01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:45.875]  Well, I see these modern mothers now.
[01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:46.556]  They're the boss.
[01:14:46.556 --> 01:14:47.497]  They're stomping around.
[01:14:47.497 --> 01:14:48.358]  They're totally unhappy.
[01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:51.301]  They have a domesticated, bent-back husband.
[01:14:51.301 --> 01:14:55.024]  And they'll let a cop in a black ski mask with a gun.
[01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:56.225]  They feel safe.
[01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:57.727]  But then Grandpa, he's evil.
[01:14:58.547 --> 01:14:59.728]  Oh yeah, Alex.
[01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:00.929]  I know, I know.
[01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:06.093]  And these people who are not upset whatsoever with the REAL ID Act or...
[01:15:06.983 --> 01:15:14.490]  The Office of Homeland Security, what's going on, taking our freedom, the merger of the federal and state police.
[01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:19.515]  Because, after all, you know, they're afraid they need to be protected.
[01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:29.365]  If only they could realize that there is hardly anything that could be out on the street or in your house or anything that is as dangerous as the federal government coming in your house.
[01:15:30.105 --> 01:15:32.447]  Well, I guess that was sort of something that we were expecting.
[01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:05.378]  Uh, and I tried to get information this morning, but since I got back, I don't, didn't know about this bill.
[01:16:05.378 --> 01:16:08.282]  There's a bill that evidently passed the Congress.
[01:16:09.768 --> 01:16:11.209]  But I'm not sure.
[01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:12.490]  That's what I'm asking you.
[01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:16.912]  That does exactly what the British article says.
[01:16:16.912 --> 01:16:29.497]  I mean, it's in regard to parents who refuse to give certain medications or medical care to their children, that it is okay, the Congress passed it, for them to be taken from their homes.
[01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:32.819]  Now, I don't want everybody else... Well, yes, I believe that passed the House.
[01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:34.419]  I don't believe that's passed the Senate.
[01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:36.400]  Okay, this is terribly important.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.621]  And you know, do you have the number of it?
[01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:39.402]  No, I don't have it in front of me.
[01:16:39.402 --> 01:16:40.963]  They're hitting us from so many angles.
[01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:48.589]  Well, that's a pretty important one, and I really wanted if someone from your office could get that information to me and your listeners.
[01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:53.973]  I'll try to dig it out, but I mean, Charlotte, do you agree that more is happening now in a month than used to happen in ten years?
[01:16:53.973 --> 01:16:56.135]  I mean, they are pulling the stops out.
[01:16:56.135 --> 01:16:57.095]  Well, absolutely.
[01:16:57.095 --> 01:17:01.759]  What they're doing is they're implementing the Soviet system, and I've been talking about it since 1975.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:03.720]  I don't
[01:17:20.572 --> 01:17:23.672]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.933]  You're not just saying this, and the big banks are behind it.
[01:17:26.933 --> 01:17:29.514]  People get confused that the big banks are, quote, communists.
[01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:31.294]  They want to make us slaves.
[01:17:31.294 --> 01:17:32.995]  Communism's not for the people.
[01:17:32.995 --> 01:17:34.355]  Then they get the wealth.
[01:17:34.355 --> 01:17:35.035]  That's right.
[01:17:35.035 --> 01:17:38.376]  And for those that don't... See, the terms mean nothing, folks.
[01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:41.657]  For those that don't understand, they are stating
[01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:46.083]  That they're here to break up the family, that they're here to do all this.
[01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:54.489]  I mean, when Charlotte says the new Soviet man, they're the ones that are saying this, and they are now carrying it out.
[01:17:54.489 --> 01:17:55.169]  Go ahead.
[01:17:55.169 --> 01:18:05.015]  They're right, and the top corporations and associations for business have made it very clear that what they want is kindergarten through age 80.
[01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:08.458]  Uh, workforce training, okay?
[01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:09.979]  And this is a Soviet system.
[01:18:09.979 --> 01:18:11.860]  It's really slavery.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:22.668]  Now, when you hear that, exactly, uh, the, you know, it's the teachers, and then it's the police, and then it's the PC repair people, and then it's carpet cleaners and plumbers, and then you have to be a spy.
[01:18:22.668 --> 01:18:24.229]  You have to work for them.
[01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:27.792]  You have to go spend months a year in, quote, training, which is brainwashing.
[01:18:28.072 --> 01:18:39.536]  Well, absolutely, and any organization or association or church or whatever entity that would take the penny, this is why the faith-based initiative... And they've now recruited 26,000 preachers to be spies, exactly.
[01:18:39.536 --> 01:18:56.563]  Yes, that's right, and when people... The faith-based initiative of George Bush, and they really ought to go to my website and look for my article, Walks Like a Doc, Talks Like a Doc, because that tells you exactly what George Bush has put in with, of course, the help of a hundred years before him.
[01:18:57.063 --> 01:19:00.630]  But the Soviet system has been implemented here.
[01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:06.231]  You have to, for instance, the faith-based initiative.
[01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:07.632]  That sounds good, doesn't it?
[01:19:07.632 --> 01:19:11.193]  But that's a merger of the churches with the government.
[01:19:11.193 --> 01:19:17.154]  So the churches and the private sector are going to have to conform to what the government wants.
[01:19:17.154 --> 01:19:19.455]  And you've got now Obama.
[01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:26.577]  You know, people could say to me before Obama opened his mouth the day before yesterday that I was wrong on Bush and faith-based initiatives.
[01:19:26.577 --> 01:19:27.177]  It's wonderful.
[01:19:27.177 --> 01:19:29.458]  Well, now Obama's come out in favor of it, folks.
[01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:34.700]  So, he has three, you know, his little prongs are really- Charlotte Isserby, stay there.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:36.241]  Charlotte Isserby, stay right there.
[01:19:36.241 --> 01:19:37.281]  We're going to come back.
[01:19:37.281 --> 01:19:39.322]  She was the head of the Department of Education.
[01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:40.442]  She was the head of policy.
[01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:44.384]  She ran a number two position during Ronald Reagan's administration and she would be
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:50.024]  It was a political appointment, and she was well qualified, but she'd come into meetings and they would just tell her this.
[01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:51.986]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:55.609]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:19:55.609 --> 01:19:58.071]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:01.113]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:01.113 --> 01:20:06.838]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:06.838 --> 01:20:10.761]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:16.265]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:20:50.663 --> 01:20:54.425]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:54.425 --> 01:20:59.447]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:20:59.447 --> 01:21:04.929]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:04.929 --> 01:21:15.414]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:15.894 --> 01:21:20.296]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:20.296 --> 01:21:23.076]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:21:23.076 --> 01:21:26.658]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:26.658 --> 01:21:39.162]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:21:55.377 --> 01:22:00.041]  A world economic collapse could come any day.

[01:23:53.656 --> 01:23:59.001]  Charlotte Izzerbeat is our guest.
[01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:01.503]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, you have a predatory...
[01:24:03.852 --> 01:24:09.798]  Scientific programs developed by the British and the Germans to turn you into mindless slaves.
[01:24:09.798 --> 01:24:19.588]  The main system came from Prussia 200 years ago, when they needed to turn the local farmers into merciless killers who would walk into gunfire.
[01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:21.931]  That's where kindergarten comes in.
[01:24:21.931 --> 01:24:25.895]  It is all how to be mindless, order-following idiots.
[01:24:27.222 --> 01:24:30.344]  Going back to Charlotte Iserby.
[01:24:30.344 --> 01:24:34.327]  Charlotte, breaking down the mindset, going through some of those quotes, what their plan is.
[01:24:34.327 --> 01:24:37.709]  You know, that was great earlier, we were tying it in, how it's all happening now.
[01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:41.411]  All this mandatory this, mandatory that, getting us into their system.
[01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:42.472]  How is this freedom?
[01:24:42.472 --> 01:24:42.812]  It's not.
[01:24:43.909 --> 01:25:03.373]  Absolutely not, and people have to remember that the system, the scientific research-based, scientific engineering, scientific model, when they see the word science, they have to know that that is basically based on their fact, that they consider a fact that man is an animal.
[01:25:03.373 --> 01:25:06.994]  That's the key to the whole thing going on.
[01:25:06.994 --> 01:25:12.695]  Man is an animal to be trained, to be conditioned, and he has no soul.
[01:25:13.737 --> 01:25:18.099]  He has no brain, no soul.
[01:25:18.099 --> 01:25:21.040]  He's totally with no conscience.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.961]  And so that's what they're creating now.
[01:25:23.961 --> 01:25:27.623]  And so it's okay to kill us, abuse us, dumb us down.
[01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.084]  They're the higher intellects.
[01:25:29.084 --> 01:25:30.044]  They're controlling us.
[01:25:30.044 --> 01:25:31.245]  Because we're animals.
[01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:36.162]  We're animals, and I know it's hard for people to believe this.
[01:25:36.162 --> 01:25:41.867]  They've been going after me for 30 years because I've been beating on this, beating on it constantly.
[01:25:41.867 --> 01:25:52.036]  The use of these horrible scientific research-based programs in the schools, mainly they used it for reading because they knew the American people were concerned their children couldn't read.
[01:25:52.036 --> 01:25:58.482]  So they kept, you know, putting new programs in based on Skinner and Pavlov, and as you said, the depression system.
[01:25:59.623 --> 01:26:05.271]  Uh, and, uh, we'll have lunch mainly from his lab in Leipzig.
[01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:14.544]  And, uh, people have got to understand that it's got to get to, especially the Christians who go to school board meetings that complain about the teaching of, uh, evolution.
[01:26:15.407 --> 01:26:26.670]  And then they go right back and they're using the same technique in their Christian schools with the computer-assisted instruction, the ACE program, Accelerated Christian Education.
[01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:29.191]  That's based on Pavlov.
[01:26:29.191 --> 01:26:31.032]  And yet, and that's Darwin.
[01:26:31.032 --> 01:26:37.854]  And yet they have no, they go to school and they write a lot of cane about the fact that the children are being taught Darwin.
[01:26:38.534 --> 01:26:39.674]  Uh, evolution.
[01:26:39.674 --> 01:26:48.657]  So, it's not a matter, it's a total, total misunderstanding out there amongst the American people, uh, regarding the method.
[01:26:48.657 --> 01:26:59.341]  And I did write a little book that is free on my website, my big book's free too, but a little book shorter, it's only 38 pages, and it's right there, and read it, because it's fascinating.
[01:26:59.341 --> 01:27:06.503]  I wrote it in 85 after I was dismissed from my job in the Department of Ed, and it's called Back to Basics Reform.
[01:27:07.443 --> 01:27:17.366]  Of course, Skinnerian International Curriculum, necessary for United States participation in the One World Government Plan for the early years of the 21st century.
[01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:23.949]  And I put it all there because I figured people wouldn't read it, so the whole story is on the title page, right?
[01:27:23.949 --> 01:27:30.451]  But that little book will explain to you, with documents that I found in my office, exactly what's going on.
[01:27:30.451 --> 01:27:36.633]  Now, when the neocons saw that little booklet, they were very upset, and they said I should rewrite it.
[01:27:37.474 --> 01:27:40.117]  And that they didn't understand it.
[01:27:40.117 --> 01:27:41.880]  And I thought that was very amusing.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.488]  So when they said that, I thought, okay, folks, I will rewrite it, but this time it's going to be 700 pages rather than 39.
[01:27:50.706 --> 01:27:55.431]  And so, there's no excuse for people not to understand this problem that we have.
[01:27:55.431 --> 01:27:55.772]  That's right.
[01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:59.096]  You've got the e-book up for free on TheLiberalDumbingDown.com.
[01:27:59.096 --> 01:28:01.018]  I suggest people go there also.
[01:28:01.018 --> 01:28:02.941]  We have it as well, and support you.
[01:28:02.941 --> 01:28:08.167]  It's the size of a phone book, and so you can physically show your neighbors and people,
[01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:10.129]  There's a reason.
[01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:15.512]  And then they test to test, as they admitted when you were there, to see how they've dumbed people down.
[01:28:15.512 --> 01:28:19.875]  And people think, man, the more education we get, the dumber people get.
[01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:21.016]  This is broken.
[01:28:21.016 --> 01:28:21.696]  It's not broken.
[01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.577]  The war on drugs is meant to have more drugs.
[01:28:23.577 --> 01:28:23.998]  No, you're right.
[01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:24.898]  More people in prison.
[01:28:24.898 --> 01:28:29.421]  The war against illiteracy is meant to destroy literacy.
[01:28:29.421 --> 01:28:33.043]  When Bush says the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedoms, they did.
[01:28:33.043 --> 01:28:33.904]  They're the terrorists.
[01:28:34.304 --> 01:28:34.825]  Exactly.
[01:28:34.825 --> 01:28:39.895]  You see, I mean, George Orwell, he understood so beautifully the use of words.
[01:28:39.895 --> 01:28:43.662]  And that's the other article you have to go because then you're going to understand.
[01:28:43.662 --> 01:28:46.748]  I wrote an article called The Devil's Seven Pronged Fork.
[01:28:47.467 --> 01:29:00.862]  How they did it to us, that, if you go click on articles on my website, DeliverItComingDown.com, click on articles, Devil's 7 Pond Fork, you'll find out how they took not only you, but me, but Alex, all of us.
[01:29:00.862 --> 01:29:08.591]  Because at some point in time, maybe not Alex, I don't know, but at some point in time we woke up and I was really the biggest
[01:29:09.156 --> 01:29:12.558]  Yeah, I fell for all of this garbage when I was younger.
[01:29:12.558 --> 01:29:18.761]  So, go there, read how they took us over a period of 150-200 years.
[01:29:18.761 --> 01:29:19.601]  Yeah, let's explain.
[01:29:19.601 --> 01:29:33.549]  They've been phasing this in, and they even said 100 years ago, by the early 21st century, the family will be breaking up completely, and then we will finally go to the next level, fully preparing them to be exterminated.
[01:29:33.549 --> 01:29:36.370]  That's their loving gift to you, and now you're being euthanized.
[01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.371]  All of us are.
[01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:37.851]  Stay with us.
[01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:44.195]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.195 --> 01:29:46.898]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:52.310]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:59.272]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:29:59.272 --> 01:30:07.654]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:07.654 --> 01:30:13.395]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:13.795 --> 01:30:15.416]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:30:15.416 --> 01:30:17.718]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:30:17.718 --> 01:30:22.120]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.342]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:30:24.342 --> 01:30:32.207]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:30:50.023 --> 01:30:55.966]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:30:55.966 --> 01:31:01.008]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:31:01.008 --> 01:31:06.190]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:31:06.190 --> 01:31:09.612]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:31:10.252 --> 01:31:10.573]  I'm good.
[01:31:24.889 --> 01:31:25.149]  I think so.
[01:31:49.961 --> 01:31:55.687]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[01:31:55.687 --> 01:31:57.008]  And we knew what to do.
[01:31:57.008 --> 01:31:59.010]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:06.037]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:32:06.037 --> 01:32:12.764]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air
[01:32:13.459 --> 01:32:14.580]  We're safe to breathe.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.963]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:32:16.963 --> 01:32:19.386]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:32:30.959 --> 01:32:34.041]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:32:34.041 --> 01:32:40.085]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:32:40.085 --> 01:32:43.027]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:32:43.027 --> 01:32:49.812]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:52.994]  Their credit cards will spend the rest of their lives paying 18% interest on something that costs $12.50.
[01:32:55.362 --> 01:32:57.803]  And they didn't like it when they got it home anyway.
[01:32:57.803 --> 01:32:58.903]  Not too bright, folks.
[01:32:58.903 --> 01:33:00.163]  Not too bright.
[01:33:00.163 --> 01:33:09.345]  But if you talk to one of them about this, if you isolate one of them, you sit him down rationally, you talk to him about the low IQs and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions, right away they start talking about education.
[01:33:09.345 --> 01:33:10.685]  That's the big answer to everything.
[01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:11.526]  Education.
[01:33:11.526 --> 01:33:13.226]  They say, we need more money for education.
[01:33:13.226 --> 01:33:16.507]  We need more books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools.
[01:33:16.507 --> 01:33:18.387]  We need more testing for the kids.
[01:33:18.387 --> 01:33:22.328]  You say to them, well, you know, we've tried all of that and the kids still can't pass the test.
[01:33:22.808 --> 01:33:26.409]  He said, ah, don't you worry about that, we're gonna lower the passing grades.
[01:33:26.409 --> 01:33:30.091]  That's what they do in a lot of these schools now, they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass.
[01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:39.374]  More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody's happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points, and pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil!
[01:33:39.374 --> 01:33:39.975]  Got a pencil?
[01:33:39.975 --> 01:33:40.775]  Get in there, it's physics.
[01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:46.416]  Then everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do.
[01:33:46.416 --> 01:33:47.756]  Education!
[01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:48.916]  Politicians know that word.
[01:33:48.916 --> 01:33:50.057]  They use it on you.
[01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:53.258]  Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things.
[01:33:53.258 --> 01:33:55.839]  The flag, the Bible, and children.
[01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:57.319]  No child left behind.
[01:33:57.319 --> 01:33:58.980]  No child left behind.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:33:59.600]  Oh, really?
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.501]  Well, it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start.
[01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:03.181]  Head start?
[01:34:03.181 --> 01:34:04.101]  Left behind?
[01:34:04.101 --> 01:34:05.522]  Someone's losing ground here.
[01:34:07.429 --> 01:34:08.270]  But there's a reason.
[01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:09.171]  There's a reason.
[01:34:09.171 --> 01:34:10.472]  There's a reason for this.
[01:34:10.472 --> 01:34:12.414]  There's a reason education sucks.
[01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:16.438]  And it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed.
[01:34:16.438 --> 01:34:17.960]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:19.081]  Don't look for it.
[01:34:19.081 --> 01:34:20.682]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:34:20.682 --> 01:34:24.306]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:34:24.306 --> 01:34:26.288]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:34:26.288 --> 01:34:28.210]  The big, the wealthy.
[01:34:30.143 --> 01:34:36.188]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:34:36.188 --> 01:34:37.509]  Forget the politicians.
[01:34:37.509 --> 01:34:39.310]  They're irrelevant.
[01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:43.234]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:34:43.234 --> 01:34:43.634]  You don't.
[01:34:44.423 --> 01:34:45.784]  You have no choice.
[01:34:45.784 --> 01:34:47.024]  You have owners.
[01:34:47.024 --> 01:34:48.564]  They own you.
[01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:50.085]  They own everything.
[01:34:50.085 --> 01:34:52.086]  They own all the important land.
[01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:53.866]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:34:53.866 --> 01:34:57.348]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[01:34:57.348 --> 01:34:59.268]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:34:59.268 --> 01:35:06.231]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:08.391]  They got you by the balls!
[01:35:08.391 --> 01:35:11.413]  They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying
[01:35:13.405 --> 01:35:15.526]  To get what they want.
[01:35:15.526 --> 01:35:17.066]  Well, we know what they want.
[01:35:17.066 --> 01:35:19.827]  They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.
[01:35:19.827 --> 01:35:21.687]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:35:21.687 --> 01:35:25.188]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:35:25.188 --> 01:35:29.129]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:35:29.129 --> 01:35:30.370]  They're not interested in that.
[01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:31.690]  That doesn't help them.
[01:35:31.690 --> 01:35:33.550]  That's against their interest.
[01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:34.551]  That's right.
[01:35:34.551 --> 01:35:35.191]  You know something?
[01:35:39.703 --> 01:35:41.403]  Garland died at 71 last week.
[01:35:41.403 --> 01:35:42.964]  Boy, he knew what was going on with that issue.
[01:35:42.964 --> 01:35:46.365]  But we have all the documents.
[01:35:46.365 --> 01:35:49.646]  They celebrate.
[01:35:49.646 --> 01:35:50.726]  They don't just dumb you down.
[01:35:50.726 --> 01:35:52.587]  They teach you how to be mentally ill.
[01:35:52.587 --> 01:35:54.908]  They teach you how to not be able to think properly.
[01:35:54.908 --> 01:35:57.589]  They teach you how to make excuses and rationalize.
[01:35:57.589 --> 01:36:03.190]  Be scared of your neighbor with a gun, but love a guy in a black uniform dressed up like a Nazi.
[01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:04.751]  Strutting around in a Darth Vader outfit.
[01:36:06.687 --> 01:36:17.093]  I mean, land of the free and home of the brave, training your children in every major public school, in 6th and 7th grade with semester-long courses, federally funded to tattle on you?
[01:36:17.093 --> 01:36:18.814]  I mean, that's hardcore crime.
[01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:22.756]  That's hardcore criminal government.
[01:36:22.756 --> 01:36:27.099]  That's Soviet Union, man, on steroids.
[01:36:27.099 --> 01:36:29.640]  But, oh no, that's freedom!
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.742]  Yeah, you're gonna find out freedom, and now it's all coming to a head.
[01:36:32.742 --> 01:36:34.343]  Now they're getting ready to really rape you.
[01:36:34.343 --> 01:36:35.664]  Take it all.
[01:36:35.664 --> 01:36:35.784]  Now,
[01:36:37.409 --> 01:36:38.070]  It's perfect!
[01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:47.657]  They quote, are the educators, you mean the brainwashers, the people that dumb you down and say, now it's, oh we can't educate you in 12 years, now it's 20 years, now it's a lifetime, now it's you gotta go.
[01:36:47.657 --> 01:37:01.349]  Oh now there's, they're gonna bankrupt the economy, now you gotta go to your government job where they give you a subsistence and you gotta go under psychological evaluation and the troops all have to spend four or five tours and go nuts and then be put on Prozac.
[01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:02.750]  It's gonna cause them to kill everybody.
[01:37:03.536 --> 01:37:09.262]  When the drug admittedly does that, then they'll have bigger police state when their own cops and military are running around.
[01:37:09.262 --> 01:37:11.805]  Charlotte Izzybee, what do you think of that George Carlin clip?
[01:37:11.805 --> 01:37:13.307]  Oh, I think it's fantastic.
[01:37:13.307 --> 01:37:15.189]  Are you sure he died naturally?
[01:37:16.022 --> 01:37:17.703]  Uh, yeah, he had a lot of heart trouble.
[01:37:17.703 --> 01:37:18.604]  I mean, who knows?
[01:37:18.604 --> 01:37:19.585]  Oh, boy, what a guy.
[01:37:19.585 --> 01:37:22.026]  I had no idea that he was so on target.
[01:37:22.026 --> 01:37:24.468]  I mean, really, I love that.
[01:37:24.468 --> 01:37:25.729]  Is that on your website?
[01:37:25.729 --> 01:37:26.309]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:26.309 --> 01:37:26.870]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:30.952]  That's the version with all the lower English cut out.
[01:37:30.952 --> 01:37:34.455]  He went on and on about the owners, the global elite, the New World Order.
[01:37:34.455 --> 01:37:35.395]  Oh, that's fabulous.
[01:37:35.395 --> 01:37:37.877]  Well, I've been going on to see it, but you know what?
[01:37:37.877 --> 01:37:40.479]  I wish that your listeners could do a very simple little thing for me.
[01:37:41.218 --> 01:37:50.428]  Yesterday, on, they probably, they can pull it up, David Broder of the Washington Post wrote an article that was called Dumbing Down the Presidency.
[01:37:51.731 --> 01:37:58.495]  And it's a good article, but he doesn't really get to the essence of why everybody in the White House is dumbed down, including the speechwriters.
[01:37:58.495 --> 01:37:59.655]  No, he doesn't get to it.
[01:37:59.655 --> 01:38:07.079]  And I did write him a little letter about this, saying that, you know, it might have something to do with the deliberate dumbing down of education.
[01:38:07.079 --> 01:38:14.222]  And, you know, his email is just plain David Broder at WatchPost.com.
[01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:19.165]  And if you could just write him out there and ask him, say that you read his excellent article.
[01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:30.193]  Dumbing down the presidency and ask him if he's read the deliberate dumbing down of America.
[01:38:30.193 --> 01:38:32.237]  I wish your listeners would do that.
[01:38:32.765 --> 01:38:33.405]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:38:33.405 --> 01:38:36.527]  I'm sure they will, but he probably knows what's going on and is celebrating.
[01:38:36.527 --> 01:38:43.151]  Well, he may, but if he got enough letters asking him that.
[01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:44.232]  I asked him myself.
[01:38:44.232 --> 01:38:50.396]  I said, I really would like to send you a copy, but for him to carry on, like, he really doesn't know where this came from.
[01:38:51.076 --> 01:38:53.379]  When your listeners could just, that's really so easy.
[01:38:53.379 --> 01:38:54.541]  You know, David?
[01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:56.002]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:38:56.002 --> 01:38:58.105]  The mainstream media is falling apart.
[01:38:58.105 --> 01:38:59.206]  They're illegitimate.
[01:38:59.206 --> 01:39:00.788]  I mean, sure, go ahead and contact him.
[01:39:00.788 --> 01:39:03.131]  I don't care if those scumbags cover us or not.
[01:39:03.131 --> 01:39:04.232]  We don't need them to cover us.
[01:39:04.232 --> 01:39:06.195]  We're going to discredit them fully.
[01:39:06.195 --> 01:39:09.138]  Their newspaper circulation is going through the ground.
[01:39:09.138 --> 01:39:10.059]  They're falling apart.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:14.443]  Uh, and you know why they, you know why they report everybody's dumbed down?
[01:39:14.443 --> 01:39:24.629]  They, they report and celebrate it to scare all the cattle into giving more property taxes and stuff to quote, pay for more education so they can dumb them and screw the kids up even more.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.280]  We're good.
[01:39:56.958 --> 01:39:57.719]  Age 80.
[01:39:57.719 --> 01:39:59.900]  Schools to work.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:03.242]  Charter schools have nothing to do with helping your child.
[01:40:03.242 --> 01:40:07.124]  It has to do with the feds actually regulating and taking control of private schools.
[01:40:07.124 --> 01:40:07.985]  Totally.
[01:40:07.985 --> 01:40:14.529]  I call it taxation without representation because charter schools do not have elected school boards.
[01:40:14.529 --> 01:40:15.710]  Watch out in Texas.
[01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:18.111]  Watch out everywhere for the charter schools.
[01:40:18.111 --> 01:40:20.933]  By the way, charter schools are being used in the Soviet Union.
[01:40:20.933 --> 01:40:21.974]  Excuse me, folks.
[01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:22.294]  Russia.
[01:40:23.013 --> 01:40:29.138]  Now, Charlotte, I want to expand on something I didn't have a chance to bring out here to people.
[01:40:29.138 --> 01:40:31.180]  No, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:45.327 --> 01:40:51.450]  You know, the larger issue is I don't even see myself as that intelligent, and I talk to people in government.
[01:40:51.450 --> 01:41:01.155]  I talk to people in companies, people who are successful, and they're only specialized in their one little area, and they are ignorant and dumbed down and don't know any history.
[01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:06.338]  And my dad was at a big consulting meeting a few years ago that his company paid for him to go to,
[01:41:07.034 --> 01:41:08.975]  And he called me from the Four Seasons here in Austin.
[01:41:08.975 --> 01:41:13.218]  He said, my God, this top CEO and consultant is admitting there's a New World Order.
[01:41:13.218 --> 01:41:15.600]  He had over-dumbed people down.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:22.144]  Now the challenge for the corporate people is to find folks that can still think, get the homeschoolers.
[01:41:22.144 --> 01:41:30.990]  And so what I'm hearing is there's a little bit of the elite worrying that they've over-damaged the population so bad that they can't even find minions that know how to function now.
[01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:36.814]  Well, I think it's true because the Wall Street Journal, which I basically detest because it supports Bush and all the neocons,
[01:41:37.134 --> 01:41:48.503]  But they did have an article about three years ago saying that the Ivy League colleges, the first applications that they looked at for entrance into those colleges came from
[01:41:50.047 --> 01:41:51.548]  Homeschool students.
[01:41:51.548 --> 01:41:56.651]  This is before Andover, Exeter, Dana Hall, whatever.
[01:41:56.651 --> 01:42:00.493]  Before any of the top public schools.
[01:42:00.493 --> 01:42:03.775]  The first applications are from homeschoolers.
[01:42:03.775 --> 01:42:13.000]  You know, for folks out there who may be a little worried or have been told by the controlled media and teachers, etc., that it's not a good idea to homeschool because you can't do it and all that.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.581]  They can't socialize.
[01:42:16.162 --> 01:42:16.883]  Remember that.
[01:42:16.883 --> 01:42:18.044]  This is what they're looking for.
[01:42:18.044 --> 01:42:18.985]  And you're right, Alex.
[01:42:18.985 --> 01:42:22.067]  They've got to... On the other hand, be careful.
[01:42:22.067 --> 01:42:30.375]  Be very, very careful, these homeschool students who get into Harvard and Yale, etc., because don't think that they're not going to brainwash your children to the hilt.
[01:42:31.494 --> 01:42:38.819]  Oh no, I've seen really smart homeschoolers go in, and within two years, they are just cyborgs of the New World Order.
[01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:39.600]  Absolutely!
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.520]  So watch out!
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.143]  Don't be excited because your homeschool child got accepted.
[01:42:45.143 --> 01:42:47.805]  Brainwashing can take place at any time in your life.
[01:42:47.805 --> 01:42:50.727]  They could even probably get a hold of you, Alex, or me.
[01:42:50.727 --> 01:42:52.989]  You know, and after maybe, how many years?
[01:42:52.989 --> 01:42:54.530]  150, each one of us, together 300.
[01:42:54.530 --> 01:43:00.174]  Well, they admit they tried to send Ventura, he didn't realize until later, to Harvard to brainwash him.
[01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:00.654]  It didn't work.
[01:43:01.457 --> 01:43:02.858]  Well, you know what?
[01:43:02.858 --> 01:43:06.319]  I'd be afraid to go up against him, too.
[01:43:06.319 --> 01:43:09.500]  He'd already been governor, and they said, oh, we want to bring you to Harvard for a year.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:15.603]  And then it was all these elitists trying to explain to him, you know, why they do all of this.
[01:43:15.603 --> 01:43:17.343]  That's great, you have information.
[01:43:17.343 --> 01:43:20.585]  I don't know anything about that, but I like Jesse Ventura, so anyway.
[01:43:20.585 --> 01:43:23.506]  Well, he came on the show and said 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:43:24.255 --> 01:43:25.436]  Well, don't we all know that?
[01:43:25.436 --> 01:43:27.317]  You know, even in Europe, it's getting out.
[01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:28.839]  I could tell you a little bit about Europe.
[01:43:28.839 --> 01:43:29.699]  Now, tell me about that.
[01:43:29.699 --> 01:43:34.863]  Yeah, well, in Europe, they don't look at you like you've got three years.
[01:43:34.863 --> 01:43:42.769]  And when you talk about it, they say it's pretty sad because they don't want to think this about this wonderful country that saved them from the Nazis.
[01:43:42.769 --> 01:43:44.831]  But anyway, after we get past that,
[01:43:45.995 --> 01:43:52.122]  Uh, they are willing to, uh, look into the information, like our Americans aren't.
[01:43:52.122 --> 01:43:57.187]  Oh, no, no, no, you're just, you're a kook, you're, you're, you hate Bush, you blah blah.
[01:43:57.187 --> 01:43:59.729]  But anyway, that's the way it is in Europe.
[01:43:59.729 --> 01:44:05.935]  Now, aside from the fact that they are really deep into the doo doo with their European Union,
[01:44:06.696 --> 01:44:09.196]  Thank God for Ireland last week.
[01:44:09.196 --> 01:44:13.577]  Oh, by the way, the European Union has officially said they're disregarding the referendum.
[01:44:13.577 --> 01:44:15.117]  The expansion will continue.
[01:44:15.117 --> 01:44:15.618]  Proof.
[01:44:15.618 --> 01:44:16.738]  Total tyrants.
[01:44:16.738 --> 01:44:18.198]  Illegitimate criminals.
[01:44:18.198 --> 01:44:19.918]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:44:19.918 --> 01:44:23.939]  But when you look at how the Europeans are living now, they're old.
[01:44:23.939 --> 01:44:25.799]  They're living high off the hog.
[01:44:25.799 --> 01:44:31.660]  They know there's a big problem with immigration, but they stay away from those nasty people coming across the borders.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.641]  And what I found fascinating, Alex, is I was there two
[01:44:36.764 --> 01:44:38.269]  Weeks.
[01:44:38.269 --> 01:44:39.795]  And maybe I just wasn't looking.
[01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:41.199]  I probably missed one.
[01:44:41.199 --> 01:44:43.226]  But I didn't see one police car.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.441]  I was in and around Brussels and in Holland.
[01:44:47.441 --> 01:44:59.046]  Well, yeah, the Europeans have already been assimilated and capitulated to tyranny, but you come to the U.S., I mean, it is cops, spies, they're tattletale squads just behind every bush.
[01:44:59.046 --> 01:45:00.826]  We don't, I mean, there aren't any there.
[01:45:00.826 --> 01:45:08.149]  In fact, one of my European relatives said, gee, you know, there are times when we really wish the police would come to our assistance.
[01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:12.411]  You know, sometimes someone could be being murdered in their community, they call the police, they just sit there.
[01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:13.892]  I don't do anything.
[01:45:13.892 --> 01:45:16.954]  And I said, well, we have just the opposite here.
[01:45:16.954 --> 01:45:20.778]  But I thought you'd be interested in hearing that.
[01:45:20.778 --> 01:45:30.125]  But what it is, Alex, I always said to my husband, Belgian, Balenciaga, wonderful patriot, I used to say, look, they're not going to take Europe.
[01:45:30.125 --> 01:45:34.409]  They're not going to take... They've already taken Europe with the European Union, but they don't know it.
[01:45:34.409 --> 01:45:38.012]  But they're not going to impose a police state there.
[01:45:38.012 --> 01:45:39.473]  They have to take us first.
[01:45:40.347 --> 01:45:46.632]  We'll go down, boom, which we're doing right now, and then the rest of the world will fall like dominoes.
[01:45:46.632 --> 01:45:48.654]  And that's exactly what we're looking at now.
[01:45:48.654 --> 01:45:52.337]  There's no place else in the world now, possibly, with the exception of China.
[01:45:53.317 --> 01:46:03.223]  Maybe in Russia now and a bit, maybe in Africa, but where there's such a consistent, pervasive element of control, police control.
[01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:10.588]  Oh yeah, and the population is just starting to figure it out, but there's all the billboards and TV ads worshipping the corrupt system.
[01:46:10.588 --> 01:46:18.993]  I mean, how do the police think that tattletale squads and kids being trained to tattle on their parents and by law all the computer repairmen have to spy on you?
[01:46:18.993 --> 01:46:19.473]  That's right.
[01:46:19.693 --> 01:46:23.855]  Well, you know, where so much of this came from, it started with the D.A.R.E.
[01:46:23.855 --> 01:46:29.138]  program, the Drug and Resistant Education out of the Department of Justice.
[01:46:29.138 --> 01:46:34.360]  Then it morphed into the COPS program, Community Oriented Policing System.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.222]  That was the spying on the parents.
[01:46:38.222 --> 01:46:42.644]  All of this came out of a public school curriculum, basically.
[01:46:42.644 --> 01:46:43.305]  The D.A.R.E.
[01:46:43.305 --> 01:46:43.765]  program
[01:46:44.642 --> 01:46:45.723]  It all came out of there!
[01:46:45.723 --> 01:46:46.923]  Did you know that, Alex?
[01:46:46.923 --> 01:46:58.209]  Yeah, and studies show that seeing the drugs made the children actually want to use it, and drug use exploded because, you know, you're teaching five, uh, fifth graders, sixth graders, here's this, here's that, it does that.
[01:46:58.209 --> 01:47:00.310]  It was introducing them, really, to the products.
[01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:05.292]  It was like somebody coming in and showing them Tupperware, you know, kind of for like a little party or something.
[01:47:05.292 --> 01:47:06.193]  Uh, but, uh,
[01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:10.230]  And they moved the police into the schools too.
[01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:10.790]  With the D.A.R.E.
[01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:12.190]  program, the police came into the schools.
[01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:15.412]  And now it's institutionalized, now they're little prisons.
[01:47:15.412 --> 01:47:18.313]  But this is the point I forgot to make earlier.
[01:47:18.313 --> 01:47:23.316]  The feds come in and they say, we're going to federally certify your police training.
[01:47:24.686 --> 01:47:25.266]  30 years ago.
[01:47:25.266 --> 01:47:35.211]  Then the police kill more people, kill more of themselves, cause more problems, and the feds swoop in as the good guys to then punish the local police and further federalize them.
[01:47:35.211 --> 01:47:45.095]  And then, so again, they always create the crisis, then offer their solution that makes it worse, and they've got another thing that, you know, we'll just do this, and then that makes it worse.
[01:47:45.095 --> 01:47:46.556]  Then they say, we'll just do this.
[01:47:46.556 --> 01:47:49.177]  It's the same thing with education, and they brag and they know it.
[01:47:49.657 --> 01:47:53.239]  And, of course, the average well-meaning cop, he doesn't understand what's happening.
[01:47:53.239 --> 01:47:55.321]  He doesn't know where even his state capitol is.
[01:47:55.321 --> 01:47:56.481]  He's like the general public.
[01:47:56.481 --> 01:47:56.942]  That's right.
[01:47:56.942 --> 01:47:59.383]  You know, he goes home and drools in front of the television set.
[01:47:59.383 --> 01:48:04.346]  I mean, literally, they're stealing people's souls.
[01:48:04.346 --> 01:48:05.767]  They don't have imaginations.
[01:48:05.767 --> 01:48:06.568]  They're not happy.
[01:48:06.568 --> 01:48:12.251]  I mean, that's the greatest crime in all of this, is that the public are basically becoming zombies.
[01:48:12.251 --> 01:48:13.232]  Have you noticed?
[01:48:13.232 --> 01:48:18.135]  Oh, yeah, well, you see, when I came back, I have to say, I know this is a real extreme
[01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:19.802]  I don't know.
[01:48:40.017 --> 01:48:45.480]  And it's a very much more civilized... Yeah, we're now the crass pig people.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:56.286]  We are, and I was going to say, and I think I can say this now that you said something even worse almost, it was like comparing angels to apes.
[01:48:56.286 --> 01:49:04.490]  They're not angels over there, you know, there are a lot of bad people over there as well, but the difference is really, it's pretty stark.
[01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:05.431]  Over here we're apes.
[01:49:06.298 --> 01:49:09.341]  Over there, they still believe in being quite polite.
[01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:14.505]  They still, when you go through Homeland Security, think it's a lot easier to take your shoes off.
[01:49:14.505 --> 01:49:15.465]  They're very polite.
[01:49:15.465 --> 01:49:16.386]  We're very sorry.
[01:49:16.386 --> 01:49:17.927]  We have to go look in your purse.
[01:49:17.927 --> 01:49:20.209]  Yeah, well, that's about humiliation.
[01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:24.292]  I mean, here it's about domestic, I mean, folks scanning your naked body.
[01:49:24.292 --> 01:49:26.434]  It's about getting a record of it, humiliating you.
[01:49:26.434 --> 01:49:28.996]  Making you take shoes off and walk through athlete's foot.
[01:49:28.996 --> 01:49:30.117]  It's about humiliation.
[01:49:30.117 --> 01:49:31.298]  It's dog training.
[01:49:31.938 --> 01:49:32.538]  Exactly.
[01:49:32.538 --> 01:49:33.698]  And how about that woman?
[01:49:33.698 --> 01:49:34.599]  You probably saw it.
[01:49:34.599 --> 01:49:37.459]  That woman from Jamaica who had mental problems.
[01:49:37.459 --> 01:49:41.880]  They let her die in that clinic or whatever in Brooklyn.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:42.720]  Did you read that?
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.320]  Yeah, of course.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.661]  She's gotta die.
[01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:46.141]  I mean, they let her die.
[01:49:46.141 --> 01:49:49.802]  She was in the waiting room for I don't know how many hours dying.
[01:49:49.802 --> 01:49:57.663]  And they looked at her and they just walked by her and then later on someone kicked her to see if she was still moving and they found out she's dead.
[01:49:57.663 --> 01:49:58.283]  Well, exactly.
[01:49:58.283 --> 01:50:01.364]  We've now seen all these videos in the U.S., Canada, and England.
[01:50:02.202 --> 01:50:07.226]  Where a person will be hit in front of 500 people on the road, they'll just keep walking.
[01:50:07.226 --> 01:50:11.749]  They're so self-centered, they don't realize they're destroying their own future.
[01:50:11.749 --> 01:50:13.310]  It's the same thing.
[01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:17.293]  You go to public school, kids disappear into the criminal system for no reason.
[01:50:17.293 --> 01:50:18.814]  Your neighbor's kids get snatched.
[01:50:18.814 --> 01:50:20.776]  Your kids are dying of leukemia.
[01:50:20.776 --> 01:50:25.039]  Everybody's dying of cancer because of the GMO and the genetic engineering.
[01:50:25.039 --> 01:50:27.621]  Again, the plague is all around us, folks.
[01:50:28.041 --> 01:50:28.982]  It is a big idea.
[01:50:53.129 --> 01:50:54.890]  A New World Order.
[01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:59.451]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:59.451 --> 01:51:02.612]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:02.612 --> 01:51:05.393]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:51:05.393 --> 01:51:08.574]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:08.574 --> 01:51:15.897]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:18.928 --> 01:51:24.372]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:24.372 --> 01:51:28.234]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:28.234 --> 01:51:30.816]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:51:30.816 --> 01:51:31.977]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:32.757]  They're not after money.
[01:51:32.757 --> 01:51:34.038]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:34.038 --> 01:51:34.639]  They're after power.
[01:51:34.639 --> 01:51:36.160]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:59.332]  Of course, we haven't covered chemical brain damage.
[01:53:59.332 --> 01:54:00.252]  That's the main thing.
[01:54:00.252 --> 01:54:02.874]  It's the sodium fluoride, the mercury.
[01:54:02.874 --> 01:54:11.798]  And I found, 80 years ago, all these top British bioethics people, the eugenicists, said, we're gonna shoot them up with mercury and brain damage the public.
[01:54:11.798 --> 01:54:14.119]  We won't take it, and then they'll be our subservients.
[01:54:14.119 --> 01:54:17.021]  Because they'd already found how bad it'd attack brain tissue.
[01:54:17.967 --> 01:54:22.450]  And they're just gonna do it to you, and you're gonna roll your sleeve up and keep assaulting your kids with it.
[01:54:22.450 --> 01:54:26.152]  You got mothers who are 5'5 and their daughter's 6'1.
[01:54:26.152 --> 01:54:27.353]  That isn't genetics, folks.
[01:54:27.353 --> 01:54:31.615]  It's all the growth hormone and the meat and poultry, the milk you give them.
[01:54:31.615 --> 01:54:32.275]  You don't care!
[01:54:32.275 --> 01:54:40.380]  You know, the fact that women have got seven times increase in lung cancer, more than a dozen times increase in breast cancer.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.601]  It's what's in the environment.
[01:54:41.601 --> 01:54:43.642]  You're having, you're under eugenics attack.
[01:54:43.642 --> 01:54:44.843]  Charlotte, Israel, be in closing.
[01:54:45.833 --> 01:54:51.000]  Charlotte, you're just a great resource in your time at the Department of Education, witnessing all this.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.229]  In closing, their whole eugenics angle, how much of your research brought you into the fact that that's the overarching system?
[01:54:58.002 --> 01:55:06.253]  Well, it's very scary now what's happening, and I am informed about a lot that's going on that I really can't make public right now.
[01:55:06.253 --> 01:55:08.896]  Oh, excuse me?
[01:55:08.896 --> 01:55:09.517]  Excuse me?
[01:55:09.517 --> 01:55:13.201]  You know, that piqued my interest.
[01:55:13.201 --> 01:55:14.223]  Tell me what's going on.
[01:55:14.223 --> 01:55:16.325]  Well, bad stuff that I could tell you later, Alex.
[01:55:17.287 --> 01:55:20.769]  We get more involved, but it's very, very dangerous what's going on.
[01:55:20.769 --> 01:55:21.730]  Well, give us a hint.
[01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:23.691]  Tell us what you found out from government.
[01:55:23.691 --> 01:55:28.494]  Their goal is to, well, not really from government.
[01:55:28.494 --> 01:55:30.516]  It's the same old crowd.
[01:55:30.516 --> 01:55:39.782]  They want the perfect Soviet man, and if they can't do it through education, they're probably going to do it through genetic engineering, and I think you know that.
[01:55:39.782 --> 01:55:42.504]  I would like to point out that for your listeners,
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:56:04.933]  You know, my website's great, DeliverItComingDown.com, but you should really, in order to get a hold of the Reese Committee hearings, which were absolutely banned in 1953, the congressional hearings, which exposed the role of the Tax Exempt Foundation in changing our country to where we are now, so we could be merged, in quotes, with the Soviet Union, that's official.
[01:56:05.859 --> 01:56:08.481]  You go to americandeception.com.
[01:56:08.481 --> 01:56:20.708]  You've got the one copy that was left available, I bought, of the Reeves Committee hearings in regard to the role of the foundations in changing our country through the schools and through war, etc.
[01:56:22.029 --> 01:56:30.094]  Please, folks, go there, read those hearings, AmericanDeception.com, and type in Reist Committee or Norman Dodd.
[01:56:30.094 --> 01:56:30.735]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:30.735 --> 01:56:32.776]  For people in the system, don't roll your eyes.
[01:56:32.776 --> 01:56:36.118]  Go read how you're being savage, how this is being done.
[01:56:36.118 --> 01:56:37.900]  Hey, Charlotte, you've got to tell me more.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:39.501]  I know you have a lot of sources.
[01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:42.703]  You know, your dad was Skull and Bones in Bohemian Grove.
[01:56:44.264 --> 01:56:47.626]  I mean, you're not a lightweight yourself there in the Foreign Service.
[01:56:47.626 --> 01:56:51.388]  I mean, you're saying you have sources about how they plan the genetic engineering.
[01:56:51.388 --> 01:56:55.890]  They're already saying they're not going to let you have kids if your, quote, genetics aren't right.
[01:56:55.890 --> 01:57:02.974]  They know that they're saying behaviorally they're going to say aggression, resistance to tyranny is a mental illness, screening out the embryos.
[01:57:02.974 --> 01:57:04.615]  Is that what you're talking about?
[01:57:04.615 --> 01:57:11.719]  I think it's very important that you keep hanging in there with that one, Alex, and I will definitely be in touch with you about it, okay?
[01:57:12.299 --> 01:57:19.362]  It's simply that there's no way we can go out with any information like this until we've got all our ducks in a row.
[01:57:19.362 --> 01:57:24.325]  But is this, I mean, when did you learn about this?
[01:57:24.325 --> 01:57:30.487]  I've been watching it for many years, but just recently I've become very concerned.
[01:57:30.487 --> 01:57:34.289]  Well, as soon as you're ready, will you call us first and come on and break it here?
[01:57:34.289 --> 01:57:35.610]  You know it.
[01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:37.211]  I'd like to be able to do it now, but I can't.
[01:57:37.211 --> 01:57:37.991]  But I will.
[01:57:37.991 --> 01:57:39.091]  I will call you first.
[01:57:39.091 --> 01:57:40.312]  How long, Charlotte, do you think?
[01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:42.970]  Couple of months, probably.
[01:57:42.970 --> 01:57:45.651]  Okay, Charlotte Iserby, DeliberateDumbingDown.com.
[01:57:45.651 --> 01:57:48.592]  Give out the other one that has all those documents.
[01:57:48.592 --> 01:57:50.113]  AmericanDeception.com.
[01:57:50.113 --> 01:57:51.493]  That's easy.
[01:57:51.493 --> 01:57:54.234]  Charlotte, we can only thank you with a great debt.
[01:57:54.234 --> 01:57:55.374]  I want to have you back up for longer.
[01:57:55.374 --> 01:58:01.976]  There's a call soon for putting out the Deliberate Dumbing Down, the e-book there for folks, for all the research.
[01:58:01.976 --> 01:58:02.937]  It's all there, folks.
[01:58:02.937 --> 01:58:05.377]  What we've told you is incontrovertible.
[01:58:05.377 --> 01:58:06.738]  They are matters of fact.
[01:58:07.438 --> 01:58:09.960]  Uh, this is not, uh, you know, any flight of fancy.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.441]  This is the reality.
[01:58:11.441 --> 01:58:15.264]  You are under scientific military genius attack.
[01:58:15.264 --> 01:58:16.965]  You are being slaughtered.
[01:58:16.965 --> 01:58:19.366]  Charlotte, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:19.366 --> 01:58:20.007]  You're welcome.
[01:58:20.007 --> 01:58:21.248]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:58:21.248 --> 01:58:21.728]  Take care.
[01:58:21.728 --> 01:58:22.729]  Thank all your listeners.
[01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:23.429]  Bye-bye.
[01:58:23.429 --> 01:58:24.450]  She's the best.
[01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:26.471]  Okay, get her book right now on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:26.471 --> 01:58:27.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:31.769 --> 01:58:34.391]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:41.317 --> 01:58:44.760]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:47.302]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:58:47.302 --> 01:58:48.484]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:58:48.484 --> 01:58:50.165]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:58:50.165 --> 01:58:58.112]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:58:58.112 --> 01:59:05.739]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own doorstep.
[01:59:05.899 --> 01:59:06.900]  I'm an inside job!
[01:59:15.023 --> 01:59:17.444]  How dare you?
[01:59:17.444 --> 01:59:22.525]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:22.525 --> 01:59:25.246]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:25.246 --> 01:59:31.648]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[01:59:31.648 --> 01:59:34.729]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:59:34.729 --> 01:59:36.989]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:59:36.989 --> 01:59:39.450]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:59:42.631 --> 01:59:45.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.016 --> 01:59:47.781]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:54.847 --> 01:59:56.589]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:58.190]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.190 --> 01:59:59.732]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:59.732 --> 02:00:03.916]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.916 --> 02:00:08.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:16.507]  Richard C. Hoagland, maiden voyage with us, Dark Mission, the secret history of NASA.
[02:00:16.507 --> 02:00:20.411]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next segment for an hour and a half.
[02:00:21.829 --> 02:00:33.796]  Then we have the NFL football player that walked across the nation, raised $2 million for firemen and police, emergency workers on 9-11 who didn't get treatment for the toxic dust inhalation.
[02:00:33.796 --> 02:00:35.157]  That is coming up.
[02:00:35.157 --> 02:00:37.298]  A few plugs right now.
[02:00:37.298 --> 02:00:39.440]  Truth Rising.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.283]  Truth Rising, ladies and gentlemen, cost me, I don't know, around $70,000 to make.
[02:00:44.283 --> 02:00:48.385]  Printing out the DVDs, another $10,000 or so.
[02:00:48.385 --> 02:00:50.827]  And all I want is it to be seen.
[02:00:50.827 --> 02:00:51.367]  That's our goal.
[02:00:52.635 --> 02:00:55.456]  And it seems it's kind of a reverse psychology.
[02:00:55.456 --> 02:01:05.438]  You say, hey, you know, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, get my weekly TV report, get my in-studio live interviews we do.
[02:01:05.438 --> 02:01:10.419]  We're about to do one with Richard C. Hoagland for the next hour and a half, and then the NFL football player.
[02:01:10.419 --> 02:01:14.279]  That'll be live streaming video for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:01:14.279 --> 02:01:17.840]  And then we'll also, of course,
[02:01:20.765 --> 02:01:26.207]  Post that on PrisonPlanet.com within an hour, so you can watch it at your leisure.
[02:01:26.207 --> 02:01:31.730]  You get extended extras that aren't on the DVDs of all my films, like Endgame 1.5.
[02:01:31.730 --> 02:01:38.413]  But the reverse psychology is sometimes I say, you know, hey, just burn all the copies you want, make all the copies you want, and then it's like, oh, well, that doesn't have any value.
[02:01:38.413 --> 02:01:40.674]  Well, why should I care?
[02:01:40.674 --> 02:01:44.095]  The value is waking people up.
[02:01:44.095 --> 02:01:45.236]  That's the whole goal here.
[02:01:45.236 --> 02:01:46.236]  Don't take this for granted.
[02:01:49.269 --> 02:01:52.251]  Tomorrow night, we always put stuff out a few hours early.
[02:01:52.251 --> 02:01:54.612]  We're gonna release Truth Rising.
[02:01:54.612 --> 02:01:58.254]  So just watch PrisonPlanet.tv, watch that space.
[02:01:58.254 --> 02:02:05.418]  We're gonna have a DivX version with simple instructions if you want to burn it to disk, not just DVD.
[02:02:05.418 --> 02:02:08.059]  And it's high quality, and it's good quality to give to people.
[02:02:08.059 --> 02:02:09.860]  And most DVD players now have DivX on them.
[02:02:11.838 --> 02:02:14.419]  But you'll be able to watch it in a bunch of other formats.
[02:02:14.419 --> 02:02:15.079]  It'll be simple.
[02:02:15.079 --> 02:02:16.480]  Just click on it and play it.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:23.742]  Just if you want to burn copies, we're designing it to be a factory of resistance to really get the word out.
[02:02:23.742 --> 02:02:27.404]  We're doing everything we can to wake up as many people as we can.
[02:02:27.404 --> 02:02:29.324]  And I'm really proud of this film.
[02:02:29.324 --> 02:02:30.765]  It's an amazing documentary.
[02:02:30.765 --> 02:02:36.287]  It's cinema vérité, which in French means the cinema of truth.
[02:02:36.287 --> 02:02:37.808]  And by that, just the camera lens.
[02:02:37.808 --> 02:02:38.728]  There's no voiceover.
[02:02:39.782 --> 02:02:43.745]  And the film has a lot of evidence of how 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:02:43.745 --> 02:02:45.346]  I'd say 20% of the film is about that.
[02:02:45.346 --> 02:02:48.529]  30% is about the first responders and the cover-up.
[02:02:48.529 --> 02:02:52.592]  And the rest, the other half, is about activism and tyranny.
[02:02:52.592 --> 02:02:55.534]  You see the police coming up and saying, we're going to say you have bombs.
[02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.616]  It's illustrating that incredible tyranny.
[02:02:57.616 --> 02:02:59.317]  That they want to violate the First Amendment.
[02:02:59.317 --> 02:03:02.980]  This is a very important film and it's going to wake a lot of people up.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:03.941]  And it needs to be seen.
[02:03:05.743 --> 02:03:08.647]  So please order the DVD right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:08.647 --> 02:03:11.271]  They'll be shipping out Saturday and Monday.
[02:03:11.271 --> 02:03:14.415]  They are now here with us.
[02:03:14.415 --> 02:03:15.497]  We need to get them out to people.
[02:03:16.707 --> 02:03:21.830]  Or starting tomorrow night and into the 4th of July at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:24.131]  And please, get it out to everyone.
[02:03:24.131 --> 02:03:27.633]  And get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership and see it in super high quality.
[02:03:27.633 --> 02:03:31.535]  Obviously in a few days afterwards it'll be on the web and that's fine, we want it to be.
[02:03:31.535 --> 02:03:33.196]  But high quality.
[02:03:33.196 --> 02:03:39.660]  This deserves to be seen in full quality, plus we need some capital so we can continue to make films.
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:41.641]  But the main goal is getting it out.
[02:03:41.641 --> 02:03:44.703]  In closing for this little segment, we're coming back with Richard Hoagland.
[02:03:45.262 --> 02:03:51.684]  I want to tell you about something that really is getting the word out, and that's New World Order trading cards.
[02:03:51.684 --> 02:04:05.369]  I'm holding in my hand New World Order trading cards, the Bilderberg Group, Henry Kissinger, Queen Beatrix, Dick Cheney, Jim Tucker, Alex Jones, Cindy Sheehan, Jerome Corsi, Riddles and Stone, G. Edward Griffin, Sherry Peele Jackson,

[02:04:15.007 --> 02:04:16.830]  They're so nicely done.

[02:08:23.769 --> 02:08:25.090]  Very excited about that.
[02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:27.430]  My first cinema verite film.
[02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:28.871]  Turned out better than I thought it would.
[02:08:28.871 --> 02:08:30.011]  It's excellent.
[02:08:30.011 --> 02:08:33.872]  I was coming back from Bilderberg Group about a month ago.
[02:08:34.975 --> 02:08:45.839]  There in Virginia, and I was in the airport, and there were all these mindless neocon books and mainline stuff and nothing interesting, and I saw Dark Mission, the secret history of NASA.
[02:08:45.839 --> 02:08:56.602]  And I have a friend who was an engineer at NASA, and actually on the flight line, you know, there in mission control for some of the Apollo missions, and he said, running some of the RCA cameras, he said, you ought to read Dark Mission.
[02:08:56.602 --> 02:08:57.562]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:08:57.562 --> 02:08:59.683]  Years ago, a few years ago,
[02:09:00.475 --> 02:09:16.066]  And I picked it up and I read it, and so much, everything that I had done my own separate research or run into or seen historically in mainline history, you know, the occult, you name it, everything Richard Hoagland was saying was accurate.
[02:09:16.066 --> 02:09:24.632]  And then, there are a lot of areas in there that's his original research, and so, if everything you know checks out, then it really freaks you out.
[02:09:24.632 --> 02:09:25.793]  You say, this sounds credible.
[02:09:27.962 --> 02:09:40.567]  And, uh, really a frightening book, because having a shadow government, having an elite where they have suppressed advanced technologies, we know they have that, they've been caught many times, who knows what's really going on?
[02:09:40.567 --> 02:09:43.588]  You know, that's the bigger issue is, we can't trust them.
[02:09:43.588 --> 02:09:53.812]  And they've been caught lying so much, and this book gets into Alistair Crowley and all these people being involved in the founding of NASA, which is really mainline history the average person doesn't know, and JPL, and
[02:09:54.412 --> 02:10:05.605]  The rest of it, uh, that I couldn't put the book down, Dark Mission, New York Times Bestseller, I guess other people couldn't put it down either, and he's got a new edition of it out, and I'm telling you, this is just an amazing book.
[02:10:05.605 --> 02:10:10.050]  By the way, I'm not selling the book, and we have a bookstore online, but I'm not selling the book.
[02:10:10.050 --> 02:10:12.954]  I'm saying you really should get the book, and
[02:10:13.607 --> 02:10:17.029]  You know, whether it's all true or whether all of his ideas are right, I don't know.
[02:10:17.029 --> 02:10:21.251]  But, you know, he's got quite a pedigree, and he's a really nice fellow, too.
[02:10:21.251 --> 02:10:29.656]  Richard C. Hoagland was science advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS News during the Apollo program, former curator of the Hayden Planetarium and consultant to NASA.
[02:10:29.656 --> 02:10:31.537]  He is the co-originator, along with Eric
[02:10:32.217 --> 02:10:43.003]  Burgress of the British Interplanetary Society, of the Pioneer plaque, you know that gold plaque they sent out, currently carrying a message for mankind on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft.
[02:10:43.003 --> 02:10:47.846]  And it goes on and on and on, all the things he's done in the Enterprise Institute.
[02:10:47.846 --> 02:10:53.449]  He heads up, and of course he's one of the most popular long-term guests on Coast to Coast AM.
[02:10:53.449 --> 02:10:57.192]  So we go to Richard C. Hoagland right now.
[02:10:57.192 --> 02:11:01.014]  Richard Hoagland, it is just wonderful to have you on the show with us, sir.
[02:11:01.654 --> 02:11:07.179]  Alex, thank you so much for inviting me, and I must say I'm really happy to be here.
[02:11:07.179 --> 02:11:08.620]  Well, I'm happy to have you, sir.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:09.601]  You're the expert on all this.
[02:11:09.601 --> 02:11:11.482]  First, tell us a little bit about Richard Hugglin.
[02:11:11.482 --> 02:11:29.117]  Believe it or not, some of my audience may not know who you are, and your saga, your awakening, and then I want to get into the crazy, admitted, this is something you can prove, history of NASA, skip forward to the kidnappings and what would be murders and crazy women running around and the wheels coming off NASA, as you put it.
[02:11:30.224 --> 02:11:36.849]  And then we'll go back into the secret government, the masonic flags, and all the really crazy stuff.
[02:11:36.849 --> 02:11:42.592]  Well, you know, you and I, and a lot of other people, have had an evolution, kind of a maturing.
[02:11:42.592 --> 02:11:54.340]  You know, we both grew up, I'm absolutely convinced, even though I don't know your story chapter by chapter, but I'm convinced you grew up like me, believing in, you know, truth, justice, the American way.
[02:11:55.410 --> 02:12:20.889]  And that we lived in the best country in the world and it was founded by people that had some amazing ideas and it was the freest and it allowed people the widest diversity and it's only as you grow older and you start asking difficult questions and you pull up the corners of the rug and you kind of look under that you realize that that is a very carefully kept facade
[02:12:21.775 --> 02:12:28.720]  That, in fact, society we live in now bears no resemblance to what we were taught in school.
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:32.662]  And about all the silly and stupid things, yes, we're free.
[02:12:32.662 --> 02:12:36.325]  About all the important things, Alex, we're not free.
[02:12:36.325 --> 02:12:40.988]  And the thing that will make you free is to not believe what you're told.
[02:12:40.988 --> 02:12:42.469]  It's as simple as that.
[02:12:42.469 --> 02:12:48.813]  So when I started out, squeaky clean mainstream, you know, Cronkite, NASA, museums, science, and all that.
[02:12:49.699 --> 02:13:04.591]  And I came through a series of deep, penetrating questions to the belief that not only have we been lied to by NASA about almost everything that they've told us that's out there, but we've been told lies about everything that means everything to anybody.
[02:13:04.591 --> 02:13:05.932]  And there's almost no limit.
[02:13:05.932 --> 02:13:12.658]  I mean, the kind of watchword, the mantra of the dark mission, is the lie is different at every level.
[02:13:13.672 --> 02:13:22.017]  And I was given that by an intel officer, who has been one of my dark, deep sources for years and years, who has never steered me wrong.
[02:13:22.017 --> 02:13:26.800]  So you're saying, wheels within wheels, lies within lies, piled on the next one.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:29.302]  To maintain the illusion.
[02:13:29.302 --> 02:13:32.964]  And of course, this audience is well familiar with your work.
[02:13:32.964 --> 02:13:40.849]  So we can skip all the stuff that I normally have to do to bring people up the curve, and today it might be useful to explore why.
[02:13:41.587 --> 02:13:43.047]  What the hell's the endgame?
[02:13:43.047 --> 02:13:44.668]  What's the point?
[02:13:44.668 --> 02:13:47.369]  Why lead people down the primrose path?
[02:13:47.369 --> 02:13:49.930]  Where did we go off the path?
[02:13:49.930 --> 02:13:51.710]  And how can we get back on the path?
[02:13:51.710 --> 02:13:55.391]  Because I firmly believe that we are not powerless.
[02:13:55.391 --> 02:13:57.852]  That we actually can change this curve.
[02:13:57.852 --> 02:14:01.373]  That we are masters of our own fate, captains of our destiny.
[02:14:02.082 --> 02:14:04.764]  But we have to wake up a lot more people.
[02:14:04.764 --> 02:14:07.587]  It really only takes about 2%, Alex, to change history.
[02:14:07.587 --> 02:14:08.748]  Well, you're right, Richard Hoagland.
[02:14:08.748 --> 02:14:10.930]  Can we go back, though, to your first awakenings?
[02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:14.893]  I mean, when did you start at NASA and at CBS and a big curator?
[02:14:14.893 --> 02:14:18.616]  And, you know, designing what's sent off in spacecraft.
[02:14:18.616 --> 02:14:20.217]  You know, a big conceptual guy.
[02:14:20.217 --> 02:14:22.059]  When did you start going, something's wrong here?
[02:14:22.759 --> 02:14:27.741]  Okay, oh gosh, how many hours have we got?
[02:14:27.741 --> 02:14:38.524]  I started out, you know, school and the museum, and I was kind of a prodigy, and I was the youngest curator in the United States for a while, because I grew out of that one.
[02:14:38.524 --> 02:14:52.008]  And, you know, when you're 18 and in a museum, and the mayor is calling you in for advice on how to increase revenues in the city through cultural diversity and all that, it gives you a kind of heavy feeling you can do anything.
[02:14:52.785 --> 02:14:55.107]  So I would pick up the phone, and I would call anybody in the country.
[02:14:55.107 --> 02:14:56.348]  I'd call people at NASA.
[02:14:56.348 --> 02:14:58.129]  I'd call people in the government.
[02:14:58.129 --> 02:15:01.631]  I'd call people in the military, the Pentagon.
[02:15:01.631 --> 02:15:05.294]  And they would answer, and they would give me answers, and they would return calls and all that.
[02:15:05.294 --> 02:15:12.539]  And I finally went to a couple of museums, and I was assistant curator in Hartford, West Harbor, Connecticut.
[02:15:12.539 --> 02:15:19.384]  And one day, I got a call, and the voice at the other end of the line said, My name is Frank Benitez.
[02:15:19.384 --> 02:15:22.226]  I'm an associate producer of CBS News special events.
[02:15:22.833 --> 02:15:25.695]  We'd like you to help us go to the moon.
[02:15:25.695 --> 02:15:30.397]  And like that great line in Bill Cosby's routine, I said, come on, who is this?
[02:15:30.397 --> 02:15:32.078]  Really?
[02:15:32.078 --> 02:15:35.680]  And it turned out to be Frank Benitez from CBS News.
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:48.867]  And so I went and had the most extraordinary education at CBS News from 1968, just before the first Apollo 8 mission around the moon, to the early 1970s.
[02:15:48.867 --> 02:15:49.128]  71, I believe.
[02:15:52.689 --> 02:16:00.355]  Um, and I'm sure I learned far more than I imparted, because I saw how big media works.
[02:16:00.355 --> 02:16:11.124]  I saw how the Tiffany Network, you know, the legendary, you know, legacy of Murrow, actually worked in its heyday.
[02:16:11.124 --> 02:16:15.648]  When Walter came back from Vietnam, looked in the camera and said, it's lost.
[02:16:16.318 --> 02:16:21.100]  And, you know, Nixon and Agnew said to each other, well, we've lost them.
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:22.540]  You know, the war has to end.
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:25.061]  If we lost Walter, we've lost the country.
[02:16:25.061 --> 02:16:33.845]  I was so privileged to work with a man of integrity, a guy who actually believed the things that he was writing about and reporting on.
[02:16:33.845 --> 02:16:37.226]  Remember when Walter was the one dissident voice during the first Gulf War?
[02:16:41.167 --> 02:16:49.254]  How he was, he was a voice of reason saying all we're seeing is basically a scripted television plot.
[02:16:49.254 --> 02:16:56.340]  We're not allowed, you know, remember the media, that was before they came up with the idea of embedding reporters so that they basically could watch them 24-7.
[02:16:56.340 --> 02:17:04.446]  And there were a couple of guys that struck out across the desert and tried to find independent information and got caught by Saddam and all that.
[02:17:04.446 --> 02:17:06.188]  Well, Walter was one of the only voices.
[02:17:06.764 --> 02:17:15.168]  To basically raise questions about this rah-rah, we're going to go beat this bad guy, you know, the new Neo-Hitler.
[02:17:15.168 --> 02:17:19.691]  Anyway, so back when I was working for him, I learned about sourcing.
[02:17:19.691 --> 02:17:22.032]  I learned the journalism side.
[02:17:22.032 --> 02:17:30.956]  I knew the science side, but I really learned journalism at the feet of a guy who really was a master.
[02:17:30.956 --> 02:17:34.638]  And I started looking around, and I remember one vivid day.
[02:17:34.638 --> 02:17:36.259]  You want to know the moment, Alex, when
[02:17:36.866 --> 02:17:41.307]  I began to realize that the facade was not what it was supposed to be.
[02:17:41.307 --> 02:17:43.928]  Yeah, tell me that lightbulb moment.
[02:17:43.928 --> 02:17:45.808]  It was very early on.
[02:17:45.808 --> 02:18:01.291]  It was critical, and if I hadn't been asked by the Cronkite people to be there and help them create this extravaganza to show people what it was like to go to the moon, I wouldn't have had a lightbulb moment or it would have come a lot later.
[02:18:01.291 --> 02:18:03.492]  It was on a Sunday afternoon.
[02:18:04.423 --> 02:18:07.484]  There were a bunch of us sitting around in Bob Whistler's office.
[02:18:07.484 --> 02:18:10.805]  Bob Whistler was the executive producer of CBS Special Events.
[02:18:10.805 --> 02:18:14.967]  He went on to become president of CBS News for a while.
[02:18:14.967 --> 02:18:21.329]  Then he went and helped Ted Turner set up his network, which was called CNN.
[02:18:21.329 --> 02:18:24.070]  Anyway, Whistler was a child prodigy.
[02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:29.212]  He was a brilliant guy, very egocentric, very... I mean, in order to be in that position, you gotta be, right?
[02:18:30.891 --> 02:18:46.280]  And we were sitting around in his office, you know, he had the cabinet open and there was some, you know, liquor flowing around and we're just kind of watching the news conference that was supposed to be coming in from Houston by satellite from the astronauts.
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:50.862]  I forget which crew was coming back from the moon.
[02:18:50.862 --> 02:18:52.223]  I think it was Apollo 8.
[02:18:52.223 --> 02:18:53.184]  It had to be Apollo 8.
[02:18:53.184 --> 02:18:54.724]  So it was December of 1968.
[02:18:56.624 --> 02:19:06.868]  And we're sitting around and there's, you know, a couple of producers and a researcher and me and Lester and, you know, some people shuffling papers and bringing in stuff from the rest of the office.
[02:19:06.868 --> 02:19:13.570]  And we're just kind of, you know, we're kind of laid back because our correspondent there in Houston was going to ask the questions during the uplink.
[02:19:13.570 --> 02:19:19.992]  This was the first time they were going to actually allow correspondents to talk to astronauts directly.
[02:19:19.992 --> 02:19:25.114]  Okay, I want to hear about this on the other side of the break with Richard C. Hoagland.
[02:19:26.064 --> 02:19:30.586]  We're going to skip the break after that for behind the scenes at presentplanet.tv.
[02:19:30.586 --> 02:19:32.687]  We'll be back in just a few minutes with Richard C. Hoagland.
[02:19:32.687 --> 02:19:36.569]  Then we're going to get into the beginning of NASA.
[02:19:36.569 --> 02:19:44.653]  The three groups that made up the founding of NASA, which is a creature of the president, a creature of the executive branch.
[02:19:49.318 --> 02:19:50.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:56.806]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:56.806 --> 02:19:57.627]  That's right.
[02:19:57.627 --> 02:20:00.470]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:20:00.470 --> 02:20:07.398]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:07.958 --> 02:20:16.083]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:16.083 --> 02:20:21.566]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:21.566 --> 02:20:27.390]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:31.893]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:20:31.893 --> 02:20:32.173]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:32.173 --> 02:20:33.994]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:20:37.236 --> 02:20:39.717]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:39.717 --> 02:20:47.618]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:47.618 --> 02:20:53.320]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:54.660]  And we knew what to do.
[02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:56.660]  Or at least we thought we did.
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:21:03.682]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[02:21:03.682 --> 02:21:04.042]  Whitman
[02:21:05.370 --> 02:21:12.593]  The director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[02:21:12.593 --> 02:21:19.697]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[02:21:19.697 --> 02:21:22.858]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[02:21:22.858 --> 02:21:27.961]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[02:21:28.621 --> 02:21:31.703]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[02:21:31.703 --> 02:21:37.747]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[02:21:37.747 --> 02:21:40.669]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:21:40.669 --> 02:21:45.613]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[02:21:46.977 --> 02:21:50.399]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[02:21:50.399 --> 02:21:52.700]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:56.002]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[02:21:56.002 --> 02:22:02.886]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[02:22:02.886 --> 02:22:04.987]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[02:22:05.507 --> 02:22:08.789]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[02:22:08.789 --> 02:22:13.572]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[02:22:13.572 --> 02:22:17.514]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[02:22:17.514 --> 02:22:19.135]  Travel less, meet online.
[02:22:19.135 --> 02:22:21.796]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[02:22:21.796 --> 02:22:27.699]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[02:22:27.699 --> 02:22:28.460]  Remember that code.
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:30.441]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:33.982]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[02:22:33.982 --> 02:22:34.382]  How so, Clyde?
[02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:57.755]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[02:22:57.755 --> 02:23:02.623]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[02:23:02.623 --> 02:23:03.124]  Just watch.
[02:23:03.752 --> 02:23:05.834]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[02:23:05.834 --> 02:23:07.315]  You gotta be kidding me.
[02:23:07.315 --> 02:23:07.716]  Nope.
[02:23:07.716 --> 02:23:12.000]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.442]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[02:23:14.442 --> 02:23:14.963]  Why?
[02:23:14.963 --> 02:23:16.924]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[02:23:16.924 --> 02:23:18.486]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[02:23:18.486 --> 02:23:22.069]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[02:23:22.069 --> 02:23:25.152]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[02:23:25.152 --> 02:23:25.693]  No way.
[02:23:25.993 --> 02:23:29.534]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:32.294]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[02:23:32.294 --> 02:23:33.394]  I already got some.
[02:23:33.394 --> 02:23:35.315]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[02:23:35.315 --> 02:23:40.295]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDStronghold.com.
[02:23:40.295 --> 02:23:42.136]  IDStronghold.com?
[02:23:42.136 --> 02:23:42.636]  Right!
[02:23:42.636 --> 02:23:43.616]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[02:24:12.381 --> 02:24:15.822]  Dark Majesty.
[02:24:15.822 --> 02:24:22.524]  It's Tex Marr's book, getting into the whole secret government available at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:22.524 --> 02:24:30.146]  And a book that gets even more in-depth into NASA and how this whole empire hooks together is Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[02:24:30.146 --> 02:24:38.068]  Richard C. Hoagland, who was a consultant to NASA, curator of a major museum, designed some of the things that were sent out on deep space aircraft.
[02:24:38.969 --> 02:24:39.509]  I don't think so.
[02:24:58.670 --> 02:25:02.651]  Yeah, I think you meant deep space spacecraft, not aircraft, right?
[02:25:02.651 --> 02:25:03.471]  Yes.
[02:25:03.471 --> 02:25:04.752]  No, deep space aircraft.
[02:25:04.752 --> 02:25:07.773]  Deep space hot air balloons.
[02:25:07.773 --> 02:25:14.194]  Anyway, so we're sitting around in the executive producer's suite, because he had a big office in the suite, and we're just kicking back.
[02:25:14.194 --> 02:25:17.035]  It's on a Sunday afternoon, and we're watching our guy.
[02:25:17.035 --> 02:25:22.016]  Remember, NASA used to jealously guard any access to the astronauts.
[02:25:22.016 --> 02:25:27.718]  During the Mercury program, they had what they called a capsule communicator, the Capcom, who was usually another astronaut.
[02:25:28.251 --> 02:25:39.964]  And even the flight directors or the head of NASA normally would go through the Capcom to talk to the crews in orbit as opposed to picking up the phone or picking up the mic and talking to the director.
[02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:42.847]  So this was a real break with this tradition.
[02:25:42.847 --> 02:25:44.029]  It was the first time.
[02:25:44.588 --> 02:25:53.794]  That ordinary reporters were going to be allowed to ask questions directly of a NASA crew in space during a live mission.
[02:25:53.794 --> 02:25:57.517]  So it was a big deal for the network, and it was a big deal for our unit and all that.
[02:25:57.517 --> 02:26:00.779]  So we're sitting there watching to see how it was going to play out.
[02:26:00.779 --> 02:26:07.644]  And NASA comes on and says, I think it was Paul Haney in those days, well, we're having a small delay.
[02:26:07.644 --> 02:26:12.427]  You know, the press conference will be in 15 minutes or something like that.
[02:26:12.427 --> 02:26:13.728]  So we had another round, right?
[02:26:14.685 --> 02:26:16.087]  And then it comes on again.
[02:26:16.087 --> 02:26:21.052]  Well, the press conferences, you know, we're having a small technical problem.
[02:26:21.052 --> 02:26:27.999]  The spacecraft has not yet risen over the horizon at Goldstone.
[02:26:27.999 --> 02:26:30.341]  Goldstone was one of the big tracking stations.
[02:26:30.341 --> 02:26:33.484]  So we have to wait for acquisition of signal.
[02:26:33.484 --> 02:26:36.347]  Something about that kind of bothered me.
[02:26:37.276 --> 02:26:48.704]  So I literally, Alex, I literally took a... I was sitting in a chair by Western's desk, so I took the back of an envelope on his desk and I started to do some scribbling, some calculations.
[02:26:48.704 --> 02:26:52.066]  And I looked at my numbers and I thought, this is nuts.
[02:26:52.066 --> 02:26:58.571]  And I shoved the paper over to Western and I said, Bob, I said, NASA's lying.
[02:26:58.571 --> 02:27:05.236]  If that's true, if what they're saying is true, those damn mountains have to be five miles high.
[02:27:05.236 --> 02:27:05.756]  And they're not.
[02:27:07.114 --> 02:27:10.396]  And that was the first time two things hit.
[02:27:10.396 --> 02:27:19.901]  One was that this agency that I believe was the agency, was for some stupid reason not telling us the truth, couldn't figure out what the agenda was.
[02:27:19.901 --> 02:27:26.645]  And then the reaction from my own, you know, guy, who had hired me, was, oh come on, you gotta be wrong.
[02:27:26.645 --> 02:27:28.706]  NASA would not lie.
[02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:31.867]  And this had persisted down to the present.
[02:27:31.867 --> 02:27:32.948]  The mainstream media
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.502]  Even when this agency has killed people.
[02:27:37.502 --> 02:27:38.602]  I'm talking Challenger.
[02:27:38.602 --> 02:27:40.383]  I'm talking Columbia.
[02:27:40.383 --> 02:27:46.165]  I'm talking bizarreness like the Lisa Nowak case, which makes no sense at all.
[02:27:46.165 --> 02:27:49.126]  Unless you start asking deeper questions.
[02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:55.789]  NASA is a we-can-do-no-wrong agency, even when they're blatantly, flagrantly doing wrong.
[02:27:55.789 --> 02:28:03.252]  And that, to me, has been a mystery that still fascinates me because it's like with so much demonstrable
[02:28:03.957 --> 02:28:11.322]  Not only just error, but deliberate malfeasance, deliberate, you know, skullduggery, deliberate lying.
[02:28:11.322 --> 02:28:19.088]  Why does this agency maintain this pristine example of the, you know, as Reagan used to say, the shining city on the hill?
[02:28:19.088 --> 02:28:28.435]  And that's another question that I don't have a good answer for, but I want a lot of people to think about it, because unless we crack the facade, I mean, there are other institutions in this society
[02:28:28.979 --> 02:28:40.326]  Where no matter what you lay out, people will not believe that your data is right, and the institutional facade or persona or manufactured image is wrong?
[02:28:40.326 --> 02:28:41.186]  Well, here's an example.
[02:28:41.186 --> 02:28:42.026]  That happened first...
[02:28:43.902 --> 02:29:02.453]  I mean, a good example is at first they would bust high-level Catholic priests, cardinals, fathers, monsignors, raping children, and for decades the police wouldn't even investigate or prosecute because you don't go after a cardinal, you don't go after a bishop, you don't go after a bigwig.
[02:29:03.293 --> 02:29:04.974]  Uh, you mean, that's impossible.
[02:29:04.974 --> 02:29:05.714]  It can't be true.
[02:29:05.714 --> 02:29:11.657]  And now we know about a third of them, it turned out, were, you know, involved or involved in the cover-up.
[02:29:11.657 --> 02:29:13.357]  I mean, is that a good analogy?
[02:29:13.357 --> 02:29:14.398]  It's an excellent analogy.
[02:29:14.398 --> 02:29:16.178]  And in fact, I was kind of in the back of my mind.
[02:29:16.178 --> 02:29:19.660]  That being a reformed Catholic, that was kind of what was on my mind.
[02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:20.880]  Wow.
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:21.781]  Okay, we'll stay there.
[02:29:21.781 --> 02:29:24.942]  We're going to talk behind the scenes about some of the things you want to bring up.
[02:29:24.942 --> 02:29:29.764]  When we get back, the basic history of NASA, all verifiable, but still just amazing.
[02:29:29.764 --> 02:29:31.645]  Then we'll get into mind control.
[02:29:31.645 --> 02:29:35.427]  Are they covering up artifacts on the Moon and Mars?
[02:29:35.427 --> 02:29:37.688]  A lot more.
[02:29:37.688 --> 02:29:39.068]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.068 --> 02:29:41.610]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.610 --> 02:29:44.311]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.844 --> 02:29:51.646]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[02:29:51.646 --> 02:29:55.788]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[02:29:55.788 --> 02:30:02.592]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[02:30:02.592 --> 02:30:05.494]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[02:30:05.874 --> 02:30:15.280]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:19.944]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:23.066]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[02:30:23.066 --> 02:30:29.510]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[02:30:29.510 --> 02:30:35.514]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.

[02:32:35.691 --> 02:32:35.891]  I think so.
[02:32:55.563 --> 02:33:07.310]  The book is a New York Times bestseller, Dark Mission, The Secret History of NASA.
[02:33:07.310 --> 02:33:13.514]  For folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see the cover of the book with the Grand Masonic flag on it there.
[02:33:13.514 --> 02:33:15.355]  We're going to talk about that later.
[02:33:15.355 --> 02:33:19.057]  You can get the book at bookstores everywhere or
[02:33:21.904 --> 02:33:29.921]  Mr. Hoagland, what's the best site to visit to get your booker to learn more about the huge overarching things that you're doing?
[02:33:29.921 --> 02:33:31.063]  Darkmission.net.
[02:33:31.063 --> 02:33:32.366]  We've set up a website for the book.
[02:33:33.317 --> 02:33:35.658]  But then you also have the Enterprise group.
[02:33:35.658 --> 02:33:40.860]  I have the Enterprise mission, yes, but that's basically a huge panoply of everything.
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:50.543]  If you're focused on the book and how to get it and the discussions going on, Mike Barra, my co-author, has a blog over there, and we publish new events around the book.
[02:33:50.543 --> 02:33:52.443]  Darkmission.net is the place to go.
[02:33:52.443 --> 02:33:55.605]  Darkmission.net, but go ahead and plug your other sites while we're at it.
[02:33:55.605 --> 02:33:56.805]  Enterprisemission.com.
[02:33:57.791 --> 02:34:06.073]  Everything you ever wanted to know about the space program that you were afraid to ask, or didn't know to ask, is at EnterpriseMission.com.
[02:34:06.073 --> 02:34:09.534]  Well, let's start getting into the history of NASA.
[02:34:09.534 --> 02:34:21.598]  You've got connections to L. Ron Hubbard, Alastair Crowley, Nazis, occultists, I mean, and then we see all the occultism and their symbols, their names.
[02:34:21.598 --> 02:34:23.798]  Break that down for us, Richard.
[02:34:23.798 --> 02:34:26.219]  Well, once you start asking questions,
[02:34:26.815 --> 02:34:52.547]  You know, one question leads to another, leads to another, leads to another, and when I realized that NASA had covered up this momentous press conference event, basically stalled it for half an hour to cover for a hungover correspondent for ABC News, I then realized that this agency, which was supposed to be exploring space for the benefit of all mankind, was basically not above doing anything lying.
[02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:57.894]  To protect one individual, or in this case, probably to Curry's favor.
[02:34:57.894 --> 02:35:05.999]  Because if Bergman, who was going to ask the question for ABC, had not been there when this historic thing happened, there would have been a holy hell to pay.
[02:35:05.999 --> 02:35:17.106]  And NASA was obviously, in retrospect, you know, skewing its entire public affairs program for this correspondent so that he would give them favorable coverage
[02:35:17.851 --> 02:35:19.572]  In future missions, in future years.
[02:35:19.572 --> 02:35:22.373]  I understand, but it shows a culture of back-scratching and lying.
[02:35:22.373 --> 02:35:24.014]  Let's go back.
[02:35:24.014 --> 02:35:30.037]  That gets into how are these missions covered.
[02:35:30.037 --> 02:35:35.579]  You know, we think of the Fourth Estate, Alex, as the kind of fourth part of government.
[02:35:35.579 --> 02:35:39.621]  You have the three branches, then you have the press, which is supposed to be the watchdog group.
[02:35:40.279 --> 02:35:48.183]  You know that press people rate somewhere down around Congress and lawyers in terms of public opinion, public perception?
[02:35:48.183 --> 02:35:58.608]  Yes, I do, because they just sit there in little sequestered rooms, drinking coffee as they're given press releases, and they're kept creatures, more and more domesticated creatures, by the government.
[02:35:58.608 --> 02:36:07.432]  You have the President setting up his own private agency with massive funding, running all these covert operations, and that's what I want to get into.
[02:36:07.432 --> 02:36:08.233]  In Dark Mission,
[02:36:09.251 --> 02:36:12.094]  And again, I'd separately learn this in my own historical research.
[02:36:12.094 --> 02:36:14.557]  This is documented, but it's so bizarre.
[02:36:14.557 --> 02:36:20.163]  Tell us how and why NASA got founded, because that's such an important part of your book.
[02:36:20.163 --> 02:36:22.746]  Well, the key thing, of course, goes back to World War II.
[02:36:22.746 --> 02:36:30.334]  You know, we have this huge war between us and the bad guys, the Nazis, or the, you know, the fascists.
[02:36:31.144 --> 02:36:33.485]  And it involved, you know, the world.
[02:36:33.485 --> 02:36:34.386]  It involved Japan.
[02:36:34.386 --> 02:36:35.787]  It involved, you know, Mussolini.
[02:36:35.787 --> 02:36:37.087]  It involved Hitler.
[02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:43.371]  It involved huge armies and millions of deaths and billions of dollars.
[02:36:43.371 --> 02:36:50.935]  And it was basically, you know, if you look at it archetypally, it was the forces of dark against the forces of light.
[02:36:50.935 --> 02:36:57.659]  Well, one of the things you've got to realize is the forces of light were operating on the same wavelength as the forces of darkness.
[02:36:57.659 --> 02:36:58.619]  FDR was a 33rd degree mason.
[02:37:00.635 --> 02:37:21.361]  And I started realizing that history itself, mainstream history, not just NASA, but mainstream history, with the help of one of my friends, Ron Nix, who's a geologist, but also has done a tremendous amount of work in this area, appears to be manipulating the conventional calendar, conventional historical events.
[02:37:21.957 --> 02:37:31.580]  According to occult and astrological signs and times and dates and moments of eventuality.
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:38.903]  And an everyday example of that would be Ronald Reagan, to the minute, when he gave a speech, what day, what he was wearing.
[02:37:38.903 --> 02:37:41.523]  Now, of course, Hitler designed it all.
[02:37:41.523 --> 02:37:45.805]  The modern Olympics, they're going to have it on 888 at 888 in the morning.
[02:37:45.805 --> 02:37:48.486]  I mean, they are really into numbers, numerology.
[02:37:48.486 --> 02:37:49.106]  Please continue.
[02:37:50.089 --> 02:38:02.783]  Well, as I was investigating, you know, as I went through the rest of my career with NASA and the networks, given that big lie on that Sunday morning, I started looking at how the press dealt with NASA.
[02:38:02.783 --> 02:38:05.065]  And I noticed a favoritism.
[02:38:05.065 --> 02:38:11.953]  You know, certain people were curried, certain people were given favors, certain people were given special things, other people were kind of excluded.
[02:38:12.543 --> 02:38:27.948]  You know, there was a pecking order, and those that were given favor were always writing favorable stories, or doing favorable coverage, or favorable pieces on the network, be it ABC, NBC, or CBS.
[02:38:27.948 --> 02:38:30.729]  So I realized there was this incestuous relationship.
[02:38:30.729 --> 02:38:39.812]  So years later, when I began to ask the questions about fundamental things, like, why did we land on the moon on July 20th, 1969?
[02:38:42.378 --> 02:38:50.560]  And the answer was, and you could actually do this with a computer, which was accessible then, was not accessible during my, you know, sojourn with NASA.
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:51.900]  We didn't have personal computers.
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:53.060]  We didn't have laptops.
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:54.440]  We didn't have, you know, Macs.
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:57.921]  We didn't have anything that gives us, certainly didn't have the Internet.
[02:38:57.921 --> 02:39:06.783]  The tools to combat this, you know, lies different at every level problem we're dealing with now, we basically were on our own with going to libraries.
[02:39:07.623 --> 02:39:16.728]  So, I started, when we got the Internet, we got the computers, I started looking at launch dates and landing times, and I noticed this bizarre pattern.
[02:39:16.728 --> 02:39:31.435]  This was in the mid-90s, which was that there appeared to be some kind of astrological, calendrical timekeeping behind the most important and major events in NASA's history.
[02:39:31.435 --> 02:39:37.258]  And more than that, certain key events, like landings on the Moon with unmanned spacecraft,
[02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:46.139]  And then later with manned spacecraft, the Apollo program actually rescued to land on Hitler's birthday.
[02:39:46.139 --> 02:39:47.980]  And another light bulb went off.
[02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:49.221]  Bing!
[02:39:49.221 --> 02:40:06.290]  Because everybody knows, you know, it's almost, almost on school, that NASA was formed of the nucleus of the German scientist in Operation Paperclip, including the big one, the superstar, Wernher von Braun, brought over to the United States
[02:40:06.857 --> 02:40:12.659]  You know, as our pet Nazis after World War II, after we quote, won World War II.
[02:40:12.659 --> 02:40:22.581]  Well, bottom line, in Dark Mission, Mike and I lay out the case that the pet Nazis basically rose up and ate NASA for lunch.
[02:40:22.581 --> 02:40:24.482]  And everything that NASA's been doing.
[02:40:25.296 --> 02:40:32.959]  has been on some kind of bizarre Nazi ritual Thule, you know, Thule Society calendar.
[02:40:32.959 --> 02:40:41.242]  But you talk about, and then even the maps, the official ball caps, the patches, uh, you know, then... Everything.
[02:40:41.242 --> 02:40:46.944]  There's symbology, the patches are designed to reflect these philosophies.
[02:40:46.944 --> 02:40:49.305]  Now what was interesting, you see, is you had three groups.
[02:40:49.935 --> 02:40:50.915]  We discovered.
[02:40:50.915 --> 02:40:51.515]  That's the key.
[02:40:51.515 --> 02:40:53.076]  You've got this Alisher Crowley group.
[02:40:53.076 --> 02:40:55.496]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, this is admitted, folks.
[02:40:55.496 --> 02:40:56.676]  Go through it.
[02:40:56.676 --> 02:41:03.637]  You have three groups that ultimately were vying for power in the creation of NAFTA when Eisenhower did it in 1958.
[02:41:03.637 --> 02:41:09.118]  You had the Nazis, who of course were the big, you know, the underground guerrilla.
[02:41:09.118 --> 02:41:10.979]  You had the Masons.
[02:41:10.979 --> 02:41:18.540]  I mean, the Masons are kind of the good guys in this scenario because James Webb, who was a 33rd degree Mason,
[02:41:19.153 --> 02:41:31.297]  Basically, try to set up NASA to do amazingly important things to uplift education, to uplift technology, to uplift blacks in the South.
[02:41:31.297 --> 02:41:41.040]  I mean, there's a huge swath of democratization that goes on in the United States by means of web using NASA and NASA as a tool to help Kennedy
[02:41:41.613 --> 02:41:50.840]  You know, create a social renaissance in this society to break out of the Ku Klux Klan and all the stuff that was going on in South America.
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:55.864]  And then farm out, use it as a unification to also farm out the new technologies to American industry.
[02:41:55.864 --> 02:41:58.626]  But then meanwhile... And to the university system.
[02:41:58.626 --> 02:42:01.128]  And then you've got the third group, which we call the magicians.
[02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:07.673]  Which is the Crowley Group, which was based out of JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[02:42:07.673 --> 02:42:12.536]  How many times have you heard, over the last 30-40 years, Alex, news stories?
[02:42:12.536 --> 02:42:19.979]  JPL, the laboratory in Pasadena, California, which is a laboratory basically under Caltech.
[02:42:19.979 --> 02:42:25.782]  So you had these three power bases, the Nazis, the Masons, and the Magicians.
[02:42:25.782 --> 02:42:28.864]  And Dark Mission goes through how they abide for power,
[02:42:29.525 --> 02:42:47.465]  For each of their overlapping reasons, and how the program, the space program that we all have seen, is the result of the inside feudal wars between these three groups inside NASA, who only have agreed on one thing, Alex.
[02:42:48.247 --> 02:42:51.749]  And that is that we should not ever get to see what's really out there.
[02:42:51.749 --> 02:42:53.130]  That's the one thing they agree.
[02:42:53.130 --> 02:42:56.232]  Exactly, and Richard Zieglein, that's the nature of the New World Order.
[02:42:56.232 --> 02:43:10.920]  You're looking at one big pyramid, and as you know, when you pull back, it's hundreds of big pyramids that come together in that compartmentalization, and that's all it is, is these sun cults, snake cults, devil cults, sex cults,
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.042]  They run every major agency, and there are wars.
[02:43:15.042 --> 02:43:20.145]  They fight amongst themselves, but they always keep the dumb cattle in the dark.
[02:43:20.145 --> 02:43:23.947]  And they're all into the occult, and that's why at certain levels they get along.
[02:43:23.947 --> 02:43:25.028]  They recruit each other.
[02:43:25.028 --> 02:43:30.371]  The super-globalists you'll find will be a member of dozens of these groups.
[02:43:30.371 --> 02:43:31.452]  That is your Illuminati.
[02:43:31.452 --> 02:43:32.993]  It's the Babylon mystery religions.
[02:43:33.713 --> 02:43:34.834]  Your book has the evidence.
[02:43:34.834 --> 02:43:39.216]  Again, separately in my own research, folks, I've seen, as I can tell you, it's accurate.
[02:43:39.216 --> 02:43:46.560]  The parts that we're getting into now, I'm not saying the other stuff isn't accurate, I just am not knowledgeable about some of the stuff in the book.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:48.241]  Let's talk about the magicians first.
[02:43:48.241 --> 02:44:00.327]  I mean, you've got chapter after chapter on it, but that's the part that most people, they know about the Masons, they know about the Nazis, and again, all following basically the same esoteric stuff, but a little bit different.
[02:44:00.327 --> 02:44:01.648]  Let's talk about the magicians.
[02:44:02.938 --> 02:44:20.805]  Well, the magicians go back, you know, this is my name for what's in NASA, this group, go back to Aleister Crowley, who was, you know, the self-proclaimed, you know, the beast, 666, etc., etc., the vilest man in the world, all that.
[02:44:20.805 --> 02:44:26.547]  He was trying to practice literal magic in the 20th, 19th and 20th centuries.
[02:44:28.837 --> 02:44:42.461]  Using mind over matter, using rituals, using esoteric rites, using, you know, sex magic, using anything he could get his hands on to basically try to change the world around him, to bend it to his will.
[02:44:42.461 --> 02:44:43.862]  He was one of those super guys.
[02:44:43.862 --> 02:44:47.283]  He was in or the head of a whole bunch of groups.
[02:44:47.283 --> 02:44:49.363]  Well, he was in and out of a lot of different groups.
[02:44:49.363 --> 02:44:51.804]  He stole freely, mixed it all together.
[02:44:51.804 --> 02:44:57.126]  There's even now a new book out which claims that he was part of the British intelligence community.
[02:44:57.788 --> 02:45:01.751]  Fighting both in World War I and World War II.
[02:45:01.751 --> 02:45:10.738]  Be that as it may, he found a young neophyte in California named Jack Parsons, who was a genius.
[02:45:10.738 --> 02:45:18.323]  He was an experimenter back in the 20s and 30s, when every kid wanted to build rockets and blow things up.
[02:45:18.323 --> 02:45:26.029]  And Jack eventually went on to help create, with a guy named Molinas, and a guy named Von Karman, who was at Caltech,
[02:45:26.607 --> 02:45:32.211]  What we now call today the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL.
[02:45:32.211 --> 02:45:38.555]  In the in crowd, JPL is actually known by another acronym, Jack Parsons Lab.
[02:45:38.555 --> 02:45:50.363]  Because what Jack Parsons did, this young kid, again another prodigal, he was able to create a solid fuel mixture that literally launched the space program.
[02:45:50.363 --> 02:45:55.366]  It wasn't Goddard, it wasn't the Germans, it was Jack Parsons.
[02:45:55.939 --> 02:46:10.855]  Who in his day job was this brilliant chemist creating amazing rocket fuel mixtures that ultimately were powerful and stable that became the baseline for JPL in various rocket series.
[02:46:10.855 --> 02:46:17.001]  And then meanwhile in mainline history about Crowley and all these people and Parsons and of course the founder of Scientology.
[02:46:18.062 --> 02:46:27.004]  Uh, Parsons is involved in sex cult rituals to channel entities to tell him, I don't know if you know about this, you probably do, to tell him how to make all these things.
[02:46:27.004 --> 02:46:28.764]  I mean, I'm not saying it's real, folks.
[02:46:28.764 --> 02:46:30.384]  The point is, they believe it.
[02:46:30.384 --> 02:46:31.505]  Well, no, wait, wait.
[02:46:31.505 --> 02:46:36.446]  What Parsons did, you know, in his day job, was separate from what he did with Crowley.
[02:46:36.446 --> 02:46:43.927]  He became part of the Malema cult, the OOTO, which is Crowley's organization in Southern California.
[02:46:44.662 --> 02:46:47.064]  He ultimately wound up leading it.
[02:46:47.064 --> 02:46:58.755]  He became the head of it in Southern California, simultaneous with working on the foundations of rocket technology, which would bootstrap NASA into space.
[02:46:58.755 --> 02:47:02.478]  Now, how does the founder of Scientology tell you?
[02:47:02.478 --> 02:47:03.899]  Ed, what's his name?
[02:47:03.899 --> 02:47:05.661]  L. Ron Hubbard.
[02:47:05.661 --> 02:47:11.126]  Became also a member of the Palima Group there in Pasadena with Hubbard.
[02:47:11.664 --> 02:47:15.614]  And he and... I'm sorry, he and Parsons.
[02:47:15.614 --> 02:47:19.102]  And then they kind of swapped wives and there was... I mean, it's a huge...
[02:47:19.890 --> 02:47:29.493]  Really interesting soap opera, an incredible soap opera that no one knows, underlying the whole Western contingent of what is now today NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[02:47:29.493 --> 02:47:48.159]  Yeah, we have this gleaming white image of, you know, handsome go-get-em America, you know, perfect people who just are totally mom and apple pie, and meanwhile it's a bunch of Nazis, a bunch of lunatic 33rd degree masons, and a bunch of psycho... Wait, wait, wait, Alex, the 33rd degree masons founded the United States.
[02:47:49.409 --> 02:47:50.529]  I'm fully aware of that.
[02:47:50.529 --> 02:47:55.571]  You have to separate the Masons from the other two groups.
[02:47:55.571 --> 02:48:00.032]  You know as well as I, I mean let's be clear, I know that a lot of the founders were Masons.
[02:48:00.032 --> 02:48:12.476]  They also then wrote about how they didn't like that their Masonry was being taken over by... Masonry in the 1800s was taken over by a guy who created Ku Klux Klan, whose name was... Albert Pike.
[02:48:12.476 --> 02:48:18.398]  So I want to be clear that the Masons today... The Bourne Masonry, the Masonry, the ordinary Masons today haven't a clue.
[02:48:18.973 --> 02:48:20.214]  We're talking about the in-crowd.
[02:48:20.214 --> 02:48:22.315]  I mean, I have some very good friends that are masons.
[02:48:22.315 --> 02:48:24.276]  Yeah, sure, the porch masons are nice guys.
[02:48:24.276 --> 02:48:26.398]  Enjoying it, because George Washington was in it.
[02:48:26.398 --> 02:48:27.158]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:27.158 --> 02:48:28.719]  And that's my point with any intelligence agency.
[02:48:28.719 --> 02:48:29.520]  And they want to do good work.
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:32.341]  Remember, remember, the lie is different at every level.
[02:48:32.341 --> 02:48:33.762]  Yes, so I'm saying.
[02:48:33.762 --> 02:48:35.163]  I'm going to make that as a bumper sticker.
[02:48:35.163 --> 02:48:36.464]  That has got to be a bumper sticker.
[02:48:37.071 --> 02:48:40.934]  Because that is such a key to figuring all this out.
[02:48:40.934 --> 02:48:50.221]  Because each level, Alex, as you and I know, is told just enough to keep them going in the same direction, but they're not told the big story.
[02:48:50.221 --> 02:48:52.864]  Exactly, so we're not here saying all nations are bad.
[02:48:52.864 --> 02:48:53.844]  I'm saying at the top.
[02:48:53.844 --> 02:48:56.847]  But they think they're told the full truth.
[02:48:56.847 --> 02:48:59.068]  That's the way to control the crowd.
[02:48:59.068 --> 02:48:59.989]  Well, here's an example.
[02:48:59.989 --> 02:49:04.373]  Every major Masonic lodge of both arms of it, they
[02:49:05.393 --> 02:49:07.274]  You know, the Grand Orient and the Scottish Rite.
[02:49:07.274 --> 02:49:09.735]  They have pictures of Albert Pike in every building.
[02:49:09.735 --> 02:49:11.717]  And they have statues of him in D.C.
[02:49:11.717 --> 02:49:13.337]  right by the Supreme Court.
[02:49:13.337 --> 02:49:19.561]  But meanwhile, do they read his book saying he's possessed by Lucifer and that Jesus is a god?
[02:49:19.561 --> 02:49:22.482]  I mean, do they read Manly P. Hall saying they worship?
[02:49:22.482 --> 02:49:24.323]  I mean, these are the head masons.
[02:49:24.323 --> 02:49:32.588]  And then a mason will argue with you and say it's not Lucifer, when their own grand supreme masters are saying, yes, I am possessed by Lucifer, sweet Lucifer.
[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:42.786]  Anyway, we both agree that the Masonic, you know, the ancient tradition were the good guys, and we're trying to enlighten humankind.
[02:49:42.786 --> 02:49:47.250]  That's why the Founders were doing this incredible experiment called the United States.
[02:49:47.250 --> 02:49:53.534]  And ever since this country was formed, we've had group after group and, you know, conspiracy after conspiracy.
[02:49:53.534 --> 02:49:55.796]  Trying to get control of that engine!
[02:49:55.796 --> 02:50:01.160]  To tear it down, to take control, to divert it from whatever its historical destiny.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:03.641]  was and is supposed to be.
[02:50:03.641 --> 02:50:07.223]  Remember, Lincoln, the last best hope of mankind.
[02:50:07.223 --> 02:50:08.865]  I still believe that, Alex.
[02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:13.468]  That's why it's important to return it to its original path.
[02:50:13.468 --> 02:50:17.250]  Critical, if we're going to survive what's coming.
[02:50:17.250 --> 02:50:26.356]  Alright, we've got a break, but I want to talk behind the scenes from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, also internet listeners who are listening to the InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[02:50:26.356 --> 02:50:28.077]  You'll be able to hear this three minutes behind the scenes.
[02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:43.154]  I've got to have Richard D. Hoagland up for 3-4 hours if he'll do it the next month or so because it's clear we've got about an hour and 5 minutes left, or less than an hour, it's about 40 minutes left, and there's just millions of questions I want to ask, points I want to bring up.
[02:50:43.875 --> 02:50:47.499]  Let's get into what's happening right now at NASA when we get back.
[02:50:47.499 --> 02:50:49.640]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:52.063]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:50:52.063 --> 02:50:54.725]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:50:54.725 --> 02:50:55.886]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:50:55.886 --> 02:50:57.588]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:50:57.588 --> 02:51:00.490]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:51:00.490 --> 02:51:04.114]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:51:06.796 --> 02:51:13.759]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:51:13.759 --> 02:51:19.661]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:51:19.661 --> 02:51:21.022]  An inside job.
[02:51:22.443 --> 02:51:25.064]  How dare you?
[02:51:25.064 --> 02:51:29.966]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:51:29.966 --> 02:51:32.847]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:51:32.847 --> 02:51:39.310]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[02:51:39.310 --> 02:51:42.151]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[02:52:09.808 --> 02:52:13.250]  Used by scouts, the military, and families around the world.
[02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:17.193]  If you would like to learn more about survival, trapping, cave cooking, navigation, tracking,
[02:52:17.193 --> 02:52:17.473]  We're good.
[02:52:48.709 --> 02:52:53.111]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[02:52:53.111 --> 02:52:55.251]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[02:52:55.251 --> 02:53:00.633]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[02:53:00.633 --> 02:53:05.075]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free-energy device.
[02:53:05.075 --> 02:53:09.477]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:12.601]  I think so.
[02:53:35.282 --> 02:53:36.823]  Visit GasFreedom.info.
[02:53:36.823 --> 02:53:38.544]  That's GasFreedom.info.
[02:53:38.544 --> 02:53:39.164]  Or call 239-628-3708.
[02:53:39.164 --> 02:53:39.584]  That's 239-628-3708.
[02:53:39.584 --> 02:53:40.465]  Call today.
[02:53:40.465 --> 02:53:41.806]  Richard C. Hoagland is our guest.
[02:53:41.806 --> 02:53:42.706]  The book, Dark Mission.
[02:54:01.075 --> 02:54:03.599]  The secret history of NASA.
[02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:05.422]  And we've hardly covered any of what's in it.
[02:54:05.422 --> 02:54:08.326]  I'll have to have it back up in the near future.
[02:54:08.326 --> 02:54:09.928]  We've got him into the middle of the next hour.
[02:54:09.928 --> 02:54:14.835]  Then we have that NFL player who walked across the country to raise money for 9-11 first responders.
[02:54:17.270 --> 02:54:17.830]  We're good to go.
[02:54:34.143 --> 02:54:48.214]  Uh, then to today, and I know people from Houston, I know a Hollywood producer who's very serious, doesn't make stuff up, you know, saying that there were magnet programs run by NASA and that he was really in a mind control program with NASA.
[02:54:48.214 --> 02:54:50.016]  I looked that up, turns out they did it.
[02:54:50.016 --> 02:54:52.558]  They are associated with that over and over again.
[02:54:52.558 --> 02:54:54.399]  Uh, what about mind control?
[02:54:54.399 --> 02:54:55.320]  I mean, did you ever, uh,
[02:54:55.988 --> 02:54:57.649]  Do you have any info on that?
[02:54:57.649 --> 02:54:58.730]  Well, let me back up.
[02:54:58.730 --> 02:55:03.914]  You've given me a statement that I want to disagree with, gently, politely, with all due respect, as they say.
[02:55:03.914 --> 02:55:04.355]  Oh, that's fine.
[02:55:04.355 --> 02:55:05.075]  Go ahead.
[02:55:05.075 --> 02:55:07.157]  You said NASA controlled by the President.
[02:55:07.157 --> 02:55:09.178]  That's the big lie.
[02:55:09.178 --> 02:55:10.299]  It wasn't.
[02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:16.744]  From the get-go, from the beginning, when Eisenhower created this agency, he thought he was in charge.
[02:55:16.744 --> 02:55:21.327]  And then, by the time his term was ended, his second term, remember his famous speech?
[02:55:21.327 --> 02:55:22.108]  Well, that's what I mean.
[02:55:22.108 --> 02:55:24.530]  It's a standalone agency outside government.
[02:55:25.345 --> 02:55:32.431]  Well, it's part of a series of agencies that are controlled from some quarter.
[02:55:32.431 --> 02:55:34.453]  It's the shadow government, sure, sure.
[02:55:34.453 --> 02:55:37.976]  Well, but is it really even the shadow government?
[02:55:37.976 --> 02:55:39.237]  I'm beginning to suspect it.
[02:55:39.237 --> 02:55:41.439]  Do you know Joseph Farrell?
[02:55:41.439 --> 02:55:42.820]  Yes.
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:44.102]  Have you had him on?
[02:55:44.102 --> 02:55:45.102]  No, I don't believe so.
[02:55:45.102 --> 02:55:47.224]  You need to have Joseph Farrell on.
[02:55:47.224 --> 02:55:50.167]  Joseph is working with me on the sequel to Dark Mission.
[02:55:50.822 --> 02:55:52.243]  Joseph is a genius.
[02:55:52.243 --> 02:55:54.245]  He's a PhD Oxford.
[02:55:54.245 --> 02:55:55.045]  He is a genius.
[02:55:55.045 --> 02:56:19.305]  What he has done is he has with documents and meticulous reasoning and research and doing it the old-fashioned way, you know, science, actually documenting what you think you found, he has discovered the most extraordinary antecedents to the genesis of NASA in the end of the Third Reich in Germany and a series of black projects
[02:56:19.915 --> 02:56:27.517]  That we're brought here and seem to form the nucleus of a secret, hidden space program.
[02:56:27.517 --> 02:56:29.058]  You see, it's not like- Oh, absolutely!
[02:56:29.058 --> 02:56:32.279]  I mean, we know NASA is the cover for the real program.
[02:56:32.279 --> 02:56:36.240]  NASA is not- is a false front, Western Town, as I say over and over and over again.
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:44.322]  And part of the reason why there is such disarray now, where they can't seem to get their act together, why we're building this thing in orbit that's going nowhere,
[02:56:45.782 --> 02:56:47.623]  They want to suppress technology.
[02:56:47.623 --> 02:56:50.164]  They don't want the public to know what's really been developed.
[02:56:50.164 --> 02:56:50.884]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:56:50.884 --> 02:56:54.406]  Raymond Teague, NASA engineer, Air Force intelligence before that.
[02:56:54.406 --> 02:56:57.387]  You know, he's on the Apollo program, you know, in Mission Control.
[02:56:57.387 --> 02:56:58.507]  See pictures of him.
[02:56:58.507 --> 02:56:59.848]  Good friend of mine.
[02:56:59.848 --> 02:57:04.490]  He's come in and he said, look, you know, he was working with RCA on the cameras on the moon.
[02:57:04.490 --> 02:57:07.151]  He was working on RCA with the stuff in Skylab after that.
[02:57:07.711 --> 02:57:13.533]  And he said, he believes they went to the moon, but a lot of it was even covered up from them, what they were really doing.
[02:57:13.533 --> 02:57:24.896]  And he said, the Van Allen radiation belt does fry the film, he saw canisters and capsules that were tested, he said they were on the moon, but that they fake the photos, and he says he doesn't know why.
[02:57:24.896 --> 02:57:25.516]  What do you say to that?
[02:57:26.212 --> 02:57:28.052]  Well, I think he's wrong.
[02:57:28.052 --> 02:57:35.634]  There is some film degradation, but they went through the belt so quickly and those canisters were put in lead for exactly that purpose.
[02:57:35.634 --> 02:57:37.694]  We've got stunning artifacts on the moon.
[02:57:37.694 --> 02:57:41.995]  I mean, you can't take what we've got in these pictures that are NASA pictures.
[02:57:41.995 --> 02:57:44.555]  What's interesting is we've had some NASA sources ourselves.
[02:57:44.555 --> 02:57:49.696]  Ken Johnston is a key guy, who by the way is a 32nd degree mason.
[02:57:49.696 --> 02:57:52.937]  And it was his masonic tradition, you know, as one of the good guys,
[02:57:53.723 --> 02:58:08.935]  When he started asking his own questions of his own experience in NASA after he read The Monument to Mars, my first book, he met me in Seattle and he gave me access to an incredible archive of NASA photography that he had been ordered to destroy in Houston
[02:58:09.415 --> 02:58:12.337]  And he had disobeyed orders and kept it for 30 years.
[02:58:12.337 --> 02:58:20.424]  Kind of like I've talked to the people for time-lapse books that were told to destroy the evidence at the back of Kennedy's head blown off, and I've seen those photos.
[02:58:20.424 --> 02:58:21.264]  They need to release them.
[02:58:21.264 --> 02:58:23.306]  I tell you what, Richard C. Hoagland, stay there.
[02:58:23.306 --> 02:58:29.671]  Back in 60 seconds.

[02:58:39.589 --> 02:58:43.191]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:43.191 --> 02:58:45.653]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:45.653 --> 02:58:48.695]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:48.695 --> 02:58:54.418]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[02:59:40.281 --> 02:59:42.684]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.684 --> 02:59:45.447]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:06.425 --> 03:00:09.126]  Richard C. Hoagland is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[03:00:09.126 --> 03:00:11.086]  Gotta have him back up sooner rather than later.
[03:00:11.086 --> 03:00:17.528]  Okay, Richard, um, there's so much to cover.
[03:00:17.528 --> 03:00:19.748]  Obviously, we're scratching the surface of Dark Mission.
[03:00:19.748 --> 03:00:21.709]  Very impressive book.
[03:00:21.709 --> 03:00:24.049]  Uh, no doubt NASA is covering up a lot.
[03:00:24.049 --> 03:00:26.930]  And then we, I guess all bets are off then.
[03:00:26.930 --> 03:00:28.931]  We can speculate all day.
[03:00:28.931 --> 03:00:34.152]  Uh, but there are some things that we can prove they're covering up.
[03:00:35.281 --> 03:00:41.046]  What about my question about NASA or the real program behind it in mind control?
[03:00:41.046 --> 03:00:49.313]  Because in government documents, in government hearings, NASA keeps popping up over the years, and then from separate sources it keeps popping up.
[03:00:49.313 --> 03:00:52.976]  You're one of the foremost experts on NASA outside of its system now.
[03:00:52.976 --> 03:00:54.718]  Does that ever come across your radar screen?
[03:00:55.669 --> 03:00:59.051]  Well, it certainly did in a very curious way.
[03:00:59.051 --> 03:01:03.935]  First of all, let me say that there are, if you go to Google, Google is your friend.
[03:01:03.935 --> 03:01:08.458]  You know, besides the lie is different at every level, the other mantra is Google is your friend.
[03:01:08.458 --> 03:01:10.439]  Use Google liberally, freely.
[03:01:10.439 --> 03:01:11.920]  It's an amazing tool.
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:15.723]  The Internet, how did you realize that we wouldn't have a prayer if we didn't have the Internet?
[03:01:15.723 --> 03:01:23.168]  The Internet, you know, thank God for Bill Gates and DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, which gave us the Internet.
[03:01:24.028 --> 03:01:29.072]  Um, has given us the tools to fight and fight effectively, because information is power.
[03:01:29.072 --> 03:01:35.517]  So what you do is you go to Google, and you start looking at all the patents for mind control.
[03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:37.018]  They're right out there.
[03:01:37.018 --> 03:01:43.203]  This is not airy-fairy, you know... By the way, speaking of Google, they're now in battle with NASA, but go ahead.
[03:01:43.203 --> 03:01:51.530]  Well, they've been a bit for quite a while with certain interesting agencies, but the information is there if you go look for it.
[03:01:52.546 --> 03:01:56.887]  Google mind-control technologies, mind-altering technologies.
[03:01:56.887 --> 03:02:00.908]  We all know, or most of this audience probably knows, but MKUltra.
[03:02:00.908 --> 03:02:12.672]  It looks like they've been at the idea of manipulating and mind-controlling other people, the other side, whoever the enemy is, and we're, in their eyes, the enemy, for a long, long time.
[03:02:12.672 --> 03:02:14.973]  20, 30, 40 years.
[03:02:14.973 --> 03:02:16.393]  The question is, how good are they?
[03:02:17.376 --> 03:02:34.830]  I think that NASA, if they themselves did not have the technology, were allied with those agencies that did have the technology, that developed it, out of World War II, the Nazis, we're back to the Nazis and those weird medical experiments again that we've all heard about.
[03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:42.996]  I ran into this first person when I was invited to Wyoming back in the early 90s.
[03:02:44.352 --> 03:02:51.994]  To do a series of programs for the school district in, in one of the southern towns, I think it was Billings.
[03:02:51.994 --> 03:03:00.437]  And I would have been invited by a former CIA guy, who was married to a doctor, a medical doctor.
[03:03:00.437 --> 03:03:07.279]  And what I decided, because they wanted me to come out and talk about the Mars stuff, based on what I talked about at the UN.
[03:03:07.279 --> 03:03:10.380]  And instead, I unveiled a surprise.
[03:03:10.380 --> 03:03:12.201]  Because at this Billings conference,
[03:03:12.898 --> 03:03:19.000]  For the first time, I talked about the structures we had found upon the moon.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:27.503]  Well, Alex, you would have thought I had taken a small nuclear weapon and detonated it in the middle of the conference.
[03:03:27.503 --> 03:03:39.047]  I literally was manhandled by this guy, and put up against a wall, and browbeat for not following what I had said I was going to talk about, etc., etc., etc.
[03:03:40.225 --> 03:03:45.468]  Now, you know that Wyoming is one of the places where they put these CIA guys out to pasture?
[03:03:45.468 --> 03:03:50.252]  They buy them all ranches, and they live like kings, and basically it's CIA country.
[03:03:50.252 --> 03:03:58.537]  Montana, Wyoming... Well, not just that, they're putting them in FBI, CIA, as almost every major sheriff.
[03:03:58.537 --> 03:04:04.581]  Well, this was a retired intel guy, who of course is never retired, but here's the nub of the story.
[03:04:05.876 --> 03:04:15.584]  When we were doing this conference, we were setting it up with this guy and his wife, and his wife was a medical doctor.
[03:04:15.584 --> 03:04:29.015]  And at one point, one of the people that I was with was trying to get her to talk about her experiences, and she revealed that she had been part of the quarantine team debriefing the astronauts.
[03:04:29.577 --> 03:04:30.318]  Life has changed.
[03:04:30.318 --> 03:04:31.459]  We're not 21 anymore.
[03:04:31.459 --> 03:04:32.740]  We have responsibilities.
[03:04:52.250 --> 03:04:55.174]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[03:04:55.174 --> 03:04:57.136]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[03:04:57.136 --> 03:05:01.301]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[03:05:01.301 --> 03:05:06.708]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[03:05:07.659 --> 03:05:13.181]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[03:05:13.181 --> 03:05:24.886]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[03:05:24.886 --> 03:05:28.728]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[03:05:28.728 --> 03:05:29.688]  It's that easy.
[03:05:29.688 --> 03:05:31.989]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[03:05:33.610 --> 03:05:37.434]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[03:05:37.434 --> 03:05:39.116]  Pick up some today!
[03:05:39.116 --> 03:05:41.919]  Remember you're drinking mate and wake up feeling great!
[03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:52.044]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[03:05:52.044 --> 03:05:56.066]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[03:05:56.066 --> 03:06:00.109]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[03:06:00.109 --> 03:06:09.434]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.
[03:06:10.054 --> 03:06:14.577]  Get on the web at efoodsdirect.com and find a two-month grab-and-go kit.

[03:06:19.441 --> 03:06:20.181]  The cost?
[03:06:20.181 --> 03:06:21.842]  About five dollars a day.
[03:06:21.842 --> 03:06:29.328]  efoodsdirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of superfood at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[03:06:29.328 --> 03:06:31.849]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:06:31.849 --> 03:06:37.133]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[03:06:37.577 --> 03:06:43.202]  Call 800-409-5633.
[03:06:43.202 --> 03:06:48.906]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:06:48.906 --> 03:06:50.227]  And we knew what to do.
[03:06:50.227 --> 03:06:52.229]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:06:52.229 --> 03:06:59.254]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:06:59.254 --> 03:07:06.000]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[03:07:06.667 --> 03:07:07.828]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:07:07.828 --> 03:07:10.351]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:07:10.351 --> 03:07:13.354]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:07:24.184 --> 03:07:27.267]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:07:27.267 --> 03:07:33.332]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:07:33.332 --> 03:07:36.255]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:07:36.255 --> 03:07:41.179]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:07:49.210 --> 03:07:54.612]  It's an amazing discussion with Richard C. Hoagland.
[03:07:54.612 --> 03:07:56.913]  Really thankful for him being with us.
[03:07:56.913 --> 03:07:59.534]  Darkmission.net's the website for the book.
[03:08:19.082 --> 03:08:39.282]  Consultant to NASA, curator of a major museum, helped design the gold tablet, you know, message to the stars, sent out on one of the more famous spacecraft, worked with CBS News and Walter Cronkite, and now the biggest whistleblower out there on NASA corruption, and so much what I've been talking about 15 years ago has now come out.
[03:08:39.890 --> 03:08:48.855]  That's what blows me away, because I try to just focus in on what I can prove, and reading his book, so much of it I can prove, and that's what scares me.
[03:08:48.855 --> 03:08:49.495]  Mind control.
[03:08:49.495 --> 03:08:59.220]  You were finishing up with mind control, so you're out at this event, you bring up cover-ups of things on the moon, and this guy literally bulls up against you, shoves you up against a wall.
[03:08:59.220 --> 03:09:03.563]  His wife's some government physician that works with the astronauts.
[03:09:03.563 --> 03:09:05.764]  Finish that up, and then I want to get into these
[03:09:06.650 --> 03:09:16.518]  These official videos they've shown on the news from the space shuttle with these craft flying around and Richard, again, we don't talk about little green men here.
[03:09:16.518 --> 03:09:26.006]  These are official government footage and Hoagland believes it's all part of a larger government program, but get back to the mind control first, sir.
[03:09:27.068 --> 03:09:35.410]  Well, we were having this dinner one night and, you know, basically when you go into a new town, you meet new people, your host, and we were staying there and all that.
[03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:39.832]  It was very social and very protocol and all that.
[03:09:39.832 --> 03:09:42.432]  Um, they did not know yet what I was going to talk about.
[03:09:42.432 --> 03:09:54.796]  So, it was kind of, you know, you're a friend, you're a friend of a friend of ours, you're going to do this thing for the school the next couple of days, you know, and so I would just started asking questions, you know, what are you doing here and what do you used to do?
[03:09:55.686 --> 03:10:13.120]  What do you do when I'm... I discovered that his wife, this intel agent's wife, CIA guy in real life, was a doctor, medical doctor, and that she had been part of the team debriefing in the quarantine the astronauts coming back from the moon.
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:18.044]  And, you know, I'm trying to be very diplomatic and not give away what I'm going to talk about the next day.
[03:10:19.187 --> 03:10:36.850]  The next day when I laid my bombshell on everybody that we found structures on the moon from the Apollo program and the other programs and showed the photographs, the reaction was so bizarre because not only was I slammed up against the wall by this guy and basically threatened, but his wife
[03:10:37.455 --> 03:10:40.097]  We never would come to the conference.
[03:10:40.097 --> 03:10:41.437]  She orbited around.
[03:10:41.437 --> 03:10:53.745]  She would go to a coffee shop down the street and have coffee, or she would go to the supermarket, or she would go and, you know, go back to the house, but she never came to the whole... For three days, she never came to the conference.
[03:10:53.745 --> 03:11:03.771]  One of my associates, who'd kind of gotten friendly with her, because I was there with several other people, kind of got her aside at one point and was asking her some questions.
[03:11:04.446 --> 03:11:14.274]  And it turns out that even though she remembered that she'd been part of the team to debrief the astronauts, she couldn't remember a thing that they said.
[03:11:14.274 --> 03:11:18.958]  She couldn't remember why she no longer was working with NASA.
[03:11:18.958 --> 03:11:30.247]  Her memory lapses were enormous, and I don't think they were faint, because we now found the same pattern in all the flight crews, starting with Ed Mitchell.
[03:11:31.053 --> 03:11:42.741]  Ed Mitchell, when he and I did the debate with Art some years ago, live, coast-to-coast, admitted freely that he was very troubled when he came back to Earth after Apollo 14.
[03:11:42.741 --> 03:11:53.149]  And a young kid at one of these school events, because they all did school events, you know, exciting the next generation, one of the kids asked him, what did it feel like, Dr. Mitchell, to walk on the moon?
[03:11:53.149 --> 03:11:57.832]  And he realized, he admitted in his own book, The Way of the Explorer, Ed Mitchell's book,
[03:11:58.638 --> 03:12:10.641]  And he admitted again on the air with Art and me that night that what troubled him immensely is he could not remember what it felt like to walk on the moon.
[03:12:10.641 --> 03:12:13.302]  Now, Ed is a very emotional guy.
[03:12:13.302 --> 03:12:15.803]  He's a scientist, you know, but he's one of the more emotional.
[03:12:15.803 --> 03:12:18.824]  In other words, he's not repressing his emotions.
[03:12:18.824 --> 03:12:23.025]  So for him not to remember the emotions really bothered him.
[03:12:23.025 --> 03:12:27.266]  And it got so bad that he actually went to a therapist to try to have post-hypnotic
[03:12:27.665 --> 03:12:32.026]  Regression, to see why it was he couldn't remember the feeling.
[03:12:32.026 --> 03:12:33.727]  He remembered the mission plan.
[03:12:33.727 --> 03:12:34.787]  We did this, we did that.
[03:12:34.787 --> 03:12:39.788]  You know, station A, station B. We traversed the Earth, you know, turned this on, all that.
[03:12:39.788 --> 03:12:42.789]  But he couldn't remember the emotions.
[03:12:42.789 --> 03:12:51.651]  And when he got in the therapy session, it turned out that there was a block so big that he literally could not be regressed through it.
[03:12:51.651 --> 03:12:53.611]  He could not penetrate the block.
[03:12:53.611 --> 03:12:55.232]  He would say things like, oh, that's not important.
[03:12:55.232 --> 03:12:56.012]  I don't need to know that.
[03:12:56.903 --> 03:13:14.594]  So, this is one clue, the major clue I have, that the astronauts, probably, when they look into the camera and they say there's nothing there, or they say that Hoagland's nuts or whatever, they're telling from their perspective the truth, because the awful truth, Alex, is they have been brainwashed.
[03:13:14.594 --> 03:13:16.295]  They have been mind-controlled.
[03:13:16.295 --> 03:13:20.298]  They have had a technology, a very sophisticated technology,
[03:13:20.922 --> 03:13:23.785]  Which took away the real missions that they experienced.
[03:13:23.785 --> 03:13:29.851]  Now we have had a few of the astronauts come out and say that they did see craft on the moon, around the moon, and around the Earth.
[03:13:29.851 --> 03:13:30.472]  Those are lies.
[03:13:30.472 --> 03:13:31.152]  Those are lies.
[03:13:31.152 --> 03:13:32.193]  That's more digression.
[03:13:32.193 --> 03:13:33.975]  That's more disinformation.
[03:13:33.975 --> 03:13:36.117]  That's absolutely not true.
[03:13:36.117 --> 03:13:38.099]  What they saw there were structures.
[03:13:38.099 --> 03:13:39.661]  What they saw there was technology.
[03:13:39.661 --> 03:13:40.582]  They were sent there.
[03:13:41.235 --> 03:13:53.000]  The mission of Apollo, I believe, and we laid this out in Dark Mission, was to bring back technology that the in-crowd, the controllers, whoever they are, the people behind NASA,
[03:13:53.772 --> 03:14:03.017]  Well, let me just stop you right there, because in the second interview, I want to spend two hours on that, but I mean, here's what I have to say about the issue.
[03:14:03.017 --> 03:14:16.024]  You mentioned during the last segment we had behind the scenes for Prison Planet dot TV viewers, and folks on the InfoWars dot com streams, that, and I've seen those footage, I remember back in the 90s or whatever it was, seeing it on the news, and NASA released, and why would they release it?
[03:14:16.684 --> 03:14:20.388]  I mean, regardless, we have to talk about that, because that is on the tape, and lasers shooting up, I mean, it's crazy.
[03:14:36.365 --> 03:14:39.708]  Well, it's not laser, it looks like particle beams or some kind of test.
[03:14:39.708 --> 03:14:42.470]  Where the, where the, where the objective... Yeah, particle beams.
[03:14:42.470 --> 03:14:43.751]  Directed energy weapons.
[03:14:43.751 --> 03:14:48.675]  Yeah, directed energy and... I don't want to get technical, but, I mean, just go ahead and get into that for me.
[03:14:48.675 --> 03:14:52.478]  Well, the spacecraft, whatever it is, nimbly dances out of the way.
[03:14:52.478 --> 03:15:04.628]  I mean, this is a technology which can control gravity, controls inertia, does not use something primitive as rocket... So why do we see particle beams, huge ones, firing at things that are... You were saying 200,000 Gs?
[03:15:07.023 --> 03:15:08.964]  I mean, go over that.
[03:15:08.964 --> 03:15:13.727]  Well, because I think it's part of a test for if there are bad guys out there.
[03:15:13.727 --> 03:15:17.970]  Or maybe they're doing preparations for factions.
[03:15:17.970 --> 03:15:20.772]  We may be looking at more than one faction.
[03:15:20.772 --> 03:15:23.253]  Remember, these groups tend to fragment.
[03:15:23.253 --> 03:15:24.974]  They fractally fragment.
[03:15:24.974 --> 03:15:28.937]  So that you have wars within wars within wars.
[03:15:28.937 --> 03:15:33.359]  But why would NASA release that footage?
[03:15:33.359 --> 03:15:35.821]  Well, remember, you've got all the good guys at NASA.
[03:15:36.713 --> 03:15:39.395]  And then you've got a few who are not good guys.
[03:15:39.395 --> 03:15:42.518]  The good guys don't know that there's something to keep secret.
[03:15:42.518 --> 03:15:44.239]  They remember the lies they've heard at every level.
[03:15:44.239 --> 03:15:46.141]  They believe the lies they've been told.
[03:15:46.141 --> 03:15:54.788]  So when you set up a structure, an institution, which is supposed to be open and above board and is supposed to present live TV of the shuttle missions, they present live TV!
[03:15:55.751 --> 03:16:00.753]  Now, the controllers can't say, oh, well, you can broadcast this, but you can't broadcast that.
[03:16:00.753 --> 03:16:03.395]  Because the honest guys are going to say, why can't we broadcast that?
[03:16:03.395 --> 03:16:03.875]  Sure.
[03:16:03.875 --> 03:16:07.296]  So people always say, if this was happening, it would come out.
[03:16:07.296 --> 03:16:09.217]  And it is coming out.
[03:16:09.217 --> 03:16:10.318]  Well, I mean, I agree with you.
[03:16:10.318 --> 03:16:13.879]  When you've got the Catholic Church saying we need to love the aliens, they're our brothers.
[03:16:13.879 --> 03:16:16.941]  When you've got every major denomination saying it.
[03:16:16.941 --> 03:16:19.342]  When you've got all the movies and you've got
[03:16:19.762 --> 03:16:33.926]  You know, in the 80s, huge programs at the Olympics with aliens landing, you know, fake aliens, and you've got huge things the size of three football fields floating over Dallas, and stuff all over the place.
[03:16:33.926 --> 03:16:39.047]  Something's going on in our government documents about fake extraterrestrial landings.
[03:16:39.047 --> 03:16:40.188]  You know, any of this, why?
[03:16:40.188 --> 03:16:41.808]  I mean, you believe it's fake?
[03:16:41.808 --> 03:16:44.229]  Remember Operation Northwood?
[03:16:44.229 --> 03:16:45.129]  Yes.
[03:16:45.129 --> 03:16:48.050]  Okay, or we can go to the, you know, September 11th.
[03:16:49.304 --> 03:16:55.669]  Governments do huge, big things to sway populations at key nodal points in history.
[03:16:55.669 --> 03:16:57.311]  They love hoaxes!
[03:16:57.311 --> 03:17:00.793]  Yeah, well, this manufactured history is what it is.
[03:17:00.793 --> 03:17:09.561]  We are building... I mean, all my UFO friends, I need to shake them because they're so... frankly, they're extremely naive, Alex.
[03:17:09.561 --> 03:17:12.343]  They really believe we're building toward disclosure.
[03:17:13.488 --> 03:17:33.026]  I believe we're building toward a mass, carefully manufactured, fake event, where ETs, who are really humans, who are really part of this secret clique, who are probably Nazis, you know, who developed and perfected their technology from World War II, which is why you've got to get, you know, Joseph von
[03:17:34.033 --> 03:17:37.254]  They are going to basically fake out the world.
[03:17:37.254 --> 03:17:39.114]  Well, now that's been declassified.
[03:17:39.114 --> 03:17:41.355]  The Nazis already had A-bombs.
[03:17:41.355 --> 03:17:43.356]  They call them radiation weapons.
[03:17:43.356 --> 03:17:45.236]  They already had broken the sound barrier.
[03:17:45.236 --> 03:17:46.516]  This is Sparrow's research.
[03:17:46.516 --> 03:17:59.820]  And the reason he got access to this documentation is that when East and West Germany reunited after the wall fell, a huge number of documents from the Polish Secret Service came out.
[03:18:00.763 --> 03:18:08.845]  And in German, of course, which they had purloined and taken back after World War II as part of their spoils from the war.
[03:18:08.845 --> 03:18:10.825]  They have been declassified.
[03:18:10.825 --> 03:18:17.306]  And there's an incredible window on the Nazi black ops program.
[03:18:17.306 --> 03:18:30.249]  The compartmentalized, incredible, high-technology efforts that were being funded by the Nazi war machine, particularly toward the end of the war, in a desperate effort to win the war, and they fastened their hopes on several key technologies
[03:18:30.975 --> 03:18:36.315]  Some of which appear to be the control of gravity itself.
[03:18:37.304 --> 03:18:44.186]  Which, again, is a separate piece of data from my work, which came at this from a hyperdimensional physics perspective.
[03:18:44.186 --> 03:18:46.207]  I mean, we know there's a lot of suppressed technology.
[03:18:46.207 --> 03:18:50.888]  I mean, 20 years after the B-2 bomber was already in service, they declassified it.
[03:18:50.888 --> 03:18:52.909]  So we have a lot of cases of that.
[03:18:52.909 --> 03:18:54.989]  We know there's a whole shadow government.
[03:18:54.989 --> 03:19:01.271]  There's a technology in physics, Alex, that would make anything you think you know like a candle flame compared to a hydrogen bomb.
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:06.242]  This is a physics that literally allows you to rearrange time.
[03:19:06.242 --> 03:19:07.483]  Well, here's an example.
[03:19:07.483 --> 03:19:13.345]  I mean, three years ago, the Air Force General at a press conference, San Francisco Chronicle, picked it up.
[03:19:13.345 --> 03:19:15.586]  Then they came out and said, forget that information.
[03:19:15.586 --> 03:19:17.907]  Admit it, they have antimatter weapons.
[03:19:17.907 --> 03:19:18.908]  I mean, is that the time?
[03:19:18.908 --> 03:19:27.152]  Again, those pale beside what I'm talking about, which is torsion field physics, which is another whole program.
[03:19:27.152 --> 03:19:29.072]  Yeah, well, final segment with Richard C. Hoagland.
[03:19:29.072 --> 03:19:30.173]  When we come back, I want to talk about
[03:19:30.965 --> 03:19:34.006]  What we know about this giant shadow reality.
[03:19:34.006 --> 03:19:35.147]  I mean, imagine the elites.
[03:19:35.147 --> 03:19:37.868]  They get to know the reality, know what's going on.
[03:19:37.868 --> 03:19:41.969]  We're down here caring about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
[03:19:41.969 --> 03:19:44.650]  And what they're trying to build, what their endgame is.
[03:19:44.650 --> 03:19:45.891]  Jim Newcomer from Midas.
[03:19:45.891 --> 03:19:46.391]  July 2nd, 2008.
[03:19:46.391 --> 03:19:47.511]  Gold opened at $9.37 an ounce.
[03:19:47.511 --> 03:19:50.772]  Gold coins can be purchased for $9.63.90, $4.74.70 for a half ounce or $2.37.35 for a quarter ounce.
[03:19:50.772 --> 03:19:50.972]  That's $9.63.90, $4.74.70, $2.37.35.
[03:20:01.001 --> 03:20:03.623]  Hedge fund is caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[03:20:03.623 --> 03:20:05.504]  The bond market continues to slump.
[03:20:05.504 --> 03:20:05.844]  J.P.
[03:20:05.844 --> 03:20:08.746]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[03:20:08.746 --> 03:20:10.948]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[03:20:10.948 --> 03:20:15.711]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[03:20:15.711 --> 03:20:18.152]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[03:20:18.152 --> 03:20:22.756]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[03:20:22.756 --> 03:20:23.176]  The U.S.
[03:20:23.176 --> 03:20:27.459]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[03:20:27.459 --> 03:20:29.180]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:32.522]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[03:20:32.522 --> 03:20:33.802]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[03:20:33.802 --> 03:20:39.246]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[03:20:39.246 --> 03:20:41.087]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:41.087 --> 03:20:42.988]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:20:42.988 --> 03:20:46.450]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:46.450 --> 03:20:49.271]  A new world order.
[03:20:49.271 --> 03:20:53.734]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:20:54.278 --> 03:20:56.982]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:20:56.982 --> 03:20:59.786]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:20:59.786 --> 03:21:02.970]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:02.970 --> 03:21:10.280]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:13.311 --> 03:21:18.755]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:18.755 --> 03:21:22.617]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:22.617 --> 03:21:25.179]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:25.179 --> 03:21:26.340]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:27.140]  They're not after money.
[03:21:27.140 --> 03:21:28.401]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:28.401 --> 03:21:29.402]  They're after power.
[03:21:29.402 --> 03:21:30.543]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[03:21:30.543 --> 03:21:35.306]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[03:21:35.306 --> 03:21:39.268]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:21:39.268 --> 03:21:40.029]  Endgame.
[03:21:40.029 --> 03:21:42.070]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:43.111]  You have been warned.
[03:21:43.251 --> 03:21:43.346]  Yeah.
[03:21:44.335 --> 03:21:53.078]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet.
[03:21:53.078 --> 03:21:55.099]  But it just seemed so difficult.
[03:21:55.099 --> 03:22:04.922]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter Water Ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[03:22:04.922 --> 03:22:06.203]  Drinking water?
[03:22:06.203 --> 03:22:07.863]  Now that's something I can handle.
[03:22:07.863 --> 03:22:13.145]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and help me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[03:22:13.525 --> 03:22:25.633]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great!
[03:22:25.633 --> 03:22:32.658]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508 to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[03:22:32.658 --> 03:22:37.541]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[03:22:37.541 --> 03:22:40.363]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[03:22:40.363 --> 03:22:42.545]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[03:22:43.806 --> 03:22:47.249]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:22:47.249 --> 03:22:49.552]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:22:49.552 --> 03:22:52.855]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:22:52.855 --> 03:22:59.282]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:22:59.542 --> 03:23:00.523]  We're good to go.
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:16.141]  Free webcams available while supplies last.
[03:23:16.141 --> 03:23:17.523]  Terms and restrictions apply.
[03:23:17.523 --> 03:23:18.443]  See website for details.
[03:23:46.622 --> 03:23:49.466]  Imagine the power trip of the elite.
[03:23:49.466 --> 03:23:51.168]  They know what the real technologies are.
[03:23:51.168 --> 03:23:53.131]  They know what's really going on.
[03:23:53.131 --> 03:23:58.878]  While we're down here talking about Hollywood squares and the NFL.
[03:23:58.878 --> 03:24:02.023]  Not even knowing the three branches of the transparent government.
[03:24:03.095 --> 03:24:09.040]  Richard C. Hogan, we're going to have him back up for two hours in the near future to really get into all the wild evidence he's got.
[03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:13.703]  I mean, NASA now basically has admitted they put red filters over the atmosphere to make it look red.
[03:24:13.703 --> 03:24:16.125]  They admit now the sky is blue.
[03:24:16.125 --> 03:24:17.746]  They found ice all over Mars.
[03:24:17.746 --> 03:24:20.348]  I mean, that's the admitted stuff is amazing.
[03:24:20.348 --> 03:24:27.194]  Why would they cover that up in the past and say, oh, we put a red filter on to make the contrast better for you, to play along with that.
[03:24:28.318 --> 03:24:30.038]  But imagine being members of the elite.
[03:24:30.038 --> 03:24:37.060]  They get to fight and jostle and always try to get to the next level of the pyramid to find out more, to be explorers.
[03:24:37.060 --> 03:24:44.262]  It's the ultimate greediness by these people to wall off the general world from true knowledge.
[03:24:44.262 --> 03:24:46.142]  I mean, I want to teach people things.
[03:24:46.142 --> 03:24:47.042]  I want to learn things.
[03:24:47.042 --> 03:24:48.683]  I want to show people things.
[03:24:48.683 --> 03:24:54.624]  I guess they love hoarding all the secret knowledge because it gives them the power, but that's what Ray Kurzweil and all these futurists say.
[03:24:55.242 --> 03:25:00.826]  Well, obviously this has been on my mind from the beginning when I started putting the dots together and realized there were two separate realities.
[03:25:00.826 --> 03:25:02.688]  Actually, more than two, but two will basically suffice for now.
[03:25:23.923 --> 03:25:29.388]  And I've been trying to back-engineer what's the endgame, what's the big picture?
[03:25:29.388 --> 03:25:41.298]  Well, one big picture is that the human race is much older and more extraordinary, astounding, astonishing, than anyone has ever been allowed to believe, certainly in modern times.
[03:25:41.298 --> 03:25:49.846]  If you go to ancient texts, ancient wisdom, ancient documents, ancient sacred writings, you find ample evidence that the human race is
[03:25:50.487 --> 03:25:59.698]  Millions and millions and millions of years old, and that we used to have an incredibly fabulous high-tech civilization that allowed human beings to live like gods.
[03:25:59.698 --> 03:26:01.620]  And then something happened.
[03:26:01.620 --> 03:26:06.526]  The Fall, as we term it in the Western idiom, you know, Genesis.
[03:26:06.526 --> 03:26:09.470]  And now we're basically living almost at a sustenance level.
[03:26:10.174 --> 03:26:27.837]  We're being told now that we have to, in the face of extraordinary physical crises of energy, the lifeblood of civilization, without which everybody becomes poor or dead quickly, we're told we have to drill for something which is ridiculous and primitive as oil.
[03:26:27.837 --> 03:26:32.078]  When they have plenty of advanced technologies, they have incredible advanced technologies.
[03:26:32.078 --> 03:26:37.079]  So the endgame, one of the endgames, is if you control people's sustenance,
[03:26:37.734 --> 03:26:47.067]  If you control the energy in which they live, the resources which they utilize, and the information under which they operate, you control them totally.
[03:26:47.725 --> 03:26:49.186]  So one of the games... And that's it!
[03:26:49.186 --> 03:26:57.992]  We're inside a bottle, we're inside a matrix, uh, not an electronic matrix, but, but, but garbage being fed into our cerebral cortexes.
[03:26:57.992 --> 03:27:10.900]  And well listen, I have to tell you, is that, that's what all this fits into, and that's what my instincts and all of my larger knowledge tells me, is that if you look at humans, we don't act or behave like anything we see, Terran.
[03:27:10.900 --> 03:27:14.763]  To say we're connected to monkeys and chimpanzees and all the rest of it's a total joke.
[03:27:15.263 --> 03:27:18.128]  And then you do look at Mars and all the legends and the rest of it.
[03:27:18.128 --> 03:27:19.750]  It isn't Martians, folks.
[03:27:19.750 --> 03:27:20.672]  It's us.
[03:27:20.672 --> 03:27:22.194]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[03:27:22.194 --> 03:27:22.975]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:27:22.975 --> 03:27:28.283]  Now, you have titled one of your websites, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:27:28.283 --> 03:27:29.165]  I always thought to myself,
[03:27:29.745 --> 03:27:30.965]  What did Alex figure out?
[03:27:30.965 --> 03:27:31.946]  What did he realize?
[03:27:31.946 --> 03:27:32.506]  No, that's it.
[03:27:32.506 --> 03:27:33.826]  We're in a false reality.
[03:27:33.826 --> 03:27:35.667]  I just don't know what it is.
[03:27:35.667 --> 03:27:37.088]  I know they're building camps.
[03:27:37.088 --> 03:27:40.849]  I know they're poisoning us, dumbing us down, genetic engineering us down.
[03:27:40.849 --> 03:27:51.052]  That's all admitted, and I'm trying to branch out now and at least get people thinking about the next level, because all my instincts tell me there's just unbelievable, fabulous things being hidden from us.
[03:27:51.052 --> 03:27:52.493]  Okay, number two.
[03:27:52.493 --> 03:27:55.614]  If you get that they're keeping all the good stuff for themselves,
[03:27:56.457 --> 03:28:07.382]  The reason is that if we got access to the good stuff, if we got access to the technologies, the energy, you know, we wouldn't be worried about $4, $5 a gallon gas or $10 a gallon gas.
[03:28:07.382 --> 03:28:12.405]  We would live like people are supposed to live, all six billion of us.
[03:28:12.915 --> 03:28:16.637]  Who could live lightly on the earth, Alex, with this technology?
[03:28:16.637 --> 03:28:17.657]  And live longer!
[03:28:17.657 --> 03:28:18.758]  And live longer!
[03:28:18.758 --> 03:28:26.221]  Absolutely, and better, and, you know, you could live to 200, 300, and have the virility of your 20s and 30s.
[03:28:26.221 --> 03:28:32.944]  There's extraordinary medical breakthroughs, there's extraordinary physics breakthroughs, technology breakthroughs, energy.
[03:28:32.944 --> 03:28:34.965]  It's all been kept away because
[03:28:35.771 --> 03:28:38.194]  They are supposed to have it, and we're not.
[03:28:38.194 --> 03:28:41.037]  So where does that dichotomy come from?
[03:28:41.037 --> 03:28:43.000]  And by the way, folks, don't roll your eyes at all this.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.361]  We know they're lying and suppressing.
[03:28:44.361 --> 03:28:46.103]  We're just trying to find out what it is.
[03:28:46.103 --> 03:28:46.644]  Think about it.
[03:28:46.644 --> 03:28:53.372]  We're already on a planet hurtling through space, all these wonders around you, and you've been taught it's bizarre to question
[03:28:53.912 --> 03:29:09.739]  And that's because there's so many kooks in the alternative movement who do talk about ridiculous, you know, Hollywood-style green men instead of really looking at the shadow government and all these crazy secret societies that are admittedly running NASA and the shadow government.
[03:29:09.739 --> 03:29:10.139]  Okay.
[03:29:10.139 --> 03:29:11.940]  The lie is different at every level.
[03:29:11.940 --> 03:29:17.302]  The lie is different at every level, and we're trying to expand that and break through those different levels.
[03:29:17.302 --> 03:29:20.983]  Okay, Richard C. Hoagland, fire out the websites again.
[03:29:20.983 --> 03:29:22.544]  EnterpriseMission.com.
[03:29:23.365 --> 03:29:24.686]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:24.686 --> 03:29:26.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:44.835 --> 03:29:50.843]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[03:29:50.843 --> 03:30:02.297]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[03:30:02.697 --> 03:30:03.858]  Here's the story.
[03:30:03.858 --> 03:30:12.001]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[03:30:12.001 --> 03:30:13.161]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:13.161 --> 03:30:14.862]  It's 100% legal.
[03:30:14.862 --> 03:30:21.284]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[03:30:21.284 --> 03:30:26.106]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[03:30:26.106 --> 03:30:30.428]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[03:30:30.428 --> 03:30:31.228]  It's that simple.
[03:30:31.528 --> 03:30:35.171]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:30:35.171 --> 03:30:38.453]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:30:38.453 --> 03:30:44.817]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[03:30:44.817 --> 03:30:45.537]  Hey, Bonnie.
[03:30:45.537 --> 03:30:47.219]  No more pickpocketing for us.
[03:30:47.219 --> 03:30:51.561]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[03:30:51.561 --> 03:30:52.842]  How so, Clyde?
[03:30:52.842 --> 03:30:55.784]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[03:30:55.784 --> 03:31:00.627]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[03:31:00.627 --> 03:31:01.148]  Just watch.
[03:31:01.772 --> 03:31:03.834]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[03:31:03.834 --> 03:31:05.336]  You gotta be kidding me.
[03:31:05.336 --> 03:31:05.716]  Nope.
[03:31:05.716 --> 03:31:10.001]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[03:31:10.001 --> 03:31:12.444]  As long as people don't hear about Identity Stronghold.
[03:31:12.444 --> 03:31:12.984]  Why?
[03:31:12.984 --> 03:31:14.946]  What's Identity Stronghold?
[03:31:14.946 --> 03:31:16.488]  They make the Secure Sleeve.
[03:31:16.488 --> 03:31:20.092]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded Secure Sleeve, I can't read them.
[03:31:20.092 --> 03:31:23.175]  Do a lot of people already know about the Secure Sleeve?
[03:31:23.175 --> 03:31:23.716]  No way.
[03:31:23.996 --> 03:31:27.540]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[03:31:27.540 --> 03:31:30.303]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[03:31:30.303 --> 03:31:31.424]  I already got some.
[03:31:31.424 --> 03:31:33.326]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[03:31:33.326 --> 03:31:38.311]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[03:31:38.311 --> 03:31:40.153]  idstronghold.com?
[03:31:40.153 --> 03:31:40.654]  Right!
[03:31:40.654 --> 03:31:41.635]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[03:31:46.081 --> 03:31:49.383]  Attention please, I've come with a message of information.
[03:31:49.383 --> 03:31:52.025]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:31:52.025 --> 03:31:53.226]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:31:53.226 --> 03:31:54.907]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:31:54.907 --> 03:31:57.809]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:31:57.809 --> 03:32:03.552]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:32:03.552 --> 03:32:10.617]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[03:32:11.118 --> 03:32:17.249]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:32:17.249 --> 03:32:18.351]  An inside job.
[03:32:19.784 --> 03:32:22.206]  How dare you?
[03:32:22.206 --> 03:32:27.290]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:32:27.290 --> 03:32:30.172]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:32:30.172 --> 03:32:36.656]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.
[03:32:36.656 --> 03:32:39.498]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[03:32:39.498 --> 03:32:41.760]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:32:41.760 --> 03:32:44.202]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[03:32:45.788 --> 03:32:50.891]  George Martin was the co-captain of the New York Giants and laid big blue to a Super Bowl victory.
[03:32:50.891 --> 03:32:57.014]  Today he accomplished another amazing feat, finishing a walk all the way across the country to raise money for the forgotten heroes of 9-11.
[03:32:58.860 --> 03:33:00.801]  Heroes come in all shapes and sizes.
[03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:08.763]  In stature, George Martin is one of the larger ones, but in his mind, he's shadowed by the ones that ran towards the towers that day in September.
[03:33:08.763 --> 03:33:11.083]  And that's why he walks now in June.
[03:33:11.083 --> 03:33:14.244]  To me, the mental part of it was more difficult than the physical aspect of it.
[03:33:14.244 --> 03:33:21.526]  I think the cost of my athletic ability, it made it a little bit easier, but the mental challenge of doing this repetitively day in and day out, that was the real grind.
[03:33:22.066 --> 03:33:33.831]  3,000 miles, 10 months, 24 pairs of shoes, and 80 sets of socks later, he arrives in San Diego the hard way, via the highway from Manhattan, met by firemen, cops, and his NFL brother.
[03:33:36.033 --> 03:33:40.134]  George endured a lot during his trek, which averaged 22 miles a day.
[03:33:40.134 --> 03:33:47.537]  He dropped 40 pounds, but also raised $2 million for folks with health-related problems linked to 9-11.
[03:33:47.537 --> 03:33:51.158]  A journey, to be sure, of mind, body, and soul.
[03:33:51.158 --> 03:33:57.460]  I would encourage everyone who is moved by what they're seeing today, or what they're experiencing today, to make their presence known as well.
[03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:12.473]  What a great guy, not being self-centered, thinking about other people, walking across the country, raising more than two million dollars.
[03:34:12.473 --> 03:34:18.215]  ajourneyfor911.info and it all goes to the first responders.
[03:34:18.215 --> 03:34:23.337]  Two million, two thousand and thirty-one has already been raised.
[03:34:23.337 --> 03:34:31.660]  You can also call 1-800-889-8038 and give for the firemen, the police, the other emergency workers that were there.
[03:34:33.237 --> 03:34:35.778]  Let's go ahead and go to our guest.
[03:34:35.778 --> 03:34:44.481]  A lot of folks already know who he is because they're fans of the Giants or NFL football, George Martin, and of course played with the Giants top player.
[03:34:44.481 --> 03:34:47.602]  Mr. Martin, it is great to have you on with us.
[03:34:47.602 --> 03:34:50.103]  Well, thank you very much, and please call me George.
[03:34:50.103 --> 03:34:56.685]  George, how did you first learn about the plight of the first responders from the deadly dust?
[03:34:56.685 --> 03:34:58.165]  I mean, how did this form in your mind?
[03:34:58.165 --> 03:35:00.466]  How did this end up developing and happening?
[03:35:01.539 --> 03:35:13.328]  Well, first of all, I played all 14 of my NFL seasons right here in New York, and I certainly consider myself a transplanted New Yorker, so the events of 9-11, by and large, took place right here in our backyard.
[03:35:13.328 --> 03:35:23.016]  And when I witness the events and I go back in my mind's eye and I see that catastrophe unfolding, I see the horde just rushing away from that catastrophe.
[03:35:23.016 --> 03:35:29.101]  But I also see a small group of people who are actually running towards it, and that always had a profound impact on me.
[03:35:29.614 --> 03:35:47.838]  And when I found out later that post 9-11, that because of their exposure to the toxic cloud at Ground Zero, that some of them had become ill and eventually some of them had died, I decided at that point in time to use my celebrity for two distinct purposes.
[03:35:47.838 --> 03:35:53.360]  Number one, to raise the awareness level of the plight of the first responders and rescue and recovery workers.
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:56.200]  And secondly, to raise funds for their medical treatment.
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:35:57.921]  And that was the essence of the journey from 9-11.
[03:36:00.456 --> 03:36:09.024]  Well, the way that the EPA knew the dust was deadly, they said it was safe to breathe, and then now they've been involved in a huge cover-up.
[03:36:09.024 --> 03:36:20.054]  They gave Christina Todd Whitman liability protection, a court did, and then they still won't give them the health care they need when it's only the cost of four or five smart bombs.
[03:36:20.054 --> 03:36:23.657]  You know, just a few hundred million dollars to give them all the treatment they need.
[03:36:23.657 --> 03:36:24.998]  Why won't they give them the treatment?
[03:36:24.998 --> 03:36:25.599]  I don't understand.
[03:36:26.616 --> 03:36:33.338]  Well, it's perplexing to me, particularly when these individuals act, to me, rises to the level of being heroic.
[03:36:33.338 --> 03:36:39.340]  And as you said, they put their very health, their career, their very lives on the line here.
[03:36:39.340 --> 03:36:44.961]  Why hasn't America and Americans responded in kind to these brave men and women?
[03:36:44.961 --> 03:36:53.944]  And it's so perplexing to me that I think in many regards it angered me, but not to the point where I would do what most of the government is doing, local and state,
[03:36:54.332 --> 03:36:54.592]  I think so.
[03:37:09.566 --> 03:37:18.369]  So instead of just complaining about it, you went and showed them up, I would say, and did some good in the process, raising more than $2 million.
[03:37:18.369 --> 03:37:25.491]  Explain to us where these funds are going to go now, or how these are dispensed out, and who's getting them so other people can give.
[03:37:26.471 --> 03:37:30.594]  Yeah, because $2 million is really just half of the story here.
[03:37:30.594 --> 03:37:43.483]  The bigger story is that with the three participating hospitals that we have that are associated with the journey from 9-1-1, and they are Mount Sinai, Hackensack University Medical Center, and North Shore Long Island Jewish.
[03:37:44.088 --> 03:37:53.738]  Each one of those three participating hospitals have pledged that for every dollar re-raised that they are going to contribute an additional dollar of medical services for these first responders.
[03:37:53.738 --> 03:37:56.480]  Well that's amazing, that's amazing.
[03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:02.226]  In fact, Mount Sinai five years ago did the CAT scans and said they did have horrible lung disease and still
[03:38:03.075 --> 03:38:11.559]  I mean, we have to focus on this because, you know, you're doing this great thing to raise $2 million, now I guess it's over $4 million, because it's being matched, and that'll certainly help hundreds of these people.
[03:38:11.559 --> 03:38:16.561]  We have over a thousand who've died from this, 50-something thousand that are sick from it.
[03:38:16.561 --> 03:38:19.642]  I mean, this could all be over overnight.
[03:38:19.642 --> 03:38:26.965]  I mean, have the feds, in all your investigations, said why they won't give any treatment to these people, or why the state's been doing that?
[03:38:27.935 --> 03:38:31.578]  Well, I've not heard any reasons or any good reasons why they have not.
[03:38:31.578 --> 03:38:40.105]  And again, that kind of angers me because when you look at the cost that we're spending at this war, I mean, you're right.
[03:38:40.105 --> 03:38:44.709]  For a fraction of what we're involved in overseas, we could take care of this problem.
[03:38:44.709 --> 03:38:47.031]  I think they can do it in grand fashion.
[03:38:47.031 --> 03:38:50.694]  And I will commend some of the local congressmen
[03:38:51.190 --> 03:38:59.533]  Carolyn Mahoney and some of her colleagues invited me to Washington, where they did introduce 9-11 legislation.
[03:38:59.533 --> 03:39:03.395]  It's my understanding that it did get out of committee, but it has not been signed by the U.S.
[03:39:03.395 --> 03:39:03.575]  Senate.
[03:39:03.575 --> 03:39:11.598]  Yes, Dennis Kucinich and Mahoney did that, and we had cameras there, and that's in the film Truth Rising, that comes out July 4th, and you're right.
[03:39:11.598 --> 03:39:14.439]  But again, how could it be?
[03:39:14.439 --> 03:39:15.880]  And then that congressman said,
[03:39:16.740 --> 03:39:18.781]  You know, just forget the first responders.
[03:39:18.781 --> 03:39:20.923]  They don't need any money, and now he's in a lot of trouble.
[03:39:20.923 --> 03:39:28.687]  I just don't understand how the government will use their heroics to try to tie it to the war and all the things, and their policies, taking our liberties.
[03:39:28.687 --> 03:39:35.971]  But then when it comes time to just give them some health care, you'd think even if they were cynical and evil, they'd want to take care of them so they wouldn't look bad.
[03:39:35.971 --> 03:39:38.753]  It's just like... It's just so bizarre.
[03:39:39.793 --> 03:39:44.175]  Well, I think what it does is it compounds an already disastrous situation.
[03:39:44.175 --> 03:39:54.439]  Because here you are, people who did not have health care, or did not have adequate health care, or these people who have expired the good health care that they did have.
[03:39:54.439 --> 03:39:58.941]  These people are really hurting, and when I've met some of these first responders who can't walk up
[03:39:59.241 --> 03:40:01.003]  Well, let's go back to the great work you did.
[03:40:01.003 --> 03:40:05.066]  How did you raise two million plus dollars in this walk across the nation?
[03:40:25.501 --> 03:40:39.511]  Now that's a great question, because when you talk about marshalling resources, and this was really a team effort, there were so many people from the corporate side, from the philanthropist side, and also from the grassroots side.
[03:40:39.511 --> 03:40:52.119]  And I'd like to acknowledge some of those individuals, and first of all, there were two outstanding philanthropists here in New York by the name of Joe and Carol Rich, who themselves alone donated and contributed $911,000 for a journey for 9-1-1.
[03:40:55.081 --> 03:41:00.544]  I mean, kudos goes out to those individuals, because that's putting your money where their mouth is.
[03:41:00.544 --> 03:41:12.991]  And then we had such great corporate support, particularly from my company that I work for, Axa Equitable, which is the 14th largest company in the world, who allowed me to go out on this journey for the nine and a half months.
[03:41:13.371 --> 03:41:14.212]  We're good to go.
[03:41:29.195 --> 03:41:29.595]  That's great.
[03:41:48.487 --> 03:41:56.375]  Well, that's the only way we're going to make the world a better place, and if the feds won't take our own tax money and help people that are dying, literally.
[03:41:56.375 --> 03:42:00.980]  I mean, even fire captains and fire chiefs are dead and dying.
[03:42:01.696 --> 03:42:01.896]  I think?
[03:42:19.501 --> 03:42:26.125]  To help, but then we see that being multiplied like the loaves and fishes now, and turning into 4 million.
[03:42:26.125 --> 03:42:38.732]  Looking at that day, 9-11, the 9-11 Commission admitted that there were prior warnings that were ignored, so much that happened, and then supposedly Saudi Arabians attack us, so we attack Iraq.
[03:42:38.732 --> 03:42:44.375]  I mean, what's your larger view, not just of the first responders and the tragedy, but just of the entire 9-11 event itself?
[03:42:46.127 --> 03:42:50.129]  Well, first of all, I'd like to say this because I think the ultimate irony is this.
[03:42:50.129 --> 03:42:50.990]  Here it is.
[03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:54.612]  We've all come to an agreement that it's not a matter of if.
[03:42:54.612 --> 03:42:58.954]  We know that in the future that there's likely to be another attack on America.
[03:42:58.954 --> 03:43:02.156]  And it's not a matter of if, it's only a matter of when.
[03:43:02.156 --> 03:43:08.740]  I did not want to give those brave men and women who now don the uniform of police, fire and rescue, and EMT
[03:43:09.620 --> 03:43:15.184]  A moment to pause because America would not stand behind them in their time of need.
[03:43:15.184 --> 03:43:23.569]  And I thought it was important for someone to stand fast and say, well, we're going to respond in kind the way these brave men and women have responded to us.
[03:43:24.238 --> 03:43:38.366]  Secondly, when you look at the nation's economy, when you look at how gas prices are just soaring through the roof, when you look at the housing meltdown, when you look at how it's costing more for the cost of living, and with inflation tacked onto that, here are people who are suffering.
[03:43:38.366 --> 03:43:43.469]  You talk about Americans who are paying the ultimate price.
[03:43:43.469 --> 03:43:53.054]  It's just incontrovertible for me to understand how we have abandoned together as a government to help these people in their gravest, darkest hour.
[03:43:55.794 --> 03:43:57.175]  Well, at least you're stepping up.
[03:43:57.175 --> 03:44:08.423]  You know, myself and a group called We Are Change in New York, we've raised pittance compared to what you have, but about $50,000 for the Feel Good Foundation and a few other groups in New York.
[03:44:08.423 --> 03:44:13.507]  We sent thousands of gas masks and breathing apparatus the day after 9-11.
[03:44:13.507 --> 03:44:16.589]  We could see that concrete and mercury and arsenic and
[03:44:17.569 --> 03:44:24.313]  Uh, the asbestos would be bad when the media and the government were saying it was good for them, and then it wasn't a problem.
[03:44:24.313 --> 03:44:43.564]  Uh, so, you know, we've tried to do what we could, and again, people have got to ask themselves, why could they could end the PR nightmare, and they could have given them, I mean, even if the government was evil, the people running it were bad, they could have still taken care of the police and firemen and emergency workers, and then they wouldn't have this big nightmare, uh, this big public relations nightmare.
[03:44:43.564 --> 03:44:44.865]  It just, it seems like such a
[03:44:45.740 --> 03:44:47.023]  Such a dumb move.
[03:44:47.023 --> 03:44:57.203]  I mean, I would imagine as you were walking for 10 months across the country, boy, what a way to see America that you were probably asking yourself that as you were walking, weren't you?
[03:44:58.181 --> 03:44:59.122]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:44:59.122 --> 03:45:15.514]  And the thing that is ironic to me, it's my understanding that there were funds that were allocated for the first responders and rescue and recovery workers, but it's been held up, I think, because of the perceived litigation that's going to come down the pike, because people are denied responsibility.
[03:45:16.094 --> 03:45:17.716]  Uh, on the federal level and the state level and the local level.
[03:45:17.716 --> 03:45:22.140]  That's right, you just, exactly, you just answered it and that's the answer to all of it.
[03:45:22.140 --> 03:45:32.010]  If they give them healthcare when all the hospitals say they're dead and dying and their lungs are full and 20% capacity like you said, if they admit they're sick, then there could be a liability, so they're just cutting them loose.
[03:45:33.190 --> 03:45:33.730]  Exactly.
[03:45:33.730 --> 03:45:40.154]  And although we realize this is a very litigious society, it should not preclude people from doing what is right.
[03:45:40.154 --> 03:45:46.817]  And it should not preclude the government from stepping up and fulfilling its obligation and its responsibility toward its citizens.
[03:45:46.817 --> 03:45:47.718]  I don't feel that that's right.
[03:45:48.431 --> 03:45:49.032]  Absolutely.
[03:45:49.032 --> 03:46:04.309]  Tell my listeners in closing, sir, in the few minutes we've got left with you, again, we're talking a famous NFL player, of course, with the Giants, George Martin, who walked across the entire country and raised more than $2 million.
[03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:05.610]  Now it's been doubled up to $4 million.
[03:46:06.691 --> 03:46:20.978]  Uh, for first responders of the 9-11 deadly dust, uh, how people can give and again, where their donations, how their donations, uh, I mean, as you said, it's going basically to healthcare at these hospitals, and then they're gonna double the care.
[03:46:22.017 --> 03:46:28.302]  Yeah, and I will share with them a quick story that always had a profound impact on me as I was traveling.
[03:46:28.302 --> 03:46:33.746]  We were passed by this van, and this grandmother got out of the van with five of her grandchildren.
[03:46:33.746 --> 03:46:43.054]  Four of them were males, and she lined them up along the road, and she pointed at us as we were walking toward her, and she said, I want my grandchildren to witness a part of history.
[03:46:43.474 --> 03:46:50.476]  And I want them to see a real American hero, and I want them to witness the selfless act of giving back to the community.
[03:46:50.476 --> 03:46:54.697]  She then reached in her purse, and she was a lady of very meager means.
[03:46:54.697 --> 03:47:07.741]  She contributed 10 of the $14 that she had in her purse, and we were so reluctant to take it, but we realized that she was teaching her grandchildren a very valuable lesson that was worth more than the $10 that she had contributed.
[03:47:08.240 --> 03:47:23.303]  So for those individuals within the sound of our listening voice who would like their presence to be known and would like to make a difference in the lives of these heroes, please go to our website which is www.ajourney4fr911.info or go to our toll free number which is 1-800-889-8038.
[03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:34.811]  Absolutely.
[03:47:34.811 --> 03:47:37.433]  And again, people think, oh, you can't save the world by giving.
[03:47:37.433 --> 03:47:44.839]  When you give to good things like this, it certainly does have an effect, and it also helps you because it softens your heart.
[03:47:44.839 --> 03:47:46.180]  What was the route?
[03:47:46.180 --> 03:47:51.484]  I mean, I know you've got a map there, but what was the route that you walked across the nation?
[03:47:52.708 --> 03:48:02.253]  Well, the thing that we wanted to do, because for the time of year we were leaving in the fall, we wanted to walk south so we could avoid any inclement weather coming forth.
[03:48:02.253 --> 03:48:05.715]  So we went south as far as we thought was possible.
[03:48:05.715 --> 03:48:12.639]  So we started in New York, went through New Jersey, then Pennsylvania, down through D.C., Delaware, and then through Tennessee.
[03:48:12.639 --> 03:48:14.300]  We walked across Tennessee.
[03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:18.202]  We went across Arkansas into the panhandle of Texas.
[03:48:18.642 --> 03:48:23.527]  What was it like when you finally reached the sea there in San Diego?
[03:48:43.021 --> 03:48:46.264]  Well, it was a moment of elation, as you could probably understand.
[03:48:46.264 --> 03:48:52.469]  But it was also a period of mixed emotions, because here it is, we have been doing this for nine months.
[03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:55.271]  It was something that we absolutely were thrilled about.
[03:48:55.271 --> 03:49:03.978]  We did not have one single day where we missed a walking day due to injury or any injury whatsoever.
[03:49:03.978 --> 03:49:11.865]  And at the same time, we wanted to resume our regular lives, to get back to our families, and to get back to our standard of living.
[03:49:12.399 --> 03:49:17.342]  And, uh, it was just so warm to see how San Diego rolled out the red carpet.
[03:49:17.342 --> 03:49:23.325]  All of the local, uh, heroes there, the firemen, the police, gave us a grand escort through the city.
[03:49:23.325 --> 03:49:25.947]  The mayor issued a mayoral proclamation.
[03:49:25.947 --> 03:49:32.550]  It was just an outstanding experience, and it's, uh, someone said it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I told him I beg to differ.
[03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:35.852]  I don't think that something like this happens quite that often.
[03:49:35.852 --> 03:49:36.973]  Well, I'll say this, sir.
[03:49:38.709 --> 03:49:42.131]  It also exposes the fact that they're not getting the treatment they need.
[03:49:42.131 --> 03:49:53.379]  Not only does it get them some of the treatment, it exposes the fact all over the country, with a lot of local newspapers and TV on the way, getting attention, now national attention.
[03:49:53.379 --> 03:49:58.802]  It's just an example of good people standing up and getting involved.
[03:49:58.802 --> 03:50:03.986]  In closing, how did you come up with the idea, I mean, to do this and then put it into motion?
[03:50:04.932 --> 03:50:11.895]  Well, first, that's a great question, and to begin with, it's a blending of two very distinct passions that I have.
[03:50:11.895 --> 03:50:26.862]  First of all, as a country boy growing up in the outback of Greenville, South Carolina, I'd always had this wonderlust inherent in me, and I always wondered what was the larger picture of this great America that we lived in, because my exposure was limited to that little farm that I grew up on.
[03:50:27.362 --> 03:50:29.885]  And I always wanted to see this country up close and personal.
[03:50:29.885 --> 03:50:32.409]  I'll tell you what, final segment coming up.
[03:50:32.409 --> 03:50:33.009]  Sir, stay there.
[03:50:33.009 --> 03:50:35.552]  I want to come back and finish up why you decided to do this.
[03:50:35.552 --> 03:50:39.037]  You know, how the idea finally popped into your head and how you did it.
[03:50:39.037 --> 03:50:41.680]  On the other side, with our guest, George Martin.
[03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:42.081]  Stay with us.
[03:50:47.364 --> 03:50:50.766]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[03:50:50.766 --> 03:50:55.589]  They get closer and closer and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.

[03:52:44.116 --> 03:52:50.061]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:52:50.061 --> 03:52:55.085]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[03:52:55.085 --> 03:53:00.270]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.

[03:53:04.193 --> 03:53:12.695]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[03:53:12.695 --> 03:53:18.497]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[03:53:18.497 --> 03:53:24.479]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:53:24.479 --> 03:53:29.760]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[03:54:08.752 --> 03:54:10.693]  And, uh, he's done a good thing.
[03:54:10.693 --> 03:54:13.014]  He's walked all the way across the country.
[03:54:13.014 --> 03:54:14.515]  Raised an album.
[03:54:14.515 --> 03:54:16.236]  Got it matched over four million dollars.
[03:54:16.236 --> 03:54:17.396]  Very exciting.
[03:54:17.396 --> 03:54:22.559]  And he was finishing up how he got the idea to do it and how he put that into action, which is important.
[03:54:22.559 --> 03:54:26.300]  You can think about things or talk about things all day, but he took action.
[03:54:26.300 --> 03:54:27.261]  Finish up your story, please, sir.
[03:54:28.186 --> 03:54:32.867]  Well, yes, as a country boy, as I said, I always had this inherent desire to do so.
[03:54:32.867 --> 03:54:36.468]  But if I ever did it, I wanted to have a cause associated with it.
[03:54:36.468 --> 03:54:44.529]  And it took me and my friends a very short time to come up with what we think was the most appropriate cause, and that's the journey for 9-11.
[03:54:44.529 --> 03:54:48.650]  And we are just so delighted to have served as ambassadors for this wonderful cause.
[03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:54.311]  And my dad always told me, he said, son, make sure that you leave this world a little bit better than you found it.
[03:54:54.311 --> 03:54:57.772]  And I hope that through those 3,000 miles, I've attempted to do so.
[03:54:59.375 --> 03:55:07.919]  Well, I think you've done that, and again, thank you for raising the money, getting a medical care, and drawing attention to the huge cover-up of what's happened that is unraveling.
[03:55:07.919 --> 03:55:09.300]  Thanks to people like you, George Martin.
[03:55:09.300 --> 03:55:11.941]  George, thank you, and have a great weekend.
[03:55:11.941 --> 03:55:12.542]  It's my pleasure.
[03:55:12.542 --> 03:55:14.483]  Have a great Fourth of July celebration yourself.
[03:55:14.483 --> 03:55:14.823]  You bet.
[03:55:14.823 --> 03:55:15.303]  Take care.
[03:55:15.303 --> 03:55:20.806]  Yeah, we're going to have a long weekend coming up, but Jason Burmess wants to sit in Thursday.
[03:55:20.806 --> 03:55:22.667]  Tomorrow, Ron Paul is on the show.
[03:55:23.698 --> 03:55:32.621]  Ron Paul, Congressman, talk about the war, what will happen to energy prices if we are engaged in a conflict with Iran.
[03:55:32.621 --> 03:55:36.102]  We have a surprise guest who's joining us for an hour and a half.
[03:55:36.102 --> 03:55:37.942]  That's not Ron Paul.
[03:55:37.942 --> 03:55:41.964]  Big guest after big guest after big guest tomorrow.
[03:55:41.964 --> 03:55:47.965]  Truth Rising comes out in 24 hours, and I'll just let my listeners know.
[03:55:47.965 --> 03:55:49.806]  It'll be out Thursday night.
[03:55:50.663 --> 03:55:59.407]  You know, we said officially that it comes out July 4th, but in case there's ever a server snafu, we got two CDNs and a bunch of backup servers.
[03:55:59.407 --> 03:56:04.309]  I like to start it a little early, knowing that only a fraction of our audience is tuned in at any one time.
[03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:14.854]  So for the few of you listening now, compared to the huge millions that tune in every week, tomorrow afternoon, I'll just say that, start looking for it to be up in a bunch of different formats at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:56:17.185 --> 03:56:21.969]  And, again, I want you to make copies of the film, digital copies, DVD copies.

[03:56:25.631 --> 03:56:28.874]  It'll be shipping out Saturday and Monday to you.
[03:56:28.874 --> 03:56:35.279]  So, for all intents and purposes, it's no longer pre-ordering at InfoWars.com or get your presentplanet.tv membership.
[03:56:35.279 --> 03:56:37.260]  See all of my other 18 films.
[03:56:37.260 --> 03:56:37.800]  It'll be my 19th film.
[03:56:39.470 --> 03:56:46.214]  Uh, see my weekly TV reports, these live streams we do, like we're doing now, are also posted for, uh, all the members every day.
[03:56:46.214 --> 03:56:48.595]  And they cut them up and do a lot of stuff with them and put them all over the web.
[03:56:48.595 --> 03:56:51.076]  We appreciate folks doing that.
[03:56:51.076 --> 03:56:55.899]  Because the goal is to get the word out, but your financial support is also needed.
[03:56:55.899 --> 03:56:58.500]  So again, get Truth Rising, get In Game.
[03:56:58.500 --> 03:57:02.362]  We have a discount of a Tex Marsh new book, the sequel to Codex Magicka.
[03:57:02.362 --> 03:57:03.663]  And I think it's even better, folks.
[03:57:03.663 --> 03:57:06.104]  His new book is just unbelievable.

[03:57:16.369 --> 03:57:18.350]  And the retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:18.350 --> 03:57:21.250]  For any of the big guests and important information that we had on today, the MNFM
[03:57:30.842 --> 03:57:38.613]  The show's over, but, and the satellite, it's over until tonight, 9 to midnight, where it's all rebroadcast on shortwave satellite, the MNFM dial.

[03:58:35.055 --> 03:58:42.017]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[03:58:42.807 --> 03:58:44.208]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:58:44.208 --> 03:58:47.230]  Whitman, EPA Director on the 18th made a statement that the air
[03:58:58.544 --> 03:58:59.665]  We're safe to breathe.
[03:58:59.665 --> 03:59:02.208]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:59:02.208 --> 03:59:04.950]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[03:59:16.061 --> 03:59:19.123]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:37.297]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:59:37.297 --> 03:59:39.819]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
