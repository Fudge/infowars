[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.000 --> 00:30.000]  Well, this is going to be a jam-packed broadcast today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  It is the 18th day of July 2011 on this Monday edition.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  Obviously, gold has surged past $1,600 an ounce in the middle of its historically dead period.
[00:42.000 --> 00:49.000]  The summer, there is all this diversionary talk about the debt ceiling,
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  and I continue to get calls and emails saying, why aren't you talking more about it?
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000]  Because, as Ron Paul said a month ago, it is all rearranging debt chairs on the Titanic.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  We have signed on to the 1.5 quadrillion that we have been induced to sign on to
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  by our terrorist politicians, financial terrorist politicians,
[01:10.000 --> 01:18.000]  and you could give the bankers all the wealth in the world it wouldn't pay off a fraction.
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  I mean, do you remember even what the Chinese talked about months ago?
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  They said the United States has already technically defaulted on its debt,
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  and that's what's happened with the QE1, QE2, now QE3.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  So we're going to be discussing that today.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  We're going to go over the economy.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  I told you Rick Perry was going to run for president,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  and his whole pledge that he wouldn't run was a pledge he always meant and intended to break
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  we're going to be going over that news as well.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  I haven't talked a lot about this. I've talked about it some,
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  and yes, I will discuss it coming up.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  The fellow that heads up Bilderberg, major website,
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  Bilderberg.org, Tony Gosling, great reporter.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  He's been following us closely from London.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  He'll be joining us in 30 minutes.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  The entire news core crises with two police chiefs,
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  the police commissioner and the head of Scotland Yard,
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  having to resign the last 24 hours.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  The head of the news core in England, in the UK,
[02:27.000 --> 02:35.000]  arrested as you know, overhacking people's phones to get news stories.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  And I think that's wrong, and they should get in trouble for it.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  But, meanwhile, I've been following this for the last week,
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  thinking the police would do something.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  Millionaire, six-year-old son dies from a mysterious accident mansion
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  where his father's lover was found hanging, naked,
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  with her arms and legs bound,
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  and the police are saying this is just like Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb's death,
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  shot twice in the back of the head with a shotgun.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  They said that was quite normal for you to shoot yourself twice in the head,
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  back of the head with a shotgun.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  Kind of like Fami Malek, the Arkansas medical examiner would rule
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  that people that were chopped up and burned had done it to themselves.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  Let's try to chop your arms and legs off.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  So, this is what I said with Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  I don't like him. He's a globalist.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  I hate their policies, but the fact that he would get busted for reported rape,
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  that is suspicious.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  Then we learned Sarkozy had spies on him,
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  announced he'd been arrested before, even been arrested before,
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  was even in the news via their Twitter, his Carl Rove, his political hatchet guy did,
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  and now we learned the whole thing was a fraud.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  So, I'm just telling you with this Rupert Murdoch deal,
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  they are announcing emergency parliament session.
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  We've got good intel that they are currently planning to launch a war in Iran in September,
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  and Bob Baer, the former top CA officer in the Middle East,
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  is saying that it's green-lighted, but it could still be called off.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  Debka Files reporting that.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  We got a big report.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  We got that from inside Bilderberg as well this year.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  Meanwhile, they're getting ready to launch all these new wars.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  They're getting ready to ground invade Libya.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  So, Gaddafi finally got the word and is finally actually saying,
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  yes, I may step down if I'm given a deal and allowed to leave.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  So, I hope something's brokered with Iran.
[04:27.000 --> 04:34.000]  The word is, their government may remove Ahmed Denizide in the next month to avert this attack.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  The point is, we got bigger issues going on here than DSK and Rupert Murdoch
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  and his reported dirty activities.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  But, nevertheless, I will cover that.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  The economy, Rick Perry, five dead in attack on Chinese police station.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Ryan's going on all over China.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  Globalists sell us China as this wonderful panacea.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  Truth is, it's teetering on the verge of collapse.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  The entire world is.
[05:00.000 --> 05:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[05:09.000 --> 05:15.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  It's true.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[05:52.000 --> 06:01.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[06:28.000 --> 06:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  Today, it seems like nobody does care. And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  Call your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[06:54.000 --> 07:20.000]  Watch it online right now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  And also deliver the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[07:30.000 --> 07:40.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[07:45.000 --> 07:56.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com
[08:15.000 --> 08:24.000]  In the third hour of the broadcast, we're going to perhaps show the video.
[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com of a teen in San Francisco who didn't pay a $2 bus fare.
[08:33.000 --> 08:41.000]  And so the police shoot him and he convulses and coughs up his lifeblood as the cops stand around him with guns.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  And it looks like that the San Francisco Police Department is saying this is a good thing to do.
[08:46.000 --> 08:56.000]  Meanwhile, the foreign banks that rule this country have stolen at least $27 trillion of U.S. taxpayer money.
[08:56.000 --> 09:06.000]  And when we give them the money, we then have to pay interest on the money we give them and have our taxes raised for austerity and have basic services cut off
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  and have the dollar devalued, which annihilates people on fixed income, social security, you name it.
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  Nothing's going to happen to the bankers, at least at this juncture, because the public has been so conditioned.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  But I think we will show the video. Folks are listening going, I'm listening to you on the AM or FM dial.
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  We simulcast all the show in live living color at prisonplanet.tv.
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.000]  We'll warn people when we play the video. But there he is, gun down, unarmed, and then coughing up his lifeblood.
[09:39.000 --> 09:51.000]  Of course, a year and a half ago, you saw the footage in the San Francisco Bay area of the youth pulled off the train because 30 months earlier a fight had been reported.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  It turned out it wasn't the right young people. And they're all sitting there on the ground and they get him up, put him in handcuffs.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  He doesn't resist and the officer shoots him in the back, pulls the gun out and shoots him in the back.
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000]  It looked extremely deliberate. And then the police lied and said he'd fought them and attacked them.
[10:08.000 --> 10:15.000]  They thought they'd confiscated all the cell phone cameras, but somebody about 30 yards away in another train was able to shoot the whole incident.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  It was stopped. And the police tried to defend it at first, so there was riots.
[10:19.000 --> 10:27.000]  Then they gave the guy a couple years in jail and he served less than a year, the police officer that engaged in the execution.
[10:27.000 --> 10:41.000]  This is the essence of living in a third world tyranny where the police are basically violent video game fans or steroid admirers and are looking for a trophy.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  They're like deer hunters. And we've seen the quotes by police in the news more and more.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  I love to hunt. I love to hunt humans. It's so much fun. I want to get some.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  So they go to the wrong house. It's a veteran. The wife says, honey, there's people around the windows.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  He gets his rifle and they bust in and got him down.
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.000]  And as he's flopping around dying, they go ahead and run up, shoot him a few more times and start squealing with delight because they're getting some.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  They're playing the video game and it's so much fun.
[11:14.000 --> 11:28.000]  They go to the insurance salesman's house because the crackhead informant wants to get some money and fingers the wrong house to the police raid the house looking for drugs openly shipped in by the U.S. government and big banks.
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.000]  And they go in the house and the 67 year old retired insurance salesman in a million dollar house gets up out of his bed with a handgun.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  They kill him and the police say, hey, it's good.
[11:39.000 --> 11:51.000]  This is America. This is what our country has turned into. And I was going to cover a bunch of other news, but watching that video right before the show was so, so horrific.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  Again, it's up on info wars dot com.
[11:55.000 --> 12:10.000]  And prison planet dot com. If you want to watch the real world, not some simulated death that we've been conditioned to all the violence on television, but the real deal. It is up an info wars dot com and prison planet dot com.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Now, here's what's coming up today.
[12:15.000 --> 12:31.000]  We have Tony Gosling of Builderburg dot org, great reporter from England joining us to break down the whole news core scandal now spreading to the United States with criminal investigations and Australia, not just the epicenter, the UK.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  UK Prime Minister calls for emergency session of parliament.
[12:36.000 --> 12:49.000]  Overall this because of course he's knee deep in with the mercadoids, the Murdoch oids. And we've got a headline scandal grows at news core, the head of news core in England arrested.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  Scotland yard heads steps down reportedly in a bribery investigation.
[12:54.000 --> 13:04.000]  The head of the Metropolitan Police Commission. That's big steps down. This is spreading. So there's some coup counter coup going on. Let me give you a news flash.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  This comes out in Hollywood all the time.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  In fact, it came out in a murder trial.
[13:08.000 --> 13:15.000]  Just a few years ago with one of LA's biggest detectives, private detectives involved with the police and others wiretapping folks.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  This is how business is done.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  You know, you look at the fortune 500 or even the fortune 100.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  What is it of the 100 biggest economies in the world?
[13:28.000 --> 13:37.000]  Last time I checked, we can look it up. 54 of the 100 biggest economies are not countries.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  They're corporations.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  Walmart is bigger than most major countries.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  Of course, they have their own mercs.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  They have their own spies. They have their own operatives.
[13:50.000 --> 14:00.000]  And my issue here is why they go after Dominique Strauss-Kahn when if you're a globalist in good standing, you can get away with murder.
[14:00.000 --> 14:14.000]  Why are they going after Murdoch now for some phone hacking, which is standard operating procedure for big fortune 100 media companies?
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  I mean, Lady Gaga's partner right a week after they signed their record deal fell off a building.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  I'm sure it was suicide.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  I mean, if you really live in the real world, this world is run by the ruthless.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  So I think the whole thing sticks to high heaven.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  I'm all for Rupert Murdoch to be punished.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  But first, they need to punish people like this guy.
[14:41.000 --> 14:47.000]  Or it needs to be investigated. Let's find out who ever was behind this.
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  A millionaire six-year-old son dies after a mysterious accident at Manchin where his father's lover was found hanging naked.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  So first, a six-year-old son falls down the stairs and then dies conveniently yesterday in the hospital.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  The six-year-old son of a multi-millionaire pharmacological tycoon has died just days after his father's girlfriend was found dead hanging naked from a balcony.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  With her arms and legs bound.
[15:12.000 --> 15:21.000]  Two days before Rebecca Nellipa's bizarre death, Max Shackani, if I'm pronouncing that right,
[15:21.000 --> 15:30.000]  had fallen down the stairs of his father's historic mansion in Coronado in her care.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  He died at Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego yesterday.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  So this article is trying to kind of imply maybe she was involved, so that's why this happened to her.
[15:40.000 --> 15:51.000]  Medics and Pharmaceutical Chief Executive Jonah Shackani announced.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  And it goes on here in the articles.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  Again, son, girlfriend, and CEO died after incidents at San Diego mansion.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  And the police are saying they're not sure it's going to be a murder investigation that she was naked hanging from the front balcony in plain view of the house with her arms and legs tied.
[16:10.000 --> 16:21.000]  You know, there was a Palestinian professor here in Austin a few years ago who was found with his arms and legs duct tape, tortured, gutted, wrist slit.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  And I know because the Imam called me about it.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  Later it came out in the news.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  The Austin police ruled it was suicide.
[16:26.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's right.
[16:27.000 --> 16:36.000]  Off the Congress Street Bridge, he reportedly got himself, slit his wrist, and then with duct tape bound, oh, I'm sorry, his mouth, arms and legs.
[16:36.000 --> 16:47.000]  And remember, remember, Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb for Dark Alliance on CIA drug trafficking had a new book coming out, even documenting it further.
[16:47.000 --> 16:53.000]  And it told friends and family, and I'd even talked to him a few months before, that he had a lot of stuff coming out.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  Would I help him build a website to pull all his documents out and he had guys breaking in his house, so he was going to move.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  And they shot gun him twice in the back of the head.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  And the police was in Sacramento.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  The police ruled that he had killed himself.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  And they said it was quite normal to treat yourself twice in the heads.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  But I'm digressing.
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  I'm digressing.
[17:13.000 --> 17:22.000]  We've got Rick Perry growing more comfortable with the call from God and citizens for him to run for president.
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.000]  And I told you the word is he's going to announce coming up in a couple of weeks at that prayer meeting down in Houston.
[17:28.000 --> 17:38.000]  Of course, he'll drop the Christian evangelicals once he gets the nomination, like a old shoe to use the words of Jim Tucker.
[17:38.000 --> 17:46.000]  We told you three and a half years ago in Endgame, he'd be the 2012 nominee that Bilderberg wanted, because the Bilderberg group, to a great extent, runs the planet.
[17:46.000 --> 17:55.000]  They steer it. They're trying to totally run and dominate the planet.
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  And we're attempting to point out that they bring the politicians, Bill Clinton, a year and a half before he ran for president from nowhere.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  Backwater governor, boom, president, Tony Blair, nobody, member of parliament, is summoned to Bilderberg.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  Only a few politicians a year are summoned.
[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  And when they're summoned, you better believe they're on the fast track to be El Presidente or Prime Minister.
[18:18.000 --> 18:35.000]  And again, my issue with Rick Perry is, I'm going to cover this more later, but the point is he was for forced inoculations with the Merck Gardasil shot that admittedly killed people in trials and has killed them since and doesn't protect you from human papillomavirus.
[18:35.000 --> 18:45.000]  He pushed the whole Natta Superhighway situation. He pushed that for the North American Union.
[18:45.000 --> 18:56.000]  He also, of course, was Al Gore's former campaign manager for the state of Texas in his presidential run the first time when he ran against Bill Clinton in the early 90s for that nomination.
[18:56.000 --> 19:05.000]  Rick Perry pledged that he was not going to run for president and was going to stay and be Texas governor six months ago. He pledged.
[19:05.000 --> 19:12.000]  When the whole time, and I knew it from insiders, he was planning to run and we told you that was a fake pledge and then he would break it.
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  It's one thing to say, I pledge and then, well, I'm breaking my pledge, then you know, read my lips, no new taxes, you can't be trusted.
[19:18.000 --> 19:27.000]  That's bad enough. But to knowingly put out a fake pledge and then say all shucks, I'm the reluctant politician. You drug me here with wild horses.
[19:27.000 --> 19:37.000]  You drafted me. I'm going to do it. And his statements yesterday to an Iowa newspaper, of course, he's like, I don't want to be president.
[19:37.000 --> 19:44.000]  My wife and constituents and God want me to. And so I'm really thinking about it.
[19:44.000 --> 19:51.000]  I told you, he made that pledge to break it. At that time, he was not intending to not run for president.
[19:51.000 --> 19:58.000]  He was intending to play out this whole scripted baloney. Now I'm going to tell you what's really going on with the debt ceiling. Stay with us. Stay with us.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  This is key. Want to know what's really happening straight ahead.
[20:01.000 --> 20:06.000]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[24:00.000 --> 24:26.000]  We will not be forgotten. We won't be left behind. Our memories live on in mortal mind.
[24:26.000 --> 24:41.000]  I knew that Ron Paul and many other economist researchers, myself included, have pointed out that for at least three years this country has been in an irreconcilable financial position.
[24:41.000 --> 24:58.000]  We have been maneuvered to a point where we have been signed on by our traitorous politicians to $1.5 quadrillion, $1,500 trillion, $600 plus trillion of that.
[24:58.000 --> 25:17.000]  The Washington Post even admits supposedly owed by the American people. The other $900 trillion or so is owed by the other nations run by the very same six global megabanks that are the New World Order.
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.000]  They're the groups that run it, finance it, shut up global standardization, agenda 21, carbon taxes, everything.
[25:24.000 --> 25:36.000]  They run the show. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citibank, they are the people that run the entire show.
[25:36.000 --> 25:44.000]  Bank of England. And they have their private holding companies, their front companies, their shell corporations, Federal Reserve, IMF, World Bank.
[25:44.000 --> 26:02.000]  Now continuing, remember this article, there was a whole bunch of them, Times of London, AP, this happens to come out of USA today, headline from May 10th, China says the U.S. is already defaulting on its debt.
[26:02.000 --> 26:11.000]  And the Chinese say, we don't care if you raise your debt ceiling, we don't care if you sell more treasury bonds, we're not going to buy them because you're devaluing the dollar.
[26:11.000 --> 26:19.000]  And a day after China said that, Bernanke came out and said, no, we are not going to have QE3. Now last week he said, yes, we're going to do it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:30.000]  They're still printing at record pace. Of course, they're going to have QE3. This is the massive tax increase without even passing tax increases.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  And by the way, they're in the news today saying the average tax rate will be really 70%.
[26:35.000 --> 26:47.000]  That's in the Wall Street Journal under what Obama is proposing. But again, the big mega banks and their subsidiaries like Google and GE, they pay zero to 2.4.
[26:47.000 --> 27:04.000]  That was in even MSNBC this weekend, zero to 2.4. You're like, well, they individually pay. No, they don't because they all work for subsidiaries that are offshore based in countries like Luxembourg and Ireland and others where they've written the rules where they're exempt.
[27:04.000 --> 27:14.000]  That's why all these big billionaires are on TV every day saying, we'll fix the economy, raise taxes, get the rich people. They say, I'm rich. I'm Warren Buffett. Get me, raise taxes.
[27:14.000 --> 27:26.000]  When he fully knows he's exempt from it all. And the average working person says, well, get that rich guy. Yeah, get people making 125,000 individually, quarter million collectively in a household.
[27:26.000 --> 27:39.000]  And that will further kill the economy. I mean, look, Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in one bracket, by what, 38 in the other bracket, and tax receipts doubled. They know that.
[27:39.000 --> 27:47.000]  California, when they raise taxes, know it's going to put the country into bankruptcy. That's what the banksters want. They're ruthless.
[27:47.000 --> 27:59.000]  But here it is, USA Today. Forget the debt ceiling debate. The U.S. is already into fault of Chinese Rating Agency claims. There you go. What did Ron Paul say a month ago? And again, last week, it's all a diversion.
[27:59.000 --> 28:16.000]  Okay, they're going to raise the debt ceiling so that the U.S. will quote, sign on to the money the Federal Reserve orders the Treasury to print and the ones and zeros they order to be put in the big six megabanks coffers, which they then loan out to us.
[28:16.000 --> 28:26.000]  And the government for the right to have the banks create new money because they took over that power in 1913 from a trader as Congress, Federal Reserve Act.
[28:26.000 --> 28:39.000]  Then we pay interest and the tax increases to them. And then the austerity where they cut the basic services but raise the taxes because everything has to go to the quote, too big to fail.
[28:39.000 --> 28:55.000]  There's another article out today where 70 plus percent of the debts worldwide are owed by the six banks themselves. 70 plus percent in some countries, like Iceland, it's over 90. In Greece, it's over 90. In Ireland, it's over 90.
[28:55.000 --> 29:09.000]  But globally, I've got the article, it's 70 something. I've hit the exact number. 70 plus percent admittedly owed by them. And guess what? They also own 70 percent, control 70 plus percent of bank deposits worldwide.
[29:09.000 --> 29:22.000]  All the bank deposits, all the real estate, all the money wouldn't pay for a fraction of the 1.5 quadrillion, quadrillion. They're debating 14 trillion in debt.
[29:22.000 --> 29:36.000]  They're debating all this. They're just maneuvering us. They already put the debt ceiling up four months ago. They're already announcing QE 3. They'll be QE 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 until that dollar isn't even worth the paper it's written on.
[29:36.000 --> 29:50.000]  A dollar will soon be worth what a penny is. The dollar since 1913 has already lost 98 percent of its buying value. Well, now they're getting rid of those last few pennies of value robbing everyone.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:20.000 --> 30:28.000]  The easy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[30:28.000 --> 30:39.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[30:39.000 --> 31:01.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.

[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:04.000 --> 32:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.000 --> 32:20.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[32:20.000 --> 32:29.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:29.000 --> 32:36.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[32:52.000 --> 33:01.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[33:01.000 --> 33:17.000]  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you. By now, you should have somehow realized what you gotta do.
[33:17.000 --> 33:23.000]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.
[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., we are here live, central.
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  Okay, we're going to Tony Gosling, great reporter from Buildenburg.org.
[33:34.000 --> 33:46.000]  He's been popping in a lot of the international television, giving his inside breakdown from his sources on what's really behind the whole news core scandal in England.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.000]  Then I'm getting back into gold above 1600 as debt default fears simmer.
[33:53.000 --> 34:01.000]  The banksters threatened to get rid of U.S. credit rating. That's a complete fraud. We've already defaulted.
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  That's all coming up, silver going above $40 an ounce because the banksters are signaling dollar devaluation.
[34:08.000 --> 34:18.000]  That is all coming up. Wayne Paul, himself a CPA, and of course, a brother of Ron Paul will be joining us coming up at the middle of the second hour.
[34:18.000 --> 34:28.000]  We'll also have open phones coming up in the second hour and a ton of news, military news, CIA veteran Robert Bear predicts September is Israel, Iran war.
[34:28.000 --> 34:38.000]  It is all coming up. But right now, I want to bring on air former researcher for BBC London, reporter for BBC Wilshire Sound,
[34:38.000 --> 34:49.000]  helped establish Eye Contact video network and Ecovillage Network UK since 2009. He's produced and presented Friday drive time, the weekly politics show on Bristol Community FM,
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  which gives a provincial perspective on the news Britain and around the world. Buildenburg.org is his website.
[34:55.000 --> 35:05.000]  I would say he's best known for doing great work reporting on the corrupt ruling fascistic class controlling our planet.
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.000]  I wanted to get Tony on because this whole news core situation is exploding and I want to get his take on why this is happening.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  We're not saying Rupert Murdoch's a good guy, but this is part of the course activity for a lot of big Fortune 100 media companies.
[35:20.000 --> 35:29.000]  Why is this happening now? If you're in favor of the globalist, if you're in good standing, you can literally engage in any type of mayhem you wish.
[35:29.000 --> 35:39.000]  AP UK Prime Minister calls for emergency session of parliament over this. Of course, you know, yesterday the head of Scotland Yard had to step down reportedly with a bribery investigation.
[35:39.000 --> 35:50.000]  The head of news core in England, Rebecca Brooks, has been arrested over the weekend. Murdoch ran in there last week to meet with her and obviously get their story straight.
[35:50.000 --> 36:01.000]  Continuing also now this morning, the head of the Metropolitan Police, the police commissioner also resigned and this goes right up to Cameron and that's why he's acting like he's investigating the whole thing.
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  Joining us is reporter Tony Gosling. Tony, thanks for coming on with us.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  Hi Alex, thanks very much for having me on.
[36:09.000 --> 36:22.000]  What's the inside baseball? What's the inside cricket on this or the inside soccer? What's the intel you've got? I mean, I want to get into the scandal, but why is this happening now?
[36:22.000 --> 36:35.000]  Well, just to let you know, we've just heard in the last hour or so that not only the number one policeman in Britain resigned yesterday, but we've also had the number two resign as well, just literally within the last hour or so.
[36:35.000 --> 36:50.000]  So Paul Stevenson resigned yesterday about 7pm our time and literally just this afternoon we've had is number two who's the head of counterterrorism for the entire country resigned today.
[36:50.000 --> 36:59.000]  He resigned because they were threatening him basically with suspension. That's John Yates. So we've had a really totally unprecedented situation.
[36:59.000 --> 37:07.000]  I don't think ever in history Britain's two top policemen resigned within 24 hours. It's absolutely astounding.
[37:07.000 --> 37:21.000]  And it's just kind of as I predicted in a way because last week I was saying that this investigation is now moving away from News International for a while, from the Rube of Murdoch Empire and now is looking at the police handling of the whole affair
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.000]  because the Metropolitan Police have had information about corruption at News International for something like seven or eight years sitting on their books.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  Yeah, at least 2005 is what major papers are reporting.
[37:35.000 --> 37:47.000]  Yeah, so why haven't they acted on that? That's the question. And this was clearly not a small little bit of phone hacking that was going on of a royal telephone, which is the way they wanted it to appear.
[37:47.000 --> 37:53.000]  And what's happened, of course, is all these policemen have sat down together and say, well, do you think we want to investigate ourselves?
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  And then they've decided not to. So that's why this is really starting to unfold. It's like a dam breaking, Alex.
[37:59.000 --> 38:05.000]  They've been trying to put little bits of wood to prop the thing up for the last six or seven years.
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  And finally, there's no way they're going to prop it up anymore because the truth is coming out now.
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  We've got some decent police on this operation, waiting, doing a proper investigation. I mean, we just heard also the other newspapers.
[38:17.000 --> 38:25.000]  There's been police raids at other tabloid newspapers like the Daily Star, for example, and the police are really going for it now, it seems.
[38:25.000 --> 38:34.000]  And of course, that means that those police that are basically corrupt and refused to investigate this in the past or have only done partial investigations,
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  they've put primary-facing evidence of criminal activity, which they've not acted on, those were the guys who are now in the frame, too.
[38:40.000 --> 38:48.000]  They're in the dock most definitely. And I don't think that these two police, and let's not forget also that John Yates,
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  he popped counterterrorism policemen in Britain. So it raises all sorts of questions about the way he's handled.
[38:54.000 --> 39:02.000]  All the fallout from the 777 London bombings and the police handling of terrorism generally in Britain is now also under question
[39:02.000 --> 39:11.000]  because it's been shown that Yates has basically moved around the whole issue and made sure that the embarrassing questions being asked about why
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.000]  he hasn't been pursuing the phone hacking have come home to roost. So absolutely crisis at the Metropolitan Police right now.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  The question is, who is actually going to be a credible person to take over?
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  And I think there's a real problem here because we've just heard an ounce within the last 10, 15 minutes
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  that the person who's taking over from Yates, the head of the Count's terrorism unit, is Cressida Dick.
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.000]  Now you may never have heard of Cressida Dick, this lady policeman, but she was the one who was promoted after her botched operation,
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  which led to the death of the Brazilian electrician Jean-Charles de Minezes and the London Underground Tube,
[39:48.000 --> 39:57.000]  where just after the 777 London bombings, Minezes was basically assassinated by what looks like a kind of SAS unit attached to the Metropolitan Police,
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  and Cressida Dick presided over the killing of Jean-Charles de Minezes.
[40:03.000 --> 40:11.000]  So it looks to me as if we're going to have another crisis when it's decided that she is not necessarily the best person to be in charge of counterterrorism.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  Sure.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  Her big badge of honour is a massive botched operation.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  So you're saying or an operation that went quite well to get rid of a witness.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  They said he ran when they shot him. The truth is they sat on him, squatted on him and unloaded their clips into his head and chest,
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  making sure they got rid of that.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  Well, I think the people who did that actually really did believe that this guy was a terrorist,
[40:32.000 --> 40:39.000]  but Cressida Dick, on her watch that it all happened, she was gold commander on that operation,
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  and Peter Powell was the guy that brought in, this is the 777 chap, who was the guy that brought in this bronze silver gold commander system,
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  which has been a lot of questions over at the Metropolitan Police.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  That's right. He was the former spokesman of Scotland Yard.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  He went on ITN that day during the bombings right after them and said,
[40:56.000 --> 41:04.000]  It's quite remarkable. We had a drill of the exact same bus and exact same trains at the exact same locations at the exact same time.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  It's quite incredible.
[41:06.000 --> 41:14.000]  He's a bit of a spooky figure. You can imagine him kind of waltzing across the screen in some kind of 1970s horror film, I think.
[41:14.000 --> 41:23.000]  He's a very strange character. There's also a lot of criticism of John Yates and Sir Paul Stevenson,
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  who was the chief of the Metropolitan Police, who was on yesterday,
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  for actually hiring what a turnout to be, basically crooks into the public relations department at Scotland Yard.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  So, Alex, this is really unfolding now, and I don't think, I mean, there are big cracks appearing in the dam,
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  and it hasn't actually finished breaking yet. This has got a long way to go still.
[41:41.000 --> 41:47.000]  Okay, well, listening to you, Tony, I know you're right there in England and are a journalist and know a lot of these players,
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.000]  so I respect your view on this, and I agree this should all be investigated.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  My problem is, as you were just alluding to, it's like shark teeth.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  You get the head of Scotland Yard, you get the police commissioner and others having to step down reportedly because of the cover-up,
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  and then into their place rolls another row of people that are just as unsavory.
[42:08.000 --> 42:14.000]  And so that's the issue here. We know that they've known for at least six and a half, seven years about this,
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  and then it goes a lot deeper than just phone hacking.
[42:17.000 --> 42:23.000]  The information that's come out is that they have MI5, MI6, and local police spying on members of parliament
[42:23.000 --> 42:29.000]  to then use dirt on them for blackmail. That's the inside baseball that I've been told, but I didn't want to go public.
[42:29.000 --> 42:38.000]  This is not MI5 and MI6, Alex. This is private investigators who are actually, some of them are maybe ex-police or ex-security services,
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  but they do have legal rights as the security service do.
[42:42.000 --> 42:51.000]  I don't think most people don't have a problem with having an official spy agency that actually does see as its role national security.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  No, no, but Tony, my point is just interject.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  People are not like that. They are actually just private hired guns who've been hired by news international to do something criminal.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  No, no, I understand that, but what I'm saying is it's come out multiple times in the last few years over and over again
[43:07.000 --> 43:13.000]  that MI5 has been spying on members of parliament. And so that was the issue I was raising.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  Now, let's go back to the New York Post. That's also owned by Murdoch. It's come out.
[43:18.000 --> 43:27.000]  That was his big flagship New York paper until he got the Wall Street Journal that the Page Six would basically threaten to print dirt about people
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  unless they got money. And so we've seen those scandals.
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.000]  What I'm asking you is you say that it's much worse than just phone hacking, Tony.
[43:35.000 --> 43:44.000]  Are the allegations that it's blackmail or can you tell us if the rabbit hole starts with the phone hacking
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.000]  and you're saying this is just the beginning of the downbreaking, what else is behind the down?
[43:49.000 --> 43:57.000]  Well, certainly there's now also evidence that live phone calls have been illegally listened into by rich and powerful people.
[43:57.000 --> 44:05.000]  There's, I mean, there's quite a lot of evidence coming out that private information has been got by blaggers.
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.000]  And of course, what David Cameron is trying to do, because let's not forget, we've got the prime minister in the frame here too,
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  because he hired Andy Coulson, who was the editor of the News of the World at the time all this was going on.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  Sure, he's involved.
[44:16.000 --> 44:24.000]  He could be his private helper with regards to the press, his press secretary, right the way through the run-up to the last year's election campaign
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  and right up till recently when Coulson resigned.
[44:27.000 --> 44:35.000]  I mean, you know, I don't know if you realize, but actually Cameron is at the moment now in South Africa, which is a weird place.
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.000]  I mean, I get alarm bells ringing in my head, you know, Cameron must be sitting out in South Africa saying, oh my God, what am I doing here?
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  You know, I need to be back home to try and control this crisis.
[44:44.000 --> 44:54.000]  And I wonder whether there's, it's ironic, isn't it, that there is also this skeleton in David Cameron's closet that back in 1991,
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  at least if you go to Peter Eyre's blog, I don't know if you know that,
[44:57.000 --> 45:05.000]  but he's a former NATO intelligence chap, Peter Eyre's blog explains that Cameron, before he became Prime Minister,
[45:05.000 --> 45:14.000]  before he became leader of the Conservative Party, did a little deal with Arms Corp in South Africa who had 10 nuclear weapons that they wanted to get rid of
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.000]  and three of those nuclear weapons apparently by Cameron were sold in order to raise money for the Conservative Party.
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.000]  Now, this sounds incredible, but if you go to Peter Eyre's blog, Eyre, you'll see the whole story there.
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  Three nuclear weapons lost.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  No, I remember that, and it wasn't Israel involved in the background too.
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  That's right, absolutely right, Alex.
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  Yep, you don't miss a trick.
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.000]  There was also race-specific bio weapons associated with another subgroup, but sorry.
[45:39.000 --> 45:45.000]  So I imagine that David Cameron out in South Africa today is just literally trembling in his boots.
[45:45.000 --> 45:54.000]  He's wondering when is my criminal activity going to come home here and when are people going to find out that actually maybe there's more to this story to come.
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  Well, Tony, that's where I was going next, and you're starting to get there.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  Blackmail, nuclear weapons.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  We know David Cameron hanging out with Qaddafi, groups that finance him.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  British arms producers, some of the biggest shellers of really high-tech weapons that our troops will be facing.
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  And British troops, if they do go in in the next two months, in Libya, unless Qaddafi stands down.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  So that's what I'm saying. Why did this break now?
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  If the other power structures in the U.K.
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  I can tell you why it broke now, and it's amazing how this stuff happens.
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.000]  About two weeks ago, The Guardian newspaper published a story about a girl called Millie Dowler who was murdered.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  And it came out in the evidence that Nick Davis, this investigative journalist, a brilliant guy who wrote a book called Flat Earth News,
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  he's probably the best investigative journalist in the country, based down in Brighton.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  And he put this story in The Guardian a couple of weeks ago about Millie Dowler
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.000]  and how her phone was hacked into by Glenn Mulcair for the News of the World.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  Now, what happened when her phone was hacked into, she was actually, she'd been murdered.
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.000]  And what it meant that her phone was actually full up, her voicemail messages were full up,
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  and what Mulcair was doing was actually deleting this murdered girl's phone messages
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  so that he could pick up more information from other people who were worried about her.
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  That story absolutely appalled the nation.
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.000]  And it's really accelerated this whole phone hacking scandal to the proper proportion.
[47:18.000 --> 47:25.000]  It was a big attempt by the Murdoch Empire and by the Metropolitan Police to cover it up back six or seven years ago.
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  And what's happened, like I said, that dam has been kind of building ever since.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  And finally, it's gone at last.
[47:31.000 --> 47:34.000]  So at least more people are realizing just how disgusting this was,
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  hacking into the phones of the victims of the 777.
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.000]  And so this is how they got Al Capone was on tax evasion, not the murders.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  And clearly the police cover up, the bribes now coming out.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  I think what's happened is you've got an establishment in Britain.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  I don't know how these things really work, but you've got a big establishment which is not necessarily.
[47:57.000 --> 48:04.000]  It's generally right-leaning conservative, but many, many people in the conservative party are not happy at all
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.000]  with the example that David Cameron is making as a conservative prime minister.
[48:09.000 --> 48:15.000]  I don't think that he has really won the hearts and minds of the conservative party in his first year or so in office.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  And so they are quite happy, I think now, to see him elbowed out of the way.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  And I think ultimately that will be the result of this crisis that we see the prime minister being forced to resign as well.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  And possibly even a general election.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  I mean, Cameron has been fighting to have these four-year fixed-term parliaments.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  And now we know why. It's because he's been standing on very, very fragile ground.
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.000]  So I mean, quite how it all turns out is impossible to see, but I certainly think that the next person to be in the frame
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  when he arrives back at Heathrow Airport from his little, nice little trip to South Africa is David Cameron.
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  He's probably down there checking on his bank account, Susanee.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  Well, I bet he's sitting out there wondering, well, maybe I should just not go back to Britain
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  and buy a nice house out here in South Africa and just enjoy the rest of my life on the beach.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  And maybe Britain is not the place for me.
[48:58.000 --> 49:05.000]  Now, again, Tony Gosling is a former BBC researcher, has a radio show in England.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  His information has always been proven to be very accurate and well researched.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  And wow, this really fleshes things out here.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  Because Cameron has been saying, and I'll quote him now, that the reason that Sir Paul Stevenson resigned
[49:19.000 --> 49:27.000]  is because his role in this whole affair has a direct bearing on public confidence in the police.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  Now, this is a funny thing to say because David Cameron's decision to employ Andy Coulson,
[49:33.000 --> 49:39.000]  who was the editor of the News of the World, while all these horrendous criminal activities were going on,
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  which nobody would have bought the paper if they knew this kind of way, but this is the way of the game story.
[49:43.000 --> 49:50.000]  Well, that's my point is that Cameron is a protoge, not just of Bilderberg, but also of Rupert Murdoch.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  Rupert Murdoch's full empire has been behind him.
[49:53.000 --> 49:58.000]  And here he is, a hiring the head of the paper to work for him.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  I mean, he is right in the middle of this.
[50:00.000 --> 50:06.000]  Yes, and all the last year or so since Cameron was elected, he's been having regular meetings every couple of weeks
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  with the chief executives of the news in Sparice Pass, the news international empire.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  So he has not realized, I mean, many of us could see this coming.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  When Andy Coulson was appointed to be his press secretary and run up to the general election,
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  people were scratching their heads thinking, is Cameron blind? What is going on here?
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  Because this guy is like a little ticking time bomb sitting in number 10 Downing Street.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  And that, I'm afraid, that time bomb is going off right now.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  Yeah, this is a Nixonian to the mass, I mean, to the max.
[50:35.000 --> 50:43.000]  And the fact that he's run off to South Africa, the fact that all these different police chiefs are stepping down
[50:43.000 --> 50:50.000]  at the head of news core in the UK has been arrested over the weekend, the fact that they're opening up investigations
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  in the United States and Australia.
[50:52.000 --> 50:59.000]  I'm going to talk about what this means for Rupert Murdoch with reporter, talk show host researcher, Tony Gosling.
[50:59.000 --> 51:25.000]  Stay with us.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  We'll see you next time.
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  Now, former BBC researcher, British radio talk show host, investigator,
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  Tony Gosling as our guest for the rest of the short segment, the next little short segment.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  Tony, there's so many facets to cover.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  But how is this going to affect Murdoch?
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  Because you can see this is imploding fast, and I smell blood.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  To be honest with you, Alex, I think Murdoch's empire in Britain is really crumbling, as we speak.
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  That's going to be over, I think, maybe even within a month or something,
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  because what's happened is he's got absolutely no credibility, and this is one of the things
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  that you do actually need if you can get people to buy your newspapers
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  and certainly pay to view on the internet if you need to have some credibility.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  That is all crumbling around him.
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.000]  He's been even putting efforts in his own newspapers today to try and convince the readers
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.000]  that what they're reading is in some way useful or true or unbiased.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  But let me tell you, on the page three of the Times today, he's got a statement,
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.000]  which is from the resignation speech of Sir Paul Stevenson.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  And he's selected extracts from it.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  And the most important thing that Sir Paul Stevenson said, which was criticizing David Cameron himself,
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  has been omitted from those extracts.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  So you can see the kind of people we're dealing with with News International.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  Propagandists, pure propagandists.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  And I wouldn't surprise me at all if Murdoch's empire within a month or so
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  is just completely crumbled and disappeared here in Britain.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  One of the rules we have is that you've got to be a fit and proper person
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  to run one of these big news companies.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  And I think he's proving, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that he's not a fit and proper person to do that.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  And let me expand on that briefly.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  The headlines in Britain are going to be on something tomorrow,
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  which is called the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee,
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  which is where two, three people from News International, Rebecca Brooks,
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  who's now been arrested and has been bailed,
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  as well as a group of Murdoch himself and James Murdoch are all due to appear there tomorrow.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  So I imagine millions of eyes across the world will have their eyes on that.
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.000]  What we're talking about here is a kind of epic struggle.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  It's like the Vatican versus the Crown here.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  Two big power networks.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  One is the British Parliament, and the other one is the Murdoch Empire.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  Absolutely daggers drawn in that Culture, Media and Sport.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  And you know News Corp has a lot of dirt on the Royal Family and others they've been keeping.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  And so I wouldn't count Murdoch out yet, and I'll say this,
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  just like I said with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, I don't like him,
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  but the whole way that went down was suspicious, and now it's come out, it was a setup.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.000]  And all I'm saying, Tony, is I respect your view on this, and you're probably right,
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  but at the same time, why are they going after Murdoch now?
[58:23.000 --> 58:28.000]  Is it that he was overshadowing the BBC and the state-run propagandist on that end?
[58:28.000 --> 58:32.000]  Was it that he was attempting to upset completely the old guard?
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  I mean, sure, I believe the dirt's there, and it's a lot deeper than what they're saying,
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  but why is it being brought out now?
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  In one minute, stay with us.
[58:44.000 --> 58:48.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Saving means to make money.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.000]  that give you rashes, itching sores, and a terrorizing clothing called lint.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  you've had to do something you've never done before.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.

[59:43.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Now into hour number two.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, is going to be joining us coming up in T-minus 30 minutes.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Fighting the Fed and the IRS for more than 50 years.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Look forward to interviewing Wayne, but on several times in the past.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  Fellow of Texan.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Tony Gosling of Builderburg.org.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Great talk show host, researcher, former BBC investigator.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And bringing that up.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  Look, news course propaganda, so is the BBC.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  They've gotten very jealous of the power of news core.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  I know news core was trying to deregulate media, some would say,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  so they could take over in England.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  And we now know for six years the police have known about this
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  and covered up the indiscretions of news core.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  So again, I go back to the start.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Why are they bringing this out now?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  I'm not a fan of Dominique Strauss-Kahn or the IMF,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  but I thought it was suspicious at the time,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  because normally these top globalists are untouchable.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Why are they untouchable now?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  And I think you said it, there's a huge war going on,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  but certainly their interest out there who aren't as pure as the driven snow either,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  that'll be happy to see the fall of the news core holdings in England.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  I think what's happened is that we've got a difference in attitude
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  amongst the chiefs using international.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  It's a kind of pack mentality there.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  They're starting to run scared.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  They're starting to make mistakes.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  They're starting to sort of trip up slightly.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  And this has really given, I think, the British establishment,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  which is a peculiar beast, has given them the feeling
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  that actually now they're smelling blood and they're going to go for it,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  because particularly with the stories that came about hacking the dead soldiers
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  that have died in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  the hacking of the 777 victims,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  this is really like the final straw, I think.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And let's not forget that Murdoch has not been loved in Britain.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  One of our greatest ever writers,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  who came from my part of the world, the Forest of Dean,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  just into the South Wales from where Bristol is in the Western country,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  he was one of the greatest writers we ever had.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  He died about 1993, but he named, before he died, his cancer, his pancreatic cancer.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  He named it Rupert, and he made a speech on British television
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  and the Royal Television Society about this, saying,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  look, Rupert Murdoch is a cancer, and we've got to get rid of this cancer somehow
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  before he died, that's what he said.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  And I think there's a feeling which has been going on for a long time.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Let's not forget, Murdoch bought the times in 1981.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  But this, hold on, this isn't the revenge of Soros, though.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  I'm not saying Murdoch's good, but Murdoch has really been bringing
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  kind of the Algorian carbon tax collectivist to their knees at many levels,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  while at the same time ordering News Corp in the U.S. to promote global warming.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  This isn't just an inter-establishment coup counter-coup?
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  I don't think so. No, I think it's fueled by genuine anger,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  particularly about hacking into murdered children's telephones,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  hacking into the phones of dead soldiers and their families,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  hacking into the phones of 77 victims whilst they may be in hospital.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  This is absolutely appalling.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Closing, what about the reports?
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  I don't think there's any kind of weird conspiracy behind it,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  but it's been a dam, Alex, which has been building right since the 1980s.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  The press in Britain really died in the 1980s with Rupert Murdoch's takeover
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  of the Times newspaper in 1981,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  right the way through to the takeover of the BBC in 1986,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  which was the last time that we had a director general of the BBC
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  who actually was a proper current affairs program maker,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  that he was replaced by an accountant.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  We've had all sorts of clones, you know, sort of business mighty people.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  And this dam has been building.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  The other thing that many people don't realize in that part of the world
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  is that Rupert Murdoch, at the time of the last election,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  as part of the deal for supporting Cameron and his friends,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  has been lobbying like crazy for the undermining of the BBC.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And I think, you know, most of the establishment in this country
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  is much more pro-BBC than it is an internationalist like Murdoch.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  We like to think that we do actually have our own broadcasting system.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  That comes from Britain.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  And Murdoch has made a big mistake in trying to attack the BBC.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  Well, we're out of time, Tony.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  We'll have to get you back as this unfolds.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  But I agree, this is a BBC seizing on it.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  And I'll tell you, Murdoch, BBC, I don't know which one of those things floating around in the water.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  I smell worse, but we'll continue to track it and follow it.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  You mentioned the infighting.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  His daughter reportedly is having cussing fits.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  So they're definitely in deep trouble.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  We'll be right back on The Economy. Stay with us.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  It's here.

[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  We're fighting the IRS, a real in the trenches activist, just like his brother.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  He'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour, 33 after for a couple segments.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  Then we're going to have open phones and a ton of military, police state news coming up in the third hour, like this report.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  CIA veteran Robert Baer predicts September, Israel, Iran, war.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Robert Baer wouldn't be predicting that if it hadn't been green-lighted, but it still could be averted.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  We're going to be breaking that down, also Japan scrambles to protect damaged reactor from typhoon that's set to hit the coast.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  So we're going to be going over that news as well.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  I just want to finish talking about the News Corp.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  That's the global holding company of News International, Rupert Murdoch Holdings.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Rupert Murdoch plays both sides of the fence.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  He supports the carbon tax, but also fights it.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  He supports Hillary Clinton, but also funds her competitors.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  And that's how top globalists operate.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  He goes to Davos.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  He's a world government supporter, but he understands that there is a, quote, market in his view of people that are awake to it.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  So more and more, that's what Glenn Beck and other things were about.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  But when it got too successful, they got rid of him.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And the word is from folks that really know Roger Ailes.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  He's actually anti-New World Order, but more and more he is kind of drifting off into the recesses of News Corp.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  And losing his influence, and he's also reportedly has medical issues.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  Last time I talked about this, the fact that I knew this caused circuses at News Corp.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And made them hate me even more, even though I'm not an enemy of News Corp.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Of the people that are there, like Lou Dobbs, Napolitano and others who are great people.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  That said, remember three months ago it came out that a year before Politico reported on this three months ago,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  that media matters, publicly financed by George Soros, connected him with a White House publicly,
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  with Cass Sunstein, who says he wants to cognitively infiltrate, get alternative media arrested.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  They said, it is our job, this is over a year ago now, came out three months ago.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  But at a meeting, what, 14, 15 months ago, again, came out a year later, three months ago, two months ago.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  You can pull up the dates.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  Like, let's pull up Politico.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  What was the exact headline for folks that forget?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  It was, media matters wants to infiltrate and destroy News Corp.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  And they said their mission is to get hired there.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  That's espionage.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  That's private spying.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  That's sabotage.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  They said, we want to get into their offices.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  We want to destroy them.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  We want to dig up dirt on them.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  We want to come after them.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  So, you see that going on.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  You see this internal battle between different camps of the New World Order that I've been talking about,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  really coming to a head.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Does that say Murdoch's good?
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  No.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  It's just that the Soros-Al Gore camp is clearly in an all-out war.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  And you've got the state-run BBC, and I'm sorry, folks.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  If I've got to choose BBC over News Corp, I'm going to choose News Corp.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  I mean, the BBC are masters of disinformation, brainwashing, dirty tricks.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  It wasn't News Corp getting internal government press releases that they were going to blow up Building 7 on 9-11.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  It was BBC.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And they later admitted, yeah, we were sent a communique that that tower was going to fall and jump the gun.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  I told you that's what that was.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  So, BBC is super bad news.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  Now, have they had some good reporters in them?
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  You know, they had the guy that made the power of nightmares about these fake wars and even alluded to stage terror.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  They do some of that to keep their audience, and more and more they've been phased out.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  So, just like Nominate Strauss-Kahn, don't like him.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  This is how elitist act.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  Now it turns out, did have sex with a woman reportedly.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Prostitute hooked in with mafia.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  Sarkozy spying on the whole thing.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Announcing he'd been arrested before the police had even picked him up or was in the news.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  That was staged.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  Now, does that mean that DSK is a good guy?
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  No, it doesn't.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  I don't like DSK.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I'd like to see him go to jail for the IMF and World Bank's crimes.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Just like I'd like to see Bernanke.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  I mean, it's now come out that the big banks that he fronts for openly sold Europe, the United States government, private individuals, bad derivatives that they knew were fraudulent were going to blow up.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  Well, we already knew that.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  They created them.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Bill Clinton got rid of it.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Simultaneously in Europe in the late 90s, they got rid of laws blocking that.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  We had laws against it because if private mega banks can create unlimited trillions in fake financial instruments, A, they're going to take over and destroy competition with unfair trade practices.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  B, it's going to undermine the entire investment system and destroy the pension funds and the credibility of the major currencies, which is all happening.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  And on the ashes of that, they're openly announcing the world government run by the private bank of the world time, Newsweek, Financial Times, list goes on and on, offering their new level of control as a solution to the problems they engineered that aren't problems for them.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  They have really pulled this off with great precision and only our naivete, only our ignorance has allowed them to get away with a lot of this.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Now, look at these headlines, Obama lawmakers have resumed debt talks, but I read to you the Chinese statements earlier where they said that.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Let me just grab it.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  USA Today, 610 last month, Chinese say the US is already defaulting on debt.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Forget the debt ceiling debate.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  The US is already in default says Chinese government and debt rating agencies.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  Of course, they're into QE three already.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Remember Bob Chapman two months ago, whenever Bernanke said, we're not going into QE three.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  He said, Alex, here's the evidence and listed the numbers.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  They were already in QE three.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  By the time they talk about officially being in QE three next month, they're going to be in QE four.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  That means devaluing your dollar, your savings, your fixed income.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  It is the biggest, most sickening, disgusting tax in the world.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  All this debt ceiling stuff about, oh, we got to cut the government spending and raise your taxes, that money's all slated to too big to fail banks.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  That's impossible to ever prop up.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  It's designed to implode.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  And I hear all these talk show hosts who just don't get it.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  We've got to get this simple information out to everybody.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Now, look at this news.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  Why is gold surging in the normally dead time for gold the middle of the summer?
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  July is always the worst.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  July, August.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  That usually picks up by the end of August.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  Why is it an all-time record in the middle of July?
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Why is silver shooting towards this record pumping past 40 today after the bankers did all this finagling months ago to drive it down?
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Because the dollar and every other major currency in G20 coordinated devaluation is being turned into a ruble, a peso.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Okay?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  I mean, the pesos rising will soon be on par.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  The Canada has already passed us.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Just a decade ago, a loonie was worth 60 cents on the dollar.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  Gold isn't going up.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  Your dollar is going down and they've signaled, yeah, we're going to fully devalue the dollar.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  So you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  Now, I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  Remember three months ago when they artificially drove gold and silver down?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  And I got Ted on and I said, I'm not selling my gold or silver because the fundamentals of this.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  You look at an 11-year graph, 12-year graph, it's all going straight up.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  They do little manipulative dips, but it always retraces and goes up even more because of the fundamentals.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  The globalists are buying gold and silver.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  So I briefly wanted to bring Ted Anderson up to talk about how big a deal this is.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  And Geithner two weeks ago saying it's going to be the worst thing in our lives and it's not going to end for a long time.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  They're basically now admitting we're going into a depression, Ted.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Well, they sure are.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  And Bloomberg is reporting through Charter saying that gold is going to hit $5,000 an ounce by the year 2020.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  I mean, there's so much going on in the marketplace, fears of the European crisis, you know, and that's just swelling up.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  It's making the S&P 500 drop.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  I mean, just about anything you can think of that could be disastrous for the United States economy is happening right now.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  And that's why you're seeing gold go up.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  I mean, gold hit a high today already of $16.50.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  Silver hit a high today of $40.82.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Obviously, there's a lot of problems that are out there just like China saying that we've already defaulted on our debt.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  Well, if you're having to print money and borrow it in order to have in order to keep things going, you've defaulted on your debt.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  It should be just like one individual who has too many credit cards and signs up for the next one to pay the last one.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  You're beyond help.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  You cannot be fixed.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  You will have to file bankruptcy.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  The way the United States files bankruptcy, they start the printing press and that's not just the Chinese.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  It's Ron Paul.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  It's Jim Rogers.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  It's Mark Fomber.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  It's Peter Schiff.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  You don't have to be an economist to know this.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  This has happened over and over again.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  It happened in Rome.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  It happened in Babylon.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  But the sickening thing is, Ted, they've maneuvered us into this and then they're posing as our saviors telling us raise taxes and it will fix it.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  The only thing that will fix it is saying we don't owe the 1.5 quadrillion that the banks created.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  That's exactly right.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  You cannot fix this problem without getting rid of the printing press and getting rid of the Federal Reserve system.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  We have a system that is compounding against us.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  We have currency that comes into existence through a loan.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  So, in other words, we have to go into debt just in order to get it.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  If we have better economic times, it just means we're going to go further into debt.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  We are now down at the edge of it.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  It's like a snowball rolling down the hill picking up more snow as it comes down.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  Eventually it crashes and it busts apart.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  And that's exactly what's going on.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Compounding interest against a fiat currency will kill it.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  And that's where we're at.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  We've had 100 years of this fiat system.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  They designed it in their own admissions to do this and to convert the entire economy over themselves.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  Then once they have more assets than all the real assets in the world,
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  they fully implode the economy and call for their global VAT, global carbon tax paid to the private banks
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  who engineered it and they've got Bill O'Reilly out promoting carbon taxes and VAT now.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  And conservatives are saying, yes, I don't want my retirement check.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  I hear veterans calling in saying, I don't deserve it for my kids.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  Don't give me my retirement check.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  That will then just mean no money into the economy, further depression, which further brings us to our knees.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  And if you gave up all of your retirement checks that you worked for,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  you would never even pay off a fraction of this.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  But you can't get the message to them because Fox News is telling them that it's good.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  That's right.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  I mean, it's just such a snow job and people are buying it in some cases.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Of course, your audience, isn't there more aware of what's going on?
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  But that's what people just need to be educated.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Ted Stather, I want to hear about this Bloomberg article.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  I didn't know they were talking about $5,000 an ounce gold.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  And if it does go that direction, if they keep evaluating the dollar, it won't be 2020.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  It won't be eight and a half years from now.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  It'll be a year from now.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  But regardless, they're killing the globe's currencies, not just the dollar.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  And there's no perfect place to be.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  But the best bet in my research is gold and silver.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  We'll be right back.

[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Well, as you can see, the people you and I know of every day that listen to your radio show and exist on a daily basis have recognized and understand much more today about federal reserves and the loss of the value of dollars than ever in the history of my life.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  It's fascinating and interesting to see how many people are now aware of things, and all of a sudden people will come up to me and say, you know, your brother may have been right.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  So yes, it can make your problem, and people daily lose their homes, people daily are looking for work, yet we have of it have an administration and a Congress that doesn't seem to want to help.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Well, their consolidation is going well.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Wayne, let's get into the Federal Reserve, what it really is, and the fact that we've been under administrative receivership for a very long time.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  Let's cut right to the chase for people and break down the emergency powers and the Secretary of the Treasury and what's really going on.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  As you know, the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 around Christmas time, and there were three people on the floor of the house that passed the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  That allowed the United States government to turn over all their money to the Federal Reserve, and in return the Federal Reserve will give you, will loan you all the money you need.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  And that's the way it's been in operation.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  In 1933, Roosevelt declared the United States bankrupt.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  They no longer had any more money coming in than was going out, so they were bankrupt in the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Wait a minute, what else are you going to pledge is collateral on the debt, and guess what we had by 1936?
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Social security.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  It's called Social Security, and each person got a number under the disguise of saying, we're going to create a fund for your retirement so that you can supplement that.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  But the truth of the matter is, was a mechanism to control the collateral that the Federal Reserve wanted, which you and I, and our ability to earn it, and that still exists today.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  And we are a country ruled by the big six megabanks who have now brought us to rack and ruin.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  Did you see Tiny Tim Gartner, not this Sunday but the Sunday before last, admit that, quote, this is going to be the worst time that we've ever experienced in our lives and isn't going to end for a long time?
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  That's a quote.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I mean, I thought we were in the middle of a great boom time, thanks to QE1 and QE2.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Well, unfortunately, we know neither of those have worked in any more. Any addition to the debt is only going to make it worse, and the disguise or the noise coming out, it says, oh, well, since I'm on Social Security, I might not get Social Security this next month, or we won't be able to pay our soldiers.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  Well, that is smoke and mirrors. I can't imagine our government not paying our soldiers and not paying our elderly, and under the threat of our current President saying that that might happen, I think that's a bunch of baloney.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  Well, it was always meant to hold us hostage, and now you've got more than half the public either on some type of government assistance or money taken out of their checks for decades being held hostage, or companies surviving on government contracts, they've got us exactly where they want us.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  Absolutely. No doubt about it. Things are going to get worse before it gets better. We have not seen the bottom of our problem. Our problems are still in front of us.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  And we isn't as a people. I believe understand that problem much more today than we ever did, and it's fascinating because I think even our Republican National Party recognize that Ron's right,
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  but they only recognize it in terms of how are we going to keep him out of the platform and out of the nomination, and they're doing it by deceptive means because they cannot attack him on words and phrases because Ron's always told the truth.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  He's always been right, and people recognize that, so they can't attack him on issues because he's right. So if they can't attack him on issues, how are they going to do it?
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  Well, they're ignoring him. They're fixing polls. They're ignoring it when he wins big straw polls by huge majorities in places like New Hampshire, and they're also talking like him on the surface. Michelle Bachman, the IRS enforcer, Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas,
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  Mr. Liberal, Pointy Boots, Rick Perry, I mean, they are really getting a gaggle of artificial counterfeit Ron Paul's ready, who as soon as they get in office, of course, they're going to continue to serve their masters.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  I mean, Rick Perry is a Bilderberg minion. It doesn't get any more obvious than this. We don't see Ron Paul invited to Bilderberg.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  No, I think you've hit on two main issues. One is, we as a nation have to be very careful as conservatives as to which Tea Party group we're going to listen to.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  The National Republican Party has taken over the name of the Tea Party and spewing out their own liberal agenda in a conservative way, and they're trying to dilute our conservative vote by throwing in as many people as they can into this Republican primary coming up.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  And they're holding Perry in the wings, saying that he's going to be the saving grace for the Republican Party. And I'm telling you, he's worse, he's done more harm to the state of Texas than the Bushes have ever done.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  They're selling him as the do sex, the guy that's going to save everybody at the last minute. I mean, talk about it. He's doubled in his 10 years as governor of the budget. He's passed all these new taxes on businesses, really a state income tax and the franchise tax, forced inoculations,
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  NAFTA superhighways, Al Gore's footstool. I knew from insiders he was always planning to run and said that over a year ago. I talked to Fox's people and others, you know, that met with him privately, and he had that fake pledge he wouldn't run and then he broke.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  And now he's looking at breaking the pledge. He always meant to. It's this whole fake, reluctant act. And you know what? Republicans are going to elect him. They love Al Gore at the end of the day. They love being conned. And that's, Wayne, they don't want something real like Ron Paul because he doesn't have the fancy hair.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  They like twinkle toes. They like the effeminate Perry, and they're going to get it. They want to be slaves, some of them.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  Well, again, I go back to the point that they can't discuss issues with Ron because they know he's right.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  So, rather than discuss issues and to bring them up so that the American people can have a clear-cut choice, they just soon undercut them, might throw these other people out as conservatives so that the conservatives get confused and think a Perry or a Bachman would do a better job and be more as conservatives.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  Talk about your brother, Ron Paul. Well, you know, before we get into Ron and his presidential run that regardless we win because he's educating people, but he's in the number one, number two, number three slot, depending on which straw poll or national poll, the media is trying to run the hoax that, oh, he can't win.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  It's the contrary. He's got ten times the power he did three, four years ago because so much of what he talked about is unfortunately manifested and he is the thinking person's candidate. But let's look at the stealth candidate Perry who is designed to knock Ron Paul out.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  Let's look at the real enemy here and he's going to team up with one of the ladies, whether it was going to be Palin, it may be Bachman now. You heard it here first years ago, folks. Watch. We know what we're talking about so people listen.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Let's talk about, I mean, I mentioned some of the things, but horrible for Texas. He's always saying Texas is great because of him. He wants us to believe the sun comes up because of him. How has Perry been bad for Texas?
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  Well, there are three major issues that I look at. One of the major ones is the TTC or the past Texas Corridor. He has done more to confiscate private property, to build tow roads, and then to lease these tow roads to foreign companies to run.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  And they say that that deal was dead. It's just under another name. It's not dead. The second item that bothers me is our education system.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  Under Perry, we have, we ranked 36th in the nation in high school graduation rates. We ranked 49th in verbal SAT scores, 47th in literacy, and 46th in the average math scores.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  We do, we've lost our education edge and it is under his administration. But the last thing that I think is worse than ever is his stand on illegal immigration.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  Oh yeah, he claims he's fighting it, but tell folks, he was the guy that got sanctuary cities through and in state tuition free legals.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  And there is a relative solution that could aid Texas in their, in their budget problem and still be compassionate to illegal, but to turn around and do something about it.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  And all you need to do is look in other countries and other locations as to how they handle immigration. And if it was done in Texas, it would be fantastic for Texas. It would be fantastic for the illegal.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  And it would be fantastic for the United States. It's a very simple solution. He won't even look at it.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  Now we don't want to do what Mexico does. They put you in a slave camp for a year. I mean, of course, but then they say our borders have got to be wide open, but they've got some of the strongest in the world after North Korea.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  What, what is your solution that other countries have used?
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  Well, every person in this country illegally, if they had 25 days to register, when they register, they bring in $1,500 of their money, but they come in with a sponsor who pays $1,000.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  That $2,500 is put into a special education fund to teach the illegal how to become a United States citizen.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  But they don't want that. They want to keep them in their little subdivisions and use them as political weapons. Stay there. We'll be right back. Absolutely.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  I'll tell you, Wayne Paul is dead on on this. We'll be right back.

[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.

[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  Wayne Paul is our guest in this segment of the next, and I'm getting into the world news, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  If you'd like to go ahead and call on any of the issues we've raised today, the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231-1800-2599-9231.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Where you can raise any item or news point you'd like to bring up or any questions or comments. We'd love to hear from you.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Wayne, I want to talk about your brother announcing when, lose, or draw, he's leaving Congress, not seeking re-elections.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  The only way he stays in government is to be the president. But before we go there, with the brother of Ron Paul himself, a great activist in Liberty, with Wayne Paul,
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  finish up your point about the program to try to make illegals actually Americans and to share in Liberty, instead of being taught how to be anti-American collectivist.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  Well, it's kind of interesting because that idea I had had for quite a while, but in talking with the Americans that have a Mexican descendancy, they were the ones that wanted to promote it.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  They said we would love to find a way to turn around and be able to bring these people on board, make them citizens.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  But you pointed out, they don't want somebody that's educated, they don't want somebody that's intelligent, and they don't want somebody that understands the Constitution.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  But you sure, you can make their sponsor liable for that individual, so that if he got in trouble, it's the sponsor's responsibility to help out, and you could do this until they learned enough.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  And then that would weed out the criminal element. Instead, the government leaves it lawless, doesn't enforce anything, and it becomes the law law less, and they use that as a pretext to take more of our freedoms.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  Right, and you then end up with productive citizens.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  Good point. Now, going back to your brother, presidential candidate Ron Paul, we had him on a few weeks ago, can't wait until we have him back up in a few weeks.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  But he's announced he's retiring from the house after long great duty. He's either going to the White House or he's going home.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Yeah, and I admire him for his time and effort. I can't believe that he has been so strong for so long.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  But I'm going to tell you, he's paid his dues, and he deserves to sit back and say who else is going to carry on in his debt, and we need to find people that are running his district that have similar philosophies and continue his tradition.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  And I just hope we find somebody that meets those standards.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Well, he's got a good chance of winning the presidency if we believe he can win. He's number one in many polls, number two or three in the others winning a lot of the key straw polls, places like New Hampshire.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  But regardless, he wins by injecting real issues. But, you know, talking to Ron Paul Offair a few weeks ago, he sounded really happy.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  And this is a guy who works 16, 18 hours a day. I don't know how he does it. And I can imagine, I mean, I dream about not doing this.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  I can't imagine me in what, 75 years old? How old is he now?
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  He's 75.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  Wow. I mean, what did he tell you about wanting to retire if he didn't win the presidency?
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  He's never talked to me about it. I think it's just been something that's been playing on his mind.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:09.000]  I think he wants to spend more time with his grandchildren and great grandchildren. He wants to spend some more time with his wife.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  He wants to relax a little bit and enjoy everything that he's worked so hard for. You know, we kind of pick on him because he's the middle of five boys.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  But do you know last week or so, the congressman tied baseball and he hit a home run?
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  I know. He's incredible. He's a war horse. Folks, I know how hard it is to think hour after hour every day. It's very exhausting.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  I get tired just looking at Ron Paul. We'll be right back.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye opener.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:59:42.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  That's End of America, the number three.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  Folks, we covered the whole Ripper Murdoch scandal that threatens to bring down this whole empire, with no doubt George Sorrell scurrying around in the mix, two demons fighting each other.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  But this is the London Guardian. News of the world phone hacking whistleblower found dead. Let me tell you, I told you they got mercs.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  Death of Sean Horror, who was first named journalist to allege Andy Coulson knew of hacking, not being treated as suspicious.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  It's like that woman they found after the kid got killed in L.A., hanging upside down on the balcony with her hands and feet bound, and they said, oh, it's not suspicious.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  They ever find me with my, you know, shot in the head five times. I didn't do it, folks.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  Going back to Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, great patriot in his own right.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  Wayne, we got to get you back up in the near future for a longer interview. But finishing up, yeah, your brother at 75, does so many interviews, reads the bills, always knows the news I bring up, even if it's brand new.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  He is a Superman. And I'm not just saying that, folks. I'm 37. People think I'm 50.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  And for years I worked 18 hours a day. I can't even do it anymore. Sometimes I look at news and get dizzy.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  I don't know, literally. I mean, I'm way past burnout. I'm on my third, fourth wind here. But your brother is just incredible.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  That's right. He holds the congressional record on the congressional baseball team. Tell folks about that.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  Well, this last game that he played in, he hit the ball out of the park.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  First time in the history that anybody from Congress had ever done that.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  And the other thing that amazed me about him several years ago, he was in the hospital. He had two knees replaced at the same time.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Two weeks later, he's walking from his car to his airplane in Houston to go back to Washington, D.C.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  And he did it all on his own. I can't comprehend that. You know, I have pain from arthritis.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  I can't comprehend replacing two knees two weeks later doing what he did.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  Now, your brother, I've gotten to know him pretty well, not like you, but he is just so focused and meek.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  But let me tell you, he's a real tough guy at the end of the day. I mean, he is focused.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  I mean, I can see him sometimes late at night live on TV and you can tell he's exhausted, but he's just powering it out.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  Well, I think the amazing thing is, is his consistency never varying at all.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  What he said 35 years ago, he says today and he doesn't need a script to say it.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  And as long as you're truthful and as long as you're right, you don't need a script or you don't need a monitor like some people do in order to read anything that's going to be publicized.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  He's straightforward. He's honest. And, you know, our politicians can't handle that.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  Well, we know there was chicanery in the last election and some of the primaries, but if there's an overwhelming landslide, they can't stop him.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  And I'm so glad he is committed all in and is not seeking reelection in the house all in for this presidential run.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  We've got to get behind him, Wayne.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  Six hundred percent. Now's the time.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  We got one minute left, Wayne. Any other little tidbits you'd like to add?
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  Oh, no, we just, you know, I will try everything in my power to support him in every way, shape, or form that I can do.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  I admire him for his tenacity. I admire him for his time and effort.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  He's unequaled as far as I am concerned in terms of anybody sitting up there in Washington, but I happen to be prejudiced.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  Now, he's unequaled. He is founding father material. And if America doesn't elect him, it's like the reprieve of Nineveh.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  I mean, if we don't elect Ron Paul, shame on us. And if we don't get a hundred percent behind him to make sure this information gets out at this critical time.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  Like he said with the TSA, if we don't stand up against this, then we deserve it.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Wayne Paul, brother of Ron Paul, great American, thank you so much for joining us, my friend.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  Alex, it's my pleasure. I'm delighted to do it. Hopefully we can do it again.

[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care. Right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  All right, I'm glad that you joined us for this third hour of jam-packed news, information, and your phone calls.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  It is, of course, Monday, July 18, 2011.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  We just had Ron Paul's brother, who's been fighting just as long as Ron Paul against the globalist.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000]  Wayne, it's almost 50 years.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  And Wayne, of course, was talking about his brother if he just joined us to finish up that story, who had a double knee replacement
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  and two weeks after was carrying his own bags from the Houston airport and walking way out in the long-term parking himself.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  Anybody's ever had a knee replacement, I've talked to folks that have.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  You're supposed to walk on them after a while, but it's reportedly excruciatingly painful.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  That's an idea of the quiet strength of Ron Paul.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And you heard in the history of the congressional baseball team, the only guy ever this year to knock a ball out of the park.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  I mean, just an example of Ron Paul.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  I respect people who can stay focused on the news, on legislation, do 10 or more interviews a day, not miss votes.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  Always know what he's talking about.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  Do all these interviews.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  He's just incredible.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  And when you know about the rest of the congressmen are lazy, visiting hookers, drugs, corruption, golf junkets.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  And there's Ron Paul, same guy 35 years ago.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000]  He is today, been absolutely right about everything.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  Perfect voting record, true constitutionalist.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  And I just haven't been giving Ron Paul enough love on air.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  He is just so good.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  And he's the type of president America needs at this critical juncture.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  God is providing him if we'll get behind him and even if he loses, we win by injecting real issues.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  You're not going to get it from Rick Perry, Michelle Bachman, the IRS tax collector.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  I wish Rick Perry was real.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  I get behind him right now.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  But he is the former chief of staff in Texas in the what, 1992 presidential run before Clinton beat him out of Al Gore.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  He worked for Al Gore.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  He is a guy that sold out our 8,000 miles of roads to foreign companies.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  He is a guy that tried to run a hoax saying he had to take force inoculations.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  And I told everybody that he was going to run for president because he went to Bilderberg and Jim Tucker has insiders, two of them.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  And Jim said he, they're getting him lined up for president probably 2012.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  Boom.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  He comes out six months ago and says, I pledged to not run.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  Oh, I may break my pledge.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  We knew from Fox insiders that was all staged.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  It's one thing if he breaks a pledge, that's bad enough.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  To know it was always fake to act like he's this reluctant hero.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  It's pure script.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  Oh, but he goes to the evangelicals, the good Christians and tells them how much he loves Jesus.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  Might as well just ask Al Gore to come out of retirement and put him on there.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  And I got all these Republican cinema emails going, he may have been Al Gore's guy in the past and he may have been for all this, but you need to leave him alone.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  He's going to beat Obama.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  What do you want Obama?
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  I heard the same thing with Clinton.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  You know, when he was leaving, what do you want Al Gore saying George Bush is bad?
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  No.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  I'm saying like a Don King boxing match, the Republican and Democrat that the establishment put forward as the people that are going to be the winners.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  Then people say, well, I want to vote for the winner.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  The people they put forward to you are like in a Don King boxing match.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  Why don't people watch Don King boxing matches?
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  It took them 30 years to figure out that they were rigged.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  Now people finally figured it out.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  I mean, this is not rocket science.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:12:06.000]  If Fox News and CNN and MSNBC have all been caught putting out fake polls on Ron Paul, dubbing old video of Ron Paul being booed when he wins the CPAC event.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  Not telling you when he wins the straw polls in major states like New Hampshire.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  I mean, it's dirty trick after dirty trick after dirty trick.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  That tells you he's the guy and all this fake Cointel pro that the White House regulations aren't Sunstein talked about.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  He said, we're not trusted.
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  We've got to pose as alternative media.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  We've got to attack the 9 11 truthers.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  We got to attack the people that don't believe in carbon taxes.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  And we've got to attack true constitutionalists.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  We'll go pose as quote conspiracy theorist and attack them.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  That's why you see that constant meme.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  Attack Alex Jones.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  Attack Ron Paul.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  The proof is in the fruit.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  The proof is in the actions.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  The proof is in Ron Paul's voting record.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  Have you seen it?
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  Have no one's got one that good.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Have you looked at it in the history of the New American for decades analyzing congressional voting records?
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  He's the only person ever with a 100 every time.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  100 100 percent constitutional voting record.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  100 percent known 20 years ago in Congress as doctor.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  No, because he votes no on all of this garbage.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  All right.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  I'm done.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  And I said, I go to your calls.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  Here's the really big news.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  You know, in the first hour we had Tony Gosling investigative journalist formerly with the BBC.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  In the research department, he's a radio talk show host.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  He broke down that this could bring down the prime minister.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  The prime minister has been connected to a nuclear arms sale to North Korea and Israel that I read about many years ago.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  But now it's back in the news.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  He's now run out of England and raced down to South Africa probably to check the Swiss bank accounts.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  He hired, of course, the head Rupert Murdoch employee who ran the News of the World to work for him.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  And guess what's happened, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  News of the World phone hacking whistleblower found dead.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  This is just out in the last 30 minutes.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  Death of Sean Hoer, who was first named journalist to allege Andy Coulson, new of hacking, not being treated as suspicious.
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  Kind of like Dr. David Kelly came out and said, we're being lied to about, well, he told his colleagues and emails, there are no W&Ds in Iraq.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  We've been ordered to fix intelligence around this.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  Of course, later it came out.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  The head of MI6 was ordered.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  There were meetings with Bush.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  It was fixed.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  But early on, that was the start of the war.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  They couldn't have that.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  He was found dead.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  And the first witnesses said five men in black uniforms ran away from the body, slit wrist, no blood there, two undigested pills.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  And they said he died of pills and slit his wrist.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000]  No blood.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  Folks, if someone has slipped their wrist, they bleed out.
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  There's gallons of blood there.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  No blood.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  They murdered him.
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  And the Hutton Inquest basically found that in England.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  So, I mean, that's when you know something suspicious.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  And this is really weird.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:23.000]  Now, it looks like the British government, the bureaucracy, the BBC mafia is going after Rupert Murdoch.
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  It's not that either side's good.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  They're all globalists just fighting for power.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  And the fact that the whistleblower is dead could mean three things.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  The government's going to use this crisis only so far and doesn't want it to go too high so they've gotten rid of a witness.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  Or people connected to Rupert Murdoch help this guy.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  Or it's real.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  He committed suicide or whatever.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  Sean Hoare, the former News of the World Showbiz reporter, who was first named journalist to allege that Andy Coulson was aware of phone hacking by a staff has been found dead.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  It'll be hard not to have that court hearing on it.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  The Guardian has learned.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  Hoare, who was working on the sun and the News of the World with Coulson before being dismissed for drinking drug problems, is said to have been found dead at his Watford homes.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  I guess firing him and claiming he was a drunk one enough to discredit him.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  Hartfordshire Police would not confirm his identity, but the force said in a statement at 10.40am today, police were called to Langley Road, Watford following the concerns for the welfare of a man who lives at the address on the street.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  Upon police and ambulance arrival at the property, the body of the man was found.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  The man was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  The death is currently being treated as unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious.
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  This could bring down the prime minister, but it's not suspicious.
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  It's like this little kid gets thrown down the stairs and dies.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  And then the girlfriend of the rich, one of the top three pharmacological companies, she's found hanging dead from the balcony arms and legs bound.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  And it's not suspicious.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  Folks, people think I'm joking about Fami Malik, the Arkansas Medical Examiner, where state police would be machine gunned off the road, hundreds of bullets, and they'd say the cop committed suicide, cops investigating Clinton.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  Or they'd grab a private investigator, cut their arms, legs off, shotgun holes in the head, gasoline on their body, and a landfill, suicide.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  That's even better than this one.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  I know you won't go look that up. You don't believe me. That's on record in the Arkansas.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  What about this new one I read earlier?
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  In fact, where are my stacks? I read it in the first hour. I shouldn't be laughing about this. It's so incredibly dangerous.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  Where the woman is hanging off the front balcony, bound naked, dead, and the police are saying, oh, this may not be foul play.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  We're not sure what we're going to do with this.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  When a little kid falls down the stairs a few days before and is now dead in the hospital.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  There it is, a millionaire, six-year-old son dies from a mysterious accident mansion where his father's lover was found hanging naked, bound.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  He can't make that up. He's the main witness in the case.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  You've got the police chief of Scotland Yard Resigning, the head of the Metropolitan Police Resigning.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  You've got the head of News Corp, a division in the UK, arrested over the weekend, and the main witness dies.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  Nothing to see here. Move along. Please, everyone.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  Everything is fine. The government is taking good care of you.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  He told the newspaper that not only did Coulson the aide to the prime minister know the phone hacking, but that he actively encouraged his staff to intercept the phone calls of celebrities in pursuit of exclusives.
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  In a subsequent interview with the BBC, he alleged that he was personally asked by his then editor, Coulson, to tap into phones.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  In an interview with the prime minister program, he said Coulson's insistence that he did not know about the practice was a lie.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  It is simply a lie. Well, you've been handled, haven't you?
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  At the time of Downing Street spokesman, Coulson totally and utterly denied the allegations, though now it turns out the police were reportedly bribed.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  We're going to come back, go to your calls, and I'll get into all the other economic news, police state news, world news.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  Also, the Formula One race track in Austin that taxpayers are going to have to pay for. The daughter of this guy is worth $4 billion and buys $150 million houses.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:45.000]  Well, why not? All over the world, this taxpayer pay for. They get $5 million in tax breaks because the Formula One track has been ruled an environmental sanctuary with all the race car, evil carbon.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  It's like Al Gore's got these giant 15, 20,000 square foot houses and private jets, but he says you need to charge carbon taxes for your tiny apartment.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  I mean, these people are so sick, we'll be right back.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptaken plants.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:47.000]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can. If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Protogrow website at growlightcrazy.com. That's www.growlightcrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.

[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  We're watching online right now in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:45.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  What would you do with a check for $25,000? What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  The court denied his request because of what I filed from the zero-debt program.
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  Find out how I did this by calling zero-debt today at 800-477-9256. Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the zero-debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  Call 800-477-9256 or visit www.ZeroDebt100.com.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  All right. Coming up, CIA veteran Robert Baer predicts September Israeli Iran war. That's from zero hedge.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  Paul Watson has a more detailed report coming out any minute now at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. We'll get into that more coming up.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  But right now, let's go to Andrew in France, then Jordan, Nick, Chuck, Michael, and others. Andrew, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:45.000]  Hi there, Alex. I've been an architect for 9-11 Truths for the past six years. I've been living in Europe for the past eight years.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  And I've got three points I'd like to make. The first is kind of a side note. I've experienced personally Codex, Alimentarius.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  There was an herbal tea that I was buying for two years, and all of a sudden I can't get it anymore.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  And so it's the real deal, you know, they'll mess around. Oh, no, it's in the European papers. They're banning hundreds and hundreds of over-the-counter herbal remedies, vitamins, minerals,
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  and they put it in the Food Safety Act last year. They're trying to pass it this year. Do the same thing here in the public's like, they'll never do that.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  Oh, they'll never pass Obamacare. They'll never have the TSA grab our genitals. They'll never ban gardens at our houses. Yes, they will.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  Yeah, you know, it's absolutely true. And they can't even advise on herbal remedies anymore. They can't have it on the package.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  They can't personally in the stores advise you anymore. That's the first point.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  Second point is when Osama bin Laden's death of Fars came out a couple months ago, I was so enraged by the French media's coverage of it
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  that I went on to La Liberation, their website, and I'm reading this ridiculous story about the Fars.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  And so I go into the forum. I leave a comment. It was a day-old article. I leave a comment. Come on, guys, this is ridiculous in French.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  This is ridiculous. Go see the truth. Go to infowars.com. Within 10 minutes, I had someone attacking me. And these comments are no one attacks people in the forum.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  It's like somebody reads an article and then they write their comment and they let it go. So someone attacked me personally.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  So I respond. I say, okay, you can attack me all you want, but why don't you attack the ideas? Go to the site.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  Why don't you let people decide for themselves? Go to the site and check it out.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  Within another two minutes, a different person, in theory, was already attacking me.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  And so it made me think about how infowars could maybe need to formally bring the war to non-Anglo-Europe,
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  because obviously in England it's pretty well-known, but maybe in France and Spain and Italy.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  No, it's very well-known there. I mean, I've had family before in Europe and they find out that, you know, they'll mention,
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  you like Alex Jones and then when they hear that they're, I've talked to other people in business who go over there,
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  and they just mention Alex Jones. Suddenly, you know, they've got a driver for the whole day once you drive them around for free.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  There are a lot of people that are awake over there, but at the same time, sir, it came out in the news today that the Pentagon is manipulating social networks worldwide.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  They have very sophisticated bots that can simulate humans, countering information, they do it with ridicule.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  There is a full spectrum attack on the Internet right now against alternative news and information.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  So I think that's what you probably are seeing, Andrew.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  Yeah, it's possible. I don't know if it was a bot or not, but maybe you could do forum bombs where you just pick a newspaper for the day,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  the Republic of Italy or Le Monde on France, and you say, okay, this is a ridiculous article.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  Well, I think that's a great idea, Andrew, but I mean, every day ought to be that.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  I mean, that's where the fights are going on, and I really appreciate you, Andrew. Thank you so much for the call.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  Look, the power of people starting a local newsletter and in physical paper being delivered to their door,
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  even if you start with your block, the power of starting your own website, the power of doing your own YouTube videos,
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  the power of you becoming a leader, that is what is unstoppable.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  Thank you, and I'm sure infowars.com is a focal point, but it's about you doing what you did, and that's a beautiful thing.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  Jordan in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  Hello?
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  Hey.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Hey, I couldn't if I was on or not. Anyway, good to talk to you again. I was going to tell you on July 4th, I went to the grass you know, I'd never actually been there, interestingly enough,
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  and I took some pictures of the picket fence that I found to be pretty interesting.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  People writing on their things like JFK plus 9-11 equals choke hold on the masses and Warren commission lied.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  It's very refreshing basically to see that people aren't buying it all anymore. I was going to know if you would be interested in me sending those to you or anything like that.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  Sure. I mean, just post them up on a Twitter account or something yourself. I wouldn't, just like the last guy, send everything to us like we're the headquarters, though that's fine if you'd like to.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  We get a lot of great information from listeners, but yeah, I think anybody who goes to Dallas should go to the grass you know,
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  and look at where they did the headshot from right there on the knoll versus shooting from the book building way down the street through trees that by the way lose their leaves in the summer, not in the winter.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  It's impossible. Anything else you'd like to add, Jordan, about your trip to Dealey Plaza?
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  No, that's it, man. Thank you very much.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  Thank you so much. Yeah, send them all along. I'd like to see them.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:10.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:46.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:31.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:49.000]  The state fore chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:33:07.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  Darker shame, darling, darker shame. Thank you for all the joy and pain. Picture show, second balcony, was the place we'd meet.
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  Obama vows to veto spending cuts. He's got a job to do. Bankrupt America even deeper into the offshore bank's hands.
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  Gold sores above $1,600 an ounce. Gas prices on the rise. Top four dollars in H states. And they keep blaming the Arabs for that. The main reason is dollar devaluation. It takes more dollars to buy the same oil. But no one dare talk about what QE12 and now three is going to do to the dollar.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  How it's going to annihilate. Obama says, hey, I don't want to, you know, you got to pass the debt increase or you won't get your social security checks. Well, they're already shrinking the value of them to begin with.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  It's like, do you pour out a pitcher of water or do you boil it out? And that's basically what inflation's doing. They're boiling it and pouring it out. Also, speaking of water radioactivity and some water supplies.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  Finally, every week I see new articles in different TV stations. This is Austin's own KXAN. There's all this uranium and other radioactive isotopes in the water. And the EPA is concerned about you.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  And nowhere do they remind you that Rick Perry covered this up. But before him, for at least 15 years, that's 25 years, they knew about it and that most of it's coming from the sodium fluoride added, which also has radioactive isotopes in it.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  This is the stuff they put in the tub senate from the mines where they get the phosphates. This is the stuff they can't sell to fertilizer companies. So why not just put it in your water? And then when they get caught covering it up, they have articles about Jeepers Creepers.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  Oh my goodness. I'm going to be going over that report as well. Oh yeah, they put hundreds of horrible things in your water because they're good people. Very good people.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  And their answer to you finding out about it is just to raise the levels of what they say is safe radioactively. Just like 20 years ago, they told the troops radioactive DU. You cannot use it. It is too deadly.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  And now they just say magic wand, no safety required troops. We're going to serve it out to you even for small arms. How's that sound? And use it in proving grounds right by major cities and towns.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  Because after all, glowing in the dark is a good thing. You know, they say the Japanese got their spirits brightened by winning the women's world cup and soccer.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  You know, again, they sell us on, hey, you won a game. But don't worry, you're radioactive now.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  Right. I want to go back to your calls. But first, I wasn't here Friday, so I didn't get to this. E-Foods Direct, the name in high quality, storeable foods.

[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters. You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  And it's hard to get fluoride out, but they got systems that will do it and systems that will get fluoride out will also get uranium out.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  I should add one of the hardest things to get out is fluoride and uranium. They're very similar to each other in their particle size and they've got the systems.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  You're insane if you don't filter your water. I know I do. They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower bath filters.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  They're reverse osmosis systems with filter, radioactive isotubes. All the filters are made in the USA. Check out the banners at infowars.com or prismplanet.com or purewaterfreedom.com to take control of your water today.

[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  It was even voted best superfood by our friend Mike Adams from Natural News. ENERfood.com is the website because it's composed of nearly 50% chloralina, spirulina kelp, chlorella, spirulina kelp, and dulse.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  It also is high in naturally occurring iodine, which again will help safeguard against the harmful effects of radiation.

[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  And I believe in all of the sponsors that you hear me endorse, ladies and gentlemen, I believe they're super high quality and you should check them out.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  Okay, let's do this. Let's go back to your calls for our rampage through some more news.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  Nick in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  Hey Alex, can I cut him with the AJs and we can cut out the kudos.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  I got a lot of topics sitting through the month with you from Dewhurst through Inside Job.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  I first wanted to ask you, since I heard about chemical trails, you might do a show on it. Have you ever heard about enhancing radar?
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  They use chemical trails to enhance the radar?
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  Yes. In fact, I've actually talked to the Director of Heart before and I've talked to General Benton K. Parton, Head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  And the word is that it's a over-the-horizon radar system is one of the uses of it.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  They can spot out planes easier also with a metal, like an aluminum. So that's hard information to get.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  So when you talk to him with Inside Job, I got some information from Donald Rumsfeld.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  Actually, a week before they executed Timothy, I got a couple of crypt notes.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  They pressed it all over Rumsfeld and they're going, why? Why so hurry?
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  And Rumsfeld finally gave in and he said he's not going to see it.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  And that's just a week before they executed McClay.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  And another intimidating thing about George W. Bush, ex-president, is he came out before he departed the White House and he said,
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  one more target and they would have one. I mean, they would have one.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  The word is, people think that the flight that went down in Pennsylvania, Flight 93, was going for seven.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  And that's why they had to blow it up later because it was already rigged.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  But the word is that it was really going for the capital. It was all going in that same general direction.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  And if they would have blown up the capital with an aircraft, that would have been a real excuse to bring in tyranny.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  And the Associated Press reported, for no reason, Jeb Bush declared martial law in Florida on September 9th.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  In fact, folks won't believe that. Just search Governor Jeb Bush declared martial law September 9th.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  And we'll show folks World Net Daily and Associated Press. You can't make this stuff up.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  Good points, Nick. I appreciate your call.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  We'll put that on screen for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  Just search Governor Jeb Bush or Florida Governor Jeb Bush declared martial law September 9th.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  Of 2001, you heard me right. Two days before 9-11.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  And George W. Bush, his brother, who had 44,000 US troops, 18,000 British troops surrounding Afghanistan,
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  two carriers that had just arrived, signed a launch order to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  Oh, yes. Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in North Carolina. Chuck, you're on the air.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? You always sound re-energized when you talk to one of the Pauls.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  Absolutely. Look, Ron Paul, I mean, I work. I work in the trenches. I work in news.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  I know how exhausting it is to really think and to really just not go with a script, but to really analyze.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  It is exhausting. I mean, it's just problem-solving every minute of the day.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  And even when I want to wind down, I can't quit thinking about it.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  And Ron Paul works 16 to 18 hours a day. He gets up at 4 a.m. He lifts weights and bikes or jogs on the treadmill for an hour.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:03.000]  He eats a Spartan breakfast, and then he reads the news for two hours and legislation and then works all day.
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  And I know no one is informed to him. And I know no one. I mean, I feel fried at 37.
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  And I don't know how he does it. So that's why you saw the profuse worshiping.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  But I just admire that type of dedication.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  Absolutely. I got a picture with him after the South Carolina debate at the Tea Party.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  He was the only one that spoke to us at the Marriott Hotel.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  And I put my arm around him to get a picture with him, expecting to feel an old man there.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  And I tell you what, I have my arm around his shoulder. He feels a muscle there.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  He's up to the task. What I wanted to ask you about, though, was the 10th anniversary coming up.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  I'm kind of hoping to hear maybe that you've got some little documentary that you might be letting out right before the thing.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Maybe a mini documentary or something.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000]  Here's the problem. Here's the problem.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  I worked up here until eight o'clock last night on Sunday, eight o'clock, and got home and put the children to bed and talk,
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  read them a few books and then worked till 11.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  So, and I worked all morning yesterday, you know, with my children around me.
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  So I got at least to be in their presence.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  But, but here's the deal.
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  I'm making too many many documentaries.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  I'm making too many iPhone 4 uploads.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  I'm doing too many other media interviews.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  I've got to launch this TV show.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  I've got to get furniture bought for some of the rooms.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  I've got to get desk in for new employees.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  I'm not complaining.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  It's just that I haven't made a film.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  I made Burma's.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  I helped him on Invisible Empires.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  Excellent.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000]  Police State 4, Rob Dube put together with Jason Douglas.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000]  But, but I haven't made a film since fall of the Republic almost two years ago.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  So I got to get the TV show launched and then I can make films.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  But I just believe me, there's a hundred films I want to make.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  I've started and stopped five films the last two years.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  Just because it's such a process to make a film.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  I've got to have it exactly right.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  That's why you watch it fall the Republic and in-game.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  I mean, in-game says Perry's going to run for president in 2012.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  How do I do it?
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  Real research, real time.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  And, and, and so yes, I want to do more, believe me.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  But that's why there's other great filmmakers that we promote because there's other people stepping up.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  This is a group effort and I love you and I appreciate your call.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000]  Who's up next here?
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  John, who's up next?
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  Michael in New York, you're on the air.
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  Go ahead.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  Alex, how are you?
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  It's an absolute honor to speak with you.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:50.000]  You gave me the red pill about three years, three years ago and I've been awake and just awakening others ever since.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000]  Just two quick things for you, Alex.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  I'm an Orthodox Christian priest serving a small Egyptian community up in New York.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  I was on Capitol Hill on June 15th meeting with some centers representatives and coming out of that meeting came out of the building, out of the heart building.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And I ran into LaRouche's group out there who I saw here locally in New York earlier today.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:21.000]  They were talking about HR 1489 and I wanted to get your take on HR 1489 and also-
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  You're going to bring back the Glass-Steagall, right?
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000]  Right.
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  Yeah, so there's a few representatives from around the nation that have signed on.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.000]  I haven't seen representative Paul's name on here.
[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  I know you'll have him back on in a few weeks so maybe you could ask him about that when you see him.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  Well, I got to tell you, I've scanned over the legislation.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  I haven't read the whole thing because it's pretty lengthy.
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  I think getting the Glass-Steagall back is good.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  The problem is Paul won't vote for something if it's not constitutional and it may have some stuff in it.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000]  I mean, that's a smell test right there.
[02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  If Ron Paul, he's really a poison detector, if he's not endorsing it, it means he's got problems with it.
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  Listen, I don't support a lot of the LaRouche solutions.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000]  Their analysis is spot on.
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.000]  I bring them on to be thought provoking because everybody we have on, we don't totally agree with.
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  I think LaRouche means well. Tarpley, I don't like to air dirty laundry or open things up,
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  but he was their chief European head for decades.
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  Tarpley's super smart and he's got mixed met.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  He says there's two camps in LaRouche and overall they're bringing out the eugenics.
[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:39.000]  They're bringing out that master plan and so I overall have them on some.
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  Could I just ask you one other quick question?
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  Go ahead.
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  I've really struggled with the idea of getting more involved.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  As I mentioned, I'm a priest up here serving a community of about 2,500 or so people.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  I struggle because I see what's going on around me.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  I have twin babies and I don't want them growing up in this kind of a world
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  where these wicked people are running the show.
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.000]  Do you have any suggestions? How could I strike that balance,
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  especially with the 503C status that I have to tiptoe around?
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:27.000]  Are there any suggestions that you might have for me that how I could get more involved with my current limitations?
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:32.000]  Well, I think a lot of it is as long as you're not acting like you're talking about something evil,
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  people will just think you're talking about news and information.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  And so I would just be confident in everything you discuss and just know you're doing the right thing
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  and realize that you don't really have any limitations.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  The only limitation out there is getting past your fear and if you get in trouble for telling the truth,
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  well then that's part of your mission in life.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  I mean, you know that the way to go is not an easy road
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  and the way that is wide leads to destruction.
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  That doesn't mean I'm on some high horse.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  In fact, it's part of my wickedness growing up that actually in the end worked for greater good
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  because I can recognize evil because I'm certainly not a fainting violet, you could say.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  I've seen a few things. I had quite an extreme upbringing.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  The things I haven't seen in Dallas, the things I ran into, but I don't want to digress.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  I appreciate your call and I'm honored that you would ask my opinion on things.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  Now, let me, it's here in my stack.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  KTLA, Drudge had it up yesterday.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  I shot a video for it on Aaron Dyke's YouTube channel.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  I don't want to get that posted up at infowars.com or prisonpotta.com where, and I said this to do
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  and I wish I would have shot a iPhone video on the fly when I was in LA this weekend.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  I was watching the fear mongering Friday night that it was the end of the world and they shut down the 405
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  and I said they're going to start doing this all the time.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  This is part of agenda 21, the way they were hyping it and of course it turned out there wasn't a disaster.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  There weren't big traffic jams and now that TV station, others are saying we just need to order people
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  when they can leave their house, when they can drive, we need to shut down more roads
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  and not let people have extra-curricular driving.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  Well, that's what the British government's calling for.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:29.000]  They show kids cartoons where in the future you'll be given a government allotment of what you can eat and do.
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  That's smart growth.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  And then I saw another article where in Germany they're saying by 2020, no single parent homes.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000]  Let's live in government dormitories.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  And I see other reports where, you know, what type of toilet, what type of light bulb, can't pack your kids' lunches,
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  can't have a guard in your front yard.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  It's prison.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  Living in Europe in the United States under the global government model is living as a prisoner.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  They're cutting off the resources to get you to a third-world level so they can starve you to death
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  and say, oh, you want welfare because you can't get a job, you've got to be sterilized.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  Now, it's a death sentence for the third world, the carbon taxes that are going in.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  Then, meanwhile, in their sick joke, they get $5 million in tax incentives because they say the F1 taxpayer-paid-for racetrack
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  to be built outside Austin, owned by this big globalist, is good for the earth.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  So when Al Gore gets a 20,000-square-foot mansion, it's for the earth, it's green.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  When you have a tiny 600-square-foot, 700-square-foot apartment, you get taxes on you.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  It is such a sickening, disgusting joke.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  When we, for years, expose that every city, 70-plus percent of the population drinks four-day water,
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  that between 150 and 300-plus chemicals are added, including radioactive isotopes.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Well, they're now claiming the radiation is in the aquifers, not in the fluoride,
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  because we forced this out in the open. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Alley C?
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C.
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent,
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath,
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number,
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  severity, and duration of common colds.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:29.000]  Our powerful Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  Just one tablet of Alley C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal, and viral infections,
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent, boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Alley C.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:53.000]  For more information and to order Alley C, call 877-888-7126 or go to garlichealthproducts.com.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:58.000]  That's 877-888-7126 or garlichealthproducts.com.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  Fight back with Alley C.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  Plus, accessories.

[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000]  You've been lied to.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  The market is in for another crash.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  Real estate is already in a double-dip recession, and if you want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  My name is Brett Kitchin, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed, I said enough is enough.
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double-digit gains,
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000]  but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  I want you to get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire,
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and J.C. Penney used to safely grow their wealth.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  Call 1-800-675-1640 right now to get your free copy.
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  I'm giving away a limited number of copies today, so call 1-800-675-1640.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  Hi, Alex. Two things are trying me to real quick.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  QUT tonight at the Cactus Cafe had a little discussion forum session about this past session of the Texas Legislature,
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  and members of the public are invited to attend, so I'm going to be there and get my 10 cents worth,
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  and many other listeners want to come up to me.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.000]  Are you the Scotchman that came down to the Capitol when we stormed it?
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  That's me, aye.
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  That's the second thing real quick. It's funny, the news of the world being the story out at the moment.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  I was London London back in the 80s and 86.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  I was working for a catering temp agency, and I used to go to this place called the HAC,
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  which was the honourable artillery company.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  It was the headquarters of the oldest regiment in the British Army.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  It was founded in King Henry VIII, and they used to hire out of the hall for functions.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  There was a big sex scandal broke this by about 1986, and I think it involved someone in the government.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  I can't swear to that, but I remember the madam's name was Cynthia Payne,
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  and she had hired this place of the HAC for a dinner this night,
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  and there was a couple of reporters from the news of the world snipping around,
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  but they never made it past security to get inside.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  Now, strangling up, a couple of nights later, the news of the world themselves had the place hired for a staff party,
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  and there was all sorts of shenanigans going on there.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  There was actually a fight broke out, and there was a couple of people,
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  there was a couple, rather, behind this grand piano in the corner of the room,
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  and pretty friendly with each other.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  Well, the story in the news of the world that Sunday was all about these shenanigans,
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  but they attributed it to the function previously of Cynthia Payne.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  So that's how incredible these people are.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  Well, what do you think about the reporter that first broke the news being found dead today,
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  and the police out of the gates are saying no big deal?
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  I'll tell you what, nothing surprises me anymore, Alex. Absolutely nothing.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  Well, John, where is that event again tonight?
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  It's at the Cactus Cafe on the UT campus. It starts at 6 o'clock.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  All right, buddy, good to hear from you. I wish I could be there.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  The woods are lovely dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Kathy in New Orleans, welcome.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  Hi, how are you? I'm very sorry. I'm very harsh. I've been sick for the last few days.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:08.000]  I am, excuse me, aged in 76 along with Gary King on Patriot Radio in New Orleans for three years now,
[02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  and I wanted to tell you about something that we've been doing this year.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  It's been really good. We have our weekly chem trail report by our actual weather girl,
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  and it's been really good. We tracked the chem trails from Baton Rouge to Mississippi to New Orleans,
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  and we have a girl that comes in and does a weekly chem trail report.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:36.000]  Well, that's good because the government's now being forced to admit they've been modifying the atmosphere,
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  and lo and behold, it's exactly what chem trail researchers said 15 years ago,
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and other little goodies.
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:46.000]  And haven't I met you guys before?
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  Yeah, we came to Austin and we met you when we wanted to start our show,
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  and you gave us some really good tips, and we've been doing it ever since.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  Well, you've done well. You've done well, Kathy.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  I've got to jump with one more tail gunner, Cindy in North Carolina.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000]  You've got about 45 seconds. Go ahead.
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  Hello, how are you?
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  Good.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  I just want to say you are my John the Baptist.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  We need you out there. There's a lot of people like me, I'm a grandma.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  They can't do much any time young. They can't do much of anything,
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  but get on the website, get on the information and get what we can get out that comes from you,
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  and we are so glad that you are out there.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  I'm glad you are doing all you can.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  I want you to focus and keep us going out here,
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  because you're the reason that we're getting angry and we're waking up
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000]  and we're doing whatever we can.
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  Well, you're awesome, Cindy. I'm out of time.
[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  They're talking about River Murdoch stepping down.
