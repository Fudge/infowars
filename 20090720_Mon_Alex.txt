[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.960 --> 00:40.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.960 --> 00:48.400]  you so much for joining us very very important jam-packed radio transmission
[00:48.400 --> 00:57.600]  today it is Monday the 13th day and I appreciate everybody tuning in to this
[00:57.600 --> 01:08.360]  worldwide transmission again the 13th day of July 2009 and we're going to be
[01:08.360 --> 01:15.360]  live here for the next four hours joining us in one hour is Paul Joseph
[01:15.360 --> 01:20.920]  Watson for the full hour we are going to break down in greater detail than I did
[01:20.920 --> 01:36.440]  yesterday the incredible breaking news concerning the head of Obama's office of
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.000]  science over all the different scientific research and development
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.600]  programs of the federal government which is close to 90% of all science and
[01:44.600 --> 01:49.200]  technology development in the United States military industrial complex
[01:49.200 --> 01:55.600]  upwards of 90% of all research at universities private corporations you
[01:55.600 --> 02:00.400]  name it is federal government funded with your tax money and this is the guy
[02:00.400 --> 02:08.200]  directing and the individual that he authored the government policy book with
[02:08.200 --> 02:21.120]  was George W. Bush's technology advisor so the issue here is that every time you
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.640]  turn over any rock in academia I mean nine times out of ten in my experience
[02:26.640 --> 02:33.160]  they are you Genesis the reason this government policy textbook this is a
[02:33.160 --> 02:39.040]  textbook for government leaders and academia it's above PhD level it's a
[02:39.040 --> 02:46.080]  textbook the reason it's so important is that it puts everything that we've
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.680]  already found in globalist documents really in one place and is congruent
[02:50.680 --> 03:04.320]  and is full spectrum and breaks down the plan the program the operation to
[03:04.320 --> 03:09.920]  bring in a planetary regime a world government and to use carbon taxes and
[03:09.920 --> 03:17.320]  environmental rules to have forced abortion the killing of babies after
[03:17.320 --> 03:25.560]  they're born in fantasied drugging of the water food air all children will be
[03:25.560 --> 03:32.680]  taken at birth by the state to be raised in government hives this is what
[03:32.680 --> 03:41.760]  China adopted in 1981 they phased it in in 1975 it began as the one-child
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.240]  policy but the majority of children in China in the large cities the people are
[03:48.240 --> 03:54.720]  so destitute so poor they forced them to live in government dormitories and you
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.120]  get to see your family on the weekends this is already happening here to a
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.440]  certain extent where oh you've got to work two three jobs parents the man and
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.360]  the woman to pay the taxes and try to survive financially we'll keep your kids
[04:06.360 --> 04:11.480]  till 10 at night first it was five and six and seven and eight and nine oh we
[04:11.480 --> 04:15.160]  got after school basketball and after school reading programs and oh after
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.600]  school indoctrination programs and after school title tell squads of the
[04:18.600 --> 04:25.760]  police see this is what's happening and so we're gonna break it all down today
[04:25.760 --> 04:30.200]  the master plan but having this document is so important the story was
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.400]  reported on weeks ago by a neocon site David Horowitz front-page magazine that
[04:36.400 --> 04:41.440]  loves to attack me and he makes it all a left-wing thing I'm sorry mr. Horowitz
[04:41.440 --> 04:45.680]  it's across the political spectrum it is the religion of the government
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.600]  control freaks but like anybody with half a brain knows this Horowitz so you
[04:49.600 --> 04:56.520]  know this but regardless so we're glad he reported on it but we actually got the
[04:56.520 --> 05:02.040]  book scans up now it's mega huge hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want
[05:02.040 --> 05:05.560]  each of you to ask yourself this question do you really know what's in your
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.080]  tap water in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.000]  found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.960]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive
[05:17.960 --> 05:22.040]  immune and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it
[05:22.040 --> 05:26.080]  the acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.400]  back control of you and your family's drinking water the acola blue 28 produces
[05:30.400 --> 05:33.840]  up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and use a
[05:33.840 --> 05:38.080]  state-of-the-art carbon filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violent light

[08:29.360 --> 08:40.680]  All right, here's what I'm going to do, trying to shake the show up a minute, change the
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.560]  way we do it here.
[08:43.560 --> 08:56.200]  We're just going to open the phones up right now at the beginning of the transmission 1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231,
[08:56.200 --> 09:02.800]  and we will get you up and on the air today.
[09:02.800 --> 09:15.960]  Obviously, I want to discuss the fact that President Obama's science czar wrote a government
[09:15.960 --> 09:22.480]  policy book, textbook for leaders in government and academia, calling for a detailed plan
[09:22.480 --> 09:31.160]  to bring in a world planetary regime with eugenics police, CPS that kidnap everyone's
[09:31.160 --> 09:40.000]  children, forced abortions, infanticide, euthanasia, forced drugging of the water supply, the food,
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.880]  inoculations, hell on earth.
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.400]  Now I know that I constantly talk about this, but I talk about a UN biological diversity
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.600]  assessment, or I talk about state of heart memorandum 200, or I discuss a book written
[09:57.600 --> 10:04.280]  by Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh, or I talk about Prince Bernhardt founder of Bilderberg
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.400]  and the Nazi talking about how we need to exterminate everyone, or Dr. Eric Pionka or
[10:09.400 --> 10:15.600]  Dr. Peter Singer and how they get standing ovations in worldwide awards for saying kill
[10:15.600 --> 10:22.360]  90% of the public, or how their graduate students send me threatening emails with links proudly
[10:22.360 --> 10:28.640]  to their PhDs saying kill everyone.
[10:28.640 --> 10:35.080]  But how am I supposed to get up here on air and even talk about Sonia Sotomayor, who's
[10:35.080 --> 10:43.280]  had most of her rulings overthrown by the Supreme Court as bad as that court is?
[10:43.280 --> 10:51.840]  She did say it doesn't matter if a white person does better on a test, you don't get the job.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.520]  That got overthrown.
[10:53.520 --> 11:03.720]  I mean, that's a big issue, or to that matter, a black person that does better, or a Hispanic
[11:03.720 --> 11:04.720]  person or an Asian.
[11:04.720 --> 11:05.720]  What about Asians?
[11:05.720 --> 11:09.600]  They generally score the highest.
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.400]  You don't get a job if you're Chinese or Japanese, I guess.
[11:15.400 --> 11:26.000]  But if you're a Hispanic who gets a high score, sorry if another minority, which really
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.800]  the majority worldwide, wants the job, they get it.
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.200]  That's why a lot of folks, why there's such white flight from California, because with
[11:36.200 --> 11:40.520]  all the draconian Soviet rules there, there's not many jobs you can get.
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.120]  But that's all part of government control.
[11:44.120 --> 11:46.720]  That's all part of domestication.
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.120]  That's all part of bankrupting everybody and driving you into the hands of the government,
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.200]  where you can't get a job, so you just go on welfare.
[11:53.200 --> 11:54.960]  Now you can be sterilized.
[11:54.960 --> 11:57.080]  Now you can have your children's CPS.
[11:57.080 --> 12:13.880]  Now you can get the mandatory home visits.
[12:13.880 --> 12:16.440]  And all of that goes back to eugenics.
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.800]  When you study the head of health and human services, or the head of science, or the head
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.880]  of drug policy, or the heads of all these state and federal agencies, and the heads
[12:25.880 --> 12:33.480]  of the biology departments, and the heads of the psychology departments, and the head
[12:33.480 --> 12:40.680]  of the mathematics department, I mean, I went to community college for two years.
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.920]  And every class, it didn't matter if it was calculus.
[12:45.920 --> 12:50.280]  It didn't matter if it was psychology 101.
[12:50.280 --> 12:52.480]  It didn't matter if it was anthropology.
[12:52.480 --> 12:54.980]  It didn't matter if it was Texas history.
[12:54.980 --> 12:57.760]  It didn't matter if it was U.S. history.
[12:57.760 --> 13:06.480]  It every class at the ACC North Campus I went to was how we all have to intermarry, how
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.880]  anyone marrying someone of their own color is evil, how the Second Amendment is bad,
[13:10.880 --> 13:21.360]  how world government is good, how psychologists skinner locking his kid in a pit for years
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.640]  till he died was beautiful, how there's too many of us, the people bomb, how we've all
[13:26.640 --> 13:28.840]  got to be exterminated.
[13:28.840 --> 13:33.280]  And I was sitting there watching this and listening to this, and I'd read all these
[13:33.280 --> 13:38.360]  books, all these history books, and I knew what this was.
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.040]  And then I would go home and watch CNN, and they'd say, there's crazy people believe there's
[13:42.040 --> 13:48.720]  a plan for world government, and there's crazy people believe Bill Clinton wants their guns.
[13:48.720 --> 13:51.960]  And there's crazy people that believe the government slaughtered everybody at Waco,
[13:51.960 --> 13:56.520]  and the Delta Force was there, and then I'd read the Congress's own reports and the Delta
[13:56.520 --> 14:02.000]  Force documents, and I just said, why should I even be here?
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.320]  I was about to go into UT.
[14:03.320 --> 14:09.720]  I'd gone and sat in on some classes, gone and looked at their RTF department, and it
[14:09.720 --> 14:10.720]  was even worse.
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.920]  And I said, pay tens of thousands of dollars a year to be taught how to be a global slave.
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.320]  People ask how I woke up to the New World Order, I mean, go to any college, any community
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.400]  college.
[14:25.400 --> 14:30.240]  And ladies and gentlemen, since then I have gone and just spot checked.
[14:30.240 --> 14:36.160]  I've never found a university head of a big establishment government or state funded university.
[14:36.160 --> 14:46.240]  I've never seen a biology department or psychology department head who wasn't openly a eugenicist,
[14:46.240 --> 14:51.160]  openly saying sterilize the population, get rid of most humans, bring in world government,
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.360]  confiscate everybody's guns, have every facet of your life, chronicle, track, trace, and
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.640]  micromanage, as Nancy Pelosi has now said they'll do under the carbon tax system in
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.640]  a speech in China.
[15:05.640 --> 15:07.560]  I mean, this is the only issue.
[15:07.560 --> 15:09.200]  This is all there is.
[15:09.200 --> 15:16.080]  This is the ruling elite don't hire you as the head of a psychology department.
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.480]  The ruling elite don't hire you.
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.840]  It's a club, and we ain't in it, as George Carlin would say.
[15:23.840 --> 15:26.560]  It's a big club, and we ain't in it.
[15:26.560 --> 15:29.720]  Now, my dad, they tried to recruit into it.
[15:29.720 --> 15:31.080]  That's nothing special.
[15:31.080 --> 15:35.960]  He was top of his class in high school and then had really high test scores, and they
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.840]  tried to recruit him and a few others that were part of this advanced curriculum search
[15:42.840 --> 15:45.720]  being done in high schools across the country.
[15:45.720 --> 15:51.040]  And anybody and everybody I've had on professors, climatologists, scientists who are fighting
[15:51.040 --> 15:56.320]  this now outside of academia, I mean, they don't even let you be a professor usually.
[15:56.320 --> 15:59.480]  They'll run you out when we've had them on.
[15:59.480 --> 16:01.800]  It's been in the news.
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.920]  But the issue is you don't get into one of those positions unless you buy into the cult
[16:08.920 --> 16:12.080]  idea.
[16:12.080 --> 16:14.320]  Now I'm not debating Darwinism.
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.960]  I'm not debating that species change and that you can breed a dog.
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.640]  You can breed a wolf, a European wolf to look like a little French bulldog with big
[16:23.640 --> 16:29.960]  bat ears and a cute face with spots on it.
[16:29.960 --> 16:36.700]  I think there is creation, and it's been proven that evolution, the way it's presented
[16:36.700 --> 16:38.120]  is a fraud and a lie.
[16:38.120 --> 16:45.760]  But my issue is I'm not debating the central religious tenet of the New World Order.
[16:45.760 --> 16:55.920]  I want people who follow Darwinism to understand it is the gateway into your real religion.
[16:55.920 --> 17:02.400]  Because out of that comes the eugenics, Galton and the rest of them who were married into
[17:02.400 --> 17:14.240]  the family and worked with the progenitor of the theory of evolution, Darwin.
[17:14.240 --> 17:20.560]  And then they develop social Darwinism where the elites need to kill and enslave and dominate
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.560]  the population.
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.840]  And that is moral thing to do because we're scum because we're not in the elite positions.
[17:26.840 --> 17:33.040]  That proves our worthlessness, that proves that we're not worthy to even live.
[17:33.040 --> 17:37.960]  And so anything they do to us is a favor to the species overall.
[17:37.960 --> 17:46.520]  Now that is the not dominant, but almost universal, more than dominant, hyper dominant, nearly
[17:46.520 --> 17:59.160]  universal, accepted, received, not even questioned, elitist, control freak mindset of academia.
[17:59.160 --> 18:06.320]  That then educates the elites for every other position in the economy in the human strata
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.360]  of civilization.
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.280]  And so if you're a professor that argues with any of this, you are drummed out, you
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.360]  are driven out, you don't get research money, you don't get your book published, you don't
[18:20.360 --> 18:24.480]  get invited to the big conferences, but when you get up like Dr. Peter Singer or Dr. Eric
[18:24.480 --> 18:36.920]  Bianca or the science czar, John Holdren, you get standing ovations with the professors
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.160]  and scientists crying.
[18:41.160 --> 18:42.280]  This isn't science.
[18:42.280 --> 18:49.840]  This is control freak pressing on the nerve of power religion.
[18:49.840 --> 18:52.440]  This is a death cult.
[18:52.440 --> 19:01.360]  This is a control freak cult on a wild power trip rationalizing all of their psychopathic
[19:01.360 --> 19:08.160]  delusions of grandeur as if it's a gift to humanity and the planet.
[19:08.160 --> 19:13.280]  And they are poisoning each and every one of our food and water on record.
[19:13.280 --> 19:16.400]  They are poisoning our air on record now.
[19:16.400 --> 19:22.720]  They're openly bankrupting the countries of the planet publicly by design to make you
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.840]  dependent, to lower their standard of living, not for the earth, but so that you're dependent
[19:26.840 --> 19:35.160]  on them so they can restrain you while they kill you.
[19:35.160 --> 19:38.360]  You understand ladies and gentlemen, that's why I get mad about Michael Jackson being
[19:38.360 --> 19:44.120]  the second biggest story in the 21st century because it doesn't matter.
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.840]  If you love your children, you love your wife, you love your husband, you better wake up
[19:48.840 --> 19:54.160]  to eugenics and find out it's the number one thing that affects every facet of your
[19:54.160 --> 19:55.160]  life.
[19:55.160 --> 19:57.080]  It is the religion, the thought process.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.600]  It is everything to the elite that are killing us.
[20:00.600 --> 20:06.080]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources and let me ask just one question.
[20:06.080 --> 20:09.720]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[20:09.720 --> 20:12.240]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count.
[20:12.240 --> 20:17.120]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets
[20:17.120 --> 20:19.200]  and escape the paper markets.
[20:19.200 --> 20:21.560]  The only real option is precious metals.
[20:21.560 --> 20:25.920]  For your retirement, your kids' education are just plain survival when the whole Obama
[20:25.920 --> 20:28.240]  mess comes crashing down.
[20:28.240 --> 20:32.120]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package and I'd like to discuss
[20:32.120 --> 20:35.920]  a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family.
[20:35.920 --> 20:45.920]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237, extension 128, that's 800-686-2237, extension 128 and
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.840]  together we can develop a make sense program before the clock runs out.
[20:49.840 --> 20:56.920]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237, extension 128 and take charge of your future and thank
[20:56.920 --> 21:01.280]  you.
[21:01.280 --> 21:07.360]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.840]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.160]  us would like to see.
[21:13.160 --> 21:18.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.720]  of the American people.
[21:19.720 --> 21:21.520]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[21:21.520 --> 21:24.080]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[21:29.200 --> 21:37.320]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[21:37.320 --> 21:40.880]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[21:40.880 --> 21:47.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[22:00.400 --> 22:04.480]  Being a part of life change tea has been an exhilarating experience.
[22:04.480 --> 22:09.920]  I love the testimonies, Julian New York writes, I love this product, I feel great, it worked
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.480]  immediately, you can feel the cleansing right away, other products don't work right away
[22:14.480 --> 22:20.440]  like this one does, Mrs. Luella from Missouri writes, my daughter has lost 27 pounds, she
[22:20.440 --> 22:25.920]  loves the tea, and David from Tennessee writes, my wife has a lot of digestive problems and
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.800]  the tea really helps her a lot, I like it too.
[22:28.800 --> 22:34.680]  And here's my favorite from CJ in Minnesota, he writes, this stuff really works, no I mean
[22:34.680 --> 22:40.640]  it really works, no I mean it really works, be one of the many testimonies that we receive

[23:00.360 --> 23:05.000]  If the current state of the economy is severely impacting your life, this might be some of
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.640]  the most important information you will ever hear, as the economy continues to spiral out
[23:09.640 --> 23:14.680]  of control, many people, just like you, wonder how they will support their family and pay
[23:14.680 --> 23:15.680]  their bills.
[23:15.680 --> 23:19.640]  The government is not going to help out the people who desperately need it, it's time
[23:19.640 --> 23:24.000]  for you to look outside the box and change your life, if you're tired of the get rich
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.720]  quick schemes, if you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck, if you're tired of being tired,
[23:29.720 --> 23:34.920]  you need to pick up Robert Beetle's new book, and it's called Here's What You Do, yes Here's

[23:39.920 --> 23:43.840]  economy that's in the middle of a recession, and the best part, this revolutionary book

[24:06.760 --> 24:32.400]  He's got some big breaking news on the show coming up today, he was in some internal hearings
[24:32.400 --> 24:37.880]  dealing with the whitewash hearings coming up of the supposed 9-11 patsies and the government
[24:37.880 --> 24:41.000]  had to admit they have no evidence against the people, that's why Obama's saying they
[24:41.000 --> 24:50.400]  can't release them though, so he's trying to set up the precedent for there being pre-crime
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.640]  in this country, just indefinitely held forever, not even charged, not even tried, that's what
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.040]  they're saying, even if they're found not guilty, they'll still be held for life, or
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.400]  until they agree to carry out terror attacks for the globalist, that's what these camps
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.600]  are really all about, to get operatives, so they mainly grab 14-year-olds as one of the
[25:08.600 --> 25:13.360]  age groups they like to grab, they can torture them and get a good operative out of it, and
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.080]  then G. Edward Griffin will also be joining us to talk about a host of issues coming up
[25:18.080 --> 25:23.480]  in the last hour today, the climate tax and the new world order and stage terror and what
[25:23.480 --> 25:27.080]  he sees the globalists trying to do, we're going to go live after the last three hours
[25:27.080 --> 25:32.040]  of the four-hour show today, Shyamalan Cash at PrismPlanet.tv, but I want to go to Bill,
[25:32.040 --> 25:38.160]  Nick, Robert, Mark, Adam and others, and I would hope you'd want to discuss the article
[25:38.160 --> 25:44.720]  that Paul Watson wrote that's been the most detailed dealing with the science czar over
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.240]  all technological development in the federal government, that means 90% of technological
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.120]  development in the United States, there's the government funds most of it, as Eisenhower
[25:54.120 --> 26:00.000]  warned us in his farewell address in 1960, beware the undue influence of the military
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.960]  industrial complex, now they were trying to set up a police state, which they've now
[26:05.960 --> 26:13.000]  done, scientific dictatorship by these boys, I would hope you want to discuss that, you
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.200]  know we posted a David Bowie song I'd never heard from 1967, it's up on PrismPlanet.com,
[26:22.200 --> 26:31.840]  and I may air it later, you know I try to have a really, really clean show, he says,
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.760]  some super society issue, I may just air it just to document that the fact that people
[26:36.760 --> 26:40.840]  are so aware of this, and he made a movie, I saw it once when I was in high school,
[26:40.840 --> 26:48.200]  in fact I'm going to look this up this morning, it's a science fiction movie that has a lot
[26:48.200 --> 26:54.480]  of eugenics parallels in it, the man who fell to earth I think is the name of it, and the
[26:54.480 --> 26:58.960]  whole song is about how the elite are making it up, there's not enough resources and plan
[26:58.960 --> 27:03.960]  to forcibly sterilize and have forced abortions and kill us and poison our water supply, I
[27:03.960 --> 27:09.120]  mean David Bowie did this in 1967, and I know why hanging out with the elites in England
[27:09.120 --> 27:13.320]  in the US, that's all they talk about, I mean that's all that's discussed, and then there
[27:13.320 --> 27:17.480]  are minions, I mean if you can't go to community college without all they talk about is how
[27:17.480 --> 27:24.520]  they want to kill everybody, this is a death cult of dangerous scum, and it is true to
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.040]  a certain extent what David Horowitz from front page magazine is saying, I can't believe
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.160]  I'm agreeing with him, he attacks me perpetually, that it's liberal, I mean when you get into
[27:33.160 --> 27:41.200]  liberals and democrats and intelligentsia and psychologists, I'd say 95% of them are
[27:41.200 --> 27:48.160]  into it, and then when you talk about conservatives it's about 95%, when you talk about high level
[27:48.160 --> 27:56.960]  conservatives, but only about 50% on the street conservatives, so it is kind of the received
[27:56.960 --> 28:07.280]  knowledge, it is the, it just accepted as if it's just a fact, they don't even question
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.200]  it, there's too many people and they got to have a world government to exterminate everybody,
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.160]  and then because they're part of the team and feel like it's for the betterment, they
[28:15.160 --> 28:23.440]  will then go on the news and lie about it, they'll say oh Alex Jones is insane, he believes
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.680]  there's a plan to get rid of the population, that crazy guy thinks we're putting stuff
[28:27.680 --> 28:36.640]  in the water, and they attack us all, that's like mainstream news still writes articles
[28:36.640 --> 28:41.960]  saying I'm lying that Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones and Bilderberg don't exist,
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.120]  while simultaneously other big publications say yeah there's a super class and we run
[28:47.120 --> 28:50.760]  things and there's a world government, it's authoritarian, but it's a good authoritarian,
[28:50.760 --> 28:57.440]  you know it's for your own good, so see a lot of these minions revel, I mean they may
[28:57.440 --> 29:03.320]  only be making $80,000 a year as a professor, but it's the peer pressure, it's that they're
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.560]  part of an accepted group, that they sit around and go ffff, and thousands of their
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.120]  minutes are public, it's sad, I know killing everybody is a little upsetting and I'm even
[29:14.120 --> 29:20.240]  ready to go when my time comes, these are actual quotes from Pianca, and it just has
[29:20.240 --> 29:25.160]  to be done, like what did Jacques Cousteau say right before he died, he said it's horrible
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.240]  to say that 365,000 people have to be killed today to save the earth, but it's even more
[29:30.240 --> 29:37.360]  horrible not to say it, and it's like oh we've got to kill everybody, gee, and we've got
[29:37.360 --> 29:43.560]  to lie to them, we can't upset the wild humans, we're the big egg heads and we know best,
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.880]  we've got to keep it from them just long enough till we're ready to launch the bio-attack,
[29:47.880 --> 29:51.080]  stay with us.
[29:51.080 --> 30:00.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:28.520 --> 33:29.520]  gonna stay out here.
[33:29.520 --> 33:32.720]  They watched you post this reporting that they're gonna try to give forced inoculations
[33:32.720 --> 33:36.480]  to every child in America.
[33:36.480 --> 33:44.680]  Coming up this winter when they fear monger about the swine flu again, yeah let's take
[33:44.680 --> 33:50.000]  inoculations that have killed people over and over again, the last two swine flu outbreaks
[33:50.000 --> 33:58.040]  in 1918 and 1976 both broke out at US military bases, we got a government that thousands
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.880]  of times admittedly has tested chemicals, biologicals and radiologicals on our own troops, killing
[34:02.880 --> 34:09.640]  them premeditatedly in many cases, this is a group that gave black men syphilis, let
[34:09.640 --> 34:17.720]  them die over 40 plus years, again, I just use some of the more popularly known examples.
[34:17.720 --> 34:25.360]  Yeah, let's go roll our sleeves up when the President's Science Advisor says we can put
[34:25.360 --> 34:31.960]  stuff in their food, water, vaccines to sterilize them, and suddenly people are coming down
[34:31.960 --> 34:36.720]  with all these cancers and brain disorders directly proven in many cases to be from the
[34:36.720 --> 34:46.280]  vaccines, oh, Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out over a million ampoules of factor
[34:46.280 --> 34:53.840]  eight filled every shot with live HIV and hepatitis, in fact, I want to play that next
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.560]  hour guys, we go to YouTube and just get it queued up, Bayer factor eight blood scandal,
[34:59.560 --> 35:08.920]  get it for you, there's a bunch of clips, get the MSNBC one with Mr. Scarborough, because
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.520]  people out there may not believe me but they'll believe him, and the reason I bring that
[35:14.520 --> 35:20.880]  up is they're killing us deader than hammers, they don't care about your life, in fact they
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.080]  see you as a negative, life isn't cheap to these people, life is a negative when it's
[35:26.080 --> 35:35.680]  almost sapien sapien, and I'm sorry you didn't wake up in Kansas folks, you woke up in hell
[35:35.680 --> 35:41.080]  and the sky's blue, the trees are green, it's a beautiful day out there, but monsters are
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.440]  lurking everywhere and it's called the government, and they've got a lot of well-meaning idiot
[35:46.440 --> 35:51.840]  bureaucrats and police and others who think they're the good guys and don't know they're
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.960]  working for psychopathic killers, now cops are you smart enough to decompartmentalize
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.400]  and look around you at the big picture because let me tell you, they're putting the stuff
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.560]  in your water too buddy boy, you can sit there and laugh all day but I wouldn't laugh with
[36:05.560 --> 36:12.480]  your own life, I swear on my honor, I swear on my children, I swear on my eternal soul,
[36:12.480 --> 36:21.120]  I'm telling you the truth, if I'm lying about this, well they say you're not supposed to
[36:21.120 --> 36:27.480]  attempt God, but the issue is I'm telling you the truth ladies and gentlemen, and there's
[36:27.480 --> 36:32.400]  no doubt God has sent me and plenty of other great people, I'm just some loudmouth but
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.320]  I'm here doing a decent job I think, to give you a warning and let you know what's going
[36:37.320 --> 36:42.200]  on, now you can buy the delusion, you can buy the illusion, people get into being ignorant,
[36:42.200 --> 36:48.160]  it's almost like it's a moral value, a positive thing to be idiotic, to be shallow, to be
[36:48.160 --> 36:54.120]  uninformed, to not care, I listen to talk radio, it's either left wing or right wing,
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.480]  compartmentalize, playing us off against each other, divide and conquer or more and more
[36:58.480 --> 37:05.320]  radio is programming towards mindless gibbering, now because conservative shows can't talk
[37:05.320 --> 37:13.320]  about sex and strippers and sex shows on radio, I'm hearing a lot of formerly conservative
[37:13.320 --> 37:18.120]  shows just kind of go off into mindless diversions entertainment and I even hear program directors
[37:18.120 --> 37:24.560]  and see articles written by consultants saying, oh let's shift into, because things are bad
[37:24.560 --> 37:27.920]  in the economy and the entertainment, so I listen to local radio and they're talking
[37:27.920 --> 37:36.120]  about dirty sex acts this morning on conservative news stations and giggling and laughing and
[37:36.120 --> 37:47.040]  it's bad to care about issues and it's weird to be informed, listen to me, grow up men,
[37:47.040 --> 37:53.560]  I know it's scary to admit that there is a group running the government on a planetary
[37:53.560 --> 38:00.640]  scale, they're mopping up the last few stand out standalone countries right now, government's
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.960]  always bad in history, yeah the moulas are terrible but they're sure not putting sterilization
[38:04.960 --> 38:10.720]  hormones in their water, they're mopping up the last few countries that aren't under
[38:10.720 --> 38:16.120]  globalist control, you know what Muammar Gaddafi had to do for the CIA to stop trying to overthrow
[38:16.120 --> 38:24.560]  him with MI6 on record, he had to let the world health organization in to take over
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.320]  health operations in Libya and then it came out, they're giving them HIV filled shots
[38:29.320 --> 38:35.160]  and you'll have entire hospitals where they vaccinate kids and all the kids get HIV, that's
[38:35.160 --> 38:39.920]  in the news, mainstream news, I mean this is, you see when you submit your people to
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.800]  death, the new water leaves you alone, China said hey we'll kill our population, we'll
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.880]  kill babies, we'll have one-shot policies, we'll let you in certain cities test chemicals
[38:49.880 --> 38:55.600]  and biologicals in the water, I talked to a top computer programmer who's involved
[38:55.600 --> 39:00.000]  mid-level with the Republican Party, he agreed to come on and then backed out and got scared,
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.400]  I've known him for more than 12 years and he said he'd been doing contracts in Singapore
[39:05.400 --> 39:12.280]  and that they test drugs in the water on a neighborhood by neighborhood, the government's
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.560]  doing that, that Singapore is the real test ground along with China, I've got government
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.320]  documents that mention that but here he was saying he worked on programs right beside
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.040]  those programs, he said yeah I'll come on, do you want to hint to who he is, he was
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.560]  on the show many years ago, he won't come on about it now and he won't even talk to
[39:31.560 --> 39:36.560]  me, I think he got threatened but the issue here is they're putting stuff in your water
[39:36.560 --> 39:43.160]  and if you think that's cute and funny, if you like all these well-meaning, trusting
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.680]  people that see the TV and radio ads and go out and get their flu shots every year and
[39:47.680 --> 39:51.040]  you meet 45, 50 year old people that take their flu shots that can't remember their
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.320]  name and are already basically biological robots that have been given chemical lobotomies,
[39:56.320 --> 40:04.640]  I mean it isn't funny folks, I go to the grocery store, I go to the gym, I was at the gym yesterday
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.600]  and there were probably 15 people in the gym working out, it was a small neighborhood
[40:09.600 --> 40:18.280]  gym and two different groups came in with people on walkers who were no more than 25
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.680]  years old, both of them separately and I just couldn't control myself, I ignored one woman,
[40:24.680 --> 40:29.440]  I was about to go up and say did this happen after you took shots or when did this happen
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.120]  or what's wrong with you, all these different disorders they meet out and I controlled myself
[40:34.120 --> 40:37.680]  and did but when I was done one of them was going out of the parking lot so I just walked
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.120]  over to her car and I asked her when did all this happen, she said I was about 20,
[40:42.120 --> 40:48.400]  do you have any idea what did it and no there's no history of my family and I said did you
[40:48.400 --> 40:52.240]  have a seizure after you had some vaccines and they started getting tears in her eyes
[40:52.240 --> 40:56.800]  and she said I've heard about that, they say that could be it and then she rolled the
[40:56.800 --> 41:02.200]  wind up and started crying and drove off, I am literally, oh my God I can't handle
[41:02.200 --> 41:08.640]  it anymore, it's almost like even doing this show lessens it, just even calmly talking
[41:08.640 --> 41:14.560]  about it, we should be in sackcloth begging God for forgiveness everywhere in sit-ins
[41:14.560 --> 41:18.080]  just chanting at the government facilities we know you're killing us, we know you're
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.720]  killing us, we know you're killing us, I mean they're all on record, it's total insanity,
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.880]  it's going on everywhere and the men are all a bunch of, with their chest sticking out
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.520]  acting tough but think that it's cool to be ignorant and not involved, men are supposed
[41:33.520 --> 41:41.120]  to protect their women and children, men are supposed to be informed and aware and involved
[41:41.120 --> 41:50.000]  and I'm not on some high horse here, I'm not even that special of a person, that's what
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.080]  I don't understand, I mean I've got thousands of government documents, we cover scores
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.240]  of them every week, government textbooks, policy reports, I'm about to go to your calls
[41:58.240 --> 42:06.760]  I know I said I would, it's like last year I went on air and I said I remember seeing
[42:06.760 --> 42:14.760]  a textbook that they use in Texas over a decade ago where it said the family belongs to the
[42:14.760 --> 42:21.080]  age of barbarism and is a disease and then I even remember the name of the textbook Calhoun
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.320]  Reader and then nobody believed me, I got all these emails saying I was a liar because
[42:24.320 --> 42:30.320]  I couldn't find the textbook, I mean I've got like four storage sheds now full of books
[42:30.320 --> 42:36.320]  and documents and videos just rotting out in the heat but the prison planet forum people
[42:36.320 --> 42:44.760]  found just scores, I know it was more than 50 textbooks and links and scans and articles
[42:44.760 --> 42:48.880]  and statements with the families of disease, we've got to get rid of it, it's horrible,
[42:48.880 --> 42:55.200]  we've got to break it up, we've got to get rid of it, it's terrible.
[42:55.200 --> 43:01.360]  And then I randomly walk up last week and grab an Atlantic Monthly with the idea to
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.960]  just see what was in it off the Barnes and Noble shelf and it's got an article in here
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.880]  saying get rid of marriage, it's bad and the whole thing is about global carbon taxes
[43:11.880 --> 43:19.800]  and chemtrailing, how chemtrailing may save the earth and then today there's an article
[43:19.800 --> 43:26.000]  in the New York Times attacking, having children and families and saying it's bad, be selfish,
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.440]  don't get married, don't have kids called, does having children make you happy?
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.880]  Folks, I'm not even looking in this and I'm drowning in it, I'm not even looking for it,
[43:34.880 --> 43:41.240]  it's everywhere, it's a total cult, they run almost everything, they love it, they love
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.480]  the power trip that they're on the inside and know about the plan to sterilize everybody
[43:45.480 --> 43:46.480]  and kill everybody.
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.880]  And let me tell you, when you get around these professors and these globalists, they only
[43:51.880 --> 43:58.040]  eat organic, they only drink highly filtered water, reverse osmosis are distilled, they're
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.280]  all obsessed with it and they sit there with pleasure watching everyone being poisoned
[44:03.280 --> 44:04.820]  and get off on it.
[44:04.820 --> 44:15.400]  These are the ultimate criminals against humanity, they are sickening degenerate filth.
[44:15.400 --> 44:20.760]  Don't take their vaccines, don't drink their water and don't eat their processed food and
[44:20.760 --> 44:28.000]  understand the head technologies are of the entire country, wrote a government textbook
[44:28.000 --> 44:34.280]  proposing how to carry out a planetary government to take your children and to sterilize them
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.120]  and how to put it in your water and food and how to put implants in you to control you.
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.680]  It's 1100 pages, we got it posted up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[44:43.680 --> 44:48.600]  Now it was posted Saturday, Paul's doing another article but we need to repost the original
[44:48.600 --> 44:56.120]  up on prisonplanet infowars on the main page with the title of it, the title of the article
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.720]  where you can then go read the book for yourself is Obama Science Advisors called for planetary
[45:02.720 --> 45:08.000]  regime to enforce the talentarian population control measures.
[45:08.000 --> 45:15.240]  And as of this morning, if you Google the name of this bastard John Holdren and click
[45:15.240 --> 45:20.360]  Google news, Paul watched the story is the number one link, meaning it's gotten the most
[45:20.360 --> 45:22.120]  hits and views.
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.200]  World Ent Daily has copied us, another story on it, I'm glad, good job.
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.920]  We're sitting to source us and they made it a front page magazine issue about how it's
[45:29.920 --> 45:31.680]  the left that wants to do this.
[45:31.680 --> 45:34.240]  It's system wide.
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.560]  See, if we just blame the left for being a bunch of murdering eugenicists, we don't stop
[45:39.560 --> 45:40.560]  it.
[45:40.560 --> 45:46.080]  It's both parties, Nixon was heavy into it, Bush senior, the last Bush, Clinton.
[45:46.080 --> 45:55.120]  It doesn't matter, Tory, labor, it doesn't matter, social democrat in Germany or conservative
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.520]  or socialist, it doesn't matter what party.
[45:58.520 --> 46:03.200]  There's only one country I know of that isn't part of this and I know they're corrupt and
[46:03.200 --> 46:05.080]  bad and do a lot of bad stuff.
[46:05.080 --> 46:09.320]  There's one country that publicly admits this is going on and says they're not part of it,
[46:09.320 --> 46:15.560]  but they do it quietly and they pay people to have children and that's Russia.
[46:15.560 --> 46:19.720]  And they've got news articles and reports saying the communists were paid by foreign
[46:19.720 --> 46:26.480]  banks to sterilize the Russian people just like China and North Korea and now they pay
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.920]  you to get married and have kids and they have big mass public weddings and they even
[46:32.920 --> 46:39.680]  have mass breeding parties, which is something Hitler did and it's somewhat immoral but it's
[46:39.680 --> 46:47.160]  better than the entire group dying and Russia has mass breeding events now because they're
[46:47.160 --> 46:50.120]  standing up.
[46:50.120 --> 46:54.440]  My God, when Russia is the only thing with half a grain of sanity, I don't know what
[46:54.440 --> 46:59.840]  we're going to do, God, I don't know what we're going to do, God.
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.680]  Listen you stupid liberal getting your Starbucks coffee, acting smart, think you know it all
[47:04.680 --> 47:09.000]  with your carbon credit sticker on the back of your car saying, my car is offset by carbon
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  credits.
[47:10.000 --> 47:15.000]  Listen, jackass, they're killing your kid, they're killing you, it isn't cute, it isn't
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  funny.
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.080]  Now maybe you haven't been let in on the full story, you just know, well of course there's
[47:19.080 --> 47:24.200]  too many people, yes, according to your worldview, that's a fact it isn't, but you're being
[47:24.200 --> 47:26.800]  hit by it too dummy.
[47:26.800 --> 47:30.440]  Don't you love your little child more, you're shooting up with the cancer viruses, more
[47:30.440 --> 47:35.280]  than you love your phony environmental crud, it has nothing to do with the environment.
[47:35.280 --> 47:41.920]  All right, I said I was getting to this next hour, I could talk for 20 hours on this, I
[47:41.920 --> 47:48.960]  can't sleep over this and then I find a government textbook written by the science are that lays
[47:48.960 --> 47:53.760]  out everything we reverse engineered word for word.
[47:53.760 --> 47:58.680]  Now get this straight, I'm not tooting my horn when I say I reverse engineered this.
[47:58.680 --> 48:01.720]  There's thousands of government documents and reports and statements and they all say
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.920]  the same thing and they've all proposed it, but they do it in a piece here, a piece there.
[48:07.920 --> 48:11.480]  This is all in one textbook.
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.760]  The next best thing to see the whole picture is the 1996 biological diversity assessment
[48:15.760 --> 48:23.800]  officially passes law and policy by the United Nations.
[48:23.800 --> 48:26.760]  That's got it all too, but it's only 91 pages.
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.120]  This thing is 1100 pages and I've only gotten through 200 and something because I'm busy
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.200]  trying to make a film, do radio shows, and I'm fighting as hard as I can ladies and gentlemen,
[48:36.200 --> 48:37.960]  this is real.
[48:37.960 --> 48:42.600]  Cops, you're running around being told fear for your life from gun owners and veterans
[48:42.600 --> 48:43.600]  and conservatives.
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.560]  Meanwhile, we got a bunch of control freak scientific dictators as they call themselves,
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.760]  running things that openly say in thousands of quotes and books and documents that they're
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.400]  putting crap in our water and food and air and we've caught them doing it.
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.040]  They're killing you too.
[48:59.040 --> 49:01.720]  They're probably, listen, they don't like me covering this.
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.600]  I'm risking my life telling you this stuff folks and doing it with a large platform,
[49:05.600 --> 49:06.600]  but I don't care.
[49:06.600 --> 49:07.600]  I care about humanity more.
[49:07.600 --> 49:10.200]  I know the species lives on.
[49:10.200 --> 49:14.280]  I'm more worried about innocent people being killed and children being enslaved and people
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.080]  being forcibly sterilized than I am about getting killed and people call that heroic.
[49:19.080 --> 49:24.280]  That's called basic human spirit because I know I'm going to grow old and die folks.
[49:24.280 --> 49:27.560]  I only care about my children and their grandchildren and everybody else's kids.
[49:27.560 --> 49:28.800]  I care about the species.
[49:28.800 --> 49:32.840]  I realize I'm a flash in the pan, but the species lives forever.
[49:32.840 --> 49:34.560]  You know that quote from Full Metal Jacket?
[49:34.560 --> 49:37.200]  We don't try to find it and play it.
[49:37.200 --> 49:41.040]  I don't know the exact quote, but you may go to war.
[49:41.040 --> 49:44.680]  You may die, but the Marine Corps lives forever.
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.760]  Well, that's a mere shadow of a human instinct you already know and understand.
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.320]  I am going to die, ladies and gentlemen, but I don't want our species being seized by a
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.480]  bunch of transhumanist technocrats to play God.
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.080]  That's what they say they're doing, to manipulate and change our species as they see fit and
[50:00.080 --> 50:04.960]  cull the majority of us so a bunch of selfish bastards get to go forward into future and
[50:04.960 --> 50:07.560]  the rest of us don't, a bunch of psychos get to go forward.
[50:07.560 --> 50:13.600]  They call that evolution and then wall us off from, from, from the future.
[50:13.600 --> 50:16.260]  And I mean, it's a heartable crime.
[50:16.260 --> 50:21.360]  And so let me tell you, it is not a, it is not a sacrifice if I get killed in this.
[50:21.360 --> 50:28.120]  It is an honor and a, and a great blessing.
[50:28.120 --> 50:29.680]  This is what I was born for.
[50:29.680 --> 50:33.640]  What you were born for is to stand up for the tribe, stand up for the human species,
[50:33.640 --> 50:37.800]  to love the species and reach for the stars.
[50:37.800 --> 50:41.640]  And listen, all the blood that was spilt into the ground of our forefathers for liberty
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.680]  and freedom, it is, it beats in us right now in our hearts.
[50:45.680 --> 50:51.000]  I am those founding fathers and so are you.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.360]  I am Andrew Jackson and so are you.
[50:53.360 --> 50:54.360]  So they kill me.
[50:54.360 --> 50:55.360]  It doesn't matter.
[50:55.360 --> 51:02.600]  As long as the species goes on, I live on in, in my brethren to come.
[51:02.600 --> 51:03.760]  That's sound.
[51:03.760 --> 51:07.640]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in pill form, that's exactly where many are
[51:07.640 --> 51:08.640]  ending up.
[51:08.640 --> 51:11.280]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[51:11.280 --> 51:16.320]  According to the physicians desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.680]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, that's $90 you're flushing down the toilet.
[51:21.680 --> 51:25.360]  In fact, orderlies at hospitals call these bedpan bullets.
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.920]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow, introducing chews for health, a delicious
[51:29.920 --> 51:35.480]  tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, seed vegetables and antioxidants.
[51:35.480 --> 51:38.120]  Stop paying for nutrients your body doesn't use.
[51:38.120 --> 51:43.480]  Order chews for health today, 1-800-210-1922.
[51:43.480 --> 51:48.880]  The first 300 callers will receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced
[51:48.880 --> 51:49.880]  Diet.
[51:49.880 --> 52:01.120]  Every time you stop flushing your vitamins down the toilet, 1-800-210-1922 or go to orderchews.com.
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.480]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[52:06.480 --> 52:12.560]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[52:12.560 --> 52:14.520]  just as well funded.
[52:14.520 --> 52:19.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[52:19.640 --> 52:20.640]  of the American people.
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.520]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.600]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[52:30.600 --> 52:37.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[52:37.120 --> 52:40.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[52:40.680 --> 52:47.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.

[53:00.520 --> 53:04.500]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[53:04.500 --> 53:07.440]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[53:07.440 --> 53:11.480]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[53:11.480 --> 53:12.480]  or gold?
[53:12.480 --> 53:15.840]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[53:15.840 --> 53:18.040]  possible that could even happen again.
[53:18.040 --> 53:22.600]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[53:22.600 --> 53:23.600]  seeds.
[53:23.600 --> 53:28.520]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.400]  food for you and your family.
[53:30.400 --> 53:34.200]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[53:34.200 --> 53:38.200]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[53:38.200 --> 53:43.880]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[53:43.880 --> 53:55.520]  a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365, remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[53:55.520 --> 53:57.240]  are the ultimate barter item.
[53:57.240 --> 54:23.720]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[54:23.720 --> 54:27.720]  How many times has the government lied to you, how many evil things have they been
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.000]  caught doing, how many times did I tell you they want a planetary government to carry
[54:31.000 --> 54:37.160]  out our orderly extermination, and here's Obama's technologies are offering a government
[54:37.160 --> 54:43.560]  textbook for PhD and above of how to do it.
[54:43.560 --> 54:48.080]  They mean business, and they are doing it, they are attacking you physically right now
[54:48.080 --> 54:49.080]  on record.
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.960]  Now, if you want to get upset about that, I think that's the thing to do.
[54:52.960 --> 54:58.120]  If you want to call me a conspiracy theorist and stick your thumb in your mouth, my God,
[54:58.120 --> 54:59.120]  you got a problem.
[54:59.120 --> 55:00.120]  That's all I can say.
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.120]  Bill in Vegas and everybody else, Bill, thanks for holding her on the air.
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[55:05.120 --> 55:08.360]  You risk your life and you do what you do so that Americans and their children can live
[55:08.360 --> 55:10.480]  in a free society with liberty.
[55:10.480 --> 55:13.720]  You and Thomas Jefferson are my greatest heroes, you're the greatest patriot walking
[55:13.720 --> 55:14.720]  the planet.
[55:14.720 --> 55:15.720]  No, you are.
[55:15.720 --> 55:18.440]  Again, look, I'm just trying to survive, and I want to explain something.
[55:18.440 --> 55:20.960]  This isn't even about keeping our liberties now.
[55:20.960 --> 55:21.960]  This is about surviving.
[55:21.960 --> 55:25.640]  If they get this planetary government in, they're going to start having larger soft
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.160]  kill weapon releases, manufactured flues and things.
[55:29.160 --> 55:34.080]  This flu thing is just a drill to test their globalization, federalization to carry out
[55:34.080 --> 55:35.600]  the kill-op.
[55:35.600 --> 55:36.800]  All this is a test.
[55:36.800 --> 55:37.800]  Go ahead.
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.320]  Well, I also had the privilege of meeting both Ron Paul and Adam Kokish at the Freedom
[55:42.320 --> 55:43.960]  Fest last week.
[55:43.960 --> 55:45.520]  I was wishing you would be there.
[55:45.520 --> 55:51.000]  I know you couldn't, but I did manage to meet the local chapter of the 9-11 group, and
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  there's only a couple of members.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.040]  I was hoping if I could shout out my email to anyone listening in Vegas, if they want
[55:56.040 --> 56:04.840]  to join us, please email me at BillyBones51athotmail.com, BillyBones51athotmail.com, and let's get
[56:04.840 --> 56:05.840]  some together.
[56:05.840 --> 56:09.920]  Beginning last summer, I'd been going mostly by myself with my microphone, portable amp
[56:09.920 --> 56:15.440]  and flyers, talking about 9-11 and the elites, and other than being beaten up by Neocons
[56:15.440 --> 56:20.120]  once or twice and the sheeple, not caring at all about what I'm saying, the police never
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.640]  really hassled me other than telling me to turn my mic off.
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.920]  They once actually defended my First Amendment right against the Neocon.
[56:26.920 --> 56:30.440]  Do you think it would be smart, though, to write a respectable letter of intent maybe
[56:30.440 --> 56:37.760]  to the police chief, telling him of my intentions just in case and also informing him of oathkeepers
[56:37.760 --> 56:38.760]  in a respectable way?
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.760]  Do you think that would be smart?
[56:40.760 --> 56:41.760]  Sure.
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.200]  I mean, it's always important to stand up, and you should get some support and people
[56:45.200 --> 56:47.840]  to stand with you, so I hope folks will check out your email.
[56:47.840 --> 56:54.640]  Take care, Bill, speaking of action, 9-11 Truth, We Are Change, all these other groups
[56:54.640 --> 56:59.640]  are confronting Biden and Obama and senators and Congress people everywhere.
[56:59.640 --> 57:09.360]  I'm seeing amazing videos every day now where citizens are getting active and handing out
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.200]  the Obama deception and other films and taking action, and I just salute you.
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.760]  That is that spirit of taking action and knowing it's going to have an effect and having faith
[57:18.760 --> 57:22.440]  in your actions, it's going to bring down the New World Order.
[57:22.440 --> 57:28.120]  You know, I didn't go to the Kansas City Liberty meeting.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.800]  I didn't go to the Minnesota ones.
[57:29.800 --> 57:36.040]  I didn't go to the Las Vegas ones because it would become a distraction and a diversion
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.920]  if I was there.
[57:40.920 --> 57:46.240]  Now let's face it, Ron Paul is kind of the doorway into reality.
[57:46.240 --> 57:48.920]  He doesn't get into a lot of the really hardcore issues like eugenics.
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.360]  You know, there's a lot of Ron Paul supporters out there who were mainline Republicans and
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.760]  Democrats who, like Ron Paul's message, that's pretty much milk-toes compared to mine.
[57:58.760 --> 57:59.760]  It's a great message.
[57:59.760 --> 58:02.120]  It's just, it's the doorway.
[58:02.120 --> 58:07.120]  It's not the big secret in the side that we've got psychopathic killers running things
[58:07.120 --> 58:08.120]  that want to kill everybody.
[58:08.120 --> 58:10.920]  Now, I've read some of his writings in the 80s.
[58:10.920 --> 58:18.480]  Ron Paul knew this back then, but, you know, Ron Paul is trying to have a mass appeal and
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.560]  so I'm not going to get a lot done going to a big Ron Paul event.
[58:21.560 --> 58:27.640]  You can go and give my films out materials, but there's probably 20, 30% of people that
[58:27.640 --> 58:34.240]  are at those events that see me and it's just horrifying to them because, see, they're cowards,
[58:34.240 --> 58:35.880]  some of the mainline Ron Paul supporters.
[58:35.880 --> 58:40.120]  I don't know just how serious this stuff is.
[58:40.120 --> 58:46.680]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[58:46.680 --> 58:50.720]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[58:50.720 --> 58:55.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.120 --> 58:56.120]  this summer.
[58:56.120 --> 59:00.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.600]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:04.600 --> 59:05.840]  allows you to have.
[59:05.840 --> 59:06.840]  It's true.
[59:06.840 --> 59:11.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially
[59:15.560 --> 59:17.520]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[59:17.520 --> 59:21.080]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[59:21.080 --> 59:24.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[59:24.760 --> 59:29.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:29.280 --> 59:33.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.120]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[59:35.120 --> 59:42.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government
[59:42.680 --> 59:53.760]  doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[59:53.760 --> 1:00:05.040]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:09.840]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:10.840]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:13.040]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:21.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:28.240]  You know, I ended the last hour talking about a lot of people in the Liberty Movement, the
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:29.240]  Freedom Movement.
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:35.480]  Don't like the fact that I talk about eugenics and the global plan to exterminate the majority
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:41.520]  of the population, but see, you can't pick and choose reality.
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:45.880]  You can't say, oh, that sounds crazy, so I'm not going to look into it.
[1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:50.760]  Everything I've said has been completely validated in triplicate by the giant textbook
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:57.400]  that's now emerged, 1100 pages, written by one of George Bush's science advisors and
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.320]  Congress's science advisor.
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:03.880]  That's his co-author, his co-author.
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:11.520]  And then now, Obama's head of all science, the science art, John P. Holdren wrote a plan
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:15.680]  in 77, a textbook with another big neocon.
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:20.680]  It's bipartisan on how to carry out global extermination, how everyone's children will
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.720]  be CPS'd.
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:28.840]  By the psychologist, psychology, psychiatrist guild, who will then decide if your child's
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.400]  going to be sterilized or ever allowed to have children to be assessed, and if you're
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:34.880]  allowed to have your child on the weekends.
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:40.440]  These bastards are waging war on the family, and the New York Times has an article today
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:46.720]  about how horrible it is to have children, any children, because they know you owe allegiance
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:48.360]  to your family.
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:50.000]  They want you to owe allegiance to the state.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.800]  They want to take control of society and kill us.
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:54.600]  Do you expect me to talk?
[1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:56.960]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:57.960]  They want us to die.
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:00.080]  What do you want from us, New World Order?
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.600]  We want you dead.
[1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:03.680]  Well, now you know the fight.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:04.680]  No quarter.
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:10.680]  Toad-a-toe combat with a psychopathic dictatorship, a scientific dictatorship.
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:17.800]  And sucking your thumb and being in the Republican or Democratic politics, isn't gonna fix it.
[1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:20.080]  You understand me?
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:22.320]  Nick in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:30.160]  On fire, as usual, and deservedly so, I got a talking point I want to throw back at you,
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:33.600]  but first I have an old news story that's now relevant again, that's too important not
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:34.600]  to mention.
[1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:39.040]  I mentioned Mr. Burmese a month ago, and he actually popped on the article and sourced
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:40.040]  it.
[1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.480]  It was from Guardian UK, and you'll probably not be able to find it, because it's kind
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:43.480]  of buried, but it was from...
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:44.480]  Okay, whatever.
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:45.480]  What's it say?
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.480]  Yeah.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.160]  It was written by the actual...
[1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:53.680]  The vice president of Rothschild Group International, and it was, carbon credits could bring in
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.760]  a new world order, a sustainable new world order, and in the article he said he hoped
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:01.800]  that the carbon credits could actually replace gold as the world reserve currency.
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:02.800]  No, that was the big...
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.280]  There was a Dubai newspaper, and it was Lord Rothschild, and he said, we're gonna have a
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.800]  world government through the carbon tax and the carbon credits, and absolutely, that was
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.720]  in the Dubai newspaper, I forget the name of it.
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.240]  I think there was another one that was actually written by the VP of Rothschild Group, and
[1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:23.000]  it was in the Guardian, but I'll try to email to you, but anyway, I kind of wanted to do
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.240]  a talking point with you, just I was listening to the Friday episode with Tarpley and Chapman
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:31.240]  and all that, and it got me kind of fired up, and some of the reading I've been doing,
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:36.680]  like I started reading America's Secret Destiny the other day, and I'm really kind of confused
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:39.960]  out, so I'd like for you to kind of expound on this.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:43.120]  Where the disconnect, or in other words, what the hell happened?
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:46.960]  Where is the discrepancy between what's written on paper, as what these guys claim, and what
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:50.280]  our founding fathers went through, and knowing that they were connected to the masons and
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:51.280]  all that?
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:56.920]  Where is the disconnect between what they claim is like this global destiny for a world democratic
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:02.880]  federation of happy-dabby people, and then this murderous plot of just, you know...
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:07.480]  Well, they tell the local professors and the psychologists that it's a loving world government,
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:13.480]  you know, we've got to sterilize some people, but it's for the greater good, that's kind
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:17.560]  of outer-party propaganda that the outer-party members, you've got the proletariat, you've
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:22.880]  got the outer-party, that's what Winston Smith is part of in 1984, and then you've got the
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:27.800]  inner-party, and this is how the Nazis and the Soviets and others have operated, the
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:35.000]  Chikoms operate this way, you have an outer and an inner-party, and the inner-party is
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.520]  just, we're cold-blooded, ruthless, we want to kill everybody, so we have the live extension
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:43.000]  for ourselves, but how do they get the professors and the minions to go along with them?
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.120]  They tell them they're going to be part of that elite, and it's all just going to be
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:50.320]  a great utopia, with them wandering around in white togas, you understand?
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:56.760]  Yeah, no, and when you get into the higher-level documents, or even public, they're going to
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:59.080]  kill 99 percent.
[1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.280]  It's hardcore death.
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:01.280]  Hello, friends.
[1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:02.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:06.200]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:07.200]  important than ever.
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:10.200]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.880]  You'll never have to stand in a red line until you have your own bread.
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:17.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.280]  in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:22.560]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:26.880]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:30.600]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:32.720]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:37.920]  Call 1-800-409-5633, or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:44.280]  foods they have to offer.

[1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:50.440]  Look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:55.680]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:56.680]  Take action today.
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:00.440]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:00.440 --> 1:06:01.440]  Hello, friends.
[1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:04.600]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:06.600]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:12.200]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:15.240]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:19.360]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:20.360]  system diseases.
[1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:22.520]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:27.280]  The E. coli blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:29.040]  you and your family's drinking water.
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:33.800]  The E. coli blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:39.320]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:40.320]  techniques.
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:41.320]  That's right.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:43.560]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:48.200]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:58.240]  That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit E. coli blue on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today.
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:04.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:08.680]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:09.680]  do you want?
[1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:15.200]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:16.680]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:17.920]  How much do you want?
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.000]  When do you want it?
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.960]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:22.080]  When will you need it?
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:25.560]  Will there be any food?
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.160]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:32.320]  and be immunized?
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:40.920]  How much will you need?
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:41.920]  We don't know.
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:42.920]  How much do you want?
[1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:43.920]  All you can get.
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:44.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:48.160]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:55.640]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at www.efoodsdirect.com.
[1:07:55.640 --> 1:08:02.760]  And that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:09.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:12.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:19.560]  It is Monday, July 13, 2009, and the next two hours and 52 minutes were simulcasting the
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:21.560]  last three hours at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:27.680]  I want to thank everybody that are prisonplanet.tv members, they get to show live, streamed,
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:32.960]  and then also the Sunday show now, 4-6 p.m., we went into overdrive for 20 minutes last
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.800]  night covering eugenics.
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:39.280]  I know that we have Robert, Mark, Adam, Ryan, and many others that are holding.
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:46.120]  We're going to get to your calls 1-800-259-9231, but I want to get into eugenics.
[1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:50.400]  And more and more, I realize I'm going to have to found an organization.
[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:51.880]  I'm going to have to get members.
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:53.960]  We're going to have to start organizing.
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:55.160]  I've never wanted to organize.
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:57.320]  I never wanted to run for political office.
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:08:59.560]  I've never wanted to be a leader.
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:01.320]  But I've got a step up to the plate.
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:06.120]  I meant to make this as a big announcement, but I'll just let you know that when my new
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:10.400]  film's done and my book I'm working on is done, I'm going to shift gears, maybe even
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:16.280]  away from filmmaking, maybe away from everything, and just form organizations and groups, kind
[1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:22.120]  of like We Are Change or 9-11-Truth, but we need a 9-11-Truth or We Are Change to go
[1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:26.280]  out and talk about eugenics and give people their own quotes, their own documents and
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:28.440]  warn people they're poisoning your water.
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:31.480]  Here's their own statements from the head of the federal government.
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:35.720]  Here's the, here's the, I mean, ladies and gentlemen, we know they're doing it.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:39.800]  I mean, nothing else matters.
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:43.000]  You know, I can't go to a movie now.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.120]  I can't go out to eat now at a nice restaurant.
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  I can't even go with my children to swim in a spring or a local pool.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.600]  There are a lot of great springs here in central Texas.
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:01.760]  I can't go camping.
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:03.040]  I can't go see family.
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:04.640]  I can't do anything.
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:09.880]  All I can do is know they're poisoning the water in the air and killing us by design and
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:12.400]  the White House admits it.
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:14.840]  The White House had a technology.
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.240]  I mean, how do I go on and act like everything's normal?
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:19.640]  How do I go on and, oh yeah, they're killing us.
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:22.360]  Hey, just see the tennis match this weekend.
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.520]  I mean, I, I'm the normal one.
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:25.520]  I'm normal.
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:32.360]  And I got the Wall Street Journal and Psychology Today and other foreign magazines and newspapers
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:36.680]  call me or they show up here and I'm giving them government documents about the plans
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:38.640]  to exterminate us and they just don't even look at them.
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:42.960]  Oh, I don't believe that.
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:44.480]  This isn't a radio show.
[1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:50.040]  This isn't about having fun and being an entertainer and, and, and, and up here getting attention
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:52.400]  and, and, and being the big radio guy.
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:11:01.000]  There was a little bit of that when I started out 14 years ago in 1995.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.400]  All of that worldliness has burned away.
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:07.360]  Sometimes I try to get in a good mood and have fun because I'm human and I'm embarrassed.
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:09.760]  I'm embarrassed when I make fun of somebody.
[1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:12.400]  I'm embarrassed when I get off into a side issue.
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:15.720]  I catch myself up here screwing around at night when I'm working on a film because it's
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.400]  hard to work 16, 17, 18 hours and stay serious.
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:24.080]  And I'll be, I'll look at my watch and for 30 minutes we start shooting the, shooting
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:30.360]  the bull about women or fishing or hunting and I catch myself watching Brock Lesnar in
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:35.560]  there, you know, on a rip off the web twice and watching deer hunting videos and I look
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:40.400]  up in an hour's pass and I'm like, Oh, I better go fight the new world order.
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:47.280]  So I understand you want to divert and distract and not face this and not deal with it.
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:50.200]  I understand that you want to have a life.
[1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:51.840]  I'm sorry.
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:58.280]  We're not going to fix this till people make this important and put it front and center.
[1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:03.120]  What I'm saying is people have been trained to kind of accept highways and roads and lights
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:10.200]  and power and computers and clothes and devices as if they just grow on trees.
[1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:14.480]  And as if nobody's steering the world and you, and that you just react to the world
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:18.560]  as a spectator and that you just kind of go through life and drive your car and go to
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:22.160]  the grocery store and go home and take care of your kids and family and go out and have
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:23.160]  fun.
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:24.160]  And it's kind of like a wonderland.
[1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:25.320]  It isn't a wonderland.
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.040]  They're building FEMA camps all around us.
[1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:28.680]  They're openly saying they want to kill us.
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:34.760]  They're openly setting up a police state, and I'm going to go over the next hour with
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  Paul Watson.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.720]  Then we've got a guest coming on in the next hour with some big breaking news on 9-11.
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.320]  And then she had her griffons coming on as well.
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:45.680]  I'll get him to talk about eugenics and a host of other issues.
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:48.400]  He's been fighting for 45 years, a great icon in the Liberty Movement.
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:51.760]  So that's the last hour today, joining us from his home in California.
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:57.280]  But right now for this hour and a little bit into the next, Paul Joseph Watson, because
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:04.400]  he can calmly and collectively go over his detailed 18-page report within screenshots
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:08.160]  and links to the book itself, go read the book.
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:11.040]  We don't just put a text version up there because people will deny it.
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:18.160]  Here is his textbook written by him that he co-authored with Bush's, one of Bush's favorite
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:27.680]  technology people, and everything we claim in this article is footnoted.
[1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:30.200]  And so Paul Watson's now going to go over this.
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:32.560]  And let me explain something, folks.
[1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:35.960]  When I start griping and complaining about Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson's death's
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:47.000]  second biggest story of century, not the million-dead Iraqis, not 9-11, not global financial meltdown,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:53.560]  not the Beijing Olympics, not Hurricane Katrina, not Pope John Paul II dying, not the tsunami,
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:14:00.960]  but Michael Jackson dying, that's why this is sick.
[1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:03.320]  That's why this is sick, folks.
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:08.160]  When I get up here and I talk about diversions and distractions, I mean, it is insane.
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:15.080]  They on record, here's just one point of thousands, and this is why my head spins.
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:19.680]  I have seen a whole bunch of mainstream news articles from Reuters and AP and others, AP
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:24.720]  every year does this detailed report where they test the water of over 100 major cities.
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:32.160]  And Dallas and Las Vegas and LA and other major cities had higher levels of Prozac type
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:37.600]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other drugs in it, as well as birth control, female birth
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:43.320]  control hormone, then was physically possible from runoff and sewage.
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.040]  And then they've done other studies, and they don't say what this means in the article,
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:50.080]  though it's clear, two plus two, and then they don't tell you the answer.
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:51.880]  You know it's four.
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:56.880]  That aquifers and water supplies and even small town supplies that don't have runoff
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:03.440]  going into it have the female hormones for sterilization, for birth control.
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:06.560]  That's what they give you is the hormone, the pregnancy hormone, the hormone that says
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:07.560]  I'm pregnant.
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:10.160]  It's a combo of those, and the woman doesn't have babies.
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:13.280]  It's not a sterilization, it's a blocking.
[1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:15.440]  They're putting that in there, and they're putting Prozac in.
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:21.040]  Then I can show you the Japanese government, just on this one subject for hours saying
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:24.600]  they want to put Prozac in the water.
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:28.960]  And then I can show you UN documents saying put Prozac in the water, and then movies like
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:35.800]  Serenity with Predictive Programming where the government puts the Prozac into the atmosphere.
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.840]  But then 1% have a side effect of turning into Revers.
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.280]  The issue is then I can show you how they're throwing in your face all over culture.
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:46.440]  I've got films from the 70s where they're talking about we're going to have a world
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:47.800]  government that exterminate the people.
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:53.160]  I can play you a 1967 David Bowie song where he's talking about openly how the elite want
[1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:57.120]  to exterminate us and sterilize us to control the future and control life extension.
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.440]  I mean, David Bowie knew this in 67.
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:01.600]  I'm not telling you some secret.
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.520]  This thing is all the elite talk about, all they do, world government is only the means
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:10.880]  to the end to carry out the extermination.
[1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:19.200]  And there's thousands of points, thousands of these points.
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:27.320]  I can go right down the line on every one of these points and I can back up every single
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:28.320]  issue I say.
[1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:32.480]  I can go on for 10 hours just on stuff in the water and where they've been caught doing
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:33.480]  it.
[1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:42.400]  Do you understand they're jacking your water with the Prozac, the basic Prozac molecule,
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:46.760]  a Prozac type drug.
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:50.880]  Do you understand they're putting hormones in it to sterilize you to block you being
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:51.880]  able to get pregnant?
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:56.800]  Do you understand they're doing this and this is what we know about.
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:00.560]  They're now saying they want to put statins in the drugs and make two year olds take statins
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:02.360]  which screw up your liver.
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.400]  Folks, this is real.
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:05.400]  Let's go to Paul Watson.
[1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:09.040]  Paul, I'm going to try to sit back and shut up and just write notes as you talk.
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.480]  But I want you to calmly, because I tend to go down rabbit trails at each point of this,
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:19.040]  go over this bastard, Paul Watson joining us from the United Kingdom, which is the command
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:22.840]  base and the foundation of the planetary eugenics movement.
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:23.840]  Paul Watson.
[1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:24.840]  Hello, Alex.
[1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:25.840]  Good to be back.
[1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:26.840]  Good to have you.
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:35.560]  Yeah, the main shocker that came out of the re-discovery of this book, Eco Science, written
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:44.240]  by Obama's top science and technology advisor in 77, and a book which Holdren is happy to
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:47.680]  be photographed with in his own library.
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:51.320]  We've got that picture on top of the article that we posted on Saturday.
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:54.440]  He's never backed away from the statements made in the book.
[1:17:54.440 --> 1:18:00.880]  I mean, that was the original claim that deniers tried to say, oh, this was 30 plus years
[1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:01.880]  ago.
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:05.560]  No, in his first press conference, he displayed it behind him.
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:08.560]  It's all by itself, right there in the shelf behind him.
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:09.560]  Oh, look.
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:10.560]  Oh.
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:15.560]  But people will, you know, they'll try to find a reason to deny it, because it is that
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:21.520]  shocking that when Front Page Magazine did a story about it back in February, it got
[1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:27.080]  basically no attention, because people didn't believe it, because they didn't have actual
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:30.680]  screenshots of the book and segments of the pages where it was written.
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:35.240]  Plus, David Horowitz is a neocon who calls for torture, and so he's so discredited and
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:38.160]  routinely attacks us that no one takes him serious.
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:40.600]  But when we broke it, it did get taken serious.
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:41.600]  Right.
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:46.080]  So if it's in Horowitz's publication, then it can be skewed into a left-right issue,
[1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:51.000]  which isn't the case, as you've said, because Republicans were involved in this as well,
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.960]  like George S. W. Bush.
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:59.520]  But the main shocker contained in Ecosine, from my perspective and from many people's
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:08.760]  perspective, I would guess, is the part where Holdren and his co-authors call for, propose
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:09.760]  the idea.
[1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:13.080]  Now, they're making these proposals, they're committing them to paper.
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:17.280]  The other thing I hear is, oh, just because they wrote about it doesn't mean they advocate
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:18.280]  them.
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:24.680]  But this book is a treatise, textbook-level, 1100-page battle plan.
[1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:31.200]  And it's putting forward proposals with which to carry out population reduction.
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:37.840]  These are proposals, the most shocking ones, adding a sterile into drinking water or staple
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:38.840]  food.
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:43.000]  And we'll get into why that is already happening right now.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.080]  Listen, if you're a black man, if you're a white man, if you're Hispanic, if you're
[1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:52.760]  Asian, if you're a cop, if you're a schoolteacher, all of you are being hit by these people.
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:55.640]  And then wonder why you have this idea in your mind that everybody knows there's too
[1:19:55.640 --> 1:19:57.880]  many people, everybody knows we've got to do this.
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:01.000]  You've been programmed and didn't even know it.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.080]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about graphunder safes.com, the makers of

[1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:06.400]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:12.600]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:14.600]  just as well funded.
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:19.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:20.760]  of the American people.
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:25.680]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:30.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:37.280]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.840]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:47.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:53.240]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:55.960]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:22:00.560]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:04.760]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:07.240]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:12.320]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:15.360]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:19.680]  Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing
[1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:23.600]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:27.360]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:28.520]  from Jekyll Island.
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.760]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:33.760]  power.
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:37.640]  It's a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:39.120]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:43.840]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:51.760]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[1:22:56.560 --> 1:23:00.440]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:04.040]  These have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:08.480]  to maintain good health, with so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:11.040]  buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:12.560]  The answer is simple.

[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:34.360]  Here's the London Independent today, Rockefeller Foundation.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:37.040]  Climate change will cause civilization to collapse.
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:41.560]  See, they've gotten us into a financial system where they own and control all the major modes
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:48.720]  of production, 90% or near it, it's like 87% of the western population.
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:55.000]  Everybody lives in urban areas and from Japan to the United States, so they can control
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.920]  us now.
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:58.400]  And they're going to collapse things.
[1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:02.560]  This is the IMF World Bank plan, and that's what we've got to do, is explain to people
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:06.160]  in an article, Paul Watson, and they're working on one today, for Prison Planet, not just
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:11.240]  that he's planning this or that it's the government textbook or all these other government documents.
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:15.240]  But the big issue here is, they're implementing this, they're carrying this out, the green
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:19.720]  carbon tax, they admit, and the IMF and World Bank documents admit, and I've heard them
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:25.800]  brag on NPR, this is not a secret that, oh, the plunging economy is good, this will help
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:28.040]  us have a smaller carbon footprint.
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:33.920]  I mean, I see that every day, in fact, I want to show listeners my mind.
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:39.280]  And by that, when I say something, I see it every day, Google, for everybody watching
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:45.440]  right now, bad economy, good for lowering carbon footprint.
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:51.000]  So, and then you can find articles where they say, oh, yes, we're imploding it to get your
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.360]  carbon footprint down, yes, to get you dependent on them, so they can really have their way
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:01.440]  with you with the CPS paramilitary police, which this bastard, Obama's head chief says
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:03.640]  he wants to do, and they're doing it.
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.160]  He didn't just write this decades ago, he's implementing all of this.
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.440]  All watching, go ahead.
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:15.480]  Right, and we just mentioned before the break, one of the proposals in the book is, quote,
[1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  adding a sterile into drinking water or staple foods.
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:25.280]  And it's explained that it must be quote, uniformly effective, but that it must not
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:28.560]  affect livestock.
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:34.600]  And so they're talking about mass sterilizing the public against their knowledge through
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:41.240]  the water supply, which is defined in the Nuremberg Code as a crime against humanity.
[1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:49.800]  Now fact is that global sperm counts have dropped by a third since 1989 and by half
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:51.600]  in the past 50 years.
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:55.680]  And that's global average whether or not running chemical attacks in third world.
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:00.760]  It's almost 90% in Europe and the United States, basically European men basically don't even
[1:27:00.760 --> 1:27:04.840]  have testicles for any intensive purposes now.
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:12.960]  Well, I've linked to studies in this new article, for example, why European men, the rate of
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:15.320]  decline is more, as you've just said.
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:24.040]  Now this study was related to Italian men and the rate of decline is 50% in the last
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:29.520]  30 years, so the sperm counts being reduced by 50% in the last 30 years.
[1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:34.880]  Now if you factor that in, it equates to a population reduction of the native population.
[1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:36.840]  We're not talking about immigration.
[1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:47.320]  A population reduction of the native population of 22% by 2050, so that's 22% population reduction.
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:50.920]  That's the fact that global sperm counts are dropping.
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:54.720]  They have been for 50 years and that's only accelerating.
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:03.080]  Now this is being blamed on a number of factors, mainly industrial and pharmaceutical factors
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:05.480]  which no doubt have contributed.
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:13.000]  You mentioned the HRT products and things like that, but the latest studies, one of which
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:22.160]  was done by the University of Exeter in England, tell us that they're finding new chemicals
[1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:25.240]  in the rivers, in the lakes, in the water supply.
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:33.760]  Now in England, this has had the effect of gender-bending male fish to the point where
[1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:41.440]  now in all British rivers and lakes, one-third of the fish population, the entire fish population
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:47.640]  throughout the country, has been feminized, one-third of the fish are now effectively
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:48.640]  female.
[1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:54.560]  In fact, they measured the fish population near the sewage works and the ones nearest
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:00.680]  to the sewage works, they found that 80% were now feminized, that female organs have been
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:01.680]  poised.
[1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:03.920]  And so it's what's being added to the water.
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:09.080]  The studies show this is at higher levels than what the regular consumption of women
[1:29:09.080 --> 1:29:12.120]  in birth control would be.
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:17.000]  And so clearly it's being added as the head of the White House Science says they want
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  to.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.080]  And these chemicals are called anti-androgen.
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:26.720]  Now these are the things that are given to transsexual men who want to become women.
[1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:29.880]  Remember what Holder said about, you know, no noticeable side effects.
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:34.560]  These are what are given to sex offenders released from prison to reduce their sexual
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:35.560]  libido.
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:36.560]  Yeah, stay there.
[1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:37.560]  Stay there.
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.720]  They have the effect of counteracting masculization.
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:40.720]  Stay there.
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:41.720]  Repeat that when we come back.
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:46.760]  And also the thousands of plastic formulas they could have adopted worldwide, they adopted
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:51.400]  the one formula that also sterilizes.
[1:29:51.400 --> 1:30:00.720]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:04.640]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:07.840]  in the Truth Movement for years, Inner Health Botanicals.
[1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:12.040]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[1:30:12.040 --> 1:30:13.960]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:19.240]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food, his editor's choice award, or
[1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:21.400]  best superfood of 2009.

[1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:05.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:06.200]  this summer.
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.120]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:14.680]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:15.920]  allows you to have.
[1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:21.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:27.600]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:31.160]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:34.840]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:31:34.840 --> 1:31:39.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:43.760]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long
[1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:45.160]  time sponsor of ours.
[1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:52.720]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government

[1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:11.480]  My friends, we're going to go back to Paul Watson a little bit in the next hour.
[1:33:11.480 --> 1:33:13.480]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[1:33:13.480 --> 1:33:23.480]  For those of you patiently holding, toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-2599-231.
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:27.040]  When people ask, how can I come in every day and start hyperventilating and always be so
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:29.880]  excited and always be so focused?
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:34.120]  It's completely normal when you have a criminal elite running things that are engaging in
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:40.080]  scientific dictatorship, spraying the atmosphere, poisoning the water and the food and admitting
[1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:41.320]  they're doing it.
[1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:44.360]  And then people say, I'm the weird one for not wanting that to happen.
[1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.720]  About to go back to Paul Watson.
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:51.560]  I tend to get so busy now, I'll do two, three, four hours, not even thank our sponsors.
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:56.520]  I do want to thank our sponsors and the biggest sponsor is my own books and videos.
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:33:58.360]  Like in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:02.960]  You want to know who the elite are, what they are and what their in-game is, what makes
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:03.960]  them tick?
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:09.480]  I mean, you watch this film, it's like his 1,100-page book.
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:12.680]  But from our perspective, you need to get the in-game.
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:14.120]  You need to have viewing parties.
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:16.740]  We need to hand the in-game out to everybody.
[1:34:16.740 --> 1:34:18.560]  We need to expose this.
[1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:23.080]  This is the big issue and to get through to the general public, you need to give them
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.760]  the Obama deception because this thing, it doesn't attack him from a right-wing perspective.
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:31.200]  It attacks George Bush and Obama and shows how they work for the same people, how it's
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:35.920]  a controlled paradigm and who they really work for and what their agenda is.
[1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:39.400]  And people are really freaking out now because this film came out one month after he was
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:43.720]  in office and now it's all been validated.
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:49.360]  So this film is going mega viral, get it, make copies, infowars.com, order a hard copy
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:57.240]  there or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:34:58.240]  You can also write to me.
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:07.440]  I'm Alex Jones at 3,001, South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:11.000]  You can also see all my films in super high quality and burn them to disk and download
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:16.120]  them and give them to folks at prisonplanet.tv as well as watching the live feed of the radio
[1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:17.640]  slash TV show.
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:23.600]  And lastly, I want to thank our longtime sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:26.320]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive.
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:30.360]  Our biggest sponsor, eFoodsDirect, is the longest continually operating affordable foods company
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:31.360]  in the country.
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:34.680]  They also have to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:39.640]  years with the looming food shortages, depression, war, the economy.
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:43.920]  It is imperative that you make sure you and your family are prepared with non-GMO, good,
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:44.920]  clean, affordable foods.
[1:35:44.920 --> 1:35:53.720]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or check them out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:59.120]  Non-GMO, non-hybrid, good quality, clean food, eFoodsDirect.com at a great price.
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:02.960]  All right, Watson, recap what you were saying about the water supply.
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:08.400]  They're clearly already doing this, but he also gets into a global police state of CPS
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:10.800]  to take everyone's kids.
[1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.440]  And then the New York Times today saying, families are bad.
[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:15.400]  I randomly pick up the Atlantic Monthly.
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:18.280]  It's got an article saying, families are bad.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:25.720]  The July, August, I mean, these people scientifically want to make us all wrecks so they can orderly
[1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:27.040]  kill our ass.
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:31.560]  They got to break down society first, then come in with fake terror for their police state
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:36.280]  cover story so they can run a black op on us, just like Dick Cheney said in Rebuilding
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:41.080]  America's Defenses about how he wanted to use race-specific bio weapons to kill certain
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:42.080]  racists.
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:45.640]  But they only tell the whites carrying this out, oh, we're just killing the blacks and
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:46.640]  Mexicans.
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:49.840]  No folks, they want to kill everybody but themselves.
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:50.840]  Paul Watson.
[1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:51.840]  Right.
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:57.000]  Well, you established the fact that global sperm counts have been reduced and that's accelerating
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:03.680]  and it's especially prevalent in white, European men, that's a fact.
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:09.080]  Now what's also a fact is that the University of Exeter along with the University of Sussex
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:18.280]  has done scientific studies earlier this year which produced the results that anti-androgens
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:23.800]  were being released into the water supply and this was above and beyond the concerns
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:31.480]  about HRT and contraceptive pills which are also affecting the environmental crisis.
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:38.560]  But these anti-androgens are used to treat sex offenders or given to sex offenders after
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:41.960]  they're released from prison to suppress their sexual libido.
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:48.240]  They're given to transsexual men who want to become women because what they do is they
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:56.240]  counteract the masculinization process and effectively diminish the normal male biological
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:57.240]  characteristics.
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:59.600]  They call them endocrine disruptors.
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.680]  And that's why a lot of cops, what they say over a third of cops are on steroids, a lot
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:09.280]  of them in a way actually need them I guess because we've all been feminized by this.
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:10.280]  Right.
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.720]  And it's also being sprayed on our food.
[1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:17.080]  They're used in pesticides, they're linked to another scientific study from the article
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:23.320]  that's at the top of prisonplanet.com now which shows that the same anti-androgens have
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:30.080]  been found to have demonstrated to induce demasculization in rats.
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:34.200]  Hold on a minute, hold on a minute, I actually saw a mainstream report on that last week
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:36.200]  and didn't even think to cover it.
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:38.040]  What you're saying is key here.
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:43.960]  They are picking chemical pesticides of a type that sterilize or reduce sperm count.
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:48.320]  I've seen those reports, that's what I'm saying, there's so much evidence just like
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:54.280]  of thousands of different plastic combinations for global standardization in the 50s, they
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:39:00.520]  picked a certain type of plastic family that leeches the endocrine disruptors, the estrogen
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:07.000]  mimickers which hyper-feminize women connected to breast cancer and a hormonal fluctuation
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:14.560]  and feminized men and then we actually see a lot of males now aren't even at age 12,
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:16.360]  13 having their testicles dropped.
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:20.720]  Most of the girls are going into puberty at five, six years old because of the food and
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.400]  the water and the boys are becoming feminine because of this and aren't even having their
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:30.320]  testicles literally like ovaries drop.
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:35.840]  This is just incredible, you're saying you've got a report up on prisonplanet.com, I guess
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:40.120]  you just already did your big report, Obama's plan to sterilize population through water
[1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:42.000]  supply already happening.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.040]  My God, this is mega huge, Watson and again people, we're risking our lives here, that's
[1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:51.640]  why I always have such excitement, I know what we're doing, we have caught these, oh
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:55.440]  my God, okay, you know what, I'm leaving the room, I'm not going to be able to shut up,
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:58.920]  I'm going to leave the room and watch from the control room, Watson you've got the floor,
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:03.680]  I've got to shut up, start over, this is huge breaking information, this is huge, Watson
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:04.680]  tell them.
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:11.960]  Yeah, these anti-androgens have not only been found in the water supply but according to
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:17.800]  this study which is the abstract of which is on encyclopedia.com and I have a link to
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:24.200]  it from the article on prisonplanet.com right now, actually a study from October 2001 so
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:29.680]  this has been known for some time now and you can, looks like it has to buy the actual
[1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:37.040]  full scientific study but it was in the environmental health perspective from October 1st, 2001
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:43.520]  and it says that the same anti-androgens have been found in pesticides and they test, which
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:49.920]  are sprayed on our food and they tested them on rats and they were quote, demonstrated
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:55.560]  to induce demasculization in rats so they're having the same effect that they are on the
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:41:05.200]  fish in the water and not only fish, polar bears, bald eagles, otters and whales have
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:13.480]  all been similarly affected by these gender-bending chemicals and there's problem not only in
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:16.560]  the UK but it's global.
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:24.760]  Now the professor at Exeter University having established that these chemicals are having
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:32.680]  gender-bending effects on fish and animals said quote, there is certainly the potential
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:37.280]  for it to have an effect in humans and possibly a marked effect.
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:42.880]  Professor Charles Tyler of Exeter University who is one of the country's leading authorities
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:49.720]  on the effects of estrogen so you tie that with the fact that global sperm count is reducing
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:55.840]  at an accelerating rate, especially amongst white, European males, there's a study that
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:00.560]  I've linked to from the article which talks about that as well.
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:06.360]  So these things are going into our water supply at an increasing rate above and beyond the
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:11.760]  normal pollutants from industry and pharmaceutical products.
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:21.280]  Now the ironic thing about all this as it was revealed in a March 2009 BBC country file
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:31.160]  documentary program is that the water authorities in England have these large industrial water
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:38.840]  filters which at the source of the sewage plants can filter out these very chemicals
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:44.360]  that are causing gender-bending effects and have devastated the fish population in the
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:45.560]  UK.
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:52.720]  They have the filters which can remove them and during one test in Derby which is not
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:59.000]  too far away from where I live they were found to successfully be able to remove these anti-angions
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:07.800]  but that test although successful was blocked from being rolled out nationwide and these
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:16.360]  large filters were prevented from being installed nationwide because of concerns about their
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:23.680]  carbon footprint and that they might contribute to global warming which is obviously the
[1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:33.440]  latest veil behind which Holdren and his eugenicist colleagues camouflaged their eugenicist agenda.
[1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:38.520]  So now because of concerns about global warming and carbon footprint the very filters that
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:44.960]  would eliminate these gender-bending chemicals which are a real environmental threat not
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:53.080]  only to the food supply and animals but also to humans as well is being blocked because
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:59.600]  people in control of the fake man-made climate change movements are protesting that they
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:05.640]  would harm the environment because they released some CO2 so the waters the lakes will continue
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:09.600]  to be poisoned by this gender-bending chemical.
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:14.320]  But see that's a religious statement now the globalists that set this up cold-bloodily
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:18.960]  don't believe it they know carbon dioxide but plants breathe but it's like oh you can't
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:24.200]  test the other water supplies that have the drugs in it that driving a car to the lake
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:32.120]  would release carbon you know see see this is their sick joke they practice mental illness
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:41.080]  to make everybody else basically feel crazy and confused this is so sick Watson and again
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:46.640]  I had that AP article where they found the drugs in our water supply of an even different
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:51.200]  type and a higher level than was possible from sewage runoff and they find it in water
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:58.040]  supplies that aren't connected to a water supply that's downstream or has any runoff
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:03.200]  they're finding it in aquifer water that's taken out and then sent to a treatment plant
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:07.720]  to have fluoride added they're adding it there so they're they're finding it in major city
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:15.080]  supplies that come from aquifers they're putting it in the water they're doing it and I'm
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:19.680]  looking at your article here on prisonplanet.com there are people in there attacking you saying
[1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:24.400]  how dare us not want to do this Paul we've got to get rid of the humans for the earth
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:30.720]  that's that's the wider issue Alex is the fact that you know the biggest battle is not
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:38.680]  convincing people that eugenicists like Holdren in positions of power advocating these positions
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:43.040]  you know nor even that they're actually might be carrying them out as is documented in this
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:50.440]  article the biggest battle is pointing out why mass sterilization of large sections of
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:56.800]  the population is wrong and you know why it would create an oppressive hyper fascist brave
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:05.360]  new world society because as you just mentioned I would say from my experience that most people
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:14.040]  agree with the top eugenicists that the useless eaters need to be sterilized without realizing
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:21.000]  that such programs would target everyone not just brown people not just people on welfare
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:25.840]  well that's because in movies and TV I mean half the science fiction movies I've seen
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:30.840]  or more will have a scene where why'd you join up for the military corps take starship
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:35.760]  troopers oh you gotta be a citizen to have babies and I want to have babies or I mean
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.840]  just all I'm a science fiction fan when I had time I'd watch science fiction movies
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:44.320]  I'd say more than half has a message of in the future you gotta have a license to have
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:52.160]  kids it's predictive programming and so people think this is the knowledgeable thing I mean
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:58.040]  I have some family who's dead now but she was sit around and talk about the white trash
[1:46:58.040 --> 1:47:04.120]  and how they you know might need to you know our breeding too much and so it was just an
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:11.840]  accepted knowledge listen 34 states passed laws for for sterilization by 1931 I mean
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:16.840]  Hitler got all his ideas from England in the US so all the big robber barons are into
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:23.200]  this so yeah no exactly listen I have yuppies emailing me I see them on the street I mean
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:28.120]  Dr. Pionka gets a standing ovation so to all these other eugenicists they are the majority
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:33.720]  in the power structure and they though go wait a minute the elite wants to kill us and
[1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:37.920]  that's a good idea but I trust it and give it to my kid but I trust him and drink the
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:46.600]  water because again they think they're the elite man they're idiots my friend yeah it's
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:53.200]  all very liberal isn't it I mean the liberals also were championed somebody like Marie Stopes
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:48:01.400]  who was recently honored in Britain by getting her own stamp Marie Stopes advocated the compulsory
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:07.320]  sterilization of the disease drunkard or simply those of bad character that's a dire
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:08.320]  lawyer.
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:13.360]  Margaret Sanger got a stamp same time same year memory serves again it's all unified
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:21.120]  we are I went to a school that was partially black but I mean a large portion of it when
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:25.080]  I was in kindergarten because we lived in white rock lake in Dallas and then we moved out
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:28.920]  to the you know countryside after that for first grade but the point is is that I went
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:34.320]  to Margaret Sanger Elementary there was a statue of her calling black subhuman the blacks
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:40.600]  are taught though to love her she's a hero oh you kill me oh I love you isn't that loving
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:49.720]  Paul oh it's liberal oh very liberal to champion these people who whose legacy can be traced
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:55.800]  through and before Hitler Marie Stopes sent love letters to Hitler she was fascinated by
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:49:02.560]  him because he advocated the same ideas oh what are you anti-Semitic I mean we get attacked
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:09.680]  by the ADL you don't want to kill Hitler is not good I'm like Hitler's not liberal
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:16.680]  now now Stopes Stopes attended the Nazi Congress on population science in Berlin in 1935 that's
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:22.080]  where she called for sterilizing people's bad character and she also concentrated her abortion
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:26.480]  clinics in poor areas because she wanted to reduce the birth rate of the world that's
[1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:31.040]  not just them Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave an AP interview and said we can't get rid of abortion
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:37.280]  we have to get rid of quote populations we don't want right I mean these people are everywhere
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:42.800]  you know I got an idea Paul how about if you were over why don't they just kill themselves
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:48.960]  I mean all these people can just kill themselves oh but see they can't their lives have value
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:56.080]  and they have to oversee killing us right and those people are now working through organizations
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:04.280]  such as the Galton Institute which was formerly known as the eugenics society Marie Stopes
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:09.880]  left to all her most of her estate to the eugenics society and now the eugenics society
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:17.280]  known as the Galton Institute supports funding for the practical delivery of family planning
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:23.440]  facilities and especially in developing countries so in other words the same organization that
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:29.800]  once advocated sterilizing black people to achieve racial purity in line with what Hitler
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:38.040]  and the Nazis wanted are now bankrolling abortions and sterilization in the third world but the
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:43.040]  bigger issue is Bill and Melinda Gates Ted Turner all of them meeting Warren Buffett
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:49.600]  the secret and it comes out mainstream news to curb overpopulation that's coming up in

[1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:16.440]  In the words of the Pentagon possibly the most transforming thing in our force defense
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:23.560]  secretary Donald A. Rumsfeld said will not be weapon systems but a set of interconnections
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:30.080]  headline US military to install global internet architecture giving godlike view of planet
[1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:34.680]  and this article on info wars.com it says exactly what I set up with the years the smart
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:41.800]  dust the RFID and all products is to give Google which is really Pentagon front on record
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:49.480]  we've had Mr. Steele the CIA officer on the cover it a three dimensional system where
[1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:56.080]  you search the internet they search reality and so it's this giant electronic technological
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:02.880]  control grid and that's what the Pentagon calls it as a control grid to straightjacket
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:06.160]  everybody and they're putting the grid in right now and then they're going to phase
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:10.120]  out and kill everybody including the troops when they're done with them and then move
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:16.560]  to a robot military drone control with AI systems run by the elites so it's like Terminator
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:21.280]  but minus the machines running and then they're already going to convert the air force by
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:26.840]  2012 over half drone that means even without humans piloting them everything's converting
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:33.280]  right now now what they'll be successful if we can't face what they're doing and realize
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:38.360]  a group of humans are waging war against the rest of us and they brag and call it this
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:43.880]  you know you talk about the Galton society that was Darwin's quote bulldog this is the
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:48.760]  new religion and I'm not debating evolution here I'm seeing out of the evolution movement
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:53.880]  came these people they're in control and Watson continue me you haven't even gotten into how
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:56:00.120]  he says a global police force will see PS everyone's children they'll break up all the families
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:05.680]  I mean and then now you see him in power today as Obama's science are they are implementing
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:12.880]  the total destruction of society total federalization mobile health vans FEMA camps for everyone's
[1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:20.640]  safety I mean this is it exactly and a lot of the liberals who support eugenics think
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:26.560]  that it's okay to be a little bit fascist on this one issue without realizing the fact
[1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:33.240]  that power corrupts absolutely and if you give government power over the very life cycle
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:41.440]  of humanity that would in and of itself create an openly hyper fascist society you can't
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:47.320]  be a little bit pregnant if the government can implant devices into people that prevent
[1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:53.520]  them from being pregnant implant them a puberty and people can only have them removed with
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:58.200]  government permission when they want to get pregnant what kind of brave new world hell
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:04.680]  whole society is not going to create it's obvious and yet people but Paul you can't
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:10.520]  even have a radio show now it's taking carbon we're shutting you down they admit under the
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:15.800]  climate bill it will all be selectively enforced down to the point in England when a university
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:20.640]  says we want to grant to go test other water supplies somebody's adding hormones that aren't
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:27.200]  even supposed to be there they say sorry carbon you're not allowed to leave but but but but
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:33.120]  wait you have a carbon footprint don't criticize it or you'll be arrested that's carbon denial
[1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:39.960]  I mean this is the most diabolical plan Paul and the point to make about it is that all
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:45.560]  these same people who are in the population control movement in the sixties and seventies
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:51.680]  are all now pushing the global warming movement even though you can go down their predictions
[1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:57.400]  line by line and in every instance the predictions that they made in the sixties and seventies
[1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:02.760]  have turned out to be absolutely wrong yeah they said an ice age we had to sterilize everybody
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:08.320]  for the ice age but see they know it's a fraud they brag they just give us a new religion
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:14.040]  they go these people are religious give them a green religion meanwhile with genetic engineering
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:18.120]  all the other stuff and the toxic waste they're actually hurting the environment the bottom
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:21.440]  line is none of this is being done for the environment this is being done for these control
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:27.000]  freaks can control the future keep the life extension technologies for themselves and
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:32.200]  really craft the development and evolution of human society themselves they don't want
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:38.160]  the people to be part of that debate and they rationalize hey the public doesn't care thus
[1:58:38.160 --> 1:58:46.200]  that is the evidence that we deserve what we're getting thank you for listening to GCN visit

[2:00:58.640 --> 2:01:04.720]  way up sterilizations way up infertility's way up the eugenics didn't go away in the
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:08.800]  1980s when they were still sterilizing women forcibly through the health department through
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:14.720]  the family planning courts the family courts are eugenics courts set up for that and this
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:21.160]  bastard uh... obama's uh... science are over ninety percent logical development the u.s

[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:36.480]  yeah holdren's essentially advocating uh... the policy in china which is enforced i'm
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:42.560]  talking about one child policy obviously if you have more than one child in china and
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:47.840]  if you live in a city in the rural areas it's two children in the city if you have more
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:57.160]  than one child the milder enforcement is by way of crippling taxes but on the other end
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:05.240]  of the enforcement they actually send out government goons who kidnapped women off the streets
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:11.280]  drag them to abortion clinics and forcibly abort the baby well he says forced abortion
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:17.200]  one of his colleagues peter singer says kill babies after they're born he says parents

[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:26.560]  murdering babies on and i give a one-year-old bouncing on your knee that's not a human it's
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:32.920]  a fetus ice-pick i'm sorry go ahead paul right winger

[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:46.280]  population control laws even including laws requiring compulsory abortion could be sustained
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:52.640]  under the existing constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:58.760]  the society so he's talking about forced abortion now i'll go back to what i was saying before
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:04.320]  all these people who were in the global population reduction movement in the sixties and seventies
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:09.840]  are all the same faces now pushing the global warming movement their predictions have been
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:18.760]  uniformly wrong aldrin's co-author of eco science said in nineteen sixty nine quote
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:24.760]  i would take even money that england will not exist in the year two thousand he also
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:29.920]  said quote life expectancy of americans by nineteen eighty would be forty two at years
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:36.160]  of age completely wrong he also said that because of overpopulation creating a food
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:42.920]  shortage and this is this is at the same time that kistinger and uh bush we're talking
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:48.920]  about withholding food from the third world in order to kill them and reduce population
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:56.360]  but um earlick said that because of food shortages four billion people would die from nineteen
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:01.760]  eighty to nineteen eighty nine this is the co-author of the book with holder and holder
[2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:06.480]  and made similar statements he said that there'd be a massive catastrophe before two thousand
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:09.640]  and everything would call out and paul let's be clear because they were planning to engineer
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:14.000]  those he now is the first speech he gave so we gotta control the weather with the chem
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:19.080]  trails describing the exact cocktail recipe that our scientists said they were already
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  spraying and he said yeah we've been doing tests that's all just test we're about to
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:28.680]  start the real program and then climatologists look at the program and say it'll actually
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:33.720]  heat the earth and then now bill gates comes out and says oh i want to start geoengineering
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:39.000]  the planet so it's clear they're trying to create droughts and floods as they said the
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:44.280]  state of perma random two hundred to stop people from having food the cause of collapse
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:52.600]  they want a collapse stay there paul watson will come back and more into that statement
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:55.400]  i just may get your take on that run through the rest of your articles and then go to

[2:07:09.960 --> 2:07:14.840]  auditor they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:19.720]  water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:07.320]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:19.800]  large portions of the u.s. population live in government housing and they say you don't have
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:23.960]  a second right if you do but that's been overturned in court because we're fighting back
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:27.160]  against these bastards you know that's only the message here we can beat them
[2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:33.240]  so a government official with the housing authority has said that you're not allowed
[2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:37.800]  to own guns because you're poor and that means you're stupid that's like when the state of
[2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:42.760]  texas asked the head psychiatrist in the state advising the state why does the state put over
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:47.640]  two-thirds of the kids and foster care on drugs and he said they have bad gene pools it's just a
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:55.160]  quackery you know made-up reason these are quacks these are scam artists churches and cops team up
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:01.000]  for gun surrender saying it's of the lord you turn your guns in that's the churches on government
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:06.120]  payroll all right i want to take some calls for watson but watson continue getting into this amazing
[2:09:06.120 --> 2:09:12.760]  report i'm giving a lot of attention to because it's so important a textbook a policy review a
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:20.360]  proposal for government and here he is decades later obama's uh science are the guy he coauthored
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:28.360]  it with advises congress and president bush showing its nonpartisan and so all of this is going on
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:33.960]  the right wing media is trying to make it a partisan issue to distract really uh but um
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:39.640]  there's a lot of other facets to the incredible uh system he calls for a global government
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:46.120]  in ecoscience population resources and environment it will carry all this out with a environmental
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:52.600]  police which now they have in new york and san francisco and many other areas are getting city
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:55.160]  environmental police running around harassing people
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:05.240]  yeah i mean the the other main shocking thing in it after the proposal to sterilize people through
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:14.120]  the water supplies under the uh subheadline involuntary fertility control on page 786 it says
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:21.160]  quote the development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:27.160]  and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility
[2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:33.560]  control the capsule could be implanted at puberty that might be removable with official permission
[2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:41.240]  for a limited number of births so he's talking about by law the government implanting a device
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:47.640]  in the body of young men and women at puberty and it says you go before a board of social workers
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:53.240]  and then your babies are taken and raised by them yeah that's the other one you have to prove that
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:58.760]  you're worthy of licensing for parenting is essentially what it is it doesn't matter that
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:03.480]  they're five to seven times more likely to be use children that they're the scum parasite control
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.440]  freaks i mean let's put this scumbag up on screen what is it about all these guys that
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:12.920]  they want to run our lives but they can't run their own lives i mean they are just such trash
[2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:20.680]  the thing about it alex is the biggest obstacle is people support their opinions
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:28.600]  i had i read a response to a daily mail article about the mary stopes issue and it was a woman
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:37.080]  reasonably outlining the need for government to breed humans like farmyard animals and this was a
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:42.360]  woman who was trying to sound reasonable about it and she was supported by the majority of other
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:51.080]  people that made these comments now they've got a culturally imperialist mindset that as he said
[2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:59.560]  has been brainwashed into them people need to get past their tribal racism and this class elitism
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:06.040]  and realize that this is not just targeted at brown people or welfare scum they're putting it in
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:13.080]  municipal water supplies for god's sake this is targeting everybody now the whole overpopulation
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:18.520]  issue itself we've proven that these people were completely wrong in their predictions i've just
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:24.600]  read out the quotes from holder and co-author in that book now you can have a debate about
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:32.680]  is overpopulation a problem the fact is would you rather have an overpopulated but free society
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:39.880]  or a sparsely populated hyperfascist society where the government regulates every aspect of your
[2:12:39.880 --> 2:12:44.760]  personal life down to the level where they implant a device that prevents you from getting pregnant
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:51.640]  now well i'll tell you what else is sick watson there are commenters in your story at prison
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:56.680]  planet dot com your part two if folks want to find the first part which is encyclopedic and very
[2:12:56.680 --> 2:13:02.600]  important for everybody to read if the average american would get is knowledgeable about eugenics
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:07.080]  the new rule order in the architecture that the elite have built on planetary scale what they've
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:12.280]  already done to us their current operations and their future plans if people were as knowledgeable
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:17.400]  about that as they were about football or baseball we'd be in a free society i mean this this is life
[2:13:17.400 --> 2:13:23.160]  and death and they're in here commenting saying we're backwards idiots we're for the welfare
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:30.360]  scum you know we've got to get rid of these people hey dumb racist you do that through education
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:35.240]  you help these people the royal commission on population the blueprint for all of this in 49
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:41.880]  out of england declassified in the 70s states that they actually want to make the third world
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:46.200]  population swell they want to get rid of their competition in the west and then call everybody
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:51.880]  off at the end this isn't about the earth it isn't about helping people it isn't about tough love
[2:13:51.880 --> 2:13:57.240]  and you are being shot up with the mercury and the cancer viruses you are being are drinking
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:02.360]  the sterilants you are being chemtrail sprayed because the white house science chief is announcing
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:09.640]  that as well don't you get it all i mean really again these are the sickos in the system that
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:14.920]  feel like they're part of the establishment and you're not you're not part of the establishment
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:22.760]  i'm sorry watch and go ahead alex the fact is about overpopulation as the figures show
[2:14:22.760 --> 2:14:30.440]  in europe in south korea in thailand places like that if you modernize if you improve living standards
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:36.760]  population gradually levels out naturally of its own accord now we know that's not going to happen
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:43.240]  in the third world because this global corporate slave system you know needs its reservation it
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:49.000]  needs its wage slaves to produce the crap that we consume the pennies on the dollar that's why
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.720]  the third world is not allowed to develop it's also not allowed to develop in the more remote
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:15:00.680]  areas because and this is exposed in um dirkin's excellent documentary the great global warming
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:06.680]  swindle third world countries are not being allowed to develop under the guise that they're
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:13.480]  going to increase their carbon footprint again it all comes back to this global warming is hurting
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:17.560]  the environment in the long run because it's preventing us from having a good environment
[2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:23.320]  is preventing third world nations from developing from becoming economically better off from
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:27.400]  stabilizing that population that's what the royal commission says it says we're not going to let
[2:15:27.400 --> 2:15:33.160]  them have industrial capacity we want them to have a people bomb to hold them down and eat up
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:40.360]  their resources so they don't challenge our hegemon uh so it's all a global game of chess and then
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:47.000]  once they're their populations bloom then we'll use sterilization and disease and war to knock
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:52.360]  them out in the next phase and then we're going to go and target our most intelligent here break
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:57.720]  up the families in the west so no one can oppose them to the point of where only the elites can
[2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:02.360]  even talk that's what orwell wrote about because he'd actually worked at the bbc in propaganda
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:07.240]  but that's what the elites talk about now and huxley talked about it so did uh uh virtual
[2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:12.120]  russle about how the public wouldn't be able to talk and poll a lot of the public now can't
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:17.960]  really talk unless it's kind of canned things they heard from tv they have i mean they've
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:23.320]  been chemically and psychologically through the educational system turned into like biological
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:29.240]  androids and now they're using these biological androids me have police uniform me take you to
[2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:40.760]  camp me take your child me and so they got like brain damage zombies government authority official
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:44.680]  and we're like warren everyone warn them quickly and the enemy's like you can't stop us the planes
[2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:52.520]  are spraying and people are drinking goblets of water and uh children don't die of cancer
[2:16:52.520 --> 2:17:00.600]  it is normal i mean where where does it end Watson i just how do we get through to these idiots
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:08.760]  who think that mass sterilization forcibly aborting babies and planting implants by
[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:15.720]  government decree in people at puberty is a sensible idea how could any free-thinking
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:23.720]  sane person advocate that the fact is this in britain there are people there are couples
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:31.320]  who haven't had jobs their entire lives they have 15 or 16 children and the state pays them
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:37.640]  for everyone it's this socialized welfare well they do that so they can point at that and say
[2:17:37.640 --> 2:17:41.720]  we need to socialize everything we got to have a license to have a kid so we don't have to pay
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:47.160]  for that they brag it's problem reaction solution they create the crisis and then offer the solution
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:53.400]  their nanny state they created to get control to reduce population actually makes it explode
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:18:00.600]  which is their original plan you see the dot this is crazy like a fox paul so how about removing
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:05.800]  the incentive for people to have 16 kids in the first place no no they're not going to do that
[2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:10.200]  because they want the person that has 16 kids they're going to put cop uniforms on them and
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.640]  they're going to be me take you camp me drink fluoride and then they're going to take the
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:20.280]  vaccines with the cancer viruses and die at retirement and and and that's their biological
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:25.240]  android in their first phase before they go to the robots to enforce for them this is all stated
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:30.840]  i'm serious folks their real enemy is you and i who can actually think we're the enemy so they're
[2:18:30.840 --> 2:18:37.480]  creating the devil horde of the white trash fluoride heads you understand paul yeah they
[2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:44.520]  need to create the opposite so they can then introduce the solution this is a this is a quote
[2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:50.600]  from somebody on an article not my article but a similar one out of the daily mail quote we breathe
[2:18:50.600 --> 2:18:55.640]  farm animals to produce the best possible stock and kill them when they have fulfilled their purpose
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:19:01.000]  we interbreed pedigree animals to produce extremes that leave them open to ill health and early death
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:05.960]  it is only religion that says humans are not animal the reality is that we are simply intelligent
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:12.120]  mammalian primate the world population of humans has increased from two to six point five billion

[2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:24.360]  what the elite that are running things are doing and mermis just ran in here all excited
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:29.240]  we're in their taping c span and he said the republican leader just got up and said this is
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:34.520]  about a new world order and a global elite wanting to micromanage and control the resources of the
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:41.480]  populations so i mean it's really i was watching another c span clip they're talking about this
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:48.040]  is about eugenics here's the exciting news the people are getting wise to how the world really
[2:24:48.040 --> 2:24:55.240]  works just like i used the example last week if you couldn't find different juice products like
[2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:00.200]  cranberry juice cocktail that didn't have corn syrup in it and now people quit buying it so now
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:09.160]  it's now it's sugar cane and and that's the issue i'm making is that we can demand what we want
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:15.240]  and change the system before the full global police state grids in but you look at piyanka
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:19.640]  singer holds run all of them it's always global police take all the police state i mean this
[2:25:19.640 --> 2:25:25.320]  is really happening watson i know i keep just repeating that but we there'd be something wrong
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:29.640]  with us if you and i and others weren't freaked out by the magnitude of this
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:38.040]  i'm freaked out by it but it appears that a majority of people support it i hate to say it but
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:44.200]  from everything i've read that's the truth well that's a wannabe elitism it's it's a wannabe
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:52.600]  elitism one thing i think a battle for the minds that we won or are winning vehemently is on the
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  vaccines because yesterday the uk government announced they didn't say it would be mandatory
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:09.720]  but they implied it definitely they said the entire uk population 61 million people will be vaccinated
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:16.600]  against swine flu within a year now i wrote an article about that referencing the london times
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:22.920]  peace which said that the vaccine was being rushed through safety procedures in five days it was
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:29.080]  being fast tracked despite the fact that the makers of it got caught you know tainting the
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:34.600]  vaccine they produced and sent out with avian flu virus baxter international
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:39.960]  now notice the people that are making it are the ones that accidentally put weaponized bird
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:46.520]  flu in the vaccine and it was it was the 76 swine flu vaccine that killed a bunch of people i have
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:53.400]  a 60 minutes from the 70s admitting all this right it killed more people than the swine
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:58.360]  flu there's many more and injured thousand well i mean we know they're putting something in it
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:03.000]  whenever they've got a big vaccine they're pushing but the idiot public's going to take it they love
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:08.040]  dying but but you're saying some are waking up here's the good news as of last night on that
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:13.960]  london times article now these are not prison planet or info was read as when i looked last night
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:19.160]  there were 50 comments on that london times article about the mandatory swine flu vaccine
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:26.680]  nearly every single one said no way in hell am i taking that from this lying government
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:34.120]  that's being proven wrong on every facet for the last god knows how many years nearly 50 people
[2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:37.880]  out of the 50 comments that they were not taking it so what are they going to do
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:42.680]  when millions of people refuse to take it no no the washington post announced today they're
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:47.000]  going to quote make every kid in america take it and they'll say it's the law and there's no law
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.520]  and then someone and you know what bunch people are going to die when they take it
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:54.920]  and then we'll keep winning but again they're they're definitely putting something in those
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:28:01.800]  shots watson uh let's uh oh what was this video i saw of a guy reciting my lines from waking life
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:07.800]  getting arrested are you not allowed to even talk in england now there was a guy in birmingham
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:16.120]  which is the second biggest city in england on saturday afternoon who got a bullhorn
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:22.120]  and just started walking through the center of town reciting your speech from waking life
[2:28:22.120 --> 2:28:28.600]  and adding a few things of his own about wanting to hold on to british sovereignty against the eu and
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:34.760]  all that kind of thing they had a he had a crowd of people that eventually joined and started marching
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:41.720]  with him and he got arrested for the crime of using the bullhorn that's right you're not allowed
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:46.200]  to protest or demonstrate you're a slave and you can't come out and say you don't want to be taken
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:52.040]  over by criminal eugenicists that openly run the eu and they said oh you can't use an
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:57.560]  unauthorized sound device but if he'd have been protesting to shut down a coal plant for carbon
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:29:02.840]  tax oh then they would have been carrying him on their shoulders man i tell you british police they
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:10.520]  are just well the videos i see are just unbelievable we got caught at g8 killing somebody and then
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:16.200]  they faked to the autopsy and had to do a second one but the point is in britain to protest the
[2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:22.520]  government you need permission from the government that's not free speech free speech is dead it
[2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:28.120]  doesn't exist when you get arrested for doing it well you and your brother and i have all been put
[2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:32.520]  in terror databases but we watch women and children being they just have secret police run up and say

[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:21.480]  about the new 911 kangaroo court trials and obama has said that uh even if they're found
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:26.840]  not guilty but they're going to be held indefinitely so this is now pre crime it's worse than bush
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:30.680]  and it's being called liberal so he was in on some of those meetings and brought up serious
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:35.640]  questions was told to shut up he joins us now to talk about that but even more important
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:42.600]  they've gotten the signatures and then some needed to make this be a ballot issue for a city
[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:49.640]  investigation of what happened so let's go to mani bedio mani it is great to have you on with us sir

[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:12.280]  of demonization 9 11 truth going on 9 11 truth is out there getting bigger every day 9 11 truth
[2:37:12.280 --> 2:37:17.160]  we are change info warriors a bunch of other groups are out there constantly making the news
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:21.160]  bringing up the issues of government sponsored terrorism if we don't do that they're going to
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:27.240]  continue to stage the attacks and use those staged events like flu or al-qaeda attacks
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:33.560]  to bring in their control but but where shall we start the petitions or should we get into
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:38.680]  some of the behind the scenes with these kangaroo trials let's start with the petitions
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:45.560]  i'll explain to you real quick nyccan dot org coalition for accountability now
[2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:53.320]  we are here in new york city collecting petitions every day we have collected upwards of 68
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:57.640]  thousand signatures from new york city voters who are looking to have a new investigation
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:02.120]  into what happened on 9 11 this is with the peanut power and this is privately funded we
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:07.800]  handed in 52 thousand signatures a couple of weeks ago to the city clerk mites McSweeney
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:12.920]  in new york we're looking to have those validated we're looking to see if it goes to the city
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:18.760]  council for a vote we are also looking for support we are looking for donations so we
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:24.440]  can continue to have the signature collected we're looking to collect at least 30 000 more
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:30.280]  signatures within the next few weeks to override any vote that the city council may give so we
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:35.640]  can ensure that this goes on to the ballot in november giving new york city voters the ability
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:43.560]  to say yes to a subpoena powered investigation it's what happened on 9 11 and this is a big
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:49.160]  feat that you've gotten all these signatures and even if they throw a lot of them out break down
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:53.960]  the rules and the math on that and then if it gets accepted which it looks like it will what the
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:39:00.040]  process is now because any real investigation of 9 11 and even a second whitewash opens a lot of
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:06.680]  holes up the first 9 11 whitewash by uh congress brought a lot out the second official commission
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:10.920]  whitewash brought a lot out now that we've had members and general counsel come out and say it
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:16.520]  was all a lie all a fraud we agreed to lie with the pentagon that's now mainstream is uh i mean
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:23.640]  this is really discrediting them right now right now we're out of position where we have uh over
[2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:31.320]  68 000 signatures okay we are still looking to collect more signatures because the the vote any
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:35.800]  vote given by the city council hopefully it will be coming up within the next few weeks with the
[2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:41.160]  city council we're still not sure where the the city council is looking to go we're still not
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.400]  sure where the city clerk is looking to go all we know is that we've done our job we've been on the
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:51.640]  streets we've been collecting signatures we engage people one-on-one this is a very honest
[2:39:52.280 --> 2:40:00.280]  passionate way a more passive way even for citizens to participate in democracy uh we are
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:06.600]  asking them to sign a ballot initiative that allows for a commission to be set up and this
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:11.160]  commission is going to have subpoena power it's going to protect those who have come out spoken
[2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:17.880]  about what happened on 9 11 that weren't heard during the first sham of an investigation 70%
[2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:22.520]  of our questions were never answered during the 9 11 commission i mentioned that in the movie truth
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:31.080]  rise the fact is is that this petition is looking to have all questions answered we are looking to
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:38.280]  have the ability for new york city voters to say yes and then to proceed on to a commission that's
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:43.560]  going to be honest it's going to be chosen by the people we have family members survivors on the
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:50.440]  commission already overseeing it we have an executive committee that uh is actively participating
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:56.040]  in what's happening here this alex is something that hasn't taken place in the rest of the world
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:03.720]  well before even here in the u.s we are engaging people every day this isn't about theory this
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:09.560]  isn't about who did it what happened this is about giving new york city voters the opportunity
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:15.400]  to say yes then we proceed with the proper investigation that's due my uncle and three
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:21.080]  thousand others that were murdered and there's no questions answered this will answer those questions
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:27.880]  mani what is it like for you to see top physicists and engineers and scientists and peer review
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:33.960]  journals in europe the united states coming out and saying clearly we didn't just find the evidence
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:39.960]  of thermite and thermate and bombs but specifically even finding part of the unexpended thermite
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:47.080]  then it turns out the very people running the niss report are the very few experts
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:57.720]  in nasa thermite thermate uh rocket separation technology then there's people in the commission
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:42:05.480]  connected in with the special jacketing and building seven of unconventional fire retardant
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:11.560]  in 99 when they built the cia command bunker in there i mean we really are honing it right
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:16.760]  down to the individuals now i mean knowing that they i mean knowing knowing who these murderers
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:20.600]  are and i understand you're just going for an investigation but the evidence is there more
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:25.560]  and more we know who the actual murderers are what is it like to be closing in on really how they did
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:32.120]  it well it feels it feels tremendously empowering and it should feel tremendously empowering to all
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:36.440]  family members that lost someone to all first responders that are dying today based on the
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:40.760]  lives they were told into all survivors but also the rest of new york city the rest of
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:45.320]  this country the rest of the world this is evidence that's coming out every day that
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:51.400]  should have been included in the original investigation that took place evidence that
[2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:57.720]  should have been included because in a court of law when you take in this evidence it's
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:43:03.640]  weighed okay this what's happening nyccan.org here we're going to have a commission
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:07.640]  where we're not going to have political consideration this is going to be a privately
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:12.360]  funded investigation this is going to be an investigation that has to pina power to protect
[2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:17.960]  those like civil admins and so many others that have come out and spoken about what they knew
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:24.680]  that the invest that the original 9-11 investigation did not want to hear so it's very important it's
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:32.040]  very empowering it and to hear that people throughout the world alex are investigating
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:37.560]  what's happening are finding the evidence publishing the evidence um i'll be honest with
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:43.320]  you i had a conversation with my mother yesterday okay she's the sister of of my uncle okay she was
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:49.080]  asking why aren't more people speaking out why aren't more people you know understanding what's
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:53.640]  happening and i've you know i have to tell her you know pretty much this isn't something that is
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:58.680]  being put on the mainstream media you know we're vilified in the mainstream media um the evidence
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:04.120]  that you know you know should be heard by the rest of the world is not being heard instead we're
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:10.200]  being told about celebrity and entertainment and what have you so my mother is was asking why why
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:15.320]  why well guess what this is an opportunity a tremendous opportunity everyone here in
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:21.240]  new york city to participate and to get to the answers that we need to know and those people
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.760]  such as steven jones and richard gauge and everyone who would be able to speak under a court in a
[2:44:26.760 --> 2:44:31.720]  court of law under subpoena power they'd be able to speak about the evidence that's being found the
[2:44:31.720 --> 2:44:38.040]  fact of the matter is very simple okay we were lied to and we need to get to the answers or else
[2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:44.200]  this may happen again another type of incident like this i don't want to speculate on theory i have
[2:44:44.200 --> 2:44:50.760]  my own opinions about it but i will say that nycken.org this is a tremendous opportunity for
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:55.960]  everyone here in the city of eight million people that he was affected the most by the catastrophe
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:01.000]  to be able to put their names to a piece of paper and say yes we want to see that question
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:06.520]  and we want to be able to say yes to a new investigation comes to come november where do
[2:45:06.520 --> 2:45:13.320]  folks go to find out more about the petition we are change.org they'd be able to go to nycken.org
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:17.160]  we're going to be getting a link up soon on we are change.org they'd be able to go to the left
[2:45:17.160 --> 2:45:28.600]  hand button bar and okay but the main side is nycken.org anyone would be able to go there take
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:34.360]  a look at the petition take a look at FAQs take a look at the executive committee that's been
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:39.080]  set up be able to donate we're looking for donations we're getting on average about
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:47.080]  a dollar a signature we need about 30,000 more signatures to ensure that a very safe way for
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:51.720]  us to override any decision by the city council to ensure that we get on the note that's right
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:56.520]  you've already got more signatures than you need correct but but but so absolutely and the reason
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:02.280]  why we've done that is because we know that the city clerk is looking to perhaps and you know try
[2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:06.760]  to cancel out a lot of the signatures that we've given for whatever reason we want to make sure
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:12.120]  that this gets on the ballot this is the real chance for real investigation into the murder of my
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:17.400]  uncle and 3,000 others my uncle should be standing here with me today instead i'm on the phone and
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:22.600]  i'm pleading with people to take a look at what we've done for the past year collecting these
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:27.640]  signatures and what we are change is done what nycken has done what info wars has done with so
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:34.440]  many people that have come and spoken out about what happened now is the time to do it and i really
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:39.960]  appreciate alex haven't haven't been on the show many we appreciate you but listen your tireless
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:43.720]  voice for liberty and freedom and we don't bring these murders to justice you're right they'll
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:48.280]  continue to commit all these other crimes but what i wanted to ask you about with this is
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:56.600]  what is the procedure going to be if they just refuse the signatures or try some you know some
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:01.320]  type of chicanery even that will be a victory because then it will beg the question why are they
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:08.520]  why are they refusing to do this even when law says if we have these petitions this happens
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:14.920]  exactly home rule of 37 under the new york city charter allows for this to take place if they
[2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:20.600]  begin to refuse it we are looking for a legal counsel we do have some legal counsel but we're
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:26.360]  always looking for more legal counsel to ensure that if they do try to say hey this is invalid
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:32.680]  that we will continue to pursue this this will not be stopped the very fact that so many people now
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:38.920]  are informed about it so many people have already signed that petition i mean we're in a city of
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:45.640]  eight million people have 68000 plus signatures already signed saying we need new investigation
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:51.320]  that just begs to say hey what if we had a hundred petitioners a 200 petition is going out
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:57.160]  showing new york city voters this petition how many more signatures could we get it shows that
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:01.400]  new york city understands what we want what have you got what have you got 80 plus percent of new
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:06.040]  york you know that's what the new york timespole said you believe we've been lied to about 9 11
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:13.320]  84 percent that was three years ago three years ago 84 percent in a scientific poll look we've won
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:18.760]  the war for 9 11 truth in that we've woken up the public but the public all feels like they're by
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:23.880]  themselves the public feels like they're the minority we're the majority and look at how more
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:30.680]  and more about government sponsored terror comes out and now that chief counsel of the 9 11 commission
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:34.440]  comes out and says we made a deal with the pentagon to lie about what really happened
[2:48:34.440 --> 2:48:39.320]  i mean we're this close to exposing these murderers many do you think the people that carried out the
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:43.720]  attacks ever thought that i would stand up that you would stand up that so many others would stand
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:49.800]  up and speak out i i think they might have had that inclination though i do want to say that um
[2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:57.000]  they never knew the strength and the power of what we bring and that's truth and that's justice
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:01.480]  and that's more than anything that they could ever throw up against us the fact that we have
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:06.680]  over 60 family members that have already signed a state the statement of support the fact that we
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:11.800]  have first responders and survivors signing our statement of support that list is building every
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:17.880]  single day every single hour okay there are people that know what happened they want a true
[2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:23.800]  investigation you can't stop that you can't stop liberty this is true liberty this is something
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:29.800]  that we were all conditioned to grow up with to say hey you know what you live in the united
[2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:35.640]  states america free america well guess what we have an opportunity now to really bring that
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:41.800]  to the public to bring it to the voting booth to bring it to where it's gotta go absolutely many briefly uh
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:46.520]  tell folks about what happened with you uh because you're you know lost family you're able to go to

[2:54:28.200 --> 2:54:35.480]  just about the transmission hey just side issue before we get into this briefly what you saw with
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:41.320]  the military commission's meeting is they try to legitimize the the the joke they're carrying out
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:44.600]  because you can't just stage the attack you've then got to stage trials of innocent people and
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:49.960]  that's not coming out what do you think of it coming out obama's chief science advisor admitting
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.480]  the whole end game and sterilization and poisoning the water and taking people's kids and a planetary
[2:54:55.480 --> 2:55:02.440]  government i mean these people mean business uh they need they need more than business alex uh
[2:55:02.440 --> 2:55:06.600]  this is something that's been taking place well before even the obama administration
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:10.760]  got into power this has been taking place in our government and the co-indexing government
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:16.440]  operate behind the public government that we are aware of this has been taking place for decades
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:24.280]  okay yes in the military myself i know what goes on and the fact is is that when we hear things on
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:29.000]  through the mainstream media we have got to look at that critically and we have got to go to the
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  sources and find out what's what what are they really telling us and what when i went into this
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:41.080]  military commission's hearing for the family members i knew i was already told by other
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:44.920]  family members that went there that you know they're going to just try to fluff it up and
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:52.680]  they're going to try to well you know what alex it was a textbook uh example of what propaganda is
[2:55:53.240 --> 2:55:58.520]  the verbiage that they used with the family members the fact that they call people evil
[2:55:58.520 --> 2:56:02.520]  and they call the people that they were no good in that they were out to kill us and that they
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:09.080]  want to continue to kill us so in a supposed uh supposed jury type situation they're using
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:13.800]  terms like evil and bad and they're guilty well they're explaining to the family members
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:19.960]  they give us a packet of the charges they give us a uh a number of documents that are going to
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:26.040]  support their case when they get to go on tonimo they're defending the military commission as opposed
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:30.840]  to going through federal courts uh they're saying we have a very strong case and alex i'm going to
[2:56:30.840 --> 2:56:38.280]  tell you something i asked questions that nobody in that room was asking and i literally was shocked
[2:56:38.280 --> 2:56:44.920]  at how they couldn't answer some of these questions on this list they gave us they mentioned a lot of
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:49.960]  issues when it comes to the four people that they're prosecuting and then mohammed octane the
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:55.400]  hijacker alleged hijackers and related and i see Osama bin Laden's name mentioned so i asked a direct
[2:56:55.400 --> 2:57:01.320]  question what evidence do we have against Osama bin Laden there was a pause and i want to tell you
[2:57:01.320 --> 2:57:06.120]  this pause happened many a times to the questions i was asking and by the way for those that don't
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:13.560]  know the fbi doesn't even list him uh on the most wanted 4911 he is not even listed 4911 well that
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:17.320]  was what was brought up because i had mentioned that i said what evidence do you have against
[2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:21.240]  and they just got finished saying that the fbi helped them out tremendously that they were that
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:24.760]  they helped them out so much in getting gathering the evidence they said what evidence you have
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:28.680]  everything was something a lot nicer because the fbi website does not even mention that he's
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:34.760]  wanted to 9 11 another great long pause now let me tell you a lot of people um on the prosecution
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:39.400]  you try to answer at the same time they got that flustered and they were saying where did you hear
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:43.800]  that from and where did you get that from and i'm like let me ask you this how come mohammed octane
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:49.880]  the transfer that he received from the isi chief uh you know about a year before 9 11 how come that's
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:56.120]  not mentioned in here how come you're not bringing evidence into this case that would increase that
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:58:02.440]  would put firing government you know in a position where hey they have to begin to answer questions
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:09.080]  what happened they were silent okay they couldn't answer about i asked them about civil edmund alex
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:12.120]  when i asked them about civil engineering said what about the evidence that she's brought up
[2:58:12.120 --> 2:58:16.360]  but you're going to use this in the trial they have the goal to state every family member that
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:23.320]  they have no idea what happened is meanwhile she worked as a translator i mean these are people
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:29.080]  and i'm going to tell you this alex when i mentioned civil edmund they one of the gentlemen
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:35.560]  that was on this prosecution team went to the rest of them and said now now this that's closed

[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:47.000]  of our questions were never answered during the commission is this going to be another sham trial
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:52.600]  that the family members then have to go through and then expect to have some sort of justice
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:56.840]  and i said to them this i said does anybody here really feel that it was only five people that did
[3:01:56.840 --> 3:02:02.200]  this silence alex they had to be at least four or five times the size and that's why

[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:40.840]  springman the head of the visa in saudi arabia and he's being told let out of the in them in
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:47.080]  their their cia that i didn't have an opportunity to but this is something else that i can continue
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:51.960]  to correspond with them i i mean this is on record that the hijackers were all trained at
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:58.600]  us military bases in super high clearance that's ap i mean i mean this is a fact i mean that the
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:02.840]  embassies wouldn't let them in and they'd say let them in these are high-level operatives yes sir
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:10.840]  who i mean in case closed they did it it's over and case closed this i actually and i and i commented
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:16.600]  a few times to a few of my close friends about how that uh the next night i was on a conference call
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:22.760]  with kandace gourmet she is one of the defendants of three of the people that are being accused
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:27.400]  during the sham 911 trial that's taking place starting this week down in guantanamo so i listened
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:32.920]  to her uh conference call i had an opportunity to ask questions there and i said um you know what
[3:03:32.920 --> 3:03:36.920]  type of facts is the government bringing up and how do you feel you can successfully defend him
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:41.080]  she goes i know i can defend him because there are no facts that bring up that's all he or say
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:47.000]  so you know i thought about this alex i was one of maybe five six billion people in the world that
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:52.440]  got to hear both the prosecution side the defense the side and the week before going to trial with

[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:00.520]  about how this is going to take place this is going to be something that the media is going to
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.520]  report on here and there because they don't want to secretly think about what's going to be a total
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:09.880]  kangaroo you also told us that they admitted they have no evidence but obama admits that he says

[3:08:56.120 --> 3:09:01.240]  we stand on his shoulders today but he also stands right beside us because he's still fighting
[3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:07.720]  more than ever he's a great gentleman and very articulate and i'm very excited that he's going

[3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:39.880]  with a big role in that exposing kind of the architecture of the new world order
[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:43.720]  but this just broke over the weekend world that daily's kind of copied our story which
[3:09:43.720 --> 3:09:48.920]  we're glad all we care about exposing it the original place was front page magazine in february
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:53.240]  but nobody believed it was david horowitz is somewhat discredited but we got the actual textbook
[3:09:53.240 --> 3:09:58.600]  and we have the scans of it and it's up on info wars dot com obama science advisor called for
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:04.600]  planetary regime to enforce a tallitarian population control implants to control us
[3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:12.440]  cps taking all children at birth a planetary government of green police force drugging of the
[3:10:12.440 --> 3:10:20.600]  water and of the food and and and this is a government plan the book is as you see on screen
[3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:28.440]  at prismplanet.tv eco science population resources environment and this was he co-wrote this with
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:36.840]  paul r earlick who was one of bush's chief advisor so this is bipartisan but front page
[3:10:36.840 --> 3:10:40.920]  magazine and the neocons are acting like it's a liberal issue though i have to admit the democrats
[3:10:40.920 --> 3:10:45.560]  are more overtly eugenicist you know margaret sanger is praised by the black community because
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:52.280]  she called black subhuman that that's the sick twisted craig like sourcing area's adl awards
[3:10:52.280 --> 3:10:57.080]  because he says he wants to be like hitler but if you fight hitler then the adl attacks you
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:11:02.920]  reality is much stranger than fiction as they say so i wanted to get geobre griffin out of the
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:10.680]  gates to talk about this but overall the the the the big eugenics agenda the plan the carbon tax
[3:11:10.680 --> 3:11:15.080]  which that which we couldn't see till they passed it home inspections federal zoning
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:26.360]  one child policies i have usa today uh here in my stack that says that in fact put it on screen
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:32.120]  for folks that says that oh the bad economy is good for the carbon footprint command destruction
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:37.720]  how they want to bring us back to a rewilding a neo feudalism assert them geobre griffin author
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:42.040]  of the creation from jackall island thanks for being here with us well thanks for inviting me
[3:11:42.040 --> 3:11:46.920]  alex i i really appreciate that very kind introduction but it scares the heck out of me
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:53.000]  because i think people expect expect too much uh no brag just fact that's what john wane said
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:57.400]  and people need to know the testament of the great work you've done in 40 plus years that
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:00.840]  briefly how long you've been fighting the globalist how'd you wake up to him and let's get into
[3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:07.720]  eugenics well that the actual year of my uh beginning of awakening was 1959 and that's when
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:13.160]  i began to read some things that were uh you know upstream that not the same stuff that i was
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:19.480]  seeing on the on the media uh and by 1960 i was in in full swing so i've been in this thing since
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:27.960]  1960 amazing so we're talking about almost 50 years yeah really time flies you know i hope
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:33.080]  i look as good as you when i'm your age you're you're us uh what a gentleman you are no no no
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:37.960]  you're handsome double i would just send you a pair of glasses in the morning but okay uh
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:40.680]  and we're gonna fire your website coming out in a few minutes so folks should get ready for that
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:45.800]  you have freedom force international taking action against these globalists but eugenics i mean in
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:51.880]  my research everything leads to that our entire society is built for a social engineering grid
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:12:58.040]  break that down from your 60 years of research and what their in game is in light of this government
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:04.520]  textbook internal textbook it's now come out written by bush's advisor and obama's advisor calling
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:11.080]  for a planetary government to kill us well i had two thoughts as you were introducing the topic
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:16.920]  uh and one of the thoughts is that uh even though i was not aware of this very latest
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:22.840]  development which you announced uh it does not surprise me in the least uh because it's just
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:29.320]  more of the same so the first thought has to do with if you understand what the ideology is of
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:35.000]  these people who have been running our government for many years is called collectivism and if you
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:40.600]  understand what that entails then you know right away what these people are going to do because
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:46.440]  that's based upon their ideology the ideology is that they must have total control over the entire
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:52.200]  population to manipulate it in any way they see fit always in the name of for the greater good of
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:58.680]  the greater number always supposedly for your own good with absolute dominance at the top and so
[3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:03.640]  once you understand that's their mindset and that they think that that's that's a very good thing
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:08.440]  well then you can predict what's going to happen they're going to want to control uh not only your
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:14.680]  health but your reproductive rights that control who will survive and who will be exterminated
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:19.160]  they'll control what you do for a living where you live how much you eat what you think you know
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:25.640]  all of these things because you become a a a clog in a giant machine so the first thought that crossed
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:31.640]  my mind was that it okay well here here comes eugenics again that's always happened in every
[3:14:31.640 --> 3:14:37.800]  collectivist regime on this planet whether it's communism or fascism and aziism or some of these
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:43.880]  other isms in in asia and africa right now that's part of part of the animal that's what it does
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:50.120]  the other thought is you mentioned it is that this is not a partisan issue at all you'll find
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:55.560]  this mentality in both the republican and the democrat parties because both parties are dominated
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:15:01.400]  by collectivists so one of the things we have to do is strip out that that concept that republicans
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:06.920]  and democrats oppose each other on anything significant so those are the thoughts that cross
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:11.560]  my mind and you know once people get the picture of this and they understand that collectivism
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.080]  is the great destroyer of their freedom then uh they won't fall for this nonsense about well
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:24.600]  is are they republicans or are they democrats doing this i want you to elaborate on this because
[3:15:24.600 --> 3:15:29.640]  you have these big monopoly capitalists to you who always advertise their free market
[3:15:29.640 --> 3:15:34.280]  but really what they want is big governments big systems to shut down their competition
[3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:38.760]  competition to bring in control and then because they are collectivists they collect our wealth
[3:15:38.760 --> 3:15:43.320]  and give it to themselves and then use the little bit they give back to us to domesticate us
[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:49.080]  then why should they even want us here in their collectivist model of everything shared well they
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:53.880]  want to get rid of people so there's more for the few that are left this is their whole social
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:59.960]  engineering goal well there is a certain element of that in their thinking they do want to limit
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:04.760]  the population because they're afraid that if the population gets too large it's it becomes
[3:16:04.760 --> 3:16:10.920]  unmanageable their their primary concern is how to manage the population it's like a herd
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:15.560]  of cattle if the if the herd gets too big you know you have trouble managing and it could
[3:16:15.560 --> 3:16:20.520]  break out the boundaries of the north forty someplace then so so there's a certain element
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:27.480]  to keep the the size of the herd down but the other element is that they need they need workers
[3:16:27.480 --> 3:16:33.960]  they want people out there producing and serving so that they can create all of the fine things of
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:39.240]  life which the elite will enjoy they want a working class and they want a servitude class
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:43.000]  and they want our women's i mean they don't want to kill all of us just just 80 percent
[3:16:44.360 --> 3:16:49.000]  well i don't know what the number is but i whatever it is they have no qualms about it that's for
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:54.520]  sure well you know the united nations biological diversity assessment 96 as a world population
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:59.880]  reduction of 80 80 is the number you get from ted turner and people but but yeah i mean some say
[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:05.000]  even more some say less yeah whatever it is if they wanted to reduce it five percent the principal
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:11.640]  is the same yeah which is total dictatorial power yeah over who lives and who dies just because of
[3:17:11.640 --> 3:17:16.760]  the numbers how would you say their programs going right now watching it closely for 60 years
[3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:22.600]  uh i mean to me watching it for 15 or so it looks like they've got the power they're steering
[3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:27.240]  things but they don't have total control and and as they build their new world order it's falling
[3:17:27.240 --> 3:17:33.720]  apart as fast as they build it well yes i can see elements of that it's certainly not uh it's not
[3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:39.640]  all in the bag that's for sure but i see it as an accelerating process and it worries the heck out of
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:46.280]  me because uh once the the dam starts to break and it looks to me like it's breaking up now the
[3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:53.960]  pieces falling out start becoming larger and they start falling faster and so this great this great
[3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:59.240]  outpouring of water from behind the dam when i when i say that i'm thinking of our freedoms our
[3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:05.160]  freedoms are being flooded out through a huge breach in the dam and it seems to be going faster
[3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:11.000]  and faster and so i'm very concerned about that we could come up with some event or series of events
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:17.400]  almost any day which they could justify they could use as justification for you know closing down on
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:22.440]  what's left of our freedoms they're definitely planning to do that it's just a question of when
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:27.160]  are they going to do it at what events are they going to use for that but by the same token as
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:33.000]  you say they it looks like their system is falling apart there's certainly a lot of disagreement among
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:39.640]  them there's a lot of uh uh infighting between them to see who is going to have the ultimate
[3:18:39.640 --> 3:18:44.600]  power and but i guess that's part of it they've got to destroy a lot of stuff to build the new
[3:18:44.600 --> 3:18:50.200]  system where they destroy everything then only their central hubs are left and so by extension
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:55.800]  by you know by the rule of heavenly bodies or gravitational pull it will pull everything
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:00.680]  uh into it yeah that's a perfect analogy i think and also you would have to remember that
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:07.640]  a certain uh subgroups within the collectivist movement uh actually advocate uh conflict within
[3:19:07.640 --> 3:19:12.600]  their own ranks you know hitler was one of those who was quite adamant on that he said it's good
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:17.960]  that we fight within our ranks because only the strongest of us will survive and we need only
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:25.800]  strong people in our movement so there's a lot of that going on too and i think that kind of
[3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:34.440]  actually pigeon holes them and trips them up a lot um well let's hope it does uh the point is
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:38.680]  i think to all of this is that we certainly cannot sit back and just wait for it to crumble
[3:19:38.680 --> 3:19:42.440]  because they've got plans for us that we're not going to like we have to fight this with everything
[3:19:42.440 --> 3:19:48.120]  we have well let's talk about what the plans are versus our plans and also how how you see the
[3:19:48.120 --> 3:19:53.080]  economic collapse engineered or not what's happening with global carbon tax what life will
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:57.880]  be like under that i mean this is the actual soviet unions what i'd call it we're going into the

[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:13.720]  watchman watchman g ever griffin's our guest icon in the fight for liberty
[3:24:15.160 --> 3:24:18.520]  so excited about having my new obama film i'll soon announce the name
[3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:23.480]  and he's gonna be in vermice's uh visible empire film so we're going out to california
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:27.800]  interview well my team is i'm going out to california separately right before they go
[3:24:28.680 --> 3:24:34.120]  for another interview i'll just leave that unnamed but uh going back to jay ever griffin
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:41.480]  in the short segment i mean there's so many questions your take on the banking implosion
[3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:47.880]  federal reserve to get power over all industry the green taxes the carbon taxes home inspections
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:52.440]  federal zoning where it says they can just take your house no judge no jury that's in there
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:59.880]  i mean it looks like on every front federalization of water gun control they're moving on every
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:07.000]  front right now is this a bum rush where we're getting hit with so much i mean why are they
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:12.120]  moving so quick right now well i guess it's because they want to tie it up as quickly
[3:25:12.120 --> 3:25:17.640]  as possible alex uh you know they they don't want to allow the people too much time to
[3:25:17.640 --> 3:25:23.720]  think about it and to uh to develop opposition can we get it all done right now i think it's
[3:25:23.720 --> 3:25:28.920]  come to the end of almost to the end of the honeymoon in the obama administration and you
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:34.200]  know in the first few months uh they could do just about anything they wanted to uh people would say
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:37.800]  well we don't know give them a chance let it work it out and so forth and they know that they didn't
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:42.760]  get too much done right away that later on opposition might be developed to it so i think
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:47.400]  that's part of it and the other thing is it's got a lot more to do with this one administration
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:53.320]  first versus another administration these people who are who are dreaming up this legislation and
[3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:59.000]  writing these laws they're not thinking as republicans or democrats they're thinking as
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:03.480]  globalist collectivists trying to create the new world order that's their mission
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:07.880]  they want to get that thing built they want to get on with it you know uh that's their dream
[3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:12.440]  and meanwhile all the folks back here at home are still thinking in terms of these people
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:16.600]  but why would a good republican do that or why would a good democrat do that you know and they
[3:26:16.600 --> 3:26:21.560]  don't get it that this has got nothing at all to do with partisan politics so i think they're in a
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:26.520]  hurry but so that the uh too many of the american people don't wake up they might get it all done
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.280]  continue along that line jay bergeron well i don't know what more i could say about that
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:42.680]  except that uh you know we're we're living in a in a time where events are moving very rapidly i
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:47.720]  guess people have always said that throughout history but also i think that it's true that
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:56.920]  because of technology uh things do move more rapidly uh as the years go by and um and i think
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:03.240]  the time that they figure to wrap up the new world order is definitely within this generation
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:08.920]  it used to be i think that they were thinking in terms of well two three generations down the line
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:14.360]  we'll get it all done but now i think they've decided it's this generation which means within
[3:27:14.360 --> 3:27:23.240]  this 20 year time span probably less than that um and so it's moving very rapidly and you know we
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:28.680]  were talking just a moment ago about what what you you know can we turn this around are we gonna win
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:32.520]  are we gonna lose what's gonna happen everybody wants to you know think what do i do how do i
[3:27:32.520 --> 3:27:38.520]  prepare what can i do for my family all of these things and uh nothing wrong with that kind of
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:43.800]  thinking it's realistic thinking but the main question is are we gonna win are we gonna lose
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:48.840]  and my my feeling is very strong on that is that we are definitely going to win this battle
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:54.760]  because freedom will always win out but the question the annoying question is how long will it take
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:27:59.640]  is it going to be in that by the next election no it's definitely not going to be the next election
[3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:04.120]  yeah how bad is it going to get and one big problem with winning is people are in this
[3:28:04.120 --> 3:28:09.800]  instant gratification give me the Wendy's hamburger in 10 seconds or i'm angry i catch myself even
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:16.520]  like this it takes time to grow a orchard it takes time to put in a garden it takes time to build
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:21.640]  a new old order it takes time to defeat it and things are moving very quickly now we're having
[3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:27.080]  great victories people need to be more positive and realize things don't happen instantly and i
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:31.880]  agree with you we're gonna win the question is how bad will it get how many of us will be enslaved
[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:37.000]  when we talk about if they win what is it like it's like living under Joe Stalin with a high-tech
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:42.760]  overlay isn't it uh gee ever yeah i think that's a good analogy yes high-tech overlay a lot more
[3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:47.800]  effective means of controlling people controlling their thoughts controlling their health their
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:54.600]  movement and a lot more sophisticated weapons to put down opposition yeah that's the high-tech overlay
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:29:01.080]  that makes it really scary but yes the back to the theme which is how long is it going to take
[3:29:01.080 --> 3:29:05.480]  that's been one of the main points of freedom force international is that we have the long
[3:29:05.480 --> 3:29:10.360]  view of history and a lot of people get very impatient with that i can understand that i used
[3:29:10.360 --> 3:29:15.240]  to be impatient with that point of view when i was a young guy i remember we were talking a moment
[3:29:15.240 --> 3:29:21.640]  ago when did i start down this path well back in 1960 and i remember back in the 60s listening to
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:25.480]  some of the old timers say well this is going to take quite a while to turn around and i kept saying
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:31.240]  the heck it is way like it in there you know i'll turn this thing around and right away well turns
[3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:37.080]  out that the old timers were right and uh it turns out hold on 60 years is a blink of an eye though

[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:19.000]  you try to take us
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:32.040]  all right let's go ahead and go back to g edward thrift and g edward fire out
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.840]  the website folks want to check out all your great films and bucks and videos and materials and
[3:34:36.840 --> 3:34:43.640]  people want to get involved in freedom force international well how do they do that i guess
[3:34:44.440 --> 3:34:51.880]  it's time to plug a couple of websites uh our commercial website as you know it's called the
[3:34:51.880 --> 3:34:57.320]  reality zone and that's easy to remember reality zone dot com we've got about a hundred different
[3:34:57.320 --> 3:35:02.680]  items there some of my books and video programs audio recordings plus we carry the good stuff
[3:35:02.680 --> 3:35:07.800]  from other people as well but that's a commercial site plenty of information if you if you're a
[3:35:07.800 --> 3:35:13.960]  reader or you like to watch videos there's enough there for for almost a year of your time of study
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:18.600]  but if you want to get involved in an organization that's trying to do something about it and trying
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:24.920]  to recapture control of our political system then you want to go to the freedom force site
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:31.000]  and that's freedom force international dot org and i can't tell you too much about it because
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:35.800]  it takes too much time to tell you about it except that there's a plan there to do something about it
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:35:41.880]  to not just complain not just to read another book but to actually acquire or reacquire i
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:47.320]  should say reacquire power over the political system of all of the country that's right we
[3:35:47.320 --> 3:35:53.400]  have to infiltrate the system like they've done to us i wouldn't say infiltrate that's kind of
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:36:00.360]  negative uh connotation to it we should be there all the time anyway that i agree but i mean they
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:06.040]  covertly infiltrated and i think in a war it's good to be overt but if people choose to be covert
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:10.760]  and we could send a lot of secret documents and i mean that is infiltration that's the
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:15.240]  american people re-infiltrating their own government well i would have to agree with the
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:19.960]  principle we have to we have to go back to where we should have been all along uh when you have
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:25.560]  got self-government uh you better be involved in government not just turn it over to somebody else
[3:36:25.560 --> 3:36:29.880]  because then it's not self-government anymore well i'll say this the government it's out of control
[3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:36.040]  and illegitimate known by offshore banks publicly now in fraud they act like we are criminal infiltrators
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:40.040]  if we try to go to a city council meeting or try to go hold a sign up on the street corner
[3:36:40.040 --> 3:36:46.120]  we all have to exercise that power or lose it that's right we have to be in the political halls
[3:36:46.120 --> 3:36:51.240]  of the nation you know the motto of us the sort of the unofficial motto of freedom force is
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:57.960]  don't fight city hall when you can be city hall and that sums it up and i'm happy to say that our
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:04.120]  members all over the country are gradually getting the the uh the idea and they're successfully
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:08.680]  moving into political groups and the system is worried they're they're putting out reports going
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:13.240]  there's police there's military there's these anti-fellow reserve people they're everywhere
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:21.560]  they might get us oh no well yeah they might become mayors of uh cities they may become
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:27.880]  members of city councils they may become elected to uh state positions they may become chiefs
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:33.160]  of police who knows they may actually recapture control of their own system that's the whole idea
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:38.760]  oh we don't want to do that and throw out the evil mayors who are on the offshore payrolls
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:43.320]  publicly you know one thing not just getting back into government and the system but also
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:48.360]  surveilling corrupt politicians legally they're i mean most these guys are really corrupt you'll
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:55.080]  catch them with hookers gambling stealing weird stuff if you just go out and surveil corrupt
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:59.560]  people folks you're they're doing evil oh you know good people are just at home barbecue and
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:04.440]  hanging out with the family these globalists are all scum and they're all degenerates you
[3:38:04.440 --> 3:38:09.560]  don't do bad things in life unless you're overall bad and you know i say play hardball with them
[3:38:09.560 --> 3:38:14.840]  too well yeah it is partly the the nature of the beast that this thing we call government we've
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:22.120]  allowed it to grow and grow and become more powerful and whenever you've got a a center of power
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:28.440]  like that it's a magnet for the criminal class or the predator class uh people who want to take
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:36.040]  advantage of others just instinctively gravitate to uh to something like that so part of our
[3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:43.000]  long-range uh strategy for success and victory that we were talking about is to dismantle that
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:50.200]  that magnet so that it won't attract that criminal class anymore yeah if there's not a big government
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:55.800]  there's no power mass or levers for a psycho or control freak to get control of it we build these
[3:38:55.800 --> 3:39:00.440]  giant government systems they're going to be taken over by crooks if they weren't built by them to
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:05.480]  begin with that's right so uh people haven't thought that all the way through they think that the
[3:39:05.480 --> 3:39:11.720]  solution to corruption in government is to make government stronger more investigations more laws
[3:39:11.720 --> 3:39:17.080]  and so forth and that's just the opposite of the solution that that structure should start to be
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:23.560]  dismantled and uh all of these tools that they have for uh controlling the lives of its citizens
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:30.040]  need to be just eliminated and then citizens will automatically start killing snakes in their own
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:34.440]  backyards instead of calling the government to do it and then citizens will start putting up their
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:38.360]  own fences and start learning how to defend themselves and start and then the wealth and
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:43.960]  money and ideas go back into the free market instead of i look at the general public they're
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:50.680]  totally domesticated i'm domesticated controlled to my dad uh compared to my dad he's domesticated
[3:39:50.680 --> 3:39:56.600]  compared to his dad i mean we really are becoming weaklings yeah well that's been part of the strategy
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:40:01.960]  and it's interesting to me because over the years i've had this i had a chance to study
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:08.120]  some of the more esoteric literature by these people you know the deep blinkers the scholars on
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:14.280]  the collective aside uh you don't run into their names often but they've written books uh they've
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:19.560]  given speeches and lectures some of them are in academia and and they wax eloquent about how
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:26.280]  wonderful it would be to domesticate uh the human race and breed out of them all of these
[3:40:26.280 --> 3:40:33.000]  aggressive instincts as they say you know and and to convert the human animal into a uh into a
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:38.600]  productive and kind and gentle thing and of course they say if they have to kill a few million people
[3:40:38.600 --> 3:40:44.840]  along the way to do that oh torture a few well it's okay the end justifies the meat it's pretty
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:49.720]  amazing how they they justify these things well the truth is when you really meet these liberal
[3:40:49.720 --> 3:40:52.440]  collectivists and they're not really liberal but that's what they usually are hiding under that
[3:40:52.440 --> 3:40:57.960]  mantle now they're like it's like yes we're going to have to kill a lot and you see i'm kind of going
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:03.960]  you know just getting off on it and the truth is their killer apes in their own view yeah they're
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:09.320]  just high functioning psychos who act like they're these egalitarians and really they're just a
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:15.400]  bunch of lunatic control freaks that that need to be dealt with yeah i think they're certainly true
[3:41:15.400 --> 3:41:21.480]  a lot of them just like that they may look very meek and mild and be be wearing bifocals but
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:26.760]  there is a killer instinct there yeah and we've got to re harness our killer instinct for defense
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:33.080]  that's the problem i found really intelligent overconfident nice friendly people are gregarious
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:39.160]  good-natured don't want to get involved we kind of just sit back and then there's these
[3:41:39.160 --> 3:41:44.840]  little greedy weak people who want to get in the power and then hate those of us that are strong
[3:41:44.840 --> 3:41:50.360]  and i found that to be the secret to eugenics is they sell it to the strong as oh we're just
[3:41:50.360 --> 3:41:54.520]  going to make the strong and the healthy have more of the world which is bad enough because it always
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:42:00.680]  leads to evil but in truth they're actually targeting the strong well yeah they're targeting
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:05.560]  uh that yeah the strength or the weakness of an individual has nothing to do with their plan
[3:42:05.560 --> 3:42:12.600]  even though they say that it does but what their plan is focused on is the uh the ideological
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:18.600]  orientation of the individual strong or weak if they if they support their collectivist agenda
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:25.000]  then they are to be uh to be defended and preserved if they're opposed to the collectivist agenda then
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:31.080]  they're there's alleged to be defective and must be eliminated so strength or weaknesses is measured
[3:42:31.080 --> 3:42:36.680]  uh primarily in terms of the degree to which individuals support their agenda but like an
[3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:42.120]  animal farm when the big stallion workhorse breaks his back trying to make more money for the pigs
[3:42:42.920 --> 3:42:48.120]  then they load him up and sell him to the glue factory so they also at the same time do hate
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:53.000]  the beautiful the smart the intelligent most of these eugenicists are like goblin like creatures
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:58.680]  who want to pull everything down yeah they get to be very analytical about society
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:04.920]  they look at the human being as a machine something to be uh controlled and directed
[3:43:04.920 --> 3:43:11.000]  you know in fact my mind just went back to that famous line attributed to the Rothschild
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:18.360]  um I had it my book but instead the the uh the rulers of uh society and they were referring
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:24.920]  indirectly to the Rothschilds in this sense they they look at man as a machine and woman as a toy
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:30.520]  I thought boy yeah that's quite an egalitarian view of the world I would say
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:38.440]  but they do look at men as machines machines to be uh controlled and put to work and if they
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:46.200]  don't work well then destroy them got programmed well I want to take a few calls for J. Edward
[3:43:46.200 --> 3:43:51.880]  Griffin Ronnie Robb Adam Greg and Chris and that'll be it we can take those five sorry the others
[3:43:51.880 --> 3:43:57.720]  but I wanted just to get your view on the carbon tax this is wildly unpopular I think it's going
[3:43:57.720 --> 3:44:02.760]  to blow up in their face not letting anybody read the bill 300 pages of it now we've got it
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:09.800]  and they're trying to pass the senate federal home inspectors and selective carbon taxes on
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:15.480]  who they want it was like Obama selectively deciding who can keep their dealerships I mean
[3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:21.080]  we're really seeing a takeover and and the gas the honeymoon is running out quick on this guy
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:27.320]  well yes and uh I certainly agree that people are fed up with all of it and this just is like
[3:44:27.320 --> 3:44:34.200]  another straw on the camel's back but I'm not so sure about whether they're going to uh not
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:38.200]  be allowed to continue because you know these people really don't care what the American people
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:43.400]  think right now they've come to the point where they just sort of go ahead anyway I mean this whole
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:49.080]  issue of global warming is a perfect example it I would say that about a year or a year and a half
[3:44:49.080 --> 3:44:54.280]  ago if you were to pull the average citizen out there the overwhelming majority a majority of them
[3:44:54.280 --> 3:44:57.960]  would say oh yes we've got global warming yes it's something that's very serious that we've
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:03.800]  got to do something about it but now with all of the scientific evidence that has come out
[3:45:03.800 --> 3:45:09.240]  and all of the obvious fact of global cooling that's been taking place for about a year now
[3:45:09.240 --> 3:45:13.880]  I think if you pull the average person they say yeah there's a bunch of bunk there's no global
[3:45:13.880 --> 3:45:18.520]  warming going on at all and these guys just want to use that as an excuse to to have a tax and have
[3:45:18.520 --> 3:45:24.360]  more power that's that's the drift of the thinking but does it stop does it stop congress does it
[3:45:24.360 --> 3:45:29.880]  stop the senate and that's the president and no it doesn't even slow them down they don't give it
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:35.080]  damn what the American people think they've got their own agenda and they have the power to execute
[3:45:35.080 --> 3:45:40.440]  it so that should be a wake-up call for people well but that's the key is that they do just ignore
[3:45:40.440 --> 3:45:46.520]  us on every front and it's clear they've made the decision to go ahead and push us into revolution
[3:45:46.520 --> 3:45:51.320]  that's what their paramilitary north comms ready for they've told the police get ready the vets the
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:56.600]  gun owners are going to attack you and it's kind of a self-fulfilling process to further destroy
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:01.320]  the country i'm not saying they're going to go with that but if they can go to us into physical
[3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:09.000]  conflict all the better for them uh it's just another form of problem reaction solution your
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:14.760]  comments on that well yes i think that they have anticipated that long ago that that inevitably
[3:46:14.760 --> 3:46:20.280]  it would come to uh to an uprising and so they started to prepare for it and i think they came to
[3:46:20.280 --> 3:46:25.480]  the to the point about uh maybe a year a year and a half ago where they think that the sooner the
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:30.040]  better let's get on with it let's close let's close the gate let's have a good excuse for bringing
[3:46:30.040 --> 3:46:36.600]  about martial law uh yeah let's go people into the streets let's get them uh you know wild eyed full
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:42.440]  of revolt you know people don't understand the difference between a revolt and a revolution uh
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:48.520]  revolts never succeed revolutions sometimes succeed and the difference between them two
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:53.880]  between the two is that revolutions have leadership they're usually conducted by uh
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:47:00.600]  governmental units uh within uh a governmental entity they have manifestos they have preeds
[3:47:00.600 --> 3:47:06.360]  it's an idea of training funding communications a strategy they have everything whereas uh
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:12.120]  you know just plain revolt is where people throw up their hands as they are i'm sick and tired i'm
[3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:16.440]  not going to put up with it anymore and they grab their musket and go out in the street well they're
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:22.120]  easily mowed down i mean the american revolution was not a revolt it was a revolution it was fought
[3:47:22.120 --> 3:47:27.560]  by the continental governments they the colonies had their militia they had their training their
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:32.360]  leaders their ammunition they had strategy you know funding they had all of that and they had a
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:40.760]  code and they had a a manifesto yes but they had leadership but their leaders uh in the colonial
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:45.000]  representative governments declared on their behalf and so forth and you can argue with some of
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:50.760]  that the point is that it was organized and that also landed legitimacy yes today these
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:56.600]  revolts that are that people are urging on the american people are just suicidal that just makes
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:01.240]  me sick to see it well i actually think a revolt's going to chew up a lot of military and police but
[3:48:01.240 --> 3:48:06.760]  the globalists don't care that would make the government the victim and then the real oppression
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:11.320]  comes in and that's why i always see these federal operatives trying to hype it but they never get
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:15.800]  in trouble folks if you're not a federal operative and you call for violence they come after you
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:19.720]  they only but they have people out there always calling for violence and saying why doesn't alex
[3:48:19.720 --> 3:48:26.840]  call for violence he's a coward those are feds folks guaranteed they want to prematurely have us
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:31.960]  launch our revolution we need to let the enemy's abuses continue to pile up well we continue to
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:36.680]  peacefully wake up the people until the government itself many people in it don't want to go along
[3:48:36.680 --> 3:48:41.800]  with it and we're already starting to see that g edward i'm glad to hear that i was not aware of
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:47.320]  that but uh it's good news oh yeah let's go ahead and take a call ronnie in texas you're on the air
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:51.800]  with jay ever griffin author of creature from jack o'leil and go ahead thank you gentlemen about
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:57.080]  a creature from jack o'leil and i've just given copies to the new mayor uh living well they're
[3:48:57.080 --> 3:49:02.520]  sharing it with my uh mike martinis and my sister's other friends at the farmers market and stuff
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:09.000]  your copies of your book yeah so phenomenal well thank you thank you thank you oh i'm trying to thank
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:13.160]  you i'm so honored to hear your voice and you can hear me yeah i've yet to get feedback but
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:17.800]  i have an effect on band from the city council i'm sure you have experience with that mr jones
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:23.240]  but uh o bgy and dr ron paul revolution of love for liberty in our sacred constitution
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:28.520]  through the campaign for liberty dot com just keeps on keeping on i had to throw that in there but
[3:49:28.520 --> 3:49:35.320]  about what you were saying earlier elitism is at the core of all of this bigotry and elitism and so
[3:49:35.320 --> 3:49:40.680]  eugenics is fundamentally evil and it's our main one of our main problems in defeating eugenics
[3:49:41.240 --> 3:49:46.040]  is the fact that there is some truth in what they say about human overpopulation i mean the
[3:49:46.040 --> 3:49:51.880]  or the population of humans on earth has more than doubled in my lifetime and thus it is a real
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:49:58.200]  challenge for survival in the future but i also agree with you mr jones and mr watson uh your previous
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:03.880]  guess that the killing people is not the answer obviously there are no here's the deal even if
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:09.320]  you think we're overpopulated which actually is disinfo at many levels some of the technologies
[3:50:09.320 --> 3:50:16.040]  are dirty and bad and may have problems and need to be perfected or or improved on the issue is all
[3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:22.600]  this eugenics isn't about population it's about control it's about restricting it's about feudalism
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:29.320]  it's about serfdom it's about a top down vertically integrated global government and uh it's about
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:34.760]  controlling human destiny and dumbing the mass down i appreciate your call the the eugenicists
[3:50:34.760 --> 3:50:39.320]  are actually trying to dumb people down to make them more manageable do you ever griffin well
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:44.760]  yeah no question about it and i think the issue of overpopulation needs to be focused on uh the
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:51.320]  evidence is very strong that in advanced societies the population now is decreasing decreasing only
[3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:56.440]  in parts of the world is it increasing i believe so the answer is you you increase the technology
[3:50:56.440 --> 3:51:00.840]  and they all know that uh jebel griffin final segment straight ahead stay with us riveting in
[3:51:01.640 --> 3:51:06.520]  finally in the news this evening it's being reported that cyber spies from russia and china
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:12.280]  have now penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:17.160]  and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for electrical
[3:51:17.160 --> 3:51:22.680]  power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:28.600]  country putting us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or
[3:51:28.600 --> 3:51:33.960]  government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:39.480]  your own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important information you
[3:51:39.480 --> 3:51:45.320]  have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available they have no moving parts to wear out
[3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:51.960]  or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so

[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:30.840]  rodin kentucky you're on the air with geover griffin go ahead hey thanks for taking my call
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:35.560]  alex mr griffin i want to say it's a pleasure to talk to you also i use uh your cd the creature
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:40.040]  from jekyll island is one of the uh intro packs i give people to introduce them to let them know
[3:54:40.040 --> 3:54:44.200]  what's going on the main reason i call it today is i just want to let you know alex about the
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:49.080]  soft kill weapons that i think one of the main things you stressed on it this morning
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:54.440]  is i went to the doctor had a complete panel run all blood tests everything was absolutely perfect
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:55:00.280]  you know i don't drink tap water stuff like that however my testosterone level was 225
[3:55:00.280 --> 3:55:04.840]  nanograms of death leader the average male is supposed to be five five fifty you don't start
[3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:09.320]  reaping the health benefits till six to eight hundred now then even if your blood panels
[3:55:09.320 --> 3:55:14.440]  everything are good if you live from middle age on with low testosterone you are at
[3:55:14.440 --> 3:55:20.680]  greater much greater risk for heart attack stroke and prostate cancer now then you think it's possible
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:25.880]  that they could be doing things already to lower the male testosterone of course i'll have immediately
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:32.520]  on therapy to replace my level no no no paul watson paul watson uh i mean the reason people are
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:39.160]  polite in texas is just 56 years ago if your roots to somebody they kill you and now men just aren't
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:44.040]  as angry they aren't as focused or it's a fake type of you know masculinus but the arms societies
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:50.680]  are polite societies the artist testosterone is lower our sperm counts are way lower uh we are
[3:55:50.680 --> 3:55:55.880]  paul watson has an article where they're putting chemicals in the water at prisonplanet.com let me
[3:55:55.880 --> 3:56:01.480]  get a comment from jebra griffin on that uh this uh this engineering of the society there's a lot of
[3:56:01.480 --> 3:56:06.200]  evidence to that your take on it well my take on it is that like everybody else it just makes a lot
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:11.080]  of sense and you can see the evidence of it as you go i haven't really checked out the science
[3:56:11.080 --> 3:56:17.400]  myself alex like you have or watson but it just makes a lot of sense and again once we understand
[3:56:17.400 --> 3:56:23.960]  the big picture and what these people are trying to do then it's almost a uh a perfect litmus paper
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:29.560]  test that you can use to come to a preliminary judgment anyway as to whether something is true
[3:56:29.560 --> 3:56:35.480]  or false you do have to run it down and uh and you know clarify it and check it out yourself
[3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:39.880]  but you have a pretty good uh feeling for whether something is true or false when you understand
[3:56:39.880 --> 3:56:45.800]  how well it fits in with the overall plan absolutely absolutely let's take another call here
[3:56:46.440 --> 3:56:49.080]  let's talk to chris and marilane you're on the air with jebra griffin
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:55.080]  info wars dot com go ahead hey um i'm i had a question for you because i was talking to some
[3:56:55.080 --> 3:57:02.440]  fellows about this uh issue but um i did some reading on one of the websites a lot like yours
[3:57:02.440 --> 3:57:08.760]  where they had said that in the united states down in the state of alabama they found a compound
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:14.040]  with trucks that had markings that looked a lot like they were russian and they were supposed
[3:57:14.040 --> 3:57:19.880]  to be drilling them to do uh civil disobedience and now let me explain this is an old urban legend
[3:57:19.880 --> 3:57:25.800]  that's been around since the mid nineties this is how they debunk us the united states government
[3:57:25.800 --> 3:57:31.240]  and others and some private companies bought tons of cheap eastern block surplus and i know people
[3:57:31.880 --> 3:57:36.120]  in bass drop you know who collect them and they got a us one a british one a russian one
[3:57:36.120 --> 3:57:41.240]  and so people show that and say it's a russian invasion a bunch of 1970s rotting equipment
[3:57:41.880 --> 3:57:46.440]  the real invasion is public deal signed to use canadian mexican troops and others
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:50.920]  to quell civil disturbances that's mainstream news but nobody will ever focus on it
[3:57:50.920 --> 3:57:59.720]  toronto star associated press um vigilant guardian uh the natural level exercise going on now
[3:57:59.720 --> 3:58:05.000]  is with troops from 14 governments that's homeland security site but nobody will get into the real
[3:58:05.000 --> 3:58:09.720]  admitted stuff instead they talk about what they heard or what they saw i appreciate your call
[3:58:09.720 --> 3:58:14.040]  and not saying you're a bad caller i'm just correcting that jever griffin your comments on that
[3:58:14.040 --> 3:58:19.720]  well again i'm stuck with saying what you said alec that's certainly true uh you get a lot of
[3:58:19.720 --> 3:58:24.840]  disinformation out there and unfortunately people will run with it because it's has the grains of
[3:58:24.840 --> 3:58:30.280]  truth but uh no you're absolutely right uh the real threat is not from a bunch of old russian
[3:58:30.280 --> 3:58:35.880]  trucks sitting in a in a lot for sales on place it's from the existing government and are in
[3:58:35.880 --> 3:58:41.080]  our treaties with the other countries canada and mexico in particular jever we're out of time god
