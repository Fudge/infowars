[00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:05.461]  It is Monday.
[00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:33.023]  September 28, 2009.
[00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:39.689]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:59.064]  And you notice that the establishment is launching the flu hype and talk of forced inoculations right at the same time that regular Army, Marines, and National Guard are running unannounced checkpoints all over the country from California to Texas, from Michigan to Iowa, from Florida to New York, from Tennessee
[00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:01.305]  To New Mexico.
[00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.007]  It's just happening everywhere.
[00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:15.257]  Remember about eight months ago, the RAM Corporation published a report that was big news in Europe, saying that the central banks need World War III as a pretext to bring in their world government.
[00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:18.980]  They openly brag about all their criminal activity.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.926]  And then right on time, suddenly they bust somebody in Illinois and in Texas
[00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:40.003]  Why the FBI, they admit, made the bombs, trained them, found the people, recruited them, and then busted them on the same day to create the illusion of this army of terrorists connected to Al-Qaeda, connected to Iran.
[00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.867]  Doesn't matter if CIA created Al-Qaeda, doesn't matter if
[00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:45.110]  Al-Qaeda is the archenemy of Iran.
[00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.754]  It doesn't matter if Al-Qaeda is attacking Iran for the last six years with covert forces.
[00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:54.498]  It doesn't matter if the last two White Houses admit they're running Al-Qaeda inside Iran.
[00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:57.000]  The public can't find Iran.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.903]  Hell, the public can't find their own state on a map.
[00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:00.523]  So why not?
[00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:02.625]  Tell them.
[00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.968]  I'm surprised they don't say that Japan runs Al-Qaeda next.
[00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.230]  The public will think Japan is South America.
[00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:12.412]  Lambs to the slaughter.
[00:02:12.412 --> 00:02:18.053]  The ignorance of the public only welcomes abuse from the criminal elite.
[00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:20.054]  They don't just rob and steal for power.
[00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:21.134]  They enjoy it.
[00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:22.474]  They laugh about it.
[00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:28.976]  They write books about how dumb the public is and how funny all of this is.
[00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:31.437]  And so right on time, you've got this amazing
[00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:59.495]  operation where Iran opened hundreds of different uranium enrichment centers because it takes tens of thousands of centrifuges even to make a peaceful system and the UN hasn't been inspecting in the last two years and so Iran openly opens a new facility and then the media hypes it and spins it just like they hyped yellow cake uranium and aluminum tubes and WMDs in Iraq
[00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:05.808]  It's the same way they hyped that Russia had launched a sneak attack last year on 888.
[00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:11.851]  For the first two days, CNN, Fox said Russia launched a premeditated, dastardly sneak attack.
[00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:18.274]  Of course, then it came out that it was the complete opposite.
[00:03:18.274 --> 00:03:28.079]  That NATO-backed forces in Georgia had launched a sneak attack on peacekeepers in South Ossetia and on the borders of the militarized zone Abkhazia.
[00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:31.712]  Facts are facts.
[00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:36.775]  The lies are so big it's like calling the moon the sun and the sun the moon.
[00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:47.122]  And saying the sun is solid rock and the moon at night is what really is radiating the sun's rays.
[00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:47.763]  And it works!
[00:03:47.763 --> 00:03:50.805]  If they told the public that the moon was actually the sun, they'd believe it.
[00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:54.427]  I mean, they tell the public carbon dioxide's a deadly nerve gas.
[00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:57.149]  Doesn't matter if trees breathe it and put off oxygen that we breathe.
[00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.982]  Large portions of the public believe carbon dioxide is a deadly nerve agent, a toxic chemical, a weapon, an ultimate weapon.
[00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:12.103]  Pretty soon, they'll probably attack Iran and say they're putting off carbon dioxide.
[00:04:12.103 --> 00:04:15.384]  The public will run screaming in fear in all directions.
[00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:24.487]  They'll throw their children on the author of Moloch to the government, begging the CPS to take more of their children or inject them with deadly mercury-filled, adjuvant-filled vaccines.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.840]  It's amazing.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.341]  So I'm going to break all this down today.
[00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.382]  They are definitely getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:37.024]  Mainstream media says the hit is on.
[00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:41.687]  Same propaganda they use in Iraq.
[00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:43.467]  We'll break it all down coming up today.
[00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:48.750]  Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, then we got Mike Adams, the health ranger, on with the latest flu developments.
[00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.851]  Big show today.
[00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.832]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:53.832 --> 00:05:00.837]  We got news coming up on one of our reporters getting arrested, Rob Dew at the G20, as they openly announce world government and further raping of the slaves.
[00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:07.822]  Millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:05:07.822 --> 00:05:13.907]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks, or the book for ten bucks.
[00:05:13.907 --> 00:05:16.549]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.134]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:27.198]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:32.582]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:05:32.802 --> 00:05:34.884]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:36.645]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:39.167]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:43.910]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.613]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.735]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:52.636]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:54.758]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:02.950]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.492]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:06:05.492 --> 00:06:08.074]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:09.315]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:11.036]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:13.918]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:17.561]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:26.775]  An inside job!
[00:06:26.775 --> 00:06:27.356]  An inside job!
[00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.501]  How dare you?
[00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:43.385]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:46.287]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:52.492]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:00.338]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:04.565]  Remain in your houses.
[00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:10.350]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.712]  Will they do it?
[00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:14.314]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[00:07:14.314 --> 00:07:20.280]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.961]  Think it can't happen here?
[00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:27.243]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[00:07:27.243 --> 00:07:32.125]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:37.027]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:41.849]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:51.197]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.

[00:07:56.761 --> 00:07:59.683]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:21.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:25.399]  Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson will both join us.
[00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:28.680]  Kurt Nemo of InfoWars.com, Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:34.463]  Kind of a roundtable discussion coming up in the second hour today.
[00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:38.586]  We'll also open the phones up on the situation with Iran.
[00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:42.648]  Let's go ahead and get Ray McGovern back on too.
[00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:44.089]  Let's line him up in the next few days.
[00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:50.953]  And we'll go over all of that throughout the week.
[00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:56.116]  Attack on Iran appears imminent.
[00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:59.358]  And the media keeps spinning it that they have secret enrichment plants.
[00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:08.128]  It takes, again, thousands and thousands and thousands of centrifuges, scores of plants to do this.
[00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:11.629]  They've publicly admitted they've built plants all over the country.
[00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:16.692]  The inspectors admit they're the type that do not create weapons-level fissile material.
[00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:18.693]  But none of the facts bother the public.
[00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:29.623]  Remember, they told you that Iraq had centrifuges and had a nuke and yellow cake from Niger, Africa, and it just goes on and on.
[00:09:29.623 --> 00:09:34.804]  All lies, all planted.
[00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:38.185]  Is this going to be the big October surprise?
[00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:43.626]  The November, the December surprise?
[00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:46.307]  Israel's saying they're probably going to go ahead and hit Iran.
[00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:53.976]  We're getting bizarre comments from Zbigniew Brzezinski about shooting down Israeli aircraft if they try it.
[00:09:53.976 --> 00:10:02.979]  Giant stack of very, very important news, and this affects all of us that live on this planet, because if Iran is struck, it is not going to go like Iraq.
[00:10:02.979 --> 00:10:09.961]  All of the experts on both sides of the fence, pro-war and anti-war, come out with the same answers.
[00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.743]  We may not have to be too worried about staged terror attacks,
[00:10:16.445 --> 00:10:20.606]  If Iran is struck, they will strike back, and they're saying they are.
[00:10:20.606 --> 00:10:26.728]  And they do have real sleeper teams all over the Western world, especially Europe.
[00:10:26.728 --> 00:10:28.548]  And it is not going to be pretty.
[00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:31.149]  Get ready for scores of U.S.
[00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:37.310]  military bases to have giant truck bombs full of plastic explosive driven into them.
[00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.071]  Just get ready for hell.
[00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:51.655]  And what do you expect Iran to do when the biggest military on earth and the fourth most powerful military on earth, the Israelis, start blowing the hell out of them?
[00:10:51.655 --> 00:10:53.657]  And look, let's get one thing straight.
[00:10:53.657 --> 00:10:56.820]  I'm just as tribal as the next person.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.600]  At a certain level,
[00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:03.982]  I'm a lot more worried about my family than I am the Iranians and their poor people.
[00:11:03.982 --> 00:11:13.244]  I mean, I feel for the 1,300,000 dead Iraqis from the last six and a half years of bombardment and siege and occupation and mass murder.
[00:11:13.244 --> 00:11:24.526]  They've been under siege for 18 years total, almost 19 years, started in 1991, late 1990 with Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
[00:11:24.526 --> 00:11:28.887]  But this is just terrible.
[00:11:31.064 --> 00:11:35.587]  More and more I'm just speechless.
[00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:38.829]  And I think about all the things that have been done to Iran.
[00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:46.395]  Iran that invented modern mathematics, that invented our alphabet that we use.
[00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:54.140]  Our alphabet is the Iranian alphabet, not the Roman.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.001]  They're good people.
[00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:58.162]  It's a first-world nation.
[00:11:58.162 --> 00:12:04.945]  They were pro-USA, anti-communist, anti-Russian.
[00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:08.826]  Mohamed Mozadek was Time Magazine Man of the Year.
[00:12:08.826 --> 00:12:15.989]  But he would not let British Petroleum, formerly Anglo-American Oil, have a total monopoly.
[00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:19.831]  He said, we want 25% of the money for our people.
[00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:35.731]  And so they staged with the CIA and the MI6, British Intelligence, Her Majesty's Secret Service, terror attacks in 1953, blamed it on Mosaddegh, said he was blowing up mosques because he was anti-Muslim extremist.
[00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:40.676]  Of course, he wasn't blowing up mosques, and the CIA has now declassified this in 1999.
[00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:45.641]  It was already known by historians, but declassified 10 years ago.
[00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:52.307]  And they killed a lot of people and shot up crowds and said that his police were doing it.
[00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:56.090]  And then they took his ministers and chopped their heads off and put him in prison for the rest of his life.
[00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.832]  I covered that in Terror Storm.
[00:12:58.832 --> 00:13:10.801]  And the West is constantly bombing their ships, their battleships routinely, blowing up their plants, bombing them, shooting down their aircraft, shooting down their jumbo jets.
[00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:14.864]  And they've been inside Iran for at least six years staging terror attacks.
[00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:15.925]  That's been declassified.
[00:13:17.108 --> 00:13:18.288]  Trying to overthrow the government.
[00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:22.409]  They've got four different Sunni, Wahhabi, Al-Qaeda groups.
[00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:25.610]  One headed up by the number three in Al-Qaeda, under White House funding.
[00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.571]  The White House bragged about this three years ago, staging terror attacks against them.
[00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:38.354]  The government and the media thinks the American people are so stupid that they get on the news and say that Iran is running Al-Qaeda.
[00:13:38.354 --> 00:13:46.736]  Remember two and a half years ago, the President, the puppet President,
[00:13:48.186 --> 00:14:03.362]  Mohammed Karzai of Afghanistan was in the Rose Garden at a press conference with George W. Bush, and Bush said, you've been doing a great job fighting Al-Qaeda, Taliban, and Iran backing both groups.
[00:14:03.362 --> 00:14:10.289]  And Karzai knew that over a billion dollars had been given to him in just the previous year by Iran, and that Iran was Shiite.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:21.788]  And that they were using Iranian secret police, who knew how to track the groups, to go after real Al-Qaeda and arrest them.
[00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:26.712]  Because the West was using Al-Qaeda and Taliban to menace Karzai when he got out of line.
[00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:29.014]  Part of their divide and conquer balkanization scheme.
[00:14:29.014 --> 00:14:31.836]  They don't want a strong president over there, even if he's a puppet.
[00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:35.620]  And he said, Mr. President, I respectfully apologize, but I must correct you.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.883]  Iran is our quote, greatest ally fighting Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
[00:14:39.883 --> 00:14:40.864]  Sir, they are Shiite.
[00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.538]  And Bush said, no, you are wrong.
[00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:46.818]  We ought to pull that clip up.
[00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:48.539]  He said, no, you are wrong.
[00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:52.501]  And Karzai literally turned red and shut up.
[00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:58.003]  Then he fell out of favor with the West at that point, even though he was the Unicole executive and was put in power.
[00:14:58.003 --> 00:15:01.765]  They got the pipelines in and the opium flowing.
[00:15:01.765 --> 00:15:07.248]  So all of that went on.
[00:15:07.248 --> 00:15:10.089]  And that just shows how stupid they think the American people are.
[00:15:11.448 --> 00:15:30.754]  Because in Central Asia and in the Middle East, it is as well known that the Shiites are Iranian-based, 20% of Islam, and that the other 80%, roughly, there's another subgroup that's less than 1%, kind of a... Well, that's a side issue.
[00:15:30.754 --> 00:15:33.635]  The point is, is that we want to get technical.
[00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:33.935]  79% are Sunni.
[00:15:41.452 --> 00:15:46.476]  20% are Shiite and 1% are a couple other subgroups.
[00:15:46.476 --> 00:16:10.476]  But that would be like if Mohammed Karzai came to the United States and at the Rose Garden said, John McCain is a Democrat and Barack Obama is a Republican, Bush would correct him and say, no, John McCain's a Republican and Barack Obama's a Democrat.
[00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:17.292]  I mean, that's how ridiculous this is to the Arabs and the Muslims and the Central Asians.
[00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:25.014]  I mean, it's just... It's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor.
[00:16:25.014 --> 00:16:28.875]  Or it's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the Washington Redskins.
[00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:32.056]  No, they're not!
[00:16:32.056 --> 00:16:38.178]  And the same stuff is going on today, and it's just ridiculous.
[00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.713]  And Kurt Nemo is really an expert on this.
[00:16:41.713 --> 00:16:42.613]  He's done deep studies.
[00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:43.173]  He's joining us.
[00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:44.414]  So is Watson.
[00:16:44.414 --> 00:16:57.078]  But he's got a excellent article that he wrote.
[00:16:57.078 --> 00:17:05.041]  And so we're going to be breaking that down coming up in the next hour.
[00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:06.842]  And I want to get into the financial
[00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:13.496]  News as well.
[00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:17.619]  And of course we're going to be covering the flu with Mike Adams coming up in the third and fourth hour.
[00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.141]  We'll be taking your calls on that subject as well.
[00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:22.602]  Big new developments on that front.
[00:17:22.602 --> 00:17:25.664]  But here's some of the financial news I've got.
[00:17:25.664 --> 00:17:26.285]  U.S.
[00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:29.507]  must face Armageddon.
[00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:29.847]  U.S.
[00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:33.090]  may face Armageddon if China, Japan don't buy debt.
[00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:39.154]  And they've already been not buying the full offerings of Treasury debt that's being put out every week.
[00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:42.947]  And open announcements of the end of the dollar.
[00:17:42.947 --> 00:17:47.310]  I don't know if the public realize what it means if they devalue the dollar by a third or two-thirds.
[00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.713]  They're talking about either one of those options or somewhere in between.
[00:17:50.713 --> 00:17:58.438]  A one-third devaluation will be just so devastating I can't even articulate how bad it is.
[00:17:58.438 --> 00:18:05.644]  A two-thirds is unspeakable and I don't even want to imagine what that's going to do according to the economists we've talked to.
[00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:10.588]  Also CNBC is also reporting the biggest government bailout is yet to come.
[00:18:18.914 --> 00:18:28.246]  So we've got that situation going on as well.
[00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:32.132]  They're reporting the biggest government bailout is yet to come.
[00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:37.979]  Even bigger bailouts, because it's not a bailout, ladies and gentlemen, it's more power.
[00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:39.400]  It's a power grab.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.244]  They already gave the private offshore banks unlimited power to steal whatever amount of money they want.
[00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:53.852]  The new bailout, this is not my opinion, we've written big articles on it in the last 10 months, and the only mainstream outlet to really tell the truth is Judge Napolitano on his Fox News Internet TV show.
[00:18:53.852 --> 00:18:56.714]  And he breaks it down.
[00:18:56.714 --> 00:19:00.898]  But in the legislation, it says they'll be given power over the entire economy and all businesses.
[00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:05.404]  And the power to even levy taxes.
[00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:10.387]  So this is a private group being given unlimited power over our entire economy.
[00:19:10.387 --> 00:19:15.211]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:19:15.211 --> 00:19:19.053]  Even CNBC with another story says, be wary of granting Fed more power.
[00:19:19.053 --> 00:19:24.036]  And then they go on to explain that the Fed is actually handing that power to the World Bank.
[00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:24.957]  In fact, that's the headline.
[00:19:24.957 --> 00:19:28.559]  Be wary of granting Fed more power.
[00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.160]  World Bank.
[00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:36.716]  And it goes on to admit this is really a transfer of power to the World Bank, a private, unelected group.
[00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:39.457]  So we're going to go over that as well.
[00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:56.345]  And even AP admits that the police attacked innocent people, released attack dogs on old women on video, hit small children playing in their front yards with LRAD cannons, telling the citizens no one was allowed on the streets of Oakland, Pennsylvania or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:58.646]  A very, very sad day for our country.
[00:19:58.646 --> 00:19:59.947]  It appears the police are raring to go.
[00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:04.171]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.171]  Now, going green can save money.
[00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:11.734]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[00:20:11.734 --> 00:20:19.437]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.

[00:21:02.702 --> 00:21:06.325]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:21:06.325 --> 00:21:08.788]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:21:08.788 --> 00:21:11.851]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:21:11.851 --> 00:21:17.636]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:21:17.636 --> 00:21:21.580]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:27.121]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:30.202]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.223]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:21:59.223 --> 00:21:59.984]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:02.264]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:02.264 --> 00:22:07.208]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:15.276]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:20.861]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:27.847]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:28.127 --> 00:22:33.730]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.792]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:46.376]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:46.736 --> 00:22:48.198]  When you hear the words water purification,
[00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:07.931]  Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:11.658]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:23:11.658 --> 00:23:13.541]  Add less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:16.827]  Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water.
[00:23:16.827 --> 00:23:18.129]  Remove dangerous chlorine,
[00:23:21.186 --> 00:23:21.586]  I think so.
[00:23:44.893 --> 00:23:47.854]  And, ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[00:23:52.956 --> 00:23:53.776]  Or, call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:23:53.776 --> 00:23:54.616]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:55.296]  I'm waitin' for you.
[00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:56.117]  I'm outta here!
[00:24:15.236 --> 00:24:17.317]  It's very simple.
[00:24:17.317 --> 00:24:33.040]  We have a corrupt, elite, private empire that has studied for over a hundred years psychological warfare, psychological manipulation, and they're going to need big crises to get the world government up and on its legs and walking.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.482]  You ever watched a female wildebeest on PBS give birth?
[00:24:37.482 --> 00:24:42.503]  That animal's got a few minutes to get up on its feet to get away from any lions that are out there.
[00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:44.726]  That's kind of what the New World Order is like.
[00:24:44.726 --> 00:24:51.332]  It's given birth to the system, and it's now getting up on all four legs.
[00:24:51.332 --> 00:24:59.018]  It's already up on its legs, and it's shaking a bit, and it's just now starting to walk.
[00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:04.202]  And if it gets completely up on its feet and starts running, we're in deep trouble.
[00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:07.425]  And to get it fully up on its legs, it needs crises.
[00:25:10.026 --> 00:25:11.627]  Staged terror attacks.
[00:25:11.627 --> 00:25:13.148]  Staged economic collapses.
[00:25:13.148 --> 00:25:15.449]  Staged bio-attacks.
[00:25:15.449 --> 00:25:18.150]  Staged medical emergencies.
[00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.651]  Wars.
[00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:22.472]  That's exactly what the Rand Corporation said was needed.
[00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:25.694]  A giant war, much bigger than what happened in Iraq.
[00:25:25.694 --> 00:25:28.515]  Something on the order of World War II.
[00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:30.076]  And that is what is lining up.
[00:25:30.076 --> 00:25:37.780]  And three weeks ago, Benjamin Netanyahu made a secret mission, the Israeli Prime Minister, to Russia.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.740]  I had Tarpley on.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.581]  We argued about it.
[00:25:41.052 --> 00:25:48.414]  Tarpley said, oh no, I think Russia's making a deal with Saudi Arabia on weapon systems and they're buddying up.
[00:25:48.414 --> 00:25:58.258]  And that certainly came out that they were, but I said, no, I believe they're getting ready for war and going to get Russia to green light an attack on Iran and a green light on sanctions in the prelude to that.
[00:25:58.258 --> 00:25:59.898]  And I was correct.
[00:25:59.898 --> 00:26:08.161]  About a week after that, Russia came out and said, we're going to support sanctions and we may have to support a strike on Iran if they don't submit.
[00:26:09.212 --> 00:26:11.493]  And Israel's now said they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[00:26:11.493 --> 00:26:13.914]  So there's no more debate.
[00:26:13.914 --> 00:26:14.274]  I don't know.
[00:26:14.274 --> 00:26:16.075]  I printed about 10 stories this morning.
[00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:20.136]  Hartman, looks like he printed, no exaggeration, this has got to be 20, 30 stories.
[00:26:20.136 --> 00:26:21.397]  I didn't count them.
[00:26:21.397 --> 00:26:23.057]  Each one of them more important than the last.
[00:26:23.057 --> 00:26:25.898]  I'm going to go over those again next hour.
[00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:32.021]  But before I do that, I want to just talk about philosophy with the listeners.
[00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:42.416]  The overriding message that I'm trying to get across to people is that we're being manipulated as a society and as a people.
[00:26:42.416 --> 00:26:50.361]  And I don't expect listeners to necessarily even buy into my worldview and the things I'm saying and the things I'm covering.
[00:26:50.361 --> 00:26:51.742]  I believe I'm telling the truth.
[00:26:51.742 --> 00:26:55.585]  We're accurate over 95% of the time in my opinion.
[00:26:57.256 --> 00:27:02.259]  And the articles we write, the films we make, in hindsight are evergreen.
[00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:06.301]  They just get better and better and more important with time because we know what we're talking about.
[00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:09.823]  But even if you haven't researched my claims and found out they're true, even if you don't
[00:27:11.175 --> 00:27:13.637]  Want to believe me or you're in denial out there?
[00:27:13.637 --> 00:27:16.039]  Will you at least admit you're being manipulated?
[00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:20.924]  Will you at least admit that there are a lot of different agendas out there operating simultaneously?
[00:27:20.924 --> 00:27:30.272]  Will you at least admit that you're being propagandized and lied to and that the media lies and the government lies more often than they tell the truth?
[00:27:30.272 --> 00:27:32.213]  We are in a system of control.
[00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:35.977]  We are in a psychological warfare system that is all around us.
[00:27:40.973 --> 00:28:00.669]  And it just hits me more and more that instead of debating Republican vs. Democrat or Black vs. White or any of these distractionary issues, that if we could just get the public to look at the corruption of government and the corruption of the big corporations that control it, no one supports what's happening and going on.
[00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:02.791]  And they have the daily diversions and distractions.
[00:28:04.636 --> 00:28:14.341]  If we could all just stop arguing with each other and really look at what's happening, if you look at all the major polls, 90 plus percent of Americans don't want open borders.
[00:28:14.341 --> 00:28:19.283]  75 to 85 percent, depending on the poll, don't want new wars.
[00:28:19.283 --> 00:28:23.405]  Over 70 percent don't want more gun control, more victim disarmament.
[00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:29.708]  The vast majority of Americans, 99 percent in major polls, don't want the banker bailouts and the banker takeover.
[00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.650]  The majority of Americans and British don't want a new world order.
[00:28:35.017 --> 00:28:40.401]  Right at 60% today in Gallup polls don't want this government health care plan.
[00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:44.965]  But still it all marches on.
[00:28:44.965 --> 00:29:00.258]  And if government was big and corrupt and out of control in previous years, it's everything they're doing, every form of corruption, every form of power grab, every level of control freak behavior is just exploding right now on every front.
[00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:08.163]  And to say I'm exhausted is a understatement.
[00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:11.665]  I'm probably going to take some time off next week because I've got to recharge my batteries.
[00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:20.590]  I had my adrenaline up with the Charlie Sheen announcements and the 9-11 information and finishing Fall of the Republic and the flu situation.
[00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:25.953]  Now that I finished the film Friday and it's been delivered and being mass-produced right now, I'm not complaining.
[00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:29.095]  I just am absolutely mentally sapped and exhausted.
[00:29:31.716 --> 00:29:36.939]  Right at a time when I need my full capacity to analyze what's happening and deal with it.
[00:29:36.939 --> 00:29:44.563]  I mean, I'm not even mad at the police that beat all these innocent people and did all these horrible things.
[00:29:44.563 --> 00:29:46.264]  I'm just sad for them and disgusted.
[00:29:46.264 --> 00:29:48.746]  I'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:29:48.746 --> 00:29:50.667]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:52.068]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.068 --> 00:29:54.589]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.589 --> 00:29:57.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:03.780]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.123]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.123 --> 00:30:11.164]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.164 --> 00:30:16.166]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.166 --> 00:30:17.346]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.346 --> 00:30:18.467]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.467 --> 00:30:20.348]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.348 --> 00:30:21.428]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.428 --> 00:30:23.449]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.629 --> 00:30:24.951]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.951 --> 00:30:26.493]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:31.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.345]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.345 --> 00:30:38.830]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.391]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:41.292]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.292 --> 00:30:42.392]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:43.333]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:44.414]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:47.476]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.476 --> 00:30:49.237]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:49.237 --> 00:30:50.158]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:01.297 --> 00:31:07.341]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.341 --> 00:31:13.224]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.224 --> 00:31:19.388]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.708 --> 00:31:21.689]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:24.151]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:24.151 --> 00:31:37.338]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.338 --> 00:31:39.019]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:40.860]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:47.104]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.774 --> 00:31:56.039]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.620]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.801]  The people strike back!
[00:32:00.373 --> 00:32:03.154]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:04.394]  I've been so sick.
[00:32:04.394 --> 00:32:06.075]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:32:06.075 --> 00:32:07.936]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:32:07.936 --> 00:32:14.058]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:32:14.058 --> 00:32:19.960]  Fight back with our all natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.462]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:32:24.462 --> 00:32:25.422]  We use results.
[00:32:25.862 --> 00:32:30.627]  LifeChangeT's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:32:30.627 --> 00:32:35.252]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:32:35.252 --> 00:32:39.116]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:32:39.116 --> 00:32:43.000]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.621]  Our number is 928-308-0408.
[00:32:47.944 --> 00:32:51.886]  Again, that's 928-308-0408.
[00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:54.707]  Or you can order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:32:54.707 --> 00:32:57.248]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:32:57.248 --> 00:32:59.849]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:33:37.495 --> 00:34:00.957]  It's very disconcerting to know the truth, to know that you're right, to know that we have a scientific dictatorship in control of our society, to know that their evil knows no limits, that it's bottomless, fathomless,
[00:34:03.004 --> 00:34:10.351]  And to know that we really are in a world government run by eugenicists and they really are poisoning people with the vaccines, water, food, and air.
[00:34:10.351 --> 00:34:16.437]  And to know that all the evils we've seen the last hundred years, in their own words, were only a beta test.
[00:34:16.437 --> 00:34:18.900]  Because this is a scientific dictatorship.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.163]  They say Iraq and Afghanistan are laboratories.
[00:34:22.163 --> 00:34:25.246]  They bragged in the news that what happened
[00:34:27.478 --> 00:34:34.704]  Last week at the G20 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a laboratory test of the people, the police, and the military.
[00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:37.126]  I don't like being tested.
[00:34:37.126 --> 00:34:41.069]  I don't like being manipulated.
[00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:42.610]  I don't like being conned.
[00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:47.374]  I don't like control freaks and bad people getting away with evil over and over again.
[00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:55.250]  I want to open the phones up for listeners on the subject of Iran, the flu, the G20, the economy.
[00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.891]  The New World Order is here.
[00:34:56.891 --> 00:34:57.971]  It's not coming anymore.
[00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:58.571]  We're in it.
[00:34:58.571 --> 00:35:00.371]  They've openly announced it.
[00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:07.973]  We are now sliding down the hill into all the hopes and dreams of the globalists.
[00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:09.653]  They're having their way.
[00:35:09.653 --> 00:35:11.413]  They're succeeding.
[00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:15.514]  Now, yes, people are waking up in record numbers and people are upset and people
[00:35:17.668 --> 00:35:21.992]  Are listening more and more to what we have to say.
[00:35:21.992 --> 00:35:24.594]  But I liken it to the couple car wrecks I've been in.
[00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:35.184]  I've been in a few car wrecks, always in rain, when you start hydroplaning and then you run off a ditch and the car starts flipping.
[00:35:35.184 --> 00:35:37.206]  That happened when I was 16.
[00:35:37.206 --> 00:35:41.770]  We were freezing our butts off at my family ranch two hours south of Dallas.
[00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.350]  It was about 1 a.m.
[00:35:44.974 --> 00:35:47.695]  We went back to the ranch house, called our girlfriends.
[00:35:47.695 --> 00:35:48.715]  They were going to sneak out.
[00:35:48.715 --> 00:35:50.096]  We could get back at 3 a.m.
[00:35:50.096 --> 00:35:58.139]  And I said, OK, let's get in the car and drive back to Dallas.
[00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:00.259]  And I was driving.
[00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:01.340]  And I said, I want to go to sleep.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.380]  My buddy said, I'll drive.
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:07.642]  And he was driving along, listening to Megadeth, Metallica.
[00:36:07.642 --> 00:36:08.703]  We were coming into Dallas.
[00:36:08.703 --> 00:36:09.603]  It was raining real hard.
[00:36:09.603 --> 00:36:12.544]  And there's these big embankments on I-45 right before we get into Dallas.
[00:36:14.104 --> 00:36:15.064]  And he kept trying to wake me up.
[00:36:15.064 --> 00:36:16.285]  He said, look, I can't stay awake.
[00:36:16.285 --> 00:36:16.985]  I can't stay awake.
[00:36:16.985 --> 00:36:17.785]  And I said, you're fine.
[00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:19.506]  Just keep driving.
[00:36:19.506 --> 00:36:26.209]  And then I woke up as the car was spinning down the highway and went rolling down the side, flipping, but thank God we had our seatbelts on.
[00:36:26.209 --> 00:36:38.433]  I remember being an upside down as rock and roll music was playing and rain was pouring through the broken windows down in the ditch in about two feet of water.
[00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:42.135]  And I remember those two or three seconds as I woke up, we were spinning off the highway.
[00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.671]  Thinking, man, I wish I could get out of this.
[00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:49.173]  I wish this wasn't happening.
[00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:56.318]  And then I guess about four or five years ago, time flies, I was out visiting family in Fredericksburg, Texas, big, beautiful, sunny summer day.
[00:36:56.318 --> 00:37:01.862]  And storms were blowing in and my aunt said, you better get going.
[00:37:01.862 --> 00:37:08.767]  So we got in our cars, we were in two cars, my dad and I driving in one, and my mother, my wife, and my two children at the time.
[00:37:10.199 --> 00:37:20.883]  Left about five minutes earlier than us and it was almost blowing us off the road when we got past Fredericksburg into close to Johnson City, I guess Stonewall.
[00:37:20.883 --> 00:37:25.884]  So I slowed down to about 50 and then 45 and then 40, probably saved our lives.
[00:37:25.884 --> 00:37:28.285]  And all of a sudden we just got picked up and thrown off the road.
[00:37:28.285 --> 00:37:32.687]  And when the state police got there, they told us, you didn't know you got hit by a tornado?
[00:37:32.687 --> 00:37:35.008]  Look, look at that barn 100, 200 yards away.
[00:37:35.008 --> 00:37:36.188]  It's completely knocked down.
[00:37:39.853 --> 00:37:49.738]  But, in this case, as we're driving, we didn't just spin off the road, we got picked up, turned around backwards, and thrown off another 20-30 foot embankment.
[00:37:49.738 --> 00:37:56.662]  And as I looked over to my dad, it seemed like a minute or two, it was really only about five seconds, I said, brace for impact.
[00:37:56.662 --> 00:38:00.724]  I could even hear my voice going, brace for impact.
[00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:04.449]  My dad thought that was kind of neat after the wreck.
[00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:06.831]  You were pretty calm when that happened.
[00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:08.692]  Boy, time slowed down, didn't it?
[00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:12.716]  And we spun around backwards, shot down the hill like a slingshot.
[00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:16.158]  You know, big, big, steep embankment.
[00:38:16.158 --> 00:38:24.044]  Down into a creek bottom and flew across the creek into three big oak trees.
[00:38:24.044 --> 00:38:30.769]  And it smashed in over a third of the Tahoe all the way back to our front seats and broke our seats.
[00:38:30.769 --> 00:38:31.350]  Seats broke.
[00:38:34.502 --> 00:38:35.743]  My dad got a concussion from it.
[00:38:35.743 --> 00:38:38.205]  I didn't get hurt.
[00:38:38.205 --> 00:38:45.832]  But it's the same feeling, but even more slow motion.
[00:38:45.832 --> 00:38:49.515]  I mean, I know they're putting poison in the water, got their own documents.
[00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:51.857]  I know they're putting poison in the vaccines.
[00:38:51.857 --> 00:38:55.320]  I know the police and military and FBI and government people aren't my enemies.
[00:38:57.304 --> 00:39:10.573]  I know even though they've been trained that we are and they're macho and think they're winners and have a distorted, twisted warrior spirit of adrenaline and they think it's cute to bite old ladies with police dogs and beat up young girls on bikes.
[00:39:10.573 --> 00:39:18.558]  And at a sick level I can go, well at least they're taking the vaccines, at least they're drinking the water, at least they think they're part of the system, but at least they're getting burned by their own system.
[00:39:18.558 --> 00:39:20.339]  But I actually don't take any pleasure in it.
[00:39:21.383 --> 00:39:25.244]  At a sick level, there's kind of a shadow of that.
[00:39:25.244 --> 00:39:29.046]  I can intellectually analyze that angle.
[00:39:29.046 --> 00:39:34.548]  And I know they're going to get hurt by the banking collapse and they're going to get hurt by everything.
[00:39:34.548 --> 00:39:42.290]  And maybe two or three, four years ago, I kind of didn't feel powerless because at a sick level of my psyche, I could say, well, at least they're going to get hurt by their own system.
[00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.191]  But I don't even have that anymore.
[00:39:44.191 --> 00:39:46.752]  I don't even hate them.
[00:39:46.752 --> 00:39:48.913]  Because I understand they don't know what they do.
[00:39:48.913 --> 00:39:49.673]  I understand that
[00:39:50.578 --> 00:39:54.659]  They perish for lack of knowledge, and I just wish they'd wake up.
[00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.480]  Because I know I'm telling the truth.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.961]  I know this is real.
[00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:10.984]  And I'm here in this truck, spun around backwards, flying down an embankment, just praying that we don't hit those trees on the side of the truck, knowing I'm gonna die.
[00:40:10.984 --> 00:40:14.225]  I mean, it all flashed in my mind, and my life flashed in my mind.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.325]  And I remember just thinking, well, at least my kids are going to go on and live after me, and at least I've been a good person.
[00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:24.809]  And I thought, man, I hope it doesn't kill my dad.
[00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:30.955]  I hope, because I could see the trees as we were spinning around backwards.
[00:40:30.955 --> 00:40:37.101]  In a split second, my mind could pull up what I'd seen forwards, that it was a big cliff and trees and a gully down there.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.541]  And I just remember when I knew that I was on the verge of possible death, all I cared about was my family and my father.
[00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:54.683]  And I just hoped that if anybody got killed or hurt real bad, it was me.
[00:40:54.683 --> 00:40:58.024]  And that wasn't because I'm some hero or some even good person.
[00:40:58.024 --> 00:41:00.564]  It's because I've got basic instincts.
[00:41:00.564 --> 00:41:03.125]  Basic instinct means I don't want my tribe to be hurt.
[00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:04.885]  I don't want my people to be hurt.
[00:41:04.885 --> 00:41:07.606]  I don't want anybody to be living like this.
[00:41:07.606 --> 00:41:10.667]  And I don't understand how I can have this stuff all figured out
[00:41:11.997 --> 00:41:13.138]  And other people can.
[00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.319]  I mean, I don't have some lofty view of myself.
[00:41:15.319 --> 00:41:17.580]  I don't think of myself as special.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.742]  How the hell can you not know?
[00:41:21.742 --> 00:41:32.607]  I went back in the break room to get some water during the last break, and there was a Bayer Pharmaceuticals ad telling everybody how great Bayer is.
[00:41:32.607 --> 00:41:33.508]  It was a one-minute ad.
[00:41:33.508 --> 00:41:34.929]  I watched the whole thing in the break room.
[00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:43.309]  About all the great things they do for science and all the great products they've got for vaccines and aspirin, how good they are and how much they love you.
[00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:49.216]  And it ended with the Bayer logo blazing in green.
[00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:52.781]  Bayer logo is basically the aspirin tablet.
[00:41:57.759 --> 00:42:04.183]  And then a whole data dump of info flashed in my mind on that, and it came back to me what I was thinking as I drove into work.
[00:42:04.183 --> 00:42:10.467]  I was thinking about Bayer Pharmaceutical, making roughly one-fifth of the H1N1 vaccine worldwide.
[00:42:10.467 --> 00:42:13.028]  I know it's one-fifth in Europe and the U.S.
[00:42:13.028 --> 00:42:14.709]  I don't know what it is worldwide.
[00:42:14.709 --> 00:42:16.831]  I know in the West they're making one-fifth of it at least.
[00:42:16.831 --> 00:42:19.552]  They got the contract for one-fifth.
[00:42:19.552 --> 00:42:20.513]  They produced one-fifth.
[00:42:20.513 --> 00:42:26.437]  And I was driving in this morning, and I was looking at cars and people and light pole cameras and
[00:42:27.543 --> 00:42:38.505]  Chemtrails and the surveillance and the control grid and how I was just driving along in this engineered, designed technocracy, this technological enslavement grid.
[00:42:38.505 --> 00:42:41.906]  Slave grid.
[00:42:41.906 --> 00:42:45.867]  Technological enslavement system.
[00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:55.249]  And I was driving along and I just had love for the people in their cars and for the police I drove by with their stupid little radar guns out there raising money and
[00:42:59.614 --> 00:43:04.055]  Saw an eagle on a light pole.
[00:43:04.055 --> 00:43:09.617]  It's watching for its prey and the surveillance camera a hundred yards away was watching for its prey.
[00:43:09.617 --> 00:43:28.162]  And I just thought about how they admit in New York Daily News that the CPS comes to, because they get the call in New York especially, it's where eugenics started in this country, and now it was in the New York Papers three or four years ago, quite a few articles we had guests on about it.
[00:43:29.562 --> 00:43:40.829]  And the chemical companies, not just drug companies, say, we need 8 and 9 year olds for our studies.
[00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:56.859]  And the CPS goes out with a quota, they get paid, to grab 8 year olds, and then how they went to these especially black women, because the black community has been in this control grid longer than anybody else, and they've been trained to turn their children over since they got off the slave ships, I guess.
[00:43:59.144 --> 00:44:25.414]  And how they mainly, in the articles it said that the majority, it was over 80% of the kids they grabbed were black, in the New York City and New York State test, and how they take those kids and they tell the women, you sign your eight-year-old son over to us, or your nine-year-old daughter, and then these had cases and names and I got their lawyers on, and they said, we're going to take that two-year-old and that three-year-old.
[00:44:25.414 --> 00:44:26.995]  And the mothers sign their kids over,
[00:44:28.444 --> 00:44:52.519]  Then they described this one little black boy they took in and they it was a chemical test in this one pesticide test and they put pesticide in his food in his drinks and the first two weeks he threw up and got sick and lost weight and then a couple weeks later he couldn't walk and then he would struggle and fight so they they would force force it on him and they'd strap him down and they killed him.
[00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:58.766]  Now, I want to tell you something, police and military.
[00:44:58.766 --> 00:45:02.268]  That's who we're dealing with here.
[00:45:02.268 --> 00:45:07.071]  And you better get your hearts and souls right with God.
[00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:12.814]  Because you don't have any excuses in the world for strapping those little boys and girls down and killing them deader than a hammer.
[00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:20.158]  Torturing them to death.
[00:45:20.158 --> 00:45:22.580]  And I want you to think about the system you work for.
[00:45:23.507 --> 00:45:24.207]  And you know what?
[00:45:24.207 --> 00:45:31.432]  If you're laughing about this driving along in your squad car saying I'm a liar, you listen to me.
[00:45:31.432 --> 00:45:33.053]  You listen real good.
[00:45:33.053 --> 00:45:36.655]  What I just told you is a true story on record.
[00:45:36.655 --> 00:45:44.920]  And when I tell you that Bayer Pharmaceutical for more than a decade, in Australia and in France and in England and in Canada and the U.S.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:52.365]  and a bunch of other countries, knowingly shipped out Factor VIII blood product, knowing every injection,
[00:45:55.299 --> 00:45:58.861]  It's delivered by IV bag.
[00:45:58.861 --> 00:46:08.565]  Every... Every dosage had HIV and hepatitis and it killed around half the hemophiliacs in this country alone who took it.
[00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:13.607]  That's half of these people, mainly little kids.
[00:46:13.607 --> 00:46:17.009]  Because a lot of times hemophiliacs die by their 20 or 30.
[00:46:17.009 --> 00:46:21.391]  And I want you to understand that it came out in court documents in Australia and France.
[00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:23.532]  And France actually sent Bayer Executive to prison.
[00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:33.814]  That they knew it was in there and said, we're going to go ahead and ship it out, not just for profits, but for eugenics.
[00:46:33.814 --> 00:46:36.135]  And I can go through thousands of other examples.
[00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:40.056]  And I want you to understand that they took foster children and radiated them to death.
[00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:41.437]  I'm just giving you well-known examples.
[00:46:41.437 --> 00:46:43.878]  There's thousands of other bizarre studies.
[00:46:43.878 --> 00:46:46.979]  They took little two-year-olds and three-year-olds and four-year-olds and five-year-olds.
[00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:47.960]  They took them into chambers.
[00:46:49.537 --> 00:46:50.898]  You can go to the Department of Energy.
[00:46:50.898 --> 00:46:51.839]  They've got photos of it.
[00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:53.600]  They apologize for it.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.262]  They always apologize, but nobody gets in trouble.
[00:46:56.262 --> 00:46:59.925]  And they radiated them to death.
[00:46:59.925 --> 00:47:02.226]  And the black men in syphilis with Tuskegee.
[00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:02.947]  You know about that.
[00:47:02.947 --> 00:47:09.492]  And I want you to understand something.
[00:47:09.492 --> 00:47:13.255]  The globalists target you in their studies more than anybody else in the military.
[00:47:13.255 --> 00:47:14.936]  Project Shad and all the other
[00:47:16.636 --> 00:47:21.561]  Projects where they spray chemicals and biologicals on ships.
[00:47:21.561 --> 00:47:29.429]  There's confirmed reports from Bob Chapman of them killing people on Navy ships in the Pacific, testing the stuff on them this month.
[00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:31.090]  And I just want you to understand something.
[00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.933]  This isn't a game or a joke.
[00:47:33.933 --> 00:47:37.837]  And once you know that our government and the Western governments are run by people,
[00:47:40.046 --> 00:48:00.711]  Who did all these tests and studies, not just to find out what would kill us or to kill us and reduce our numbers, but to find groups of doctors and medical workers and police and military that would take part in nerve gassing our troops or releasing anthrax on them.
[00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.432]  And these are just the studies we know about.
[00:48:02.432 --> 00:48:08.173]  And then I see two different groups
[00:48:09.394 --> 00:48:14.698]  There's about four different groups of neighbor kids that come over and play in our front yard and play in the other yards.
[00:48:14.698 --> 00:48:25.046]  I obviously, or my wife when I'm not there, goes out and watches them.
[00:48:25.046 --> 00:48:32.011]  And a couple weeks ago I saw the neighbor kids come over.
[00:48:32.011 --> 00:48:33.912]  They were showing off they'd gotten their flu shots.
[00:48:33.912 --> 00:48:36.794]  Two different groups of neighbor kids.
[00:48:36.794 --> 00:48:38.256]  One was a brother with his sister.
[00:48:39.246 --> 00:48:45.107]  The other was a little girl, her little brother, two boys, two girls.
[00:48:45.107 --> 00:48:50.368]  They were all showing me their shots that the school had given them free.
[00:48:50.368 --> 00:48:54.729]  It was the regular flu shot, and they said they were going to get the next shot when it came out.
[00:48:54.729 --> 00:49:00.870]  And I knew they had mercury and squalene in them, and I knew it had adjuvants, and I knew it was going to hurt them.
[00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:08.952]  And the little kids, who I know well, did seem kind of dazed and stupid, but I thought, well, maybe that's just me projecting that.
[00:49:11.169 --> 00:49:14.912]  And then about a week and a half later, saw him playing again and I said, where's your sister?
[00:49:14.912 --> 00:49:15.493]  Where's your brother?
[00:49:15.493 --> 00:49:17.555]  And they said, oh, they're sick at home.
[00:49:17.555 --> 00:49:19.656]  I said, how long has your sister, how long has your brother been sick?
[00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:22.679]  And one said, oh, she's been in bed about a week.
[00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:24.641]  We don't know what's wrong with her.
[00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:28.444]  And the other one was so little, they just said, yeah, my brother's sick.
[00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:30.086]  He's been sick.
[00:49:30.086 --> 00:49:31.387]  He's got a rash.
[00:49:31.387 --> 00:49:34.429]  He's in bed.
[00:49:34.429 --> 00:49:36.191]  They may have to take him to the hospital.
[00:49:39.901 --> 00:49:43.702]  Those parents don't know what they did to their kids.
[00:49:43.702 --> 00:49:47.003]  I like my kids having neighborhood kids to play with.
[00:49:47.003 --> 00:49:55.345]  I know if I go over and give the parents a packet of documentation and try to talk to them, they're just going to get uppity and mad and think I'm in their business.
[00:49:55.345 --> 00:49:58.766]  So I know why you don't talk to your neighbors, but I am probably going to have to go over there and talk to them.
[00:49:58.766 --> 00:50:00.867]  Because you know what?
[00:50:00.867 --> 00:50:04.588]  I care about those little kids, and I don't like David Rockefeller.
[00:50:04.588 --> 00:50:08.749]  I don't like Ted Turner and George Soros.
[00:50:09.767 --> 00:50:17.193]  Bella Melinda Gates, who openly are involved in all this, and who openly talk about population reduction.
[00:50:17.193 --> 00:50:27.201]  And I don't like the fact that those neighborhood kids now, maybe it'll wear off, but I've seen their IQs reduced.
[00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:36.649]  Not only are two of them too sick to come out and play after they took it, now I'm trying to talk to the neighborhood kids and just a couple weeks ago they were there and their eyes were sparkly.
[00:50:36.649 --> 00:50:38.551]  They look like they're borderline retarded now.
[00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:42.128]  And you know what?
[00:50:42.128 --> 00:50:46.633]  It's really sick to be powerless, just like I'm in that car, flying down that embankment.
[00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:50.017]  I've lost control and I can't even help the neighborhood kids.
[00:50:50.017 --> 00:50:52.640]  Now the government's talking about trying to make my kids take their death.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.482]  And you know what?
[00:50:54.482 --> 00:50:57.785]  Don't force me to stand up against you, that's all I got to say.
[00:50:57.785 --> 00:50:58.406]  We'll be right back.

[00:52:02.598 --> 00:52:05.399]  A new world order.
[00:52:05.399 --> 00:52:09.542]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:52:09.542 --> 00:52:13.144]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:52:13.144 --> 00:52:15.905]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:52:15.905 --> 00:52:18.327]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:29.455]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:29.455 --> 00:52:34.382]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:42.491]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:42.491 --> 00:52:43.272]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.272 --> 00:52:44.553]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:44.553 --> 00:52:45.534]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.534 --> 00:52:46.676]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:52:58.207 --> 00:52:59.368]  You have been warned.
[00:53:00.796 --> 00:53:02.797]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:53:02.797 --> 00:53:06.058]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:10.459]  I repeat, do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[00:53:10.459 --> 00:53:19.322]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 16 books and a Harvard-trained public health expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season.

[00:53:59.033 --> 00:54:12.496]  They don't want to see us unite.
[00:54:12.496 --> 00:54:14.777]  All they want us to do is
[00:54:15.834 --> 00:54:20.016]  So they want to start World War 3 with Iran.
[00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:48.317]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:54:48.317 --> 00:54:58.083]  We're going to go live to prisonplanet.tv at 8 after in the next hour.
[00:54:58.083 --> 00:55:00.665]  Turn it up, John.
[00:55:20.538 --> 00:55:24.519]  You know, we can be angry.
[00:55:44.855 --> 00:55:53.399]  The mindless, dumbed-down police beating old women with billy clubs, coming out of shops and bags, biting on police dogs.
[00:55:53.399 --> 00:56:02.764]  We can be mad at them chasing down young women, beating them off their bikes with billy clubs, firing sound cannons at them.
[00:56:02.764 --> 00:56:09.307]  But know this, those men that did that are so cursed.
[00:56:09.307 --> 00:56:12.489]  Think about what a bad place they're in.
[00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:14.110]  Think about what they've been turned into.
[00:56:16.647 --> 00:56:22.089]  To be able to attack old women with belly clubs and police dogs.
[00:56:22.089 --> 00:56:28.072]  To fire sound cannons at nine-year-old boys in their front yards.
[00:56:28.072 --> 00:56:31.854]  Think about how they've been twisted.
[00:56:31.854 --> 00:56:38.497]  Think about the evil Bayer executive shipping out the tainted blood to kill the hemophiliacs, knowing it.
[00:56:41.223 --> 00:56:44.065]  Think about how they're damned off from humanity.
[00:56:44.065 --> 00:56:46.086]  Think about how far they've fallen.
[00:56:46.086 --> 00:56:50.749]  Yes, we've got to expose them and fight them and stand up to them and bring them to justice.
[00:56:50.749 --> 00:56:56.533]  But, purely hating them, we begin to fall to their level.
[00:56:56.533 --> 00:56:58.154]  God help you what you've been part of.
[00:56:58.154 --> 00:56:59.655]  God help you what you've become.
[00:56:59.655 --> 00:57:01.776]  God help you on what you're missing out being good.
[00:57:03.541 --> 00:57:05.802]  We're going to take your calls as I start the next hour.
[00:57:05.802 --> 00:57:08.824]  Mike, Ted, Dennis, Roman, Annie, and others.
[00:57:08.824 --> 00:57:14.807]  About 15 after, we're going to get Kurt and Paul, everybody off the rest of the hour.
[00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:20.550]  I do want to encourage listeners, because of the way things are going, this could be the last film we ever release.
[00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:22.772]  Things are getting dark.
[00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:28.335]  They're talking about shutting off the web, and I know we're getting pretty much surrounded here.
[00:57:28.335 --> 00:57:32.197]  Fall of the Republic, according to
[00:57:33.866 --> 00:57:40.552]  Matt and other people that saw a screening of it Friday night here, they say it is definitely the most powerful film I've ever produced.
[00:57:40.552 --> 00:57:46.476]  Films get better each time, but this is a whole quantum level better and more powerful.
[00:57:46.476 --> 00:57:51.080]  You can pre-order it right now at InfoWars.com and we'll ship them out as the orders come in.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.144]  We'll probably be able to ship them a few days before its official release date at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:56.144 --> 00:57:58.987]  Get the high quality DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:58.987 --> 00:58:00.568]  You pre-order it, it'll be shipped to you first.
[00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:06.601]  We're probably going to have these on the Friday before the 21st.
[00:58:06.601 --> 00:58:07.842]  What is that?
[00:58:07.842 --> 00:58:09.123]  Like the 17th or something?
[00:58:09.123 --> 00:58:09.163]  18th?
[00:58:11.385 --> 00:58:12.046]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:12.046 --> 00:58:12.486]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.833 --> 00:58:45.589]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:48.703 --> 00:58:54.585]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:58:54.585 --> 00:58:56.586]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:58:56.586 --> 00:59:05.109]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:10.651]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:12.272]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[00:59:12.512 --> 00:59:19.034]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:59:19.034 --> 00:59:30.078]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[00:59:30.078 --> 00:59:30.858]  That's right.
[00:59:30.858 --> 00:59:33.419]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[00:59:33.419 --> 00:59:34.999]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:37.400]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:08.152]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:09.894]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.894 --> 01:00:11.475]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:12.396]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:17.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:24.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.885 --> 01:00:28.568]  We're gonna be taking your calls throughout the next three hours of broadcast 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:32.739 --> 01:00:41.561]  We're going to cover extensively the open announcements of the plan to go ahead and strike Iran, the frame-up that is taking place on that front.
[01:00:41.561 --> 01:00:43.302]  Right now, let's go to Mike in Connecticut.
[01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:45.502]  Mike, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:00:45.502 --> 01:00:46.362]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:00:46.362 --> 01:00:48.563]  Thank you very much for what you've been doing lately.
[01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:49.763]  Thank you.
[01:00:49.763 --> 01:00:54.484]  I live in a small town in Farmington, the suburbs, and I'm always out and about, you know?
[01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:59.585]  And on the highway, for the past month and a half, I've been seeing so much military activity going on.
[01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:01.786]  I have a bunch of videos I want to send you.
[01:01:02.276 --> 01:01:06.361]  Armored light tanks coming in, a trail of about 13 of them I have recorded.
[01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:09.384]  Military convoys coming in.
[01:01:09.384 --> 01:01:12.648]  Hueys going up by the old military base by us.
[01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:15.071]  And they're getting, it seems like they're getting everything ready for something.
[01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.953]  And we've never seen it.
[01:01:16.953 --> 01:01:19.075]  I lived here for 24 years.
[01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.959]  And my mother and father never seen any of this happen before in their life.
[01:01:23.386 --> 01:01:25.607]  And I mean, I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:46.082]  They first took over part of it, now they've taken over the whole thing.
[01:01:46.082 --> 01:01:56.590]  Helicopters all over the place, military checkpoint videos, pouring in of military coming up to people's cars, asking them if they've had their flu shot.
[01:01:56.590 --> 01:02:06.297]  Clearly they're going to try to use the flu while an Iran attack goes on, if they believe the public will buy it, as the pretext for a domestic clampdown.
[01:02:06.297 --> 01:02:11.421]  Right, and speaking of that too, we live maybe about a thousand feet from the Yukon Medical Center.
[01:02:12.151 --> 01:02:14.993]  And there is so much National Guard there.
[01:02:14.993 --> 01:02:18.455]  I mean, they're giving out in Hartford, the city.
[01:02:18.455 --> 01:02:20.516]  They're giving out vaccines for money.
[01:02:20.516 --> 01:02:22.697]  If you take the vaccine shot, you'll get $50.
[01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:29.081]  And you can clearly see the signs at Walgreens, CVS, everywhere.
[01:02:29.081 --> 01:02:31.983]  And all the local cops, too, even suburb cops.
[01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:34.384]  They're all armed with M16A2s.
[01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.786]  I mean, you can clearly see them inside the cop cars.
[01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:42.706]  And they have new BDUs now, and just two weeks ago I recorded... You know what?
[01:02:42.706 --> 01:02:47.510]  They're not just planning to hit Iran and do all these horrible things.
[01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:52.354]  They're gonna, very soon, they're saying they're planning on it, devalue the dollar.
[01:02:52.354 --> 01:02:56.458]  And when that happens, we'll be in a depression overnight.
[01:02:56.458 --> 01:02:57.359]  And that's the whole point.
[01:02:57.359 --> 01:03:01.342]  From a military standpoint, they're openly arming and building up
[01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:04.272]  Well, I've taken pictures and I used to have a nice camera and I was filming
[01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:39.172]  On the National Guard doing training at Central Connecticut, and a military person walked up to me, took my camera, threw me on the ground, zip-tied me, and broke the camera.
[01:03:39.172 --> 01:03:40.893]  And now I'm considered a domestic terrorist.
[01:03:40.893 --> 01:03:43.135]  I can never go out and buy another firearm ever again.
[01:03:43.135 --> 01:03:46.117]  Have you tried?
[01:03:46.117 --> 01:03:49.919]  Oh, I went down actually yesterday.
[01:03:50.638 --> 01:03:54.701]  Um, to go down to Newington Gun Exchange to go try to buy another rifle and they denied me right away.
[01:03:54.701 --> 01:03:57.483]  Red flag popped up on the computer and said, you're not allowed to.
[01:03:57.483 --> 01:04:05.109]  No judge, no jury, you're just put on a list and the Attorney General has claimed this power.
[01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:08.172]  If we give in to this chilling effect, we've already lost.
[01:04:08.172 --> 01:04:12.775]  This is the most vicious form of tyranny when you're put on secret list.
[01:04:12.775 --> 01:04:13.255]  My guys,
[01:04:14.238 --> 01:04:29.564]  Rob Due got arrested, and it was the military and FBI running the state penitentiary they were putting people in, and just for asking the military for an interview, Jason Douglas was told he was going to be put on a list, so they're reveling
[01:04:30.624 --> 01:04:37.047]  In their Fallujah-type list, just like everybody in Fallujah got put on a list, this is the occupation of our country.
[01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:42.529]  You need to call your congressman, you need to sue over this, you need to demand that this be removed.
[01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:43.790]  We need to stand up and fight this.
[01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:44.690]  God bless you.
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.491]  Mike, I'm sorry the secret police got you.
[01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:52.433]  But if we give in to this through fear, and then don't ask questions or speak out, they win and it's over.
[01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:55.514]  They're getting ready to bankrupt everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:55.514 --> 01:04:56.435]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:05.580]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.126]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:05:10.126 --> 01:05:12.389]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:05:12.389 --> 01:05:14.011]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:15.053]  There is a solution.
[01:05:15.273 --> 01:05:23.699]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:05:23.699 --> 01:05:31.164]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:05:31.164 --> 01:05:36.808]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:05:37.188 --> 01:05:43.213]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:05:43.213 --> 01:05:47.376]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[01:06:00.287 --> 01:06:03.669]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:07.291]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:11.874]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[01:06:11.874 --> 01:06:17.457]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:22.521]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:26.144]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:06:26.144 --> 01:06:30.968]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:30.968 --> 01:06:37.533]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:06:37.533 --> 01:06:39.475]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:43.159]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:47.664]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!

[01:07:02.307 --> 01:07:04.309]  Remain in your houses.
[01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:10.096]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[01:07:10.096 --> 01:07:11.457]  Will they do it?
[01:07:11.457 --> 01:07:14.060]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:20.007]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[01:07:20.507 --> 01:07:22.708]  Think it can't happen here?
[01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:26.989]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[01:07:26.989 --> 01:07:31.870]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:36.771]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[01:07:36.771 --> 01:07:41.592]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[01:07:42.512 --> 01:07:50.934]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:53.434]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.636]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.636 --> 01:08:10.398]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.398 --> 01:08:11.979]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.979 --> 01:08:12.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.899 --> 01:08:17.723]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:22.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.686 --> 01:08:26.069]  Alright, we're one hour, eight minutes into this four-hour transmission.
[01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:32.393]  We just began simulcasting the Seneca Radio Show on the web via television at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:34.599 --> 01:08:43.106]  I do want to just point out that coming out October 21st, I will release Fall of the Republic.
[01:08:43.106 --> 01:08:47.270]  Each film gets better, but this is a whole quantum level above any film I've ever made.
[01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:50.133]  You can pre-order those at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:50.133 --> 01:08:52.374]  And as things deteriorate and as things fall apart...
[01:08:53.548 --> 01:09:01.577]  Uh, we will, uh, release the film at PrisonPlanet.TV early if we have to and start shipping the DVDs early.
[01:09:01.577 --> 01:09:05.481]  So whoever gets their orders in first will have them shipped to them in order.
[01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:13.049]  So the pre-ordering going on now and we're only 21, 22 days out from the film being released and being shipped.
[01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:13.830]  So PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.122]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I know we have Ted, Dennis, Roman, Annie, Louis.
[01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:24.264]  We're going to get to all of you at the bottom of the hour with both of our guests on any issue you want to discuss.
[01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:33.648]  But for these next two little short segments with our guest, I wanted to go over the Iran situation.
[01:09:33.648 --> 01:09:42.732]  Three weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago, a secret mission by Benjamin Netanyahu was sent to Russia to meet with Putin and Medvedev, the president and prime minister.
[01:09:44.403 --> 01:09:49.467]  We clearly pointed out that that was about getting the green light to strike Iran.
[01:09:49.467 --> 01:09:55.852]  A few weeks later, Russia came out and said, yes, we may have to support a strike on Iran and sanctions.
[01:09:55.852 --> 01:09:56.672]  A big shift.
[01:09:56.672 --> 01:10:06.620]  The deal was to, at least for now, pull the missile systems out of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, to get that concession that Russia will be left alone.
[01:10:08.834 --> 01:10:15.237]  The bargaining chip, I guess, was launching the sneak attack on Russia on 888 to say, we're serious, you better let us have Iran.
[01:10:15.237 --> 01:10:21.079]  Israel helped, of course, launch that attack, according to Jerusalem Post and Haaretz, along with NATO and U.S.
[01:10:21.079 --> 01:10:27.682]  forces on 888 in Georgian areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:30.223]  So we have all of that going on.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.242]  We have the open announcements of troops being deployed all over the country.
[01:10:41.242 --> 01:10:42.623]  Searching people at checkpoints.
[01:10:42.623 --> 01:10:44.804]  New videos coming in every day.
[01:10:44.804 --> 01:10:45.664]  Very chilling.
[01:10:45.664 --> 01:10:47.365]  Open talk of forced inoculation.
[01:10:47.365 --> 01:10:50.686]  If we don't get the word out, that's going to end up happening.
[01:10:50.686 --> 01:10:54.968]  Open discussion of the dollar being completely devalued any time in the next two years.
[01:10:54.968 --> 01:10:57.189]  Maybe even quicker.
[01:10:57.189 --> 01:11:00.871]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going into receivership.
[01:11:00.871 --> 01:11:05.513]  A foreign group of banks by fraud, by fraudulent means, has seized control of our government.
[01:11:06.394 --> 01:11:09.015]  They have threatened the Congress with martial law on record.
[01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.816]  Senator Inhofe's on record.
[01:11:11.816 --> 01:11:13.997]  Many other congressmen are on record.
[01:11:13.997 --> 01:11:16.378]  We cover that in the Obama deception.
[01:11:16.378 --> 01:11:18.818]  It's on record that they've been threatened with martial law.
[01:11:18.818 --> 01:11:22.860]  Ron Paul has talked about that here on the show.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.600]  This is a very, very serious time.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.602]  And the military and police have shown themselves on the heels of what happened at the G20.
[01:11:29.602 --> 01:11:32.103]  I'm going to talk about that in the fourth hour today.
[01:11:32.103 --> 01:11:34.104]  One of my camera guys being arrested, Rob Dub.
[01:11:35.123 --> 01:11:43.410]  They were taken to a military facility run by the military and the FBI at the state penitentiary.
[01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:49.776]  They pepper sprayed people and tear gassed them once they were handcuffed on the ground.
[01:11:49.776 --> 01:11:57.583]  They tortured Luke Rodowski, stripped him down, made fun of him, made fun of Rob Dues' body.
[01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:59.604]  That's what they did to everybody when you go to the bathroom.
[01:12:00.869 --> 01:12:01.209]  I don't
[01:12:23.424 --> 01:12:35.994]  This is high treason, and the military and police have shown themselves that in a mob psychology, in the heat of the moment, they will take your guns, they will take your children, they will forcibly inoculate you.
[01:12:35.994 --> 01:12:41.799]  Now, are they going to stage a new war, as the RAND Corporation document showed they wanted to do eight months ago that Paul Watson wrote about?
[01:12:42.731 --> 01:12:45.113]  Is it going to be mixed with the flu outbreak?
[01:12:45.113 --> 01:12:47.134]  Is it going to be mixed with the dollar devaluation?
[01:12:47.134 --> 01:12:48.335]  We don't know.
[01:12:48.335 --> 01:12:51.438]  But the assets are in place, the legislation's in place.
[01:12:51.438 --> 01:12:56.041]  This appears to not be a tabletop exercise where it's a drill on paper.
[01:12:56.041 --> 01:13:11.993]  It appears, well it doesn't appear, it's a fact that the real hardware assets and training is in place and they're drilling openly at a level conservatively 20, 30, 40 times anything we've ever seen.
[01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:23.234]  I want to now go to Kurt Nemo of Infowars.com, Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com, both my main editors of those sites.
[01:13:23.234 --> 01:13:28.776]  Kurt, let's tackle Iran first, and then we'll go through all of this, and then Paul, I want to get Paul's take on it.
[01:13:28.776 --> 01:13:40.782]  You've written two excellent articles, Building a Pretext for Mass Murder, Iran's Secret Enrichment Facility, and then you read in, the US launched a sneak attack on Russia, but they said Russia launched it, and then later they had to admit it was a lie.
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:46.025]  Iraq had WMDs, yellow cake, aluminum tubes, that was a lie.
[01:13:46.025 --> 01:14:05.284]  You prove this is just one of many enrichment facilities on record, and that this is another huge hoax, just like Iraq, and they only do this, and then now they put out the fake Patsy's being busted that the FBI created, founded, gave them the bombs, same MO as usual, so they're creating the terror fear again, ahead of a staged terror attack.
[01:14:06.005 --> 01:14:07.386]  Everything is happening.
[01:14:07.386 --> 01:14:15.309]  They're demonizing the Patriot gun-owning movement, admitting Homeland Security's for us, claiming the American people have linked up with Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:15.309 --> 01:14:17.289]  It doesn't look good, Curt Nemo.
[01:14:17.289 --> 01:14:18.770]  Yeah, it doesn't look good at all.
[01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:33.856]  On Friday, Obama went before the G20, flanked by Brown and Sarkozy, and accused Iran of building a new uranium enrichment plant to produce weapons-grade uranium.
[01:14:34.716 --> 01:14:36.617]  Turns out this is total nonsense.
[01:14:36.617 --> 01:14:40.960]  The United States knew about this plant being under construction for two years.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:48.605]  And also, Iran doesn't have the capability to enrich uranium to 95%, which is needed for weapons-grade bombs.
[01:14:48.605 --> 01:14:51.827]  So, in essence, this is just another pretext.
[01:14:51.827 --> 01:14:55.609]  You know, the corporate media spun it as, you know, they're building an atomic bomb.
[01:14:55.609 --> 01:15:00.212]  So it's just more nonsense, you know, getting ready for an attack on Iran.
[01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:10.883]  Just like it was later declassified that the girl who testified about seeing Republican Guard throw babies out of incubators turned out she'd never been to Kuwait.
[01:15:10.883 --> 01:15:15.648]  Her family owned the big PR firm that was paid to put the story out.
[01:15:15.648 --> 01:15:22.254]  It's just classic and they wouldn't be going with a lie this big and this bold if they weren't planning to hit Iran.
[01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.691]  Absolutely, they're planning on hitting it.
[01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:39.861]  Also, Depka today reported that, and of course that's a suspicious news source, but they reported, if you can believe them, that the United States is in the process of developing a new bunker buster that's going to be able to take out these, you know, reinforced bunkers.
[01:15:39.861 --> 01:15:42.282]  No, no, that was admitted six years ago.
[01:15:42.282 --> 01:15:48.847]  That's a McDonnell Douglas, and they have several other big bunker buster, smaller nukes, so yes.
[01:15:48.847 --> 01:15:52.329]  Yeah, and these are nuclear-tipped bunker busters, which is
[01:15:53.058 --> 01:15:56.743]  Pretty scary.
[01:15:56.743 --> 01:16:05.613]  Well, you accuse the country of about to nuke people when you nuke them and all the good old boys get a extension, Phil Manley, through it even though they can't find it on a map.
[01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:10.278]  And of course we'll all breathe that as it rains back down on us.
[01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:11.579]  Your article breaks this down.
[01:16:11.579 --> 01:16:13.659]  I mean, they've built these things all over the country.
[01:16:13.659 --> 01:16:15.300]  They haven't come clean.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:19.081]  They said, OK, we finish a new enrichment center, come inspect.
[01:16:19.081 --> 01:16:22.803]  As it opened, they've got them all over the country.
[01:16:22.803 --> 01:16:25.463]  This is just another mass lie.
[01:16:25.463 --> 01:16:25.804]  Right.
[01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:31.285]  And also, Iran is not anywhere near bringing this plant online.
[01:16:31.285 --> 01:16:34.547]  So they have followed the rules that are set up by the IAEA.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:44.902]  As far as under the NPT to supposedly come clean as Obama put it.
[01:16:44.902 --> 01:16:51.964]  But Israel doesn't come clean about its 400 to 800 high-tech nukes and submarines and ICBMs to deliver it and cruise missiles.
[01:16:51.964 --> 01:16:57.065]  I mean, why can Israel have all this and then no one's supposed to talk about it, but Iran can't have anything?
[01:16:57.065 --> 01:16:58.846]  Well, Israel's a preferred client state.
[01:16:58.846 --> 01:17:01.467]  They're allowed to do that.
[01:17:01.467 --> 01:17:03.227]  In the same way that Pakistan is allowed to do it.
[01:17:05.828 --> 01:17:09.452]  Paul Watson, another giant hoax.
[01:17:09.452 --> 01:17:12.355]  We need a headline explaining that this is a hoax.
[01:17:12.355 --> 01:17:16.699]  Just like they announced that Russia snuck attack Georgia.
[01:17:16.699 --> 01:17:20.323]  I mean, this is a giant hoax.
[01:17:20.323 --> 01:17:21.224]  That's right Alex.
[01:17:21.224 --> 01:17:28.392]  I mean, if you remember, Obama won the nomination against Hillary by posing as
[01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:38.914]  This peacenik, because Hillary kept saying in debates how she wanted to go after Iran, and Obama was positioning himself as the opposite of that.
[01:17:38.914 --> 01:17:41.475]  You know, he would seek talks with Iran.
[01:17:41.475 --> 01:17:44.536]  He was this ambassador for peace.
[01:17:44.536 --> 01:17:57.722]  And now he's involved in one of the biggest stage-managed and contrived inventions that we've seen in years, which is acting as a pretext for hostility against Iran.
[01:17:57.722 --> 01:17:58.262]  You know, I mean,
[01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:20.227]  The fact is that, as Kurt lays out in his article, Obama claimed that Iran was breaking these rules, but under the March 2007 agreement that Iran had with the IAEA, they're not required to report a nuclear processing installation when it's first being constructed.
[01:18:20.227 --> 01:18:27.149]  They're only required to report it six months before any nuclear materials are brought onto the site.
[01:18:27.748 --> 01:18:33.972]  So Iran reported it, as would be routine, to the IAEA early last week.
[01:18:33.972 --> 01:18:47.822]  And then Obama seized upon that as if Iran's cover had been blown and that they were trying to come clean after the fact, when they were just reporting it six months before the nuclear material was going to be on site.
[01:18:47.822 --> 01:18:53.325]  And the plan itself is 18 months away from even being completed.
[01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:55.627]  Obama himself knew
[01:18:56.394 --> 01:18:56.594]  Of course.
[01:19:20.905 --> 01:19:24.807]  Well, just like last time, I want to talk about that when we come back.
[01:19:24.807 --> 01:19:29.730]  He says, I want to be friends with you right when they launch the CIA destabilization.
[01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:31.711]  He says, I want to be your friend.
[01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:33.812]  They go, OK, we're going to open this plant.
[01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:36.313]  And they go, oh, my God, we found a secret plant.
[01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:38.895]  Then you read down deeper, it says Iran announced it.
[01:19:40.049 --> 01:19:50.679]  I mean it's just, but just like the public loves to be lied to about how the banks were going to use the bailout money to unfreeze the mortgages and then they get the money and say they're not going to day one.
[01:19:50.679 --> 01:19:54.543]  It's all about hoaxes, all about giant lies.
[01:19:54.543 --> 01:19:55.224]  Stay there.
[01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:57.286]  Let's talk about the timetable for hitting Iran.
[01:19:57.286 --> 01:19:59.368]  Israel says they can do it any time now.
[01:19:59.368 --> 01:19:59.968]  God help us.
[01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:07.535]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:09.217]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:20:09.217 --> 01:20:13.801]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:20:13.801 --> 01:20:21.468]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:20:21.468 --> 01:20:23.930]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.
[01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.671]  We're good to go!
[01:20:49.172 --> 01:20:52.234]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:52.234 --> 01:20:57.256]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:21.336]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.298]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:23.298 --> 01:21:25.800]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:36.771]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:39.043]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:39.043 --> 01:21:40.904]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:40.904 --> 01:21:47.811]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.861]  The people strike back.
[01:22:02.677 --> 01:22:04.138]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:04.138 --> 01:22:10.183]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:22:10.183 --> 01:22:11.003]  That's right.
[01:22:11.003 --> 01:22:13.605]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:22:13.605 --> 01:22:20.771]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:29.461]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:34.967]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:22:34.967 --> 01:22:37.991]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:40.754 --> 01:22:45.278]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:47.860]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:24:06.044 --> 01:24:07.724]  Your call's coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:07.724 --> 01:24:09.405]  Curt Nimmo, Paul Watson, whoever wants to go first can.
[01:24:16.192 --> 01:24:23.969]  From all these hundreds of articles that we've been reading and scanning the last few weeks, the announcements, Israel saying they're getting ready to attack, Israel doing drills to attack.
[01:24:25.615 --> 01:24:31.979]  Clearly they're beating the drums just like they did up until March 2003 with the strike on Iraq.
[01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:41.105]  The same folks that lied about WMDs, they are now doing it here, but not worried about Pakistan, who the West actually gave nukes to, and delivery systems.
[01:24:41.105 --> 01:24:46.289]  They want to go into Iran more than anything, just as a political cover for devaluing the dollar here.
[01:24:46.289 --> 01:24:53.314]  Because as long as they devalue the dollar while we're in a war, people will wave flags and say, great, I'm glad I'm going bankrupt.
[01:24:53.314 --> 01:24:55.375]  The Rand Corporation talked about that, didn't they, Paul?
[01:24:56.736 --> 01:24:58.757]  Yeah, that was about a year ago.
[01:24:58.757 --> 01:25:04.581]  They said we want a major new war, you know, to get the weapons trade flowing again.
[01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:23.153]  And, uh, we've been talking about this for years, but as Kurt mentioned, the, um, massive ordnance penetrator, the nucleotide bunker buster, they're reporting now that it's been, uh, brought forward by no less than three years.
[01:25:24.031 --> 01:25:31.254]  And it indicates, quote, the Obama administration has been preparing military muscle to back up the international condemnation of Iran.
[01:25:31.254 --> 01:25:34.135]  So they're getting ready for the sanctions, as you said.
[01:25:34.135 --> 01:25:35.976]  Oh, Israel's got those, too.
[01:25:35.976 --> 01:25:41.119]  They, what was it, two years ago, ordered, I want to say, 50 of them?
[01:25:41.119 --> 01:25:41.879]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:25:41.879 --> 01:25:44.520]  Of course they have bunker-busting mini-nukes.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:51.023]  No, it's the first 15-ton super bunker-buster bomb, so it's just the bigger version.
[01:25:54.215 --> 01:26:00.399]  Because it allows them to reach a depth of 60 meters, according to this article, before exploding.
[01:26:00.399 --> 01:26:04.402]  So they're just beefing up the weapons system.
[01:26:04.402 --> 01:26:11.067]  And I don't think that we've said all along they can't do it without some kind of major provocation.
[01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:20.053]  You had Robert Baer on the show about, well, two years ago now, who said that they could launch an attack inside the United States
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:45.912]  The Saudis could launch it in a false flag and blame it on Iran, which seems to line up with everything we're seeing, especially with the CIA front intel center now saying that because Bin Laden said something on an audio tape, which is completely ridiculous within itself if you study who's behind it, that an imminent al-Qaeda attack is to be expected.
[01:26:46.474 --> 01:26:58.837]  And then the FBI goes out and finds former prisoners, leads them, gives them cell phones, money, and fake bombs, and busts them at the same time, clearly to coincide with the G20 and the Iran situation.
[01:26:58.837 --> 01:27:08.680]  And going back to Saudi Arabia, with Israel, with the U.S., setting up the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Charlie Wilson's war, which is a whitewash, but that part is true.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.921]  It's the same M.O.
[01:27:10.921 --> 01:27:15.945]  That's why the hijackers were known Saudi intelligence, according to Mr. Springman of the U.S.
[01:27:15.945 --> 01:27:20.729]  Embassy, and ordered to come over here and set up, thinking they were taking part in drills.
[01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:25.953]  Saudi Arabia always helps stage attacks to go after its enemy, Iran and Iraq.
[01:27:25.953 --> 01:27:29.756]  I agree with Bayer when he said that a year and a half ago.
[01:27:29.756 --> 01:27:30.857]  We should repost that, Paul.
[01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:46.967]  Yeah, and obviously it ties in with the fact that the US government, both under Bush and Obama, has been funding Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, Sunni terrorist groups, to go into Iran and attack Iran.
[01:27:46.967 --> 01:27:58.632]  And there have been attacks on parliament buildings in Iran that have all led back to this Jundullah organization, which was formerly headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and it's being funded directly by the CIA.
[01:27:59.366 --> 01:28:02.268]  And by the way, the White House put out a press release three years ago on that.
[01:28:02.268 --> 01:28:09.812]  They're proud of this because they know the public can't tell Al Qaeda from Shiite.
[01:28:09.812 --> 01:28:14.234]  I mean, it's like John McCain during the campaign saying that.
[01:28:14.234 --> 01:28:19.918]  I mean, they think of the public as absolute trash.
[01:28:19.918 --> 01:28:21.438]  Well, yeah, they don't care.
[01:28:21.438 --> 01:28:23.540]  I mean, it's black and white.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.481]  They just portray it as a comic book villain piece every time.
[01:28:28.146 --> 01:28:47.822]  I mean, they tried to overthrow Ahmadinejad, obviously, a few months ago with this election when there were cries of staged elections, which is pretty rich when the most recent election in Afghanistan is admittedly completely staged for the Western puppet to get back in power.
[01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:50.945]  But there's no establishment media outcry about that.
[01:28:51.425 --> 01:28:55.766]  Kurt, let me ask you this, and we'll come back and ask Paul, and then take calls.
[01:28:55.766 --> 01:28:59.587]  When do you believe they're getting ready to hit from all their statements, hit Iran?
[01:28:59.587 --> 01:29:04.468]  Is there any way to stop them from saying they've got WMDs and we'll do Iraq Part 2?
[01:29:04.468 --> 01:29:07.729]  Well, it looks like mass murder by Christmas, but not necessarily.
[01:29:07.729 --> 01:29:14.191]  Recall that Obama said that they're going to impose some punitive medieval sanctions on Iran.
[01:29:14.978 --> 01:29:19.641]  Prior to, you know, putting this war agenda on the table.
[01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:24.505]  And then give them ultimatums and then it's almost like a get the popcorn countdown.
[01:29:24.505 --> 01:29:29.548]  As Americans go, we feel manly when we see skyscrapers blowing up during shock and awe.
[01:29:29.548 --> 01:29:30.729]  We feel manly.
[01:29:30.729 --> 01:29:34.872]  We may have lost our jobs and lost our bank accounts, but we want to feel manly.
[01:29:34.872 --> 01:29:36.493]  We want to see some buildings blow up.
[01:29:36.493 --> 01:29:38.914]  It's better than going to a Bruce Willis movie.
[01:29:38.914 --> 01:29:40.836]  Come on, we want to feel manly right now.
[01:29:41.656 --> 01:29:43.217]  Bomb that Middle Eastern country.
[01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:45.778]  It's not Middle Eastern, but they don't care.
[01:29:45.778 --> 01:29:47.699]  We'll be right back with Curt Nimmo, Paul Watson.
[01:29:47.699 --> 01:29:49.960]  Get their take on all this and take your phone calls.
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.140]  Countdown to the strike on Iran.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:52.421]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:54.021]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:57.643]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:04.211]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.211 --> 01:30:09.536]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.536 --> 01:30:11.577]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.577 --> 01:30:16.581]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.581 --> 01:30:17.502]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.762 --> 01:30:18.883]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.883 --> 01:30:20.765]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.765 --> 01:30:21.845]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.845 --> 01:30:24.047]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.047 --> 01:30:25.388]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.388 --> 01:30:26.910]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:32.194]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.194 --> 01:30:35.777]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.777 --> 01:30:39.240]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.801]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:41.701]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:42.802]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:43.742]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.742 --> 01:30:44.843]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.843 --> 01:30:47.884]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.884 --> 01:30:49.665]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.665 --> 01:30:50.585]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.259 --> 01:31:05.566]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:31:05.566 --> 01:31:10.092]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:31:10.092 --> 01:31:12.375]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:13.997]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:31:13.997 --> 01:31:15.019]  There is a solution.
[01:31:15.259 --> 01:31:23.685]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[01:31:23.685 --> 01:31:31.150]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[01:31:31.150 --> 01:31:37.194]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:31:37.194 --> 01:31:42.778]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[01:31:43.178 --> 01:31:47.343]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[01:31:47.343 --> 01:31:51.708]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now.
[01:31:51.708 --> 01:31:54.812]  866-762-9238.
[01:31:54.812 --> 01:31:58.096]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[01:32:01.530 --> 01:32:06.712]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine?
[01:32:06.712 --> 01:32:10.193]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[01:32:10.193 --> 01:32:15.915]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[01:32:15.915 --> 01:32:18.476]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[01:32:18.476 --> 01:32:23.017]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[01:32:23.017 --> 01:32:25.738]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[01:32:26.198 --> 01:32:31.920]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.181]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:42.725]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[01:32:42.725 --> 01:32:48.687]  Don't pick your nose, don't shake hands, and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[01:32:48.687 --> 01:32:53.569]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[01:32:53.789 --> 01:32:55.532]  Go to NoGerms.info.
[01:32:55.532 --> 01:32:57.756]  That's NoGerms.info.
[01:32:57.756 --> 01:32:59.500]  Be well and stay well.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:00.221]  Best MZ!
[01:33:12.619 --> 01:33:20.865]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls with Curt Nemo and Paul Watson, both of InfoWars and Prison Planet, joining us today.
[01:33:20.865 --> 01:33:31.512]  I wanted to, again, remind viewers and listeners that you can pre-order Fall of the Republic, and each one of my films tends to get a little bit better than the last.
[01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.328]  And Obama Deception's great.
[01:33:34.328 --> 01:33:35.268]  It's excellent.
[01:33:35.268 --> 01:33:36.869]  It's good for newbies.
[01:33:36.869 --> 01:33:38.930]  It's designed to shatter the left-right paradigm.
[01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:40.751]  It's the biggest film I've ever made.
[01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:41.912]  Most watched online.
[01:33:41.912 --> 01:33:43.593]  Most DVDs out there.
[01:33:43.593 --> 01:33:45.113]  Activists have gotten it and made copies.
[01:33:45.113 --> 01:33:47.475]  Keep it up.
[01:33:47.475 --> 01:33:54.218]  But Fall of the Republic is a whole nother level.
[01:33:54.218 --> 01:33:56.920]  It's a whole nother level.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.842]  And the budget is almost double any previous budget I've had.
[01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:05.588]  And I would encourage everybody to go check it out at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:05.588 --> 01:34:07.690]  Look at the cover, watch the trailer, read about it.
[01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:14.674]  Get your pre-order in now because we're going to attempt to start shipping it out three or four days before the October 21st date.
[01:34:14.674 --> 01:34:23.060]  I got it off to the manufacturers earlier than I normally do so that we'd have time to ship these out so a lot of people will be getting them on the date of October 21st.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.221]  Some people maybe even before.
[01:34:24.921 --> 01:34:27.262]  I can't promise that, but we're really trying.
[01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:36.004]  Also, it'll be at PrisonPlanet.tv in super high quality for all the members there to download, burn to disk, a DivX copy to get it out to everybody.
[01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:42.905]  We're getting it uploaded and ready in the next few days in case a war gets launched or we go into quarantines, something like that happens.
[01:34:42.905 --> 01:34:47.426]  I'll go ahead and release it early and start shipping it early, too.
[01:34:47.426 --> 01:34:53.288]  But I did end up releasing the Obama deception three days early because of some things happening here.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.701]  But folks, just get Fall of the Republic today.
[01:34:56.701 --> 01:34:58.701]  Your purchase also makes what we do here possible.
[01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:02.742]  You can go to falloftherepublic.com for all things Fall of the Republic.
[01:35:02.742 --> 01:35:03.642]  It is Volume 1.
[01:35:03.642 --> 01:35:11.304]  Volume 2 will come out March 15th of next year on the anniversary of the Obama deception.
[01:35:11.304 --> 01:35:17.305]  This version covers how the banks took over, what their new world order is, what their master plan is, the secret police, Stasi teams.
[01:35:19.301 --> 01:35:25.004]  The television, mind control system, the propaganda, the left-right paradigm.
[01:35:25.004 --> 01:35:26.345]  It's just an amazing film.
[01:35:26.345 --> 01:35:30.947]  Fall of the Republic, Volume 1, available at InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:35:30.947 --> 01:35:31.508]  Or write to me, it's 1995, P.O.
[01:35:31.508 --> 01:35:32.208]  Box 19549, P.O.
[01:35:32.208 --> 01:35:33.028]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:52.625]  We also have some discounts where you can get $5 off the film and you get it with Camp FEMA or the Obama Deception.
[01:35:52.625 --> 01:36:00.170]  We're posting specials right now where you can get the Obama Joker shirts with Infowars, fascism, or socialism on them for $5.95.
[01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:03.633]  That's right at about a dollar above cost.
[01:36:03.633 --> 01:36:08.677]  So you basically get the shirt almost free by the time we ship it and handle it and all that basically is free.
[01:36:08.677 --> 01:36:11.599]  So you can get the shirt with $5.95 when you get it.
[01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.461]  And that's going up on the shopping cart right now for folks who are interested in that.
[01:36:15.427 --> 01:36:20.290]  And lastly, some of the other sponsors that make this radio show possible are local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:27.775]  Be sure and support those local sponsors you hear, and spread the word about the local stations we're on, and support the local affiliate sponsors that you hear.
[01:36:27.775 --> 01:36:29.456]  That is so important, and thank those sponsors.
[01:36:29.456 --> 01:36:31.738]  We're really getting a lot of affiliates right now.
[01:36:31.738 --> 01:36:33.179]  I want to thank all those folks.
[01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:38.562]  And the great folks at efoodsdirect.com, the highest quality storable foods company out there.
[01:36:38.562 --> 01:36:40.864]  They have organic food lines, non-GMO,
[01:36:41.764 --> 01:36:42.284]  I don't
[01:36:59.650 --> 01:37:01.751]  The food lasts more than 10 years in climate control.
[01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:12.317]  10 years if it's not climate control, like in the garage where I have mine, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:37:12.317 --> 01:37:19.301]  Okay, going back to you guys, and I wanna go to calls, they'll be all over the map, but that's fine, because you guys study this stuff every day.
[01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:24.324]  Paul Watson, you were trying to finish up a point when I cut you off for Kurt.
[01:37:24.324 --> 01:37:26.725]  Continue with what we're seeing happen with Iran.
[01:37:29.025 --> 01:37:34.947]  Well, you ask her, um, when, based on when you think they've launched the attack.
[01:37:34.947 --> 01:37:37.768]  Um, I don't think they'll launch it under Obama.
[01:37:37.768 --> 01:37:46.191]  I think you'll probably see an attack, a single attack on a nuclear facility, like Israel did against Iraq.
[01:37:46.191 --> 01:37:51.013]  Um, but I don't think you'll see a full-scale war until they put a Republican back in.
[01:37:51.013 --> 01:37:52.934]  I think Obama's the kind of
[01:37:53.536 --> 01:38:01.591]  Guy to jab them and keep them on the back foot and then the Ocon administration will come in and deliver the knockout blow in 2012.
[01:38:04.119 --> 01:38:07.360]  So you think he's happy with the 50,000 troop escalation?
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:07.941]  Already 30.
[01:38:07.941 --> 01:38:09.581]  They want 50,000 more.
[01:38:09.581 --> 01:38:16.845]  Replacing the troops pulled out of Iraq, sent to Afghanistan and Pakistan with mercs, with mercenaries, with contractors.
[01:38:16.845 --> 01:38:22.647]  And that they're just going to further put sanctions on, encircle, and soften Iran up.
[01:38:22.647 --> 01:38:24.188]  But here's the issue.
[01:38:24.568 --> 01:38:27.751]  Clearly they're gearing up on a war footing here in the U.S.
[01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:32.314]  They're clearly getting ready and telling police departments that the citizens are going to attack all their departments.
[01:38:32.314 --> 01:38:34.877]  That's confirmed mainstream news.
[01:38:34.877 --> 01:38:38.059]  I would agree with you, Paul, if we weren't seeing such a massive buildup.
[01:38:38.059 --> 01:38:44.585]  And now, I said, if they start staging bust of terrorists, that's to introduce into the mind that it's real.
[01:38:45.225 --> 01:38:48.706]  That I think you may be wrong, Paul.
[01:38:48.706 --> 01:38:51.266]  I hope you're right, but I think you could be wrong.
[01:38:51.266 --> 01:38:56.287]  I'm seeing signs here that they may go ahead and stage terror attacks and say Iran did it.
[01:38:56.287 --> 01:39:00.268]  But I do agree, Iran is 65 million, not 20 million like Iraq.
[01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:02.669]  Or 21 million, it was 23 million, but millions are dead.
[01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:04.929]  And millions others have left.
[01:39:04.929 --> 01:39:07.970]  It used to be 25 million total, but it's down to 21 million now.
[01:39:10.916 --> 01:39:12.718]  That they could just do aerial bombardments.
[01:39:12.718 --> 01:39:23.467]  But under Bush, three years ago, the attack plans were published to hit more than 300 sites inside Iran with as much as a month-long bombardment.
[01:39:23.467 --> 01:39:27.771]  Iran has better surface-to-air missiles, air-to-air missiles.
[01:39:27.771 --> 01:39:29.773]  They have better anti-ship missiles.
[01:39:29.773 --> 01:39:32.455]  They've been testing these missiles that can hit Israel.
[01:39:32.455 --> 01:39:35.097]  We know they do have powerful chemical weapons.
[01:39:35.097 --> 01:39:36.839]  I would imagine they've got biological weapons.
[01:39:36.839 --> 01:39:37.419]  And Iran
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.302]  Historically lost a million and a half people fighting Saddam in the U.S.
[01:39:41.302 --> 01:39:42.964]  when they had primitive systems.
[01:39:42.964 --> 01:39:43.965]  These are not Arabs.
[01:39:43.965 --> 01:39:48.028]  And Arabs have a lot of courage, but historically their armies aren't very well trained.
[01:39:48.028 --> 01:39:57.915]  Iranians are up there in the military science publications I've read as some of the most dogged and suicidal fighters out there.
[01:39:57.915 --> 01:40:02.259]  So I don't think the globalists are going to have to stage any terror attacks if they hit Iran.
[01:40:04.158 --> 01:40:15.146]  Well, I don't think they'll be sending troops in anytime soon, because those secret documents in relation to Afghanistan say they need 500,000 more troops.
[01:40:15.146 --> 01:40:18.268]  So they're just not going to have the personnel to send in there.
[01:40:18.268 --> 01:40:22.932]  But yeah, they're probably going to conduct aerial bombardment, just as they did with Iraq.
[01:40:23.897 --> 01:40:32.604]  That's to be expected over the next few years, but I don't think it'll be anything on the scale of Iraq until they put a Republican in, again.
[01:40:32.604 --> 01:40:36.808]  Because they'll be able to sell it better than Neocon.
[01:40:36.808 --> 01:40:38.709]  Cardin Emo, your take on all this?
[01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:42.392]  Well, that's basically what happened under Bush Sr.
[01:40:42.392 --> 01:40:46.355]  with the Gulf War, and then, you know, with Clinton.
[01:40:46.355 --> 01:40:51.680]  Clinton oversaw punitive sanctions, murderous sanctions on Iran for more than, for almost a decade.
[01:40:52.475 --> 01:40:54.677]  So it could repeat that way.
[01:40:54.677 --> 01:41:00.541]  But he also launched attacks on Serbia, bombing their infrastructure and putting in ground forces in Pristina.
[01:41:00.541 --> 01:41:05.765]  Here's the deal though, if they take out any of these plants, Iran's not going to sit there.
[01:41:05.765 --> 01:41:09.507]  They've got sunburn missiles, they've got the high technology that he talked about.
[01:41:09.507 --> 01:41:10.388]  They're going to respond.
[01:41:10.388 --> 01:41:12.510]  I don't think they're going to sit back.
[01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:16.933]  They're going to destabilize the troops in Iraq and it'll be, you know,
[01:41:20.515 --> 01:41:23.618]  It's going to be human wave attacks like the Iran-Iraq war.
[01:41:23.618 --> 01:41:25.760]  The Pentagon's own reports say that.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.123]  We've had top CIA analysts retired on agreeing with that, which is what the globalists want.
[01:41:30.123 --> 01:41:37.069]  They want to get us, that's what Rand Corporation says, into a war like World War II where we're actually in danger of losing.
[01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:39.892]  So we'll then psychologically join with the government.
[01:41:39.892 --> 01:41:44.136]  They've set up the national draft boards again and they're going to have the troops.
[01:41:44.136 --> 01:41:46.438]  I think this could be the start of Armageddon.
[01:41:48.953 --> 01:41:59.034]  Well you know what will happen if they do fight back, the media will express absolute shock and indignation that they dare do anything as, you know, hundreds of thousands of their people are being liquidated.
[01:41:59.912 --> 01:42:01.292]  Well, that's just like G20.
[01:42:01.292 --> 01:42:04.373]  I mean, we've got them coming up and hitting women in the head.
[01:42:04.373 --> 01:42:05.974]  A woman's riding her bike at the university.
[01:42:05.974 --> 01:42:07.514]  They say no one's allowed on the street.
[01:42:07.514 --> 01:42:08.595]  They hit the woman twice.
[01:42:08.595 --> 01:42:14.516]  She gets up, fights back, and the media says, how dare this cowardly terrorist attack our finest.
[01:42:14.516 --> 01:42:19.358]  I mean, you got guys in Darth Vader outfits wantonly rioting, beating people up, the police.
[01:42:19.978 --> 01:42:24.859]  And then a woman, a little woman, dare push back at the police and the media.
[01:42:24.859 --> 01:42:30.020]  Literally, we could play the clip, it's like, oh my gosh, you just hit an officer, this is horrible!
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:35.081]  I mean, it's this sick system where they assault you, they shock and awe you.
[01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:38.261]  If I go to YouTube, pull up a shock and awe them, blowing those buildings up.
[01:42:38.261 --> 01:42:42.322]  And then it's like, oh my god, they fired back, you're not allowed to, it's Al-Qaeda!
[01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:48.343]  Well then, people abducted off the street.
[01:42:48.982 --> 01:43:08.278]  And then, Neocons, because their infantile minds couldn't accept that America's dead, basically, tried to claim it was all a hoax and it was staged by the protesters, until G20 officials came out Friday night and admitted that, yeah, they had abducted people off the streets by their unmarked cars.
[01:43:08.278 --> 01:43:15.364]  Yeah, but see, the Pentagon run, Michelle Malkin, who's admittedly Pentagon run, that's even her big sponsors, they knew it was real.
[01:43:15.364 --> 01:43:17.545]  It's a military tactic to just deny.
[01:43:18.286 --> 01:43:20.529]  They will, as they go, I'm not punching you.
[01:43:20.529 --> 01:43:21.310]  Boom!
[01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:22.451]  I'm not punching you.
[01:43:22.451 --> 01:43:24.734]  And it's meant to just get you off balance for a minute.
[01:43:24.734 --> 01:43:26.677]  They knew those were real police cars.
[01:43:26.677 --> 01:43:29.200]  They knew those were troops arresting people.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:33.465]  I've seen, I've only seen one CNN report where they admitted sound cannons.
[01:43:33.465 --> 01:43:33.926]  Go ahead, Kurt.
[01:43:34.662 --> 01:43:50.332]  I was going to say, in regard to the possible attack on Iran, I think the Pentagon's got a whole plan, not just to take out the nuclear facilities, but take down the whole civilian and military infrastructure in that country like they did in Iraq.
[01:43:50.332 --> 01:43:56.396]  They realize that they cannot just take out a couple nuclear facilities and then sit back and see what happens.
[01:43:56.946 --> 01:44:00.149]  They're going to take down the whole country and bring it back to the Stone Age.
[01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:01.070]  They're going to have to.
[01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:02.351]  Well, that's like Serbia.
[01:44:02.351 --> 01:44:06.374]  Anybody who becomes first world and isn't controlled by the central banks will be bombed.
[01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:12.879]  Yeah, bomb them, have internal revolutions, and if they can just knock them out and have them be all screwed up, that's good.
[01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:18.004]  They don't like big glistening buildings and sharp-dressed people and people making money and being unhappy.
[01:44:18.004 --> 01:44:19.105]  Well, the difference is when
[01:44:21.066 --> 01:44:22.568]  Bush attacked Iraq.
[01:44:22.568 --> 01:44:29.035]  The country had suffered under more than a decade of sanctions that killed a million Iraqis and 500,000 children.
[01:44:29.035 --> 01:44:31.618]  So they were decimated when they attacked them.
[01:44:31.618 --> 01:44:33.099]  Iran's not like that.
[01:44:33.099 --> 01:44:35.362]  They're, you know, they're ready to go.
[01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:43.211]  Well Iran has said they're going to fire 11,000 sunburned missiles at all the ships.
[01:44:43.211 --> 01:44:44.311]  Right.
[01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:46.712]  And those things have got a several hundred mile range.
[01:44:46.712 --> 01:44:49.072]  They've got a bunch of missiles to hit Israel.
[01:44:49.072 --> 01:44:50.392]  Israel's going to nuke them.
[01:44:50.392 --> 01:44:54.173]  Israel has said, we're going to bomb you and if you fight back we're going to nuke you.
[01:44:54.173 --> 01:44:59.354]  And so I guess the world's going to see Israel nuking their major cities and it'll be, good, nuke them!
[01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:01.414]  Israel bombs you, you're not allowed to fight back.
[01:45:01.414 --> 01:45:02.695]  I mean it's so sick.
[01:45:04.975 --> 01:45:07.977]  The thing about Iran, Alex, and the nuclear facility is that
[01:45:28.394 --> 01:45:35.059]  All their nuclear facilities are littered with surveillance cameras that are directly wired to the UN.
[01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:47.568]  Even if they attempt to create bombs, which is nuclear weapons, which is completely impossible, as Kurt said earlier, because they've only got 5% enrichment, everything they do is fed directly back into the UN.
[01:45:48.268 --> 01:45:52.371]  Well, why is Pakistan allowed to have nukes given to them by the West?
[01:45:52.371 --> 01:45:53.671]  Iran doesn't.
[01:45:53.671 --> 01:45:57.274]  These systems admittedly get nowhere near the 95% enrichment.
[01:45:57.274 --> 01:46:02.136]  I mean, it's so hypocritical and ridiculous.
[01:46:02.136 --> 01:46:09.521]  Well, it's because like Netanyahu said, Iran, like them or not, and we're by no means fans of Ahmadinejad or anything like that.
[01:46:10.228 --> 01:46:14.311]  Just like our government has said, we've got to have our standard of living lowered.
[01:46:14.311 --> 01:46:16.412]  And so they're bankrupting us by design.
[01:46:43.626 --> 01:46:44.907]  Let's take some calls.
[01:46:44.907 --> 01:46:47.809]  Ted in Florida, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:46:47.809 --> 01:46:48.930]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:55.895]  Listen, of course they're going to start all these wars, because I'm proud of Ron Paul, but you cannot audit that Federal Reserve.
[01:46:55.895 --> 01:47:02.140]  That's the source of this whole apparatus, and he's doing a great job, but they're not going to allow that.
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:06.103]  Of course they're going to divert attention and start these wars, and I'm with you, Alex.
[01:47:06.103 --> 01:47:07.064]  I believe that it will be.
[01:47:07.799 --> 01:47:09.840]  Uh, the final World War.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.123]  There's just too many things in place, uh, that fall in line with scripture, for one.
[01:47:14.123 --> 01:47:23.288]  But, uh, I don't believe there's gonna be any military, uh, coup, uh, like Bob Chapman suggests, or even my dad, who's 60 years old, I think has more wishful thinking.
[01:47:23.288 --> 01:47:34.355]  Um, there's, there's obviously, when you look at all these things that are happening, whether it's, uh, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Denver, there's obviously way more, uh, I mean, a majority of the military and police enjoy being thugs.
[01:47:35.581 --> 01:47:35.802]  And it's
[01:47:50.752 --> 01:47:59.244]  Any order will be followed, just like Germans would follow orders of Hitler to kill children because the Fuhrer said so.
[01:47:59.244 --> 01:48:04.491]  And these cops, if they're told to do something, they will take your guns, they will kill you.
[01:48:04.491 --> 01:48:07.174]  And we better, as a country, have a real...
[01:48:08.015 --> 01:48:23.886]  Talk about this, because the same banks that hate Iran hate this country, and notice that they're going to use the United States to bring in the New World Order and attack all these countries, and then bankrupt us in the process, taking out both their enemies at the same time.
[01:48:23.886 --> 01:48:28.329]  Well, there's something that people need to realize, and that's the power they have in numbers.
[01:48:28.329 --> 01:48:32.652]  And bringing up that again, the Pittsburgh and Seattle and Denver things that go on, the people
[01:48:33.861 --> 01:48:37.386]  I'm sorry, I'm not there physically, and I have a family here in Florida where I'm taking care of.
[01:48:37.386 --> 01:48:49.943]  But if there's something going on in Orlando, and this is just me, but if I see somebody hitting a woman, arresting somebody, all those people standing around, sometimes with only three or four little thugs, they don't understand their power.
[01:48:50.595 --> 01:48:53.236]  And I'm sorry, I know you're not for violence, Alex.
[01:48:53.236 --> 01:48:54.376]  I know you're always against that.
[01:48:54.376 --> 01:48:57.957]  You want to reach out to people first and reach as many as we can, but it's going to come.
[01:48:57.957 --> 01:48:58.998]  It's inevitable.
[01:48:58.998 --> 01:49:09.321]  Well, more than that, and I don't do this from a cold-blooded position, the more images of them burning down churches, beating women, attacking old ladies with police dogs,
[01:49:09.921 --> 01:49:11.702]  This is waking everybody up.
[01:49:11.702 --> 01:49:13.882]  The emails are flowing in, the calls.
[01:49:13.882 --> 01:49:16.683]  People are saying, why don't we stand up?
[01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:21.705]  And the police are getting emboldened by the sheep that they're tearing the guts out of.
[01:49:21.705 --> 01:49:28.387]  I don't think they realize that the sleeping giant is rising and they're taking the people's restraint as a sign of weakness.
[01:49:28.387 --> 01:49:29.507]  It's not.
[01:49:29.507 --> 01:49:32.228]  Why do you think gun sales are at record levels for the last year?
[01:49:34.622 --> 01:49:37.843]  Well, I agree, and I hope that that's the case.
[01:49:37.843 --> 01:49:41.005]  I am a Christian myself, and I'm not one of these rapture freaks.
[01:49:41.005 --> 01:49:49.049]  Revelation 2.10 itself talks about that Jesus brings up that many of his followers will be tortured to death, basically to test their faith.
[01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:51.270]  I mean, if you're raptured out, how are you going to be tortured to death?
[01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:57.272]  You can read that in Revelation 2.10, and you can back up a second, too.
[01:49:57.272 --> 01:50:00.113]  I want to bring up another issue briefly, if you'd allow me.
[01:50:00.113 --> 01:50:00.694]  We've got one minute.
[01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:00.994]  Go ahead.
[01:50:01.522 --> 01:50:06.806]  Okay, back up to Revelation 2.9, the verse just before that where it talks about the synagogue of Satan.
[01:50:06.806 --> 01:50:17.253]  Jesus brings up this one group of people as the main cause of the tribulations that are coming.
[01:50:17.253 --> 01:50:31.103]  And I'm no Jew basher or anything like that, but it is brought up in 2.9 and 3.9, Revelation 3.9 also, and it's something that people need to look into and learn about.
[01:50:31.747 --> 01:50:33.508]  You've got to identify the enemy.
[01:50:33.508 --> 01:50:39.612]  And if we don't address that issue, things will never, never be able to be defeated.
[01:50:39.612 --> 01:50:41.493]  I've got two of the real quick things I need you to get rid of.
[01:50:41.493 --> 01:50:42.274]  Ted, we're out of time.
[01:50:42.274 --> 01:50:44.195]  We've got to go to break and we're going to get to other callers.
[01:50:44.195 --> 01:50:45.196]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:45.196 --> 01:50:51.400]  Dennis, Roman, Annie, Lewis, and others, we're going to come back and get to your calls with both our guests until 8 after.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.342]  Then Mike Adams and the whole flu issue is coming up.
[01:50:54.342 --> 01:50:58.925]  Then in the last hour I'm going to get into the economy, the police state grid, everything, and more of your phone calls.
[01:50:58.925 --> 01:50:59.385]  Continuing.
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.223]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:51:04.223 --> 01:51:13.852]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[01:51:43.412 --> 01:51:45.773]  The Heart and Body Extract is just so great.
[01:51:45.773 --> 01:51:50.316]  I thank God that I was led to this product that's doing so much for me and that can do so much for others.

[01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:59.771]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:51:59.771 --> 01:52:05.233]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:52:05.233 --> 01:52:07.533]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:52:07.533 --> 01:52:09.074]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:52:09.074 --> 01:52:10.754]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:52:10.754 --> 01:52:13.615]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[01:52:13.615 --> 01:52:18.637]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UNICEF.
[01:52:26.958 --> 01:52:33.105]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:52:33.105 --> 01:52:34.206]  An inside job.
[01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:38.236]  How dare you?
[01:52:38.236 --> 01:52:43.137]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:52:43.137 --> 01:52:45.478]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:52:45.478 --> 01:52:52.480]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of the... Truth Rising.

[01:52:57.601 --> 01:53:00.082]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:53:00.871 --> 01:53:05.372]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[01:53:05.372 --> 01:53:09.634]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[01:53:09.634 --> 01:53:20.477]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[01:53:20.477 --> 01:53:30.040]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system-building blocks defending your body against natural and man-made viruses, but they also assist your body in healing itself from
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:30.440]  We're good to go.
[01:54:05.253 --> 01:54:06.834]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:54:06.834 --> 01:54:07.495]  to 3 p.m.
[01:54:07.495 --> 01:54:08.295]  Central.
[01:54:08.295 --> 01:54:10.057]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:54:10.057 --> 01:54:10.737]  Eastern.
[01:54:10.737 --> 01:54:11.638]  We're live.
[01:54:11.638 --> 01:54:19.103]  Coming up at the Five After, we've got Mike Adams joining us to talk about all the different issues and developments with the flu.
[01:54:19.103 --> 01:54:21.725]  From Natural News, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[01:54:21.725 --> 01:54:26.569]  In this segment and the next, we're going to continue with Paul Watson and Curt Nemo with your phone calls.
[01:54:26.569 --> 01:54:30.412]  Dennis in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:30.412 --> 01:54:31.593]  Yes.
[01:54:31.593 --> 01:54:33.134]  Go ahead.
[01:54:33.134 --> 01:54:33.374]  Hello.
[01:54:35.549 --> 01:54:39.290]  Anyway, I've got an article I wrote, titled, Republic.
[01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:52.153]  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[01:54:52.153 --> 01:54:55.774]  We are not a democracy, we are a republic.
[01:54:55.774 --> 01:54:56.675]  What is the difference?
[01:54:56.675 --> 01:55:00.215]  In a democracy, innocent people are persecuted.
[01:55:00.215 --> 01:55:02.096]  In a republican, in a republic,
[01:55:02.697 --> 01:55:05.299]  No victim, no crime, no punishment.
[01:55:05.299 --> 01:55:07.902]  Common law is just common sense.
[01:55:07.902 --> 01:55:11.445]  It has its roots in the Ten Commandments.
[01:55:11.445 --> 01:55:15.209]  Our original common law was created in Admiralty State.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:24.942]  Hey Dennis, that poem you wrote sounds an awful lot like the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:55:24.942 --> 01:55:30.724]  Yes, a democracy of 51% say kill the other 49 and it happens.
[01:55:30.724 --> 01:55:34.765]  In a republic, the majority can't vote out the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:55:34.765 --> 01:55:36.205]  I appreciate your call.
[01:55:36.205 --> 01:55:39.246]  Roman in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:55:39.246 --> 01:55:44.407]  Hey Alex, I was wondering if I could talk about two things real quick.
[01:55:46.813 --> 01:55:55.156]  Um, you know how they predicted 9-11 and The Simpsons and in those movies, especially the one with Samuel L. Jackson?
[01:55:55.156 --> 01:55:57.657]  Yes, The Longest Good Night.
[01:55:57.657 --> 01:55:58.517]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:58.517 --> 01:56:02.799]  There's one called The Siege, where they predict martial law.
[01:56:02.799 --> 01:56:04.399]  In New York?
[01:56:04.399 --> 01:56:07.320]  Yeah, I think somebody's going to be kidnapped, actually.
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:14.083]  Like in that movie, I don't know what, but something's going to happen, and that's what they're going to use instead of swine flu.
[01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:16.391]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:16.391 --> 01:56:26.175]  Curt Nemo, Paul Watson, we saw the Fox News, the Fox Show, Lone Gunman, where the government hijacks a jet to fly at the World Trade Center to bring in martial law.
[01:56:26.175 --> 01:56:35.978]  We are seeing all these messages of collapse of society, martial law, checkpoints in the last decade, and now it's all manifesting in reality.
[01:56:35.978 --> 01:56:39.880]  Well, yeah, Alex, it's the question of chicken and egg, I mean.
[01:56:41.587 --> 01:56:53.770]  Conspiracy theory, if you want to call it that, is so popular at the moment that that's the playbook that people in Hollywood and TV are all going off, because that's what people watch at the moment.
[01:56:53.770 --> 01:57:03.272]  So, whereas in the past, when it wasn't popular at all, you could draw parallels between things like The Lone Gunman, which definitely was very suspicious.
[01:57:03.272 --> 01:57:07.533]  Now, every other program is about martial law, so, you know,
[01:57:08.223 --> 01:57:15.426]  There's not much credence in it now, it's interesting, but... Yeah, well, there's a massive preparation, a massive preparation.
[01:57:15.426 --> 01:57:16.547]  Curt Nemo?
[01:57:16.547 --> 01:57:29.112]  Well, it's indicative when you have a television show like Jericho on that talks about this very thing, nuclear terrorism, and it points back to a, you know, a mercenary group working in the United States, you know?
[01:57:29.112 --> 01:57:34.395]  So, yeah, the programming's definitely out there, and God only knows what's going to happen.
[01:57:34.878 --> 01:57:38.539]  Well on record, the National Security Council runs everything now.
[01:57:38.539 --> 01:57:47.803]  And then it's under the control of the UN Security Council that the President is the first President to chair it in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution.
[01:57:47.803 --> 01:57:50.524]  And they said he's now the New World Order President.
[01:57:50.524 --> 01:57:54.246]  I mean, such a throwing it in our face.
[01:57:54.246 --> 01:57:55.346]  Totally unconstitutional.
[01:57:57.483 --> 01:58:02.225]  Alex, the things that scare me more are the programs made by the government.
[01:58:02.225 --> 01:58:12.748]  In England, there have been numerous programs made by the government in association with the BBC about mass pandemics, quarantines and martial law.
[01:58:12.748 --> 01:58:19.370]  You know, when the government's putting them out, that's when we should start to have suspicions about what we're being prepared for.
[01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:33.137]  And now they've got Sesame Street with government messages, most the children shows, children changing the words of Jesus loves the little children to Obama loves the little children, red, yellow, black and white, they are all equal in the president's sight.
[01:58:33.137 --> 01:58:35.519]  I mean, it's just total 1984.
[01:58:35.519 --> 01:58:37.880]  Back in 70 seconds with a few final calls.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:42.543]  Then, Rick Adams joining us.
[01:58:42.543 --> 01:58:45.965]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.965 --> 01:58:48.126]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.572 --> 01:58:54.813]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:58:54.813 --> 01:58:56.813]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:58:56.813 --> 01:59:05.335]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:59:05.335 --> 01:59:10.877]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.497]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[01:59:12.737 --> 01:59:19.262]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:59:19.262 --> 01:59:30.311]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[01:59:30.311 --> 01:59:31.692]  That's right, clean water.
[01:59:31.992 --> 01:59:33.633]  Right from the air you breathe.
[01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:37.796]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:37.796 --> 01:59:40.978]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:59:40.978 --> 01:59:48.343]  Or visit Okolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:59:48.343 --> 01:59:53.747]  That's okolablue.com.
[01:59:53.747 --> 01:59:56.149]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:58.911]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:10.254]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.254 --> 02:00:11.836]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.836 --> 02:00:13.397]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.397 --> 02:00:17.581]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.581 --> 02:00:23.166]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.166 --> 02:00:26.268]  The new world order is coming in like a flood.
[02:00:26.268 --> 02:00:30.172]  All these years they said there was no world government being set up, now it's just admitted.
[02:00:31.428 --> 02:00:32.569]  They're testing the public.
[02:00:32.569 --> 02:00:33.590]  They're probing.
[02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:36.532]  Taking some more phone calls here.
[02:00:36.532 --> 02:00:38.414]  Good old Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo.
[02:00:38.414 --> 02:00:41.376]  We've got Mike Adams, the health ranger, coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:41.376 --> 02:00:43.137]  Annie, in New York, you're on the air.
[02:00:43.137 --> 02:00:44.238]  Welcome.
[02:00:44.238 --> 02:00:45.479]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:00:45.479 --> 02:00:50.203]  I'm the sister of Claire, the daycare teacher, who works for Northeast Health.
[02:00:50.203 --> 02:00:53.105]  And we're going to that rally in Albany tomorrow.
[02:00:53.105 --> 02:01:00.491]  And as everything on hold, I was printing out some stuff from your site, you know, that the regular flu shot has H1N1 in it, and some stuff from Dr. Horowitz.
[02:01:01.447 --> 02:01:07.110]  We should probably expect that there are going to be feds there in one way or another, shouldn't we?
[02:01:07.110 --> 02:01:08.430]  Yeah, you're evil Americans.
[02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:16.594]  You're not allowed to go out and say, we don't want to take the forced flu shot that Obama says isn't forced, though they are forcing it on healthcare workers.
[02:01:16.594 --> 02:01:20.075]  Again, that's not American to go out and have free speech.
[02:01:20.075 --> 02:01:21.436]  How dare you?
[02:01:21.436 --> 02:01:22.176]  It's ridiculous.
[02:01:22.176 --> 02:01:28.759]  My sister is being ostracized by her boss because, you know, she's been taken out of her regular classrooms.
[02:01:29.508 --> 02:01:33.430]  And given other duties, like she's some kind of pariah.
[02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:35.071]  I just feel so sorry for her.
[02:01:35.071 --> 02:01:37.432]  Alex, I mean, they're going to take down the web eventually.
[02:01:37.432 --> 02:01:48.399]  I wish that shortwave and CB retailers would advertise on your sites because possibly we could get your show then on shortwave, correct?
[02:01:48.399 --> 02:01:50.920]  Yes, I'm on shortwave.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.561]  I wish they would advertise on your sites.
[02:01:52.561 --> 02:01:56.163]  And lastly, Alex, the camera has become mightier than the sword.
[02:01:56.764 --> 02:02:02.747]  As evidenced by the punishment Mook Radarsky got for making a fool of Brian Williams, and God bless each and every one of you.
[02:02:02.747 --> 02:02:03.567]  God bless you.
[02:02:03.567 --> 02:02:24.996]  We'll bring this up to Mike Adams in the next segment, but closing out with the flu, and with the secret police running around trying to intimidate people that speak out against it, the flu really is the perfect cover for a takeover, because it makes everybody a potential enemy, and as Ron Paul said last Thursday here on air, they're setting the precedent for this medicalized tyranny.
[02:02:27.148 --> 02:02:29.010]  Yeah.
[02:02:29.010 --> 02:02:40.459]  The news story about that today is the UK government has come out on the Downing Street website and said that the swine flu vaccine will not be mandatory.
[02:02:40.459 --> 02:02:42.641]  And yet, as we've discussed before,
[02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:47.913]  Their private plans all revolve around it being a compulsory vaccination.
[02:02:47.913 --> 02:02:52.615]  Their preparation revolves around it being a compulsory vaccination.
[02:02:52.615 --> 02:02:56.437]  They're making health workers take it by mandate or they're fired.
[02:02:56.437 --> 02:03:07.822]  So while governments are publicly saying that it won't be mandatory, all their planning indicates that for large sectors of the population it will be.
[02:03:07.822 --> 02:03:08.563]  Absolutely.
[02:03:08.563 --> 02:03:10.844]  Kurt Nemo, your take on that?
[02:03:11.448 --> 02:03:13.750]  Well, I think that he's right.
[02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:23.299]  You know, in this country, they're starting with the healthcare workers and anybody who's in the public domain and trying to work down towards the general populace.
[02:03:23.299 --> 02:03:24.741]  I'm not sure they'll make it.
[02:03:24.741 --> 02:03:30.847]  Yeah, because if they can force the healthcare enforcers to do it and the police to do it, then they'll make us do it.
[02:03:31.383 --> 02:03:33.364]  Yeah, we're going to have a hard time doing that though.
[02:03:33.364 --> 02:03:36.264]  They've only got the next two months to do it.
[02:03:36.264 --> 02:03:42.626]  I think they're going to get enough people just through this pervasive propaganda campaign to go and get the vaccine.
[02:03:42.626 --> 02:03:47.988]  It's going to be difficult for them to come and tell me to get a vaccine and my neighbors.
[02:03:47.988 --> 02:03:54.370]  Well that's the next phase, shutting down roads, shutting down cities, making you have a bracelet or you don't get through.
[02:03:55.492 --> 02:04:03.454]  Well, yeah, if they can make this into a pandemic, you know, this H1N1, which is a total joke, they may be able to do that.
[02:04:03.454 --> 02:04:11.877]  Well, regardless, they are gauging the response of the people worldwide to this for future forced inoculation campaigns, or they could go
[02:04:12.876 --> 02:04:14.177]  Hot with the program right now.
[02:04:14.177 --> 02:04:18.618]  We'll talk about this with Mike Adams, the health ranger, who now lives in Ecuador full time.
[02:04:18.618 --> 02:04:21.099]  And he also writes for Natural News.
[02:04:21.099 --> 02:04:22.580]  So that is coming up.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:31.924]  We'll continue to watch InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for all the piercing analysis of Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, and Paul Watson.
[02:04:31.924 --> 02:04:34.445]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you both for joining us today.
[02:04:34.445 --> 02:04:40.928]  We need to get a story out with the term hoax in it, dealing with Iran and this being a secret facility.
[02:04:40.928 --> 02:04:41.628]  Good job, men.
[02:04:42.108 --> 02:04:42.708]  Take care.
[02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:44.169]  Thanks Alex.
[02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:04.030]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:07.651]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:05:07.651 --> 02:05:12.213]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:05:12.213 --> 02:05:17.815]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:05:18.095 --> 02:05:22.879]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:05:22.879 --> 02:05:26.502]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:05:26.502 --> 02:05:31.326]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:05:31.326 --> 02:05:37.891]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:05:37.891 --> 02:05:39.833]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:05:40.313 --> 02:05:43.514]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:05:43.514 --> 02:05:48.015]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today!
[02:05:48.015 --> 02:05:50.236]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.236 --> 02:05:50.536]  877-327-0365.

[02:06:00.859 --> 02:06:08.604]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[02:06:08.604 --> 02:06:14.688]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[02:06:14.688 --> 02:06:17.650]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[02:06:17.650 --> 02:06:23.554]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[02:06:23.914 --> 02:06:25.495]  This book will work for anyone.
[02:06:25.495 --> 02:06:27.976]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:27.976 --> 02:06:33.599]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[02:06:33.599 --> 02:06:35.680]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.441]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:06:37.441 --> 02:06:39.962]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:06:39.962 --> 02:06:44.705]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:06:44.705 --> 02:06:48.406]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[02:06:48.406 --> 02:06:50.548]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:51.528 --> 02:06:53.409]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:06:53.409 --> 02:07:01.092]  One last time, it's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[02:07:01.092 --> 02:07:04.093]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:04.093 --> 02:07:09.436]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.436 --> 02:07:11.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.476 --> 02:07:16.479]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.479 --> 02:07:17.399]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.659 --> 02:07:18.780]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:20.661]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.661 --> 02:07:21.742]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.742 --> 02:07:23.943]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.943 --> 02:07:25.284]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.284 --> 02:07:26.805]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:32.069]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:35.651]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.651 --> 02:07:39.134]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.474 --> 02:07:40.695]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.695 --> 02:07:41.595]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.595 --> 02:07:42.696]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.696 --> 02:07:43.636]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.636 --> 02:07:44.737]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.737 --> 02:07:47.779]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.779 --> 02:07:49.560]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.480]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.566 --> 02:08:09.187]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.187 --> 02:08:15.869]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.869 --> 02:08:20.490]  A lot of Americans, and Europeans for that matter, are bugging out.
[02:08:20.490 --> 02:08:25.931]  They're going to New Zealand, they're going to the Cook Islands, they're going to the South Pacific, they're going to Costa Rica, they're going to Ecuador.
[02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:29.852]  You know, the Bushes have bought land in South America.
[02:08:30.683 --> 02:08:32.104]  Hundreds of thousands of acres of it.
[02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:38.148]  There are a lot of wealthy people here in Austin, a lot of wealthy business people that I've run into over the years.
[02:08:38.148 --> 02:08:40.850]  They tell me that a lot of the big money is left.
[02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:43.232]  The last three years, there's been news articles about that.
[02:08:43.232 --> 02:08:54.741]  That's a side issue, but Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, founder of NaturalNews.com, huge site, an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary wellness, from nutrition to renewable energy.
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:09:00.203]  And he's written thousands of articles and built the following over 800,000 people across the globe.
[02:09:00.203 --> 02:09:01.463]  It's a lot more than that.
[02:09:01.463 --> 02:09:09.548]  Mike has also founded a non-profit organization, the Consumer Wellness Center, an online retail center, Better Life Goods, and popular publishing company, Truth Publishing.
[02:09:09.548 --> 02:09:10.569]  He now lives in Ecuador.
[02:09:11.389 --> 02:09:12.810]  And he joins us for the rest of the hour.
[02:09:12.810 --> 02:09:15.831]  We're going to be opening the phones up on a host of issues.
[02:09:15.831 --> 02:09:21.694]  But Mike, you've certainly put your money where your mouth is down there trying to have real sustainability.
[02:09:21.694 --> 02:09:24.435]  Something the UN tries to create an evil clone of.
[02:09:24.435 --> 02:09:25.616]  Why did you move to Ecuador?
[02:09:26.894 --> 02:09:29.376]  Well, by the way, thanks for having me on the show, Alex.
[02:09:29.376 --> 02:09:31.837]  It's a great honor to be with you again today.
[02:09:31.837 --> 02:09:36.740]  But you're right, sustainability and putting my money where my mouth is.
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:41.763]  Right now, I'm living 80% off of my own food supply down here.
[02:09:41.763 --> 02:09:46.566]  And more importantly, I'm able to make sure that I can stay on the air.
[02:09:46.566 --> 02:09:48.427]  So if things happen in the U.S.
[02:09:48.427 --> 02:09:49.108]  with websites,
[02:09:49.648 --> 02:09:58.695]  I know that I can host websites in other countries and I can continue to help reach people from Ecuador without being, you know, taken away by U.S.
[02:09:58.695 --> 02:09:59.135]  authorities.
[02:09:59.135 --> 02:10:00.676]  So there are a lot of reasons I'm here.
[02:10:00.676 --> 02:10:01.817]  Those are a couple of them.
[02:10:01.817 --> 02:10:06.080]  What are you doing to keep from getting malaria?
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:06.940]  I'm not in the jungles.
[02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:08.922]  I'm actually in the high elevation Andes.
[02:10:08.922 --> 02:10:11.443]  It's the perfect climate year-round.
[02:10:11.443 --> 02:10:12.444]  Spring-like weather.
[02:10:12.444 --> 02:10:14.366]  You think you're in paradise here.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:20.804]  It's really just crazy good weather and non-stop food production.
[02:10:20.804 --> 02:10:24.806]  You can feed a family of four on about half an acre here.
[02:10:24.806 --> 02:10:29.089]  Yeah, I've talked to filmmakers like the maker of Crude, big film that just came out.
[02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:31.691]  It was 25 trips I think he said down there.
[02:10:31.691 --> 02:10:34.593]  And I've seen the videos you've shot and put on your YouTube channel.
[02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:37.555]  Really good people there.
[02:10:37.555 --> 02:10:39.276]  And so you're living in the high Andes.
[02:10:40.751 --> 02:10:41.852]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:10:41.852 --> 02:10:45.013]  It's high enough to get rid of the mosquitoes and the hot weather.
[02:10:45.013 --> 02:10:57.559]  And like you hinted at the top of the hour there, Alex, there are a lot, a lot of Americans and Canadians and British and Australians who are coming here for many of the same reasons.
[02:10:57.559 --> 02:11:01.761]  They're concerned about the swine flu pandemic vaccine response.
[02:11:01.761 --> 02:11:04.422]  They're concerned about the global currency collapse that's coming.
[02:11:04.422 --> 02:11:07.023]  They're concerned about their freedoms, and many of them are coming here.
[02:11:07.023 --> 02:11:08.244]  We have great neighbors here.
[02:11:08.717 --> 02:11:09.797]  What about kidnapping?
[02:11:09.797 --> 02:11:13.559]  I hear Ecuador's got a problem with that.
[02:11:13.559 --> 02:11:17.520]  Up in the north area, near Colombia, there is a kidnapping issue.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:20.361]  But we have really good relationships with all the local people here.
[02:11:20.361 --> 02:11:23.583]  You know, I speak decent enough Spanish now to get by.
[02:11:23.583 --> 02:11:26.524]  And we're part of the community.
[02:11:26.524 --> 02:11:28.525]  We're valued members of this community.
[02:11:28.525 --> 02:11:29.965]  We're not loners here.
[02:11:29.965 --> 02:11:31.966]  So I don't have any concern about that.
[02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:35.719]  Well, yeah, that's the way it is, I guess, in Central and South America.
[02:11:35.719 --> 02:11:37.000]  The people are the salt of the earth.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:47.904]  You've usually got a small criminal group feeding on them, but from just looking at places to send my family if I have to, the area of Ecuador you're in, separate from your research, does look like a pretty good area.
[02:11:47.904 --> 02:11:50.485]  Tell us about your facility, then I want to get into the flu.
[02:11:52.102 --> 02:11:52.663]  Okay, sure.
[02:11:52.663 --> 02:11:56.886]  Well, we have some acreage here, and we grow all kinds of food.
[02:11:56.886 --> 02:12:03.412]  We have 80 different types of food and superfruits, 75 different trees just on our own land here.
[02:12:04.099 --> 02:12:15.985]  And we grow far more than we can eat, so we donate food to the local community to help people there, and to help create good relationships between myself, a foreigner, and the local people.
[02:12:15.985 --> 02:12:19.547]  And, like you said, these are really good people.
[02:12:19.547 --> 02:12:25.951]  And Alex, this society cannot collapse, because they already live so close to the Earth.
[02:12:26.491 --> 02:12:28.173]  I mean, they can do without water.
[02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:29.795]  They can do without electricity.
[02:12:29.795 --> 02:12:33.459]  They don't have heating and cooling here because the temperature doesn't require it.
[02:12:33.459 --> 02:12:39.405]  If the whole world falls apart, there are certain places on this planet where people are going to be just almost business as usual.
[02:12:39.405 --> 02:12:40.847]  And this is one of those places.
[02:12:42.341 --> 02:12:43.542]  Amazing.
[02:12:43.542 --> 02:12:44.023]  The flu.
[02:12:44.023 --> 02:12:45.724]  You're watching this.
[02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:49.808]  You're actually down in the hemisphere where a lot of this cranked up.
[02:12:49.808 --> 02:12:52.130]  We've seen the flu chart from the CDC.
[02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:54.352]  They say it peaks in a week and a half.
[02:12:54.352 --> 02:12:57.635]  Very mild, but people are being forced to take the regular shot.
[02:12:57.635 --> 02:12:58.496]  They're being intimidated.
[02:12:58.496 --> 02:13:02.660]  They're now starting this week with the regular H1N1.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:05.983]  We've got vaccine trial deaths with other similar vaccines in Europe.
[02:13:06.764 --> 02:13:13.369]  We have the very same vaccine makers like Bayer caught knowingly shipping out HIV filled shots with hepatitis.
[02:13:13.369 --> 02:13:19.434]  No one seems to point out why do we trust these people that they're deploying troops in major cities everywhere.
[02:13:19.434 --> 02:13:25.780]  They are savagely attacking peaceful protesters and even going on university campuses saying no one's allowed outside day or night.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.421]  Alright, and I apologize in advance.
[02:13:28.421 --> 02:13:34.425]  If I do get disconnected, I'll call right back in, because I am talking to you from southern Ecuador, and sometimes that happens.
[02:13:34.425 --> 02:13:34.685]  In any case,
[02:13:52.530 --> 02:14:05.358]  The number one thing that I think most Americans need to be aware of right now is that even if they never got the vaccine, and even if they never showed flu symptoms, they may already have antibodies for the swine flu.
[02:14:05.358 --> 02:14:07.720]  They may have already been exposed.
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:09.941]  And their immune system did its job.
[02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:15.424]  You know, the job that God meant our immune system to do, which is to overcome infectious disease.
[02:14:15.424 --> 02:14:19.487]  You may be walking around right now immune to swine flu.
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:33.224]  And yet, at the same time, these authorities want everybody to be injected anyway, regardless of your status, regardless of what the side effects might be, and without any long-term testing ever being done on any of these vaccines.
[02:14:33.224 --> 02:14:37.925]  So this vaccine, I agree with your previous guests over the last several weeks who have said,
[02:14:38.545 --> 02:14:43.747]  This vaccine is more dangerous than the pandemic, by far.
[02:14:43.747 --> 02:14:45.228]  Let me just interrupt briefly.
[02:14:45.228 --> 02:14:59.053]  Dr. Monteith made the point from the CDC's own numbers, upwards of 37% of Americans when they get tested who are healthy already have the antibodies for the H1N1, meaning that it's already massively in the public and a very weak virus.
[02:14:59.053 --> 02:15:04.756]  So why would they, and they still inoculate people who have the antibodies.
[02:15:04.756 --> 02:15:05.576]  Totally pointless.
[02:15:07.093 --> 02:15:08.134]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:08.134 --> 02:15:09.616]  Well, it comes down to this.
[02:15:09.616 --> 02:15:13.339]  They use taxpayer dollars to buy all these vaccines.
[02:15:13.339 --> 02:15:16.662]  And if they don't find a way to use them, they're going to look pretty darn stupid.
[02:15:16.662 --> 02:15:24.569]  So they are going to push this pandemic, regardless of the scientific basis for it, which is really no basis for vaccination at this point.
[02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:32.840]  And this is going to make sure they use up all these vaccines, even if that means injecting babies and children and immune-compromised people.
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.807]  I mean, they're just going to use them up to justify the decision that they made to buy these vaccines.
[02:15:37.807 --> 02:15:40.010]  That's not medical policy.
[02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:40.691]  That's politics.
[02:15:42.079 --> 02:15:49.164]  Did you see the Reuters story two weeks ago where they said, oh, millions are going to die of heart attacks and strokes and autoimmune stuff.
[02:15:49.164 --> 02:15:52.487]  They're going to think it's after they take the shot, but it's impossible.
[02:15:52.487 --> 02:15:54.328]  The shot can't have a bad reaction.
[02:15:54.328 --> 02:15:57.951]  So they're getting everybody ready for the bad reaction, saying it's a conspiracy.
[02:15:57.951 --> 02:15:58.972]  It doesn't exist.
[02:15:58.972 --> 02:16:05.317]  When their own internal CDC memorandums that were released a month ago said, no, get ready for adverse effects.
[02:16:06.570 --> 02:16:10.914]  Yeah, this is, I call it preemptive hypnosis of the consumers.
[02:16:10.914 --> 02:16:18.841]  They're trying to feed people this line to make them ignore the side effects and discount them as being just coincidence.
[02:16:18.841 --> 02:16:21.263]  But we've got a plan to do something about this.
[02:16:21.263 --> 02:16:26.568]  We're going to have a website out there where people can post the side effects that they're experiencing.
[02:16:26.568 --> 02:16:28.650]  And we'll be announcing that within a few days.
[02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:30.832]  So we've got to get some of this on the record, Alex, because
[02:16:32.073 --> 02:16:35.795]  The whole medical industry is trying to whitewash this entire thing.
[02:16:35.795 --> 02:16:40.859]  They have full immunity, they take no responsibility, and they don't value human life.
[02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.740]  We'll talk about conflict of interest.
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:53.628]  I mean, they're the ones profiting from it, running the genocide, and then they preemptively say, if you get Guillain-Barré or you get any of these other diseases, or you die or get sick, it wasn't the vaccine preemptively.
[02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:56.171]  Right.
[02:16:56.171 --> 02:17:11.500]  And remember this, this is research that has come out of Canada just in the last two days, that people who get the regular seasonal flu shot may be at an increased risk of being harmed by the swine flu if they do get exposed to the swine flu.
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:16.743]  So now we've got a case where one vaccine is worsening potentially the pandemic.
[02:17:17.978 --> 02:17:20.800]  And yet they're pushing both of these vaccines on everyone.
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.721]  Of course, I say don't take any of the vaccines.
[02:17:22.721 --> 02:17:27.503]  Just take care of your immune system and you're going to be fine.
[02:17:27.503 --> 02:17:34.607]  You know, it's anecdotal, but neighbor kids playing my yard, a bunch of them got a shot a week and a half ago.
[02:17:34.607 --> 02:17:40.050]  Now, two of the four neighbor kids are sick in bed the last week and a half, and their parents can't put two and two together.
[02:17:41.861 --> 02:17:43.022]  It's very common, Alex.
[02:17:43.022 --> 02:17:57.848]  If you look at many of the outbreaks of infectious disease over the last several decades, you'll find that many of the people who were infected, in some cases the vast majority, were in fact the very people who received the vaccination injections.
[02:17:57.848 --> 02:18:01.890]  I've called vaccines, Alex, the quackery of modern medicine.
[02:18:02.466 --> 02:18:05.087]  This is the one thing that they cannot give up.
[02:18:05.087 --> 02:18:16.290]  They can't tell the truth about vaccines because so much of western medicine and pharmacology depends on this mythology that chemical intervention is the solution to your health problems.
[02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:17.931]  But it's not.
[02:18:17.931 --> 02:18:23.753]  It's just a collection of lies and we are seeing it now very clearly with this swine flu vaccine.
[02:18:25.569 --> 02:18:26.571]  Amazing.
[02:18:26.571 --> 02:18:27.052]  Continue.
[02:18:27.052 --> 02:18:35.768]  We're about to go to break, but with the talk of forced inoculations, trying to force medical workers to do it, while Obama says, don't worry, you don't have to take it.
[02:18:37.985 --> 02:18:39.046]  Well, very clearly.
[02:18:39.046 --> 02:18:40.607]  We're getting lots of reports from people.
[02:18:40.607 --> 02:18:42.849]  You know, we get thousands of emails sometimes.
[02:18:42.849 --> 02:18:54.278]  And healthcare workers are complaining to us that they are being threatened, they're being intimidated, and they're losing their jobs now because of their refusals to get the swine flu vaccination.
[02:18:54.278 --> 02:18:56.139]  And this is happening all across America.
[02:18:56.139 --> 02:19:00.563]  So it is being made mandatory in several different ways, even though they don't admit it.
[02:19:00.563 --> 02:19:04.926]  Oh yeah, they're having a big protest in New York and New Jersey tomorrow, and it's now mainstream news.
[02:19:04.926 --> 02:19:05.727]  They're firing people.
[02:19:06.761 --> 02:19:07.721]  Oh yeah, they are.
[02:19:07.721 --> 02:19:09.162]  Yeah, they're just gonna kick them right out.
[02:19:09.162 --> 02:19:12.483]  And the thing is, these nurses, they know what they're talking about.
[02:19:12.483 --> 02:19:25.927]  They can go to their bosses in the hospitals and they can present documentation that, you know, I'm a healthy person, I have high vitamin D levels, I don't have respiratory problems, I'm not susceptible to swine flu infection, and I'm healthy, but it doesn't matter.
[02:19:25.927 --> 02:19:28.488]  They say take the injection or take a hike.
[02:19:28.488 --> 02:19:30.169]  That's what they're being told right now, Alex.
[02:19:32.975 --> 02:19:36.777]  Meanwhile, the military propaganda arm is saying, no one has to take it.
[02:19:36.777 --> 02:19:38.977]  Don't listen to the conspiracy theorists.
[02:19:38.977 --> 02:19:42.399]  Just take the shot or you're fired, but no one's making you.
[02:19:42.399 --> 02:19:44.059]  All psych warfare.
[02:19:44.059 --> 02:19:49.181]  I want to get the bottom line from Mike Adams, the health ranger, on what he believes is really going on here.
[02:19:49.181 --> 02:19:51.502]  A lot of scientists are saying this is man-made.
[02:19:51.502 --> 02:19:54.884]  They're saying they may release something else that's mutated that's more deadly.
[02:19:54.884 --> 02:19:59.686]  Why do we see such a massive buildup for something that looks so incredibly mild on the surface?
[02:19:59.686 --> 02:20:00.226]  Stay with us.
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:06.322]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[02:20:06.322 --> 02:20:08.984]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.
[02:20:08.984 --> 02:20:12.727]  eFoods Direct just finished developing our new Nutraversal Foods.
[02:20:12.727 --> 02:20:19.052]  Close your eyes and taste our creamy three cheese blend macaroni and cheese, and you'll swear you're eating fresh pasta in downtown Italy.
[02:20:19.412 --> 02:20:23.295]  Dig into our chili with cornmeal dumplings and you'll feel like a wealthy Texan.
[02:20:23.295 --> 02:20:27.658]  Or sip a cup of warm potato cheddar soup and be soothed on a cold rainy day.
[02:20:27.658 --> 02:20:29.920]  New Traversal Foods from eFoods Direct.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:31.281]  Your new comfort food.
[02:20:31.281 --> 02:20:34.363]  Incredible taste, easy to prepare, and a long shelf life.
[02:20:34.363 --> 02:20:35.624]  New Traversal Foods.
[02:20:35.624 --> 02:20:42.329]  More fun while hunting and fishing, bigger tails around the campfire, and the food your kids will want when celebrating the win of a ballgame.
[02:20:42.329 --> 02:20:46.812]  And if it's this great during the good times, imagine how reassuring it will be if times get tough.
[02:20:51.618 --> 02:20:52.499]  It is a big idea.
[02:20:52.499 --> 02:20:53.900]  A new world order.
[02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:57.643]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:20:57.643 --> 02:20:59.625]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:59.625 --> 02:21:04.148]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:21:04.148 --> 02:21:06.230]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:19.185 --> 02:21:29.549]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:29.549 --> 02:21:34.451]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:34.983 --> 02:21:38.844]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:38.844 --> 02:21:41.425]  The Olivera gets to make great progress for New World Order.
[02:21:41.425 --> 02:21:42.585]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:42.585 --> 02:21:43.365]  They're not after money.
[02:21:43.365 --> 02:21:44.646]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:44.646 --> 02:21:45.626]  They're after power.
[02:21:45.626 --> 02:21:46.786]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[02:21:55.489 --> 02:21:58.290]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:21:58.290 --> 02:21:59.450]  You have been warned.
[02:22:00.416 --> 02:22:07.078]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.078 --> 02:22:15.200]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:23.362]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.362 --> 02:22:28.123]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.463 --> 02:22:33.685]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.685 --> 02:22:38.027]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.027 --> 02:22:39.108]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.108 --> 02:22:43.610]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:48.512]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.512 --> 02:22:51.513]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.513 --> 02:22:53.154]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.335 --> 02:22:59.656]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.656 --> 02:23:03.398]  When looking at your personal preparedness level, remember the freeze-dry guide.
[02:23:03.398 --> 02:23:10.561]  During times of physical and emotional stress, like the uncertain times we live in today, it is vital that you not alter your diet too much.
[02:23:10.561 --> 02:23:12.482]  You should only store what you usually eat
[02:23:12.742 --> 02:23:15.866]  Because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored.
[02:23:15.866 --> 02:23:17.948]  Lucky for you, there's the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[02:23:17.948 --> 02:23:24.436]  Featuring the superior nutrition and taste you've come to expect, the Freeze-Dry Guy has a wide variety of choices in freeze-dried foods.
[02:23:24.436 --> 02:23:29.181]  All freeze-dried foods are no-cook products, requiring only hot water and a few minutes of your time.
[02:23:29.381 --> 02:23:38.709]  The Freeze-Dry Guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[02:23:38.709 --> 02:23:45.375]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch card days of the 60s and 70s to the high-speed personal computers of today.
[02:23:45.575 --> 02:23:50.598]  Comparably, the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great.

[02:23:55.642 --> 02:23:57.083]  You look like an angel.
[02:23:57.083 --> 02:23:57.863]  Walk like an angel.
[02:24:12.987 --> 02:24:22.396]  You know, Mike Adams, Health Rangers, joining us from Ecuador.
[02:24:28.462 --> 02:24:30.063]  It's not even a devil in disguise.
[02:24:30.063 --> 02:24:35.066]  I mean the history of vaccines, the history of these drug makers, the history of how they're involved in eugenics.
[02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:39.308]  Not 50 years ago, I mean they were, but 5 years ago, a year ago.
[02:24:39.308 --> 02:24:45.172]  How they kill us on purpose, how they do this by design, how we're in this scientific big pharma dictatorship.
[02:24:46.894 --> 02:24:48.334]  It's just incredible.
[02:24:48.334 --> 02:25:09.660]  You go over the 10 big lies of the vaccine, but before we go into that and take calls in the next segment, from your deep study of this, and I really respect your wide-ranging view and research on this, and you're probably the biggest alternative media person when it comes to just alternative health, and all the experts you talk to, what is this whole flu hype really about?
[02:25:11.001 --> 02:25:24.187]  Well, thanks for asking that question, by the way, because there's a lot of information that comes to me that I really don't... I can't substantiate well enough to publish, but it comes to me from several different sources, so it starts to paint a picture.
[02:25:24.187 --> 02:25:39.293]  For example, I had a physician visiting me here in Ecuador recently, and this physician was telling me about the training that they had just received for how to handle people who were refusing to swine flu vaccinations.
[02:25:39.293 --> 02:25:40.494]  And this is
[02:25:41.425 --> 02:25:59.716]  Totally, completely congruent with the reports we're getting from certain law enforcement personnel, sheriffs especially, who are saying that they're receiving either training or instruction on how to deal with swine flu vaccine checkpoints and the so-called refuse nicks, people who refuse the vaccine.
[02:25:59.716 --> 02:26:06.941]  And that's in the level 6 literature globally and a lot of the info we were getting 2-3 weeks ago is now being confirmed, so this is going on.
[02:26:08.135 --> 02:26:12.298]  Oh yeah, absolutely, and I've heard it first-hand from people that I know and trust.
[02:26:12.298 --> 02:26:14.399]  It's not just random bloggers emailing me things.
[02:26:14.399 --> 02:26:16.781]  These are people I've known for many years.
[02:26:16.781 --> 02:26:20.504]  There's an undercurrent that is definitely happening.
[02:26:20.504 --> 02:26:31.651]  Now, I can't say if it's a plan to make these things happen, or if it's just a contingency plan in case this pandemic gets out of control.
[02:26:31.651 --> 02:26:35.534]  Or if it's a drill to test military and police to see if they'll do it.
[02:26:36.691 --> 02:26:38.572]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[02:26:38.572 --> 02:26:41.393]  There's definitely an element of that going on.
[02:26:41.393 --> 02:26:51.937]  I think, Alex, I think that these people are listening to your show, they're reading my website, they're watching what the physicians and the nurses and the healthcare professionals actually do.
[02:26:51.937 --> 02:26:53.978]  Oh no, they've written about that.
[02:26:53.978 --> 02:26:57.200]  Fox News, others have written about this show particularly.
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.320]  I've seen you singled out.
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.081]  No, they admit they're monitoring us right now.
[02:27:01.249 --> 02:27:07.730]  Oh yeah, it's all part of the same plan to make sure that they can properly manipulate the population.
[02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:16.832]  And that's why you get into that story that you mentioned before the break about the preemptive hypnosis of people to discount the swine flu vaccine side effect.
[02:27:16.832 --> 02:27:25.514]  But if you ask me what the underlying purpose of all of this, there are two that really come to mind.
[02:27:26.115 --> 02:27:34.039]  And one is that vaccines are fantastic at creating future business for the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:27:34.039 --> 02:27:45.485]  Because if you vaccinate everybody, you're going to get down the road a certain percentage of people with liver problems, with neurological problems especially, and of course, immune system problems.
[02:27:45.485 --> 02:27:54.430]  And this means future business for the cancer industry, future business for the transplant industry, which is steeped in all kinds of evil doing that we can't even go into.
[02:27:55.199 --> 02:27:57.180]  But you see where I'm going with this, Alex?
[02:27:57.180 --> 02:27:59.482]  This creates a lot of business.
[02:27:59.482 --> 02:28:01.443]  And it's all about money.
[02:28:01.443 --> 02:28:07.407]  But the second possibility here is about population control.
[02:28:07.407 --> 02:28:12.991]  And if you look at the chemicals that are being put into these vaccines, you know, the squalene in particular,
[02:28:13.965 --> 02:28:18.228]  This is a chemical that is associated with increased infertility.
[02:28:18.228 --> 02:28:23.152]  And what a brilliant, clever, evil way to cause widespread infertility.
[02:28:23.152 --> 02:28:26.114]  Just get everybody to sign up for an injection.
[02:28:26.114 --> 02:28:31.097]  And frying immune systems.
[02:28:31.097 --> 02:28:32.398]  Absolutely.
[02:28:32.398 --> 02:28:39.243]  I think that the medical complex in this country wants to keep people immune-compromised
[02:28:39.947 --> 02:28:43.570]  And completely ignorant of medical reality.
[02:28:43.570 --> 02:28:51.415]  They don't want people to know about natural cures, for example, or all the cures for cancer that exist right now all around the world.
[02:28:51.415 --> 02:28:54.737]  I've got cures for cancer growing in my front yard here in Ecuador.
[02:28:54.737 --> 02:28:56.778]  They're all over South America.
[02:28:56.778 --> 02:28:59.520]  And North Americans haven't heard of many of these.
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:06.785]  But they exist, and they're being censored and oppressed because the people in charge want to keep the American people ignorant.
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:09.760]  Well, I agree with that.
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:17.704]  It's also about reinforcing the lie that you've got to take vaccines, setting the precedent that you've got to take vaccines.
[02:29:17.704 --> 02:29:19.464]  It's also, as you said, a soft kill weapon.
[02:29:19.464 --> 02:29:26.367]  Like, look at how they've increased the vaccinations for hepatitis, then suddenly levels of hepatitis explode off the charts.
[02:29:26.367 --> 02:29:30.229]  Let's come back and talk about that on the other side with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[02:29:30.229 --> 02:29:31.269]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:32.630]  Your phone calls as well at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:35.791 --> 02:29:37.592]  I realize a lot of your calls will be all over the map.
[02:29:37.592 --> 02:29:38.572]  We'll move to you quickly.
[02:29:38.572 --> 02:29:44.235]  But if you have questions on the flu, or questions about medical issues, Mike Adams is a real authority.
[02:29:44.235 --> 02:29:45.636]  We really are honored to have him here.
[02:29:45.636 --> 02:29:51.399]  He's a great asset to Liberty and Freedom.
[02:29:51.399 --> 02:29:52.799]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.799 --> 02:29:55.320]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:58.002]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.811 --> 02:30:05.035]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:30:05.035 --> 02:30:07.057]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:30:07.057 --> 02:30:15.585]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:30:15.585 --> 02:30:21.130]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:30:21.130 --> 02:30:22.752]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:30:22.972 --> 02:30:29.498]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:30:29.498 --> 02:30:40.549]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:30:40.549 --> 02:30:41.930]  That's right, clean water.
[02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.590]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.768 --> 02:31:06.075]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:06.075 --> 02:31:10.601]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.601 --> 02:31:12.884]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.884 --> 02:31:14.506]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.506 --> 02:31:15.548]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.768 --> 02:31:24.194]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:32:01.118 --> 02:32:01.478]  I think so.
[02:32:22.719 --> 02:32:26.123]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:32:26.123 --> 02:32:28.565]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[02:32:28.565 --> 02:32:35.172]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[02:32:35.172 --> 02:32:38.696]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[02:33:11.664 --> 02:33:13.446]  We're here live Monday through Friday.
[02:33:15.058 --> 02:33:16.179]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:33:16.179 --> 02:33:16.499]  Eastern.
[02:33:16.499 --> 02:33:18.680]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:21.761]  This show is not about races or religions fighting with each other.
[02:33:21.761 --> 02:33:25.743]  It's not about bashing any one group.
[02:33:25.743 --> 02:33:34.988]  It's about waking up to the scientific dictatorship we live under and warning the people and saying no as free sentient beings on this planet.
[02:33:34.988 --> 02:33:38.490]  And if we don't shatter the false left-right paradigm, it's over for this society.
[02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:40.191]  Going back to Mike Adams in a moment.
[02:33:41.278 --> 02:33:41.498]  I don't
[02:34:01.909 --> 02:34:11.229]  A guard with border patrol deep inside a state and they asked him if he'd had his flu shot, started asking if he had a bracelet and people were honking and they waved him on through.
[02:34:12.386 --> 02:34:17.427]  California Swine Flu Checkpoint Identified, ladies and gentlemen, is the headline at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:17.427 --> 02:34:22.208]  Before we go back to my guest, I want to tell you about one of our sponsors that makes this hour possible.
[02:34:22.208 --> 02:34:23.828]  That's Front Sight.
[02:34:23.828 --> 02:34:25.449]  Front Sight Firearms.
[02:34:25.449 --> 02:34:27.129]  FrontSight.com.
[02:34:27.129 --> 02:34:31.710]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza, the founder of the Front Sight Firearms Training Institute?
[02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:35.251]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[02:34:36.124 --> 02:34:42.568]  The offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piaget is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal and won't last forever.
[02:34:42.568 --> 02:34:43.448]  So listen up.
[02:34:43.448 --> 02:34:51.132]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:34:51.132 --> 02:34:56.515]  Act fast, you will be given a free spring-filled Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:34:56.515 --> 02:35:00.438]  It's one thing to own a bunch of guns and ammo to defend yourself from criminals and
[02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:04.699]  Other groups, but it's one another thing to actually be trained.
[02:35:04.699 --> 02:35:06.040]  No drill instructor attitude.
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:06.880]  It's awesome.
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:08.020]  Frontsight.com.
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:10.921]  That's frontsight.com.
[02:35:10.921 --> 02:35:14.523]  And one last sponsor I want to tell you about is mysolarbackup.com.
[02:35:14.523 --> 02:35:17.404]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:20.857]  Global greenhouse taxes, you name it.
[02:35:20.857 --> 02:35:24.019]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a way to do just that.
[02:35:24.019 --> 02:35:28.041]  The solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[02:35:28.041 --> 02:35:35.465]  You get an emergency power backup kit, which consists of the power source, 800-watt generator, and a high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[02:35:35.465 --> 02:35:41.008]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:35:41.008 --> 02:35:43.670]  It's a perfect emergency backup for these troubled times.
[02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:46.431]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[02:35:46.431 --> 02:35:47.432]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:35:49.993 --> 02:35:51.153]  Or 877-327-0365.
[02:35:51.153 --> 02:35:55.015]  MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:35:55.015 --> 02:36:02.957]  And I won't belabor this anymore, but I will just tell you, the listeners, that my new film is done.
[02:36:02.957 --> 02:36:06.519]  We sent crews out 17 times around the country for these interviews.
[02:36:06.519 --> 02:36:09.060]  Alan Watts in it, just to give you an idea.
[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:09.680]  Went to Canada.
[02:36:11.795 --> 02:36:20.618]  It covers the entire master plan, how the banks carried it out, what the new rule order is, how they're using television to put people into a hypnotic state, and it's volume one.
[02:36:20.618 --> 02:36:22.438]  Volume two comes out March 15th.
[02:36:22.438 --> 02:36:25.439]  It will be shipping out on or before October 21st.
[02:36:25.439 --> 02:36:29.200]  If your orders come in first, we ship the orders out in the order they came in.
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:33.962]  Get yours first, pre-order today at InfoWars.com to get Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:34.926 --> 02:36:38.188]  Or you can also call toll-free to pre-order 888-253-3139.
[02:36:38.188 --> 02:36:48.035]  Be sure and ask about all the combos and specials you can get half off and or more on some of my films when you get it with Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:48.035 --> 02:36:53.039]  Going back to Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com, the health ranger.
[02:36:53.039 --> 02:36:57.102]  He also runs Better Life Foods and Truth Publishing.
[02:36:57.102 --> 02:36:58.763]  And again, NaturalNews.com.
[02:36:58.763 --> 02:37:00.164]  I want to go to calls, but
[02:37:00.484 --> 02:37:03.026]  Before we do that, Mike, again, you've got the floor.
[02:37:03.026 --> 02:37:07.891]  You keep pausing for me to jump in, and that's a great opportunity for me, but I'm trying to break my habit of interrupting.
[02:37:07.891 --> 02:37:13.656]  What is most important people should know about the regular shot and the H1N1?
[02:37:13.656 --> 02:37:18.240]  Where do you see all this going, and what can we do to get the word out to say no to this?
[02:37:19.981 --> 02:37:30.025]  Yeah, the most important thing people need to know right now is that if they're considering a vaccine, maybe they're trying to weigh the potential upside and the potential downside.
[02:37:30.025 --> 02:37:35.568]  They might be doing that from a point of view of believing that they have been told both sides of the story.
[02:37:36.108 --> 02:37:54.205]  What they need to know is that these drug companies, and Merck in particular, I just wrote an article about Merck today, has a well-documented history of engaging in the intimidation of doctors and researchers who disagree with the safety of the company's products.
[02:37:54.205 --> 02:38:02.152]  So, the question that I asked in today's article, in fact, was, are doctors and researchers and healthcare workers being intimidated
[02:38:02.811 --> 02:38:07.816]  About speaking out against the safety of the vaccines, because I think that's what's going on.
[02:38:07.816 --> 02:38:21.028]  In fact, I'm sure of it, Alex, that people need to know that they aren't being given both sides of the story, that these vaccines are not safe, and that, in fact, they weren't even approved under a system of, quote, scientific medicine.
[02:38:21.468 --> 02:38:28.094]  They were approved under a medical dogma, a medical tyranny that operates in this country today.
[02:38:28.094 --> 02:38:31.596]  Under emergency, under level 6, under level 6 flu pandemic.
[02:38:31.596 --> 02:38:33.758]  Emergency, they did it.
[02:38:33.758 --> 02:38:34.899]  Absolutely.
[02:38:34.899 --> 02:38:36.400]  This isn't scientific.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.362]  This vaccine isn't based on science.
[02:38:38.362 --> 02:38:42.465]  It's based on profits and politics and control.
[02:38:42.465 --> 02:38:45.668]  It has nothing to do with medical justification, period.
[02:38:47.472 --> 02:38:49.274]  Mike, you brought up Merck, interrupting here.
[02:38:49.274 --> 02:38:50.995]  You brought up Merck.
[02:38:50.995 --> 02:38:53.998]  It was in the ABC News Australia headline.
[02:38:53.998 --> 02:38:59.583]  Merck drew up hit list of doctors with, quote, seek and destroy missions, quote, going to where they live.
[02:38:59.583 --> 02:39:03.166]  And then Merck said, we just mean we go after them, not that we kill them.
[02:39:03.166 --> 02:39:06.469]  But a lot of people in the federal court said, no, we believe this is hit teams.
[02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.790]  Go ahead.
[02:39:07.762 --> 02:39:09.443]  Well, yeah, they used those exact terms.
[02:39:09.443 --> 02:39:11.803]  They said we were going to, quote, neutralize doctors.
[02:39:11.803 --> 02:39:20.286]  There was another email from a Merck employee that surfaced in this Australian court case where they said, quote, we're going to go after them where they live.
[02:39:20.286 --> 02:39:23.587]  We're going to interfere with the funding of academic institutions.
[02:39:23.587 --> 02:39:30.029]  We're going to essentially target and destroy any person or organization that speaks out against our drugs.
[02:39:30.029 --> 02:39:33.210]  This is a drug company whose vaccines have been approved.
[02:39:35.171 --> 02:39:43.215]  And they brought us Gardasil, they brought us Gardasil, they brought us Vioxx.
[02:39:43.215 --> 02:39:44.296]  Remind folks about that.
[02:39:45.691 --> 02:39:47.913]  Well, Gardasil, it's the same story.
[02:39:47.913 --> 02:39:53.358]  In fact, I think the Gardasil propaganda was a trial run for this pandemic propaganda.
[02:39:53.358 --> 02:40:08.311]  Gardasil, they've managed to get more than half of all teenage girls in America injected with this Gardasil vaccine, which is, once again, medically unjustified, in my view, and in the view of many, many other well-educated medical professionals.
[02:40:08.311 --> 02:40:10.693]  But this vaccine has been linked with all kinds of problems.
[02:40:12.225 --> 02:40:14.006]  People passing out with death.
[02:40:14.006 --> 02:40:15.606]  Deaths have been linked with this.
[02:40:15.606 --> 02:40:17.807]  Neurological problems have been linked with it.
[02:40:17.807 --> 02:40:20.588]  But it's the same story as with the swine flu vaccine.
[02:40:20.588 --> 02:40:26.370]  They say, couldn't be us, couldn't be the vaccine, don't blame us, it must be something else.
[02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:28.671]  It's always this disavowing of responsibility.
[02:40:30.393 --> 02:40:35.197]  Well, these are new type of genetically engineered hybrid viruses.
[02:40:35.197 --> 02:40:44.904]  They admitted in their own insert during the trials three years ago, as you know, but recapping for people, that it was causing autoimmune disorders, that there were deaths linked to it in the trials.
[02:40:44.904 --> 02:40:50.768]  Now the deaths are mounting and healthy 13, 14 year old girls take it and their lives are over.
[02:40:50.768 --> 02:40:51.269]  They die.
[02:40:51.269 --> 02:40:52.250]  They get paralyzed.
[02:40:53.070 --> 02:41:03.661]  And we know that Merck went to Governor Rick Perry to get him to quote make it mandatory or on the list of mandatory shots to be in school so that vaccine damage fund federally would kick in.
[02:41:03.661 --> 02:41:07.866]  This is one cold-blooded plan that they're engaged in.
[02:41:09.045 --> 02:41:18.270]  This is a very powerful corporation with a lot of strong political ties, including with Governor Rick Perry there in Texas, but many other ties at the national level.
[02:41:18.270 --> 02:41:29.216]  I mean, this company rules the medical world, and my concern with that, Alex, is that they're doing so purely based on profit and politics and not based on science.
[02:41:29.216 --> 02:41:34.419]  I mean, the scientific method has been thrown out the window when it comes to these vaccines.
[02:41:35.675 --> 02:41:46.925]  This whole germ theory has been turned on its head and used, exploited, as a way to dominate the health beliefs of the American citizens.
[02:41:46.925 --> 02:41:51.750]  Now people don't realize that they need to take responsibility for their own health.
[02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:53.091]  They need to eat better.
[02:41:53.091 --> 02:42:00.138]  They need to get some sunshine and vitamin D. They need to stop using so many chemicals in personal care products.
[02:42:00.598 --> 02:42:07.462]  If they do those things, they're going to be well protected against this pandemic, or any pandemic, really.
[02:42:07.462 --> 02:42:12.726]  But the medical system wants chemical intervention, and that's what they keep driving at.
[02:42:13.171 --> 02:42:37.502]  Well now the medical system is telling doctors don't tell people there's any protection but Tamiflu or H1N1 shot, don't tell people you need natural vitamin D from the sun, 30 minutes of sun every few days, direct sun, don't tell people vitamin C, don't tell people fish oil, don't tell people colloidal silver compounds, even though the studies show it's excellent, they're saying you're now not allowed to tell people.
[02:42:38.783 --> 02:42:39.543]  Well, exactly.
[02:42:39.543 --> 02:42:44.704]  This is the enforced health illiteracy of the American people.
[02:42:44.704 --> 02:42:51.606]  I mean, really, I almost hate to invoke this imagery, but it goes back to the enslavement of people in America.
[02:42:51.606 --> 02:42:54.826]  And how do you keep people enslaved is you keep them illiterate.
[02:42:54.826 --> 02:42:56.507]  And that's what the FDA is doing.
[02:42:56.507 --> 02:43:03.688]  That's what the FTC is doing with the way that they attack and go after these companies that try to tell the truth online.
[02:43:04.148 --> 02:43:09.309]  About the benefits of their herbal products, or their nutritional products, or their superfoods.
[02:43:09.309 --> 02:43:12.210]  They are being attacked, intimidated, arrested.
[02:43:12.210 --> 02:43:14.631]  They're having their inventory confiscated.
[02:43:14.631 --> 02:43:19.772]  I had one of these guys, the founder of one of these companies, visit me in Ecuador.
[02:43:19.772 --> 02:43:25.653]  The things he told me, I would have thought he was being oppressed in Nazi Germany.
[02:43:25.653 --> 02:43:28.514]  But no, he came from the United States of America.
[02:43:29.014 --> 02:43:36.716]  He barely got out of the country with his life, with his freedom, and now he refuses to go back because he's selling natural products.
[02:43:36.716 --> 02:43:38.757]  Well, the people perish right now.
[02:43:38.757 --> 02:43:55.202]  The people perish for lack of knowledge, and certainly there's a lot of quacks out there, but there's more quackery in the major MD medical system and the drug companies taking over medicine, even getting rid of classical western medicine and bringing in this pharmakia medicine, but
[02:43:57.199 --> 02:44:01.582]  I've talked to a lot of other medical doctors and they say that the tyranny is really expanding.
[02:44:01.582 --> 02:44:12.029]  When you can't tell people, get lots of rest and sunshine, when the CDC says only drugs, only shots, it's just such a crime.
[02:44:13.496 --> 02:44:19.200]  Yeah, and there are very few companies and individuals are willing to stand up to the FTC.
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:35.111]  There's one company, it's actually a church organization, Daniel Chapter One, and I've written about them extensively, and I know you've spoken with them, but they are standing up to the FTC and pulling the bluff of these federal tyrants that are trying to censor
[02:44:35.931 --> 02:44:36.631]  Absolutely.
[02:44:36.631 --> 02:44:38.572]  I want to take some phone calls now.
[02:44:38.572 --> 02:44:39.853]  Any other key points you haven't added, sir?
[02:44:39.853 --> 02:44:41.394]  Yeah, they'll be all over the map.
[02:44:41.394 --> 02:44:43.495]  Lewis in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:44:43.495 --> 02:44:43.895]  Go ahead.
[02:45:04.957 --> 02:45:05.857]  Can you hear me good?
[02:45:05.857 --> 02:45:07.898]  Yes, I can.
[02:45:07.898 --> 02:45:11.840]  Yeah, I got three quick points and a question for the doctor.
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:12.621]  He's not a doctor.
[02:45:12.621 --> 02:45:14.822]  He's a health researcher.
[02:45:14.822 --> 02:45:15.442]  Oh, okay.
[02:45:15.442 --> 02:45:16.462]  Yeah, right.
[02:45:16.462 --> 02:45:26.867]  Well, you know, I was alive during the Vietnam War and a good portion of the resistance came from the university.
[02:45:26.867 --> 02:45:32.450]  And I mean, this thing that we witnessed over here at the G20, I mean, that ought to pop anybody's cork, you know?
[02:45:33.291 --> 02:45:46.998]  Yeah, a lot of people are saying, how do we let the police come up and even go into dorms and attack people and shoot kids on their front porches playing ball or in their front yards with sound cannons?
[02:45:46.998 --> 02:45:48.078]  This is just outrageous.
[02:45:48.078 --> 02:45:49.399]  Go ahead.
[02:45:49.399 --> 02:45:57.203]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm calling for is nationwide, even worldwide demonstrations on all the college campuses.
[02:45:58.444 --> 02:46:06.548]  You know, against this New World Order, against, you know, especially here, you know, against the free, you know, they're trying to give us these free speed zones and all this stuff.
[02:46:06.548 --> 02:46:12.831]  I mean, you don't want to get out there and get yourself killed like Kent State, but I mean, you know, I mean, there's things that we can do.
[02:46:12.831 --> 02:46:13.952]  You know, we got to stand up.
[02:46:13.952 --> 02:46:19.715]  I mean, these students, I mean, if I was a student in another university and I saw what they did to those guys over at Pittsburgh there,
[02:46:20.416 --> 02:46:23.820]  I'd be like, man, how fast can I get in these people's faces?
[02:46:41.218 --> 02:46:47.341]  And because they know that the changes to the dollar, the changes to our way of life, the tyranny, people are going to rebel.
[02:46:47.341 --> 02:46:50.262]  So they're trying to cow us and make us submit.
[02:46:50.262 --> 02:46:52.703]  Right now, these are psyops.
[02:46:52.703 --> 02:47:00.326]  But more importantly than just protesting, and I think that's important, is calling into talk radio, starting websites, starting flyering campaigns.
[02:47:00.326 --> 02:47:04.288]  Because they can't stop you coming out of the middle of nowhere putting up flyers with different issues.
[02:47:04.288 --> 02:47:06.089]  That's what our Joker poster contest was about.
[02:47:06.869 --> 02:47:09.710]  And I'm going to announce the new contest tomorrow, I promise, the Loomis one.
[02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:13.790]  I've just been so far behind, got behind with Fall of the Republic, but I'm going to do that tomorrow.
[02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:18.991]  The issue here is that we've done this to show people the power of just getting active.
[02:47:18.991 --> 02:47:20.431]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:20.431 --> 02:47:30.093]  What are other things we can do, Mike Adams, in your point, to really rattle the cage of the establishment and have the people's voice be heard?
[02:47:30.093 --> 02:47:35.354]  Or do you see my point about what will happen if we just let this chilling effect take place?
[02:47:36.405 --> 02:47:37.446]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:47:37.446 --> 02:47:43.169]  The ruling class right now is ruling by fear and intimidation.
[02:47:43.169 --> 02:47:44.529]  More and more people are waking up.
[02:47:44.529 --> 02:47:46.950]  I want to point this out about the vaccine.
[02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:53.634]  You know, a recent poll showed that 60% of parents are refusing to give their children the vaccine.
[02:47:53.634 --> 02:47:55.355]  That's a huge statistic, Alex.
[02:47:55.355 --> 02:48:01.198]  That means that people like you and I are winning this information campaign against all the
[02:48:01.858 --> 02:48:12.563]  The multi-million dollars worth of public relations and advertising and promotional pushes by the drug companies, more than half of the parents still won't vaccinate their children against swine flu.
[02:48:12.563 --> 02:48:18.586]  That's a victory, and we need more victories like that, because the truth will prevail here.
[02:48:18.586 --> 02:48:25.269]  All we gotta do is keep on getting the truth out there, help to awaken other people around us, turn them on to the truth,
[02:48:25.905 --> 02:48:31.850]  And we will ultimately be victorious in this, I believe, but it's going to be a difficult process.
[02:48:31.850 --> 02:48:34.492]  And by the way, now is the time.
[02:48:34.492 --> 02:48:40.917]  As the tyranny comes in, as everything we talked about beforehand unfolds, we have amazing credibility right now.
[02:48:40.917 --> 02:48:47.282]  We've got to reach out to everybody and speak out now, because we can wake people up ten years ago, but not in these numbers.
[02:48:47.282 --> 02:48:49.344]  People are ready to hear the truth.
[02:48:49.344 --> 02:48:50.385]  The establishment there
[02:48:51.026 --> 02:48:54.078]  Is there trying to lead them around into more tyranny right now?
[02:48:54.078 --> 02:48:56.306]  We've got to be there to say no, there's an alternative.
[02:48:57.694 --> 02:48:58.934]  I think that's exactly right.
[02:48:58.934 --> 02:49:01.055]  You know, the American people are smart people.
[02:49:01.055 --> 02:49:04.737]  They can figure it out if they have access to the right information.
[02:49:04.737 --> 02:49:09.498]  Now, the people in power are trying to keep the Americans blind.
[02:49:09.498 --> 02:49:17.701]  But, fortunately, websites like yours, Prison Planet, and many others out there, and the information that you are getting out there, this is working.
[02:49:17.701 --> 02:49:20.742]  So keep up, keep doing it.
[02:49:20.742 --> 02:49:22.743]  Thank goodness for what you're doing there, Alex.
[02:49:24.059 --> 02:49:26.361]  Well, we're going to go to Brighton, come back and take some final calls.
[02:49:26.361 --> 02:49:27.482]  Thank God for what you're doing.
[02:49:27.482 --> 02:49:32.406]  Your sites are rivaling ours in size, which excites me.
[02:49:32.406 --> 02:49:36.330]  So many other people in alternative media think we're competing with each other.
[02:49:36.330 --> 02:49:39.933]  My show's been successful because I bring the little guys on, the big guys.
[02:49:40.433 --> 02:49:41.473]  Everybody in between.
[02:49:41.473 --> 02:49:43.894]  I just want freedom for my family.
[02:49:43.894 --> 02:49:49.235]  I understand I'm in a race against the globalists and I'm not doing this for fame or fortune.
[02:49:49.235 --> 02:49:55.957]  We certainly try to fund ourselves and be comfortable and have some assets so we can defend ourselves if something comes up.
[02:49:55.957 --> 02:50:01.678]  We need to be strong and powerful so we're trying to become strong and powerful and challenge the system.
[02:50:02.645 --> 02:50:14.455]  That's why I've noticed CIA and FBI funded, and it's come out with some of these groups, that they are FBI funded, try to create racial division, try to make the Liberty Movement be about race or religion.
[02:50:14.455 --> 02:50:15.776]  They try to divide us.
[02:50:15.776 --> 02:50:17.478]  They constantly fight with each other.
[02:50:18.178 --> 02:50:22.321]  Uh, they do this not just out of jealousy or greed, but really to divide us.
[02:50:22.321 --> 02:50:23.642]  That's why they attack Ron Paul.
[02:50:23.642 --> 02:50:24.843]  That's why they attack me.
[02:50:24.843 --> 02:50:25.904]  That's why they attack you.
[02:50:25.904 --> 02:50:28.486]  The establishment knows they're discredited.
[02:50:28.486 --> 02:50:30.627]  They can't attack us from their high perches.
[02:50:30.627 --> 02:50:35.451]  They have to attack us from Renamob false grassroots.
[02:50:35.451 --> 02:50:38.353]  And that's because we're effective and it's scaring the system.
[02:50:38.353 --> 02:50:39.834]  So I take those attacks as a blessing.
[02:50:42.043 --> 02:50:42.763]  Yep.
[02:50:42.763 --> 02:50:44.004]  Well said, Alex.
[02:50:44.004 --> 02:50:45.945]  Let's keep up the good work here.
[02:50:45.945 --> 02:50:47.326]  Are you going to break right now?
[02:50:47.326 --> 02:50:47.886]  Yeah, we're going to break.
[02:50:47.886 --> 02:50:51.809]  I'm going to get your take on that and take more calls on the other side.
[02:50:51.809 --> 02:50:53.970]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is our guest.
[02:50:53.970 --> 02:50:54.590]  Stay with us.
[02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:55.531]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[02:51:01.365 --> 02:51:03.066]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:51:03.066 --> 02:51:04.808]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:51:04.808 --> 02:51:07.489]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:51:07.489 --> 02:51:12.633]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:51:12.633 --> 02:51:15.816]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:51:15.816 --> 02:51:19.258]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.

[02:52:01.892 --> 02:52:06.174]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:52:06.174 --> 02:52:09.455]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:52:09.455 --> 02:52:17.238]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:52:17.578 --> 02:52:17.858]  I think?
[02:52:38.643 --> 02:52:39.043]  I think so.
[02:53:04.292 --> 02:53:04.973]  It's here.
[02:53:04.973 --> 02:53:10.116]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:53:10.116 --> 02:53:17.682]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:53:18.459 --> 02:53:25.904]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:53:25.904 --> 02:53:37.633]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:53:37.633 --> 02:53:41.615]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:53:41.615 --> 02:53:43.877]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:53:43.877 --> 02:53:47.720]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:55.744]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:54:05.595 --> 02:54:07.937]  I was just talking to my guys during the break.
[02:54:07.937 --> 02:54:18.544]  The FBI has reissued a report they put out seven years ago saying cell phones, farmer's almanac, maps are all signs you're a terrorist.
[02:54:18.544 --> 02:54:20.065]  Go ahead and the police pull you over.
[02:54:20.065 --> 02:54:22.467]  Go ahead and put you in a terror database for life.
[02:54:22.467 --> 02:54:24.548]  No firearms, no liberty, no due process.
[02:54:25.942 --> 02:54:30.885]  Mike Adams, is that not the ultimate tyranny where they just put you on secret list for no reason?
[02:54:30.885 --> 02:54:42.210]  And what, two years ago, one of the head federal marshals in Denver went public and said, we have a quota of innocent people to put on terror list for life.
[02:54:42.210 --> 02:54:47.553]  And they've put 1,200,000 Americans on it we know of since a year ago when they made the list secret.
[02:54:49.028 --> 02:54:59.321]  Yeah, this is one of the processes of tyranny, is putting people on these secret lists outside of the normal process of law, right?
[02:54:59.321 --> 02:55:00.242]  Of due process.
[02:55:00.242 --> 02:55:05.228]  I mean, this is the way to circumvent the Constitution, and they are really clever at this.
[02:55:05.228 --> 02:55:06.370]  They're really good at this.
[02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:10.212]  And I think it's going to get a lot worse, Alex, before it gets better.
[02:55:10.212 --> 02:55:12.854]  Something has to happen here.
[02:55:12.854 --> 02:55:19.258]  The American people have got to rally again and to stand up for their freedoms and their rights and to protect the U.S.
[02:55:19.258 --> 02:55:24.441]  Constitution, which I thought was a valid document, you know, when I was growing up in school and I was being taught American history.
[02:55:24.441 --> 02:55:27.563]  Gee, I thought that thing still applied.
[02:55:27.563 --> 02:55:29.985]  Only as an adult do you learn that it's been circumvented.
[02:55:30.796 --> 02:55:35.138]  Well, I don't think people realize the process of tyranny.
[02:55:35.138 --> 02:55:45.623]  Once an elite decides to be ruthless and go all the way, and they believe human life is not just a cheat, but a negative, once they make that decision, the sky's the limit.
[02:55:45.623 --> 02:55:47.464]  And it's now the sky's the limit.
[02:55:47.464 --> 02:55:49.585]  We're going to keep you another 20 minutes and take calls.
[02:55:49.585 --> 02:55:50.945]  We appreciate you joining us.
[02:55:50.945 --> 02:55:54.307]  Talk to Chris, Tanya, Mary Ann, Dee, Bob, and others.
[02:55:54.887 --> 02:56:02.332]  But it sounded like when I mentioned the concerted attacks that are clearly funded against anybody exposing the corruption.
[02:56:02.332 --> 02:56:04.393]  Ron Paul isn't making people take flu shots.
[02:56:04.393 --> 02:56:06.334]  Ron Paul isn't raising people's taxes.
[02:56:06.334 --> 02:56:08.455]  You're not making people take flu shots.
[02:56:08.455 --> 02:56:10.637]  You're not sending SWAT teams to people's homes.
[02:56:10.637 --> 02:56:14.619]  But all this alternative media attacks anybody who's real.
[02:56:14.619 --> 02:56:18.982]  I notice we all get attacked by these concerted operations, mainstream and alternative.
[02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:24.245]  And as much as I'd like to believe it's just jealous people, more and more it's being proven it's government.
[02:56:24.245 --> 02:56:32.189]  And that's their counter, is to try to throw up such a screen of arguing and fighting and infighting that nobody can ever get together.
[02:56:32.189 --> 02:56:37.712]  And I think when you see somebody being attacked and lied about, that's the seal that they're good and can be trusted.
[02:56:38.985 --> 02:56:40.266]  Well, there's no question.
[02:56:40.266 --> 02:56:49.691]  We've been subjected to attacks that were organized and funded by, we think, pharmaceutical companies or their front companies, and this has just been going on for years.
[02:56:49.691 --> 02:56:52.272]  We hardly even really talk about it anymore.
[02:56:52.272 --> 02:56:57.015]  It's just a routine part of being a publisher of true information.
[02:56:57.015 --> 02:57:05.160]  I mean, you know, the only way to not be harassed in our system today is to lie on behalf of the corporation.
[02:57:05.948 --> 02:57:20.737]  If you, if you go out and you say nice happy things about the drug company and about the oil companies and about all the politicians who are lying to us and spending us into a complete bankruptcy, if you say happy things about those people, you'll be left alone.
[02:57:20.737 --> 02:57:22.578]  You won't be harassed by anybody.
[02:57:22.578 --> 02:57:28.382]  It's only when you go out and start asking questions like, like what Ron Paul does every single day.
[02:57:28.382 --> 02:57:32.844]  You know, Ron Paul is being attacked precisely because he is effective.
[02:57:32.844 --> 02:57:35.166]  And that's the same reason that you and I are being attacked, Alex.
[02:57:35.816 --> 02:57:37.957]  Well, and also it's a military tactic.
[02:57:37.957 --> 02:57:42.598]  Whenever they deny they're trying to forcibly inoculate nurses, and they are.
[02:57:42.598 --> 02:57:47.320]  Or they lie and say there's no plan to get rid of the dollar as they openly have debates about doing it.
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:54.862]  It's a denial so that we just debate whether it exists or not instead of having a real debate about whether we want it or not, or if it's legal or lawful.
[02:57:55.362 --> 02:58:09.197]  And it's the same thing by making it about Alex Jones being bad, or Ron Paul being bad, or Mike Adams being bad, or Dr. Stan Monteith being bad, then even our defenders spend their time defending us instead of going out and warning new people.
[02:58:09.197 --> 02:58:11.740]  So that's why I always tell my listeners, don't defend me!
[02:58:12.682 --> 02:58:15.744]  Go out and reach new people and warn them about fluoride in the water.
[02:58:15.744 --> 02:58:17.485]  Warn them about GMO food.
[02:58:17.485 --> 02:58:19.206]  Warn them about vaccines.
[02:58:19.206 --> 02:58:26.190]  Warn them about the attack on Iran and lying about their processing centers for uranium and how that's a hoax.
[02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:27.691]  Do not defend me.
[02:58:27.691 --> 02:58:30.993]  My family doesn't get saved if you defend me.
[02:58:30.993 --> 02:58:32.414]  Wake everybody up.
[02:58:32.414 --> 02:58:35.916]  Spend your time doing that and then all of us can be saved from this tyranny.
[02:58:35.916 --> 02:58:38.777]  Back in one minute with Mike Adams and your phone calls.
[02:58:38.777 --> 02:58:39.518]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:42.819 --> 02:58:46.322]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.322 --> 02:58:50.827]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.827 --> 02:58:54.210]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:58:54.210 --> 02:58:57.853]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:58:57.853 --> 02:59:02.418]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:59:02.418 --> 02:59:08.023]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[02:59:08.283 --> 02:59:13.066]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[02:59:13.066 --> 02:59:16.689]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[02:59:16.689 --> 02:59:21.512]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[02:59:21.512 --> 02:59:28.076]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:59:28.076 --> 02:59:30.018]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[02:59:30.498 --> 02:59:33.699]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:59:33.699 --> 02:59:38.201]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:59:38.201 --> 02:59:39.922]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:59:39.922 --> 02:59:40.442]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.442 --> 02:59:40.722]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:40.722 --> 02:59:40.982]  Don't wait.
[02:59:40.982 --> 02:59:41.603]  Call today.
[02:59:41.603 --> 02:59:42.703]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.703 --> 02:59:43.904]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.582 --> 03:00:18.307]  Mike Adams with us for another 20 minutes, then I'm going to get into the economy, a bunch of police state news, and what really happened at the G20.
[03:00:18.307 --> 03:00:23.330]  The aftermath of that, if you look at it in hindsight, very precedent-setting on multiple fronts.
[03:00:23.330 --> 03:00:30.315]  World government being announced, global tax being announced, attacks on Iran being hyped, end of the dollar being hyped.
[03:00:30.315 --> 03:00:35.499]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[03:00:35.499 --> 03:00:38.681]  Let's talk to Chris in Maryland, then Tanya and others.
[03:00:38.681 --> 03:00:39.922]  Chris, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[03:00:40.802 --> 03:00:42.563]  Hey, how you guys doing today?
[03:00:42.563 --> 03:00:43.544]  Good.
[03:00:43.544 --> 03:00:51.628]  Okay, I don't know if you guys got this, but I have a document from the federal government that I culled off of Google.
[03:00:51.628 --> 03:00:55.290]  It is the International Swine Flu Conference they had a month ago.
[03:00:55.290 --> 03:00:56.451]  Yeah, we covered it.
[03:00:56.451 --> 03:01:07.517]  We originally broke that, and we had reporters who were there on the show, like Wayne Madsen, but that was forced quarantines, how to deal with dead bodies, lockdowns of cities.
[03:01:07.517 --> 03:01:08.838]  Mike Adams, you want to comment on that?
[03:01:10.134 --> 03:01:11.955]  Uh, no, you're exactly right.
[03:01:11.955 --> 03:01:15.417]  That was a very important piece of breaking news that wasn't supposed to break.
[03:01:15.417 --> 03:01:19.980]  That was supposed to be kept, you know, behind the curtain, but it was exposed.
[03:01:19.980 --> 03:01:26.503]  But do you ever notice now, caller, notice that when you tell people about that, they look at you like you're crazy.
[03:01:26.503 --> 03:01:27.884]  They don't believe it's real.
[03:01:27.884 --> 03:01:29.485]  Have you experienced that?
[03:01:29.485 --> 03:01:33.347]  Oh, man, people, I have my own family calling me a nut job or
[03:01:33.917 --> 03:01:41.082]  Or one of these people that are getting too into it that I'm going to go nuts and I'm like, hey, I'm just trying to find out what's going on around me.
[03:01:41.082 --> 03:01:42.062]  Exactly.
[03:01:42.062 --> 03:01:48.226]  Well, that's because they know they should be going nuts about this tyranny and they know things are out of control.
[03:01:48.226 --> 03:01:52.049]  And so they're telling you what they're afraid of about themselves.
[03:01:52.049 --> 03:01:52.469]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:52.469 --> 03:01:53.510]  Go ahead.
[03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:55.771]  One last, uh, well, one, a couple of things.
[03:01:55.771 --> 03:01:59.874]  Uh, they had 15 sessions and one of them here in the breakout session one,
[03:02:00.561 --> 03:02:06.823]  One of their bullets is conducting morgue operations, so they were obviously planning on mass casualties and mass deaths.
[03:02:06.823 --> 03:02:09.984]  No, no, they've got quarantines, lockdowns, forced inoculations in there.
[03:02:09.984 --> 03:02:13.245]  Mike Adams, your comments on that document.
[03:02:13.245 --> 03:02:22.388]  Well, when I read that document, you know what the first thing that came to my mind was, is that the ultimate plan for health care reform is to reduce the population by 80 percent.
[03:02:22.388 --> 03:02:25.129]  Because then, health care becomes affordable.
[03:02:25.129 --> 03:02:28.670]  Did you see the cover of Newsweek, where it said the case for killing Granny?
[03:02:29.969 --> 03:02:31.450]  No, I haven't seen that one.
[03:02:31.450 --> 03:02:34.772]  In fact, guys, pull up the Newsweek cover of the case for killing Granny.
[03:02:34.772 --> 03:02:36.673]  I can't find the actual article.
[03:02:36.673 --> 03:02:39.494]  The actual... Keep going, Mike.
[03:02:39.494 --> 03:02:47.158]  Well, again, if you... This country is going broke, treating sickness and disease.
[03:02:47.158 --> 03:02:52.341]  And at some point, it's not unreasonable to think that somebody at high levels would say, you know what?
[03:02:52.341 --> 03:02:57.704]  The only way we can afford healthcare in this country is if we have fewer people to care for.
[03:02:58.454 --> 03:03:12.306]  And my goodness, that whole session that went on there, training for body bags, and training for quarantine, and training for mass deaths, I mean, that was some really concerning stuff.
[03:03:12.306 --> 03:03:14.288]  You know, it should get you thinking hard about
[03:03:14.788 --> 03:03:16.930]  What's really being planned for the near future?
[03:03:29.705 --> 03:03:56.802]  uh... but there's no mention of that then simultaneously they have all these news articles saying there's too many people we've got a reduced world population having kids is bad for your carbon footprint and by the way we need to kill granny the case for killing granny there's the Newsweek headline online from Newsweek uh... and then they sit there and say we're gonna kill you but then it doesn't exist and then your neighbor even if you show your neighbor Newsweek they go you're insane that's a fake Newsweek
[03:03:57.813 --> 03:03:58.482]  No, I'm not kidding!
[03:04:00.083 --> 03:04:06.964]  You know, the healthcare reform debate right now is completely congruent with these kinds of evil philosophies.
[03:04:06.964 --> 03:04:26.528]  You know, it's absolutely true now that if this healthcare reform bill gets passed, and if you don't agree to sign up for healthcare insurance and pay, what is it, $1,900 a year or so for an individual, or $13,000 for a family, they will be able to arrest you, imprison you for one year, and the IRS can fine you $25,000.
[03:04:26.528 --> 03:04:26.668]  I mean,
[03:04:28.939 --> 03:04:29.319]  Hold on.
[03:04:29.319 --> 03:04:29.820]  Hold on.
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:30.640]  I'm sorry Mike.
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:31.301]  I'm sorry Mike.
[03:04:31.301 --> 03:04:32.341]  We have breaking news.
[03:04:32.341 --> 03:04:34.243]  I'm going to cover this with you when we come back.
[03:04:34.243 --> 03:04:36.344]  It always comes out in hindsight.
[03:04:36.344 --> 03:04:37.245]  Look at this video.
[03:04:37.245 --> 03:04:39.106]  They're definitely cops.
[03:04:39.106 --> 03:04:42.488]  Age of Provocateurs documented at G20 during March.
[03:04:42.488 --> 03:04:45.971]  Infowars.com exclusive article with the video.
[03:04:45.971 --> 03:04:46.991]  Right now you can look at them.
[03:04:46.991 --> 03:04:48.893]  They're clearly police officers.
[03:04:48.893 --> 03:04:50.113]  Huge guys.
[03:04:50.113 --> 03:04:51.634]  I've seen this over and over again.
[03:04:51.634 --> 03:04:53.856]  Oh my God.
[03:04:53.856 --> 03:04:54.536]  Oh my God.
[03:04:54.536 --> 03:04:55.937]  That's why they attacked Luke.
[03:04:55.937 --> 03:04:57.839]  They didn't like it that he was exposing them.
[03:04:58.599 --> 03:04:59.781]  Man, these people are evil.
[03:04:59.781 --> 03:05:00.422]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:01.543]  Stay there, Mike.
[03:05:01.543 --> 03:05:04.567]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.567 --> 03:05:09.913]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.913 --> 03:05:14.840]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:16.941]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:16.941 --> 03:05:18.122]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.122 --> 03:05:19.243]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.243 --> 03:05:21.124]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.124 --> 03:05:22.204]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.204 --> 03:05:24.406]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.406 --> 03:05:25.746]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.746 --> 03:05:27.267]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.267 --> 03:05:32.551]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.551 --> 03:05:36.133]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.133 --> 03:05:39.595]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:39.935 --> 03:05:41.156]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.156 --> 03:05:42.076]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.076 --> 03:05:43.176]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.176 --> 03:05:44.097]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.097 --> 03:05:45.197]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.197 --> 03:05:48.238]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:05:50.019 --> 03:05:50.939]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:05.907]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:05.907 --> 03:06:10.433]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.433 --> 03:06:12.716]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:12.716 --> 03:06:14.338]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.338 --> 03:06:15.380]  There is a solution.
[03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:24.022]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:06:24.022 --> 03:06:31.484]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:07:08.935 --> 03:07:12.656]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[03:07:20.538 --> 03:07:20.738]  I think so.

[03:07:54.128 --> 03:07:54.829]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[03:07:54.829 --> 03:07:56.291]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:07:56.291 --> 03:07:58.213]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.129 --> 03:08:14.471]  Ladies and gentlemen, the video is flooding in as people have a chance to analyze it.
[03:08:14.471 --> 03:08:17.132]  We're analyzing ours, finding similar things.
[03:08:17.132 --> 03:08:18.493]  We have a limited crew.
[03:08:18.493 --> 03:08:20.034]  They just got back Saturday.
[03:08:20.034 --> 03:08:21.815]  We've already posted a lot of videos.
[03:08:21.815 --> 03:08:23.916]  This video is from another activist.
[03:08:23.916 --> 03:08:27.998]  Clearly police officers breaking people's cameras, trying to stir up trouble.
[03:08:27.998 --> 03:08:32.440]  I can't play the audio because there's so much cussing, but these are just two of the three
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:34.521]  And big, huge cops.
[03:08:34.521 --> 03:08:37.162]  They put their biggest cops in to pose as anarchists.
[03:08:37.162 --> 03:08:49.350]  And we're gonna try to match this up with other video of big, scrapping guys who will throw stuff at police so the police have a pretext to then fire and attack the general crowd.
[03:08:49.350 --> 03:08:53.733]  And, uh, I remember... Pardon me?
[03:08:55.612 --> 03:08:58.178]  Yeah, breaking demonstrators' cameras, absolutely.
[03:08:58.178 --> 03:09:00.082]  That's in the video.
[03:09:00.082 --> 03:09:03.529]  We can't play it because there's so much cussing, but look at these cops.
[03:09:03.529 --> 03:09:04.552]  I mean, look at these guys.
[03:09:04.552 --> 03:09:05.754]  Now, we caught them in Denver.
[03:09:07.236 --> 03:09:11.961]  Last year, mainstream news, Denver Post headline, police caught attacking their own police.
[03:09:11.961 --> 03:09:15.345]  We caught them in Canada at the SPP meeting last year.
[03:09:15.345 --> 03:09:21.091]  They were caught, but the BBC admitted it, in England, and they killed a guy, beat him to death.
[03:09:21.091 --> 03:09:22.953]  These guys need to be criminally charged.
[03:09:22.953 --> 03:09:24.915]  We need to find out who they are.
[03:09:24.915 --> 03:09:27.457]  But it's, I mean, they put these big giant cops in.
[03:09:27.457 --> 03:09:29.760]  Mike Adams, your comment on agent provocateurs?
[03:09:31.118 --> 03:09:36.501]  This is a preview of things to come, Alex, and great work on your part and the contributors who are sending this in.
[03:09:36.501 --> 03:09:38.462]  I can't wait to look at this myself.
[03:09:38.462 --> 03:09:42.824]  But this is what's going to be happening in more cities across the U.S.
[03:09:42.824 --> 03:09:49.467]  And this is a test to see how people react, to see whether they can do this covertly and be exposed.
[03:09:49.467 --> 03:09:58.791]  So the fact that you are exposing them is probably going to help save lives down the road, because it's going to help suppress that kind of tactic from being used excessively.
[03:09:58.791 --> 03:10:00.092]  I mean, they're going to try it anyway.
[03:10:00.552 --> 03:10:08.557]  But the thing is, we keep exposing them and other people do, and then the Royal Mounted Police admit it, the Denver Police admit it, and no one gets in trouble!
[03:10:08.557 --> 03:10:24.527]  That's why Luke Rudowsky was there, and Rob Dewar, there were others saying, don't be violent, you'll have a couple thousand people, or in this case, a couple hundred, you'll have fifteen people led by cops, they'll yell and scream and tell Luke, shut up, when he calls out against violence, and then it's cops!
[03:10:24.527 --> 03:10:26.509]  I mean, how evil are these police?
[03:10:27.594 --> 03:10:37.462]  What we've got to do is get some long-range cameras going from people who are away from the immediate fray and who are not in the fight.
[03:10:37.462 --> 03:10:38.522]  That happened in Greece this year.
[03:10:38.522 --> 03:10:42.385]  In fact, pull up Greek TV agent provocateurs.
[03:10:42.385 --> 03:10:50.091]  Uniformed police directing regular cops busting out windows at another global meeting to then blame it on the general protesters.
[03:10:50.091 --> 03:10:50.652]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:10:51.121 --> 03:10:51.781]  Yeah.
[03:10:51.781 --> 03:10:52.802]  No, no, you're exactly right.
[03:10:52.802 --> 03:10:58.765]  I mean, this is like a local law enforcement false flag operation, and they're going to keep doing it for as long as they can get away with it.
[03:10:58.765 --> 03:11:05.529]  But in the video that you're seeing right now, Alex, can you make out the faces very clearly of those responsible?
[03:11:05.529 --> 03:11:09.471]  No, they're wearing masks, but it's big, strapping cops.
[03:11:09.471 --> 03:11:11.353]  I mean, they stick out like a sore thumb.
[03:11:11.353 --> 03:11:12.293]  It's always the same.
[03:11:12.293 --> 03:11:16.155]  I mean, it's big guys, 230, 240 pounds.
[03:11:16.155 --> 03:11:18.957]  They always dress the same, ball caps and their face covered.
[03:11:21.274 --> 03:11:22.557]  They're breaking people's cameras.
[03:11:22.557 --> 03:11:24.141]  They're starting fights.
[03:11:24.141 --> 03:11:25.384]  They're just absolute scum.
[03:11:26.616 --> 03:11:28.758]  Pittsburgh has been turned into a police state.
[03:11:28.758 --> 03:11:34.162]  I mean, the city was a fortress, and this is a sign of things to come.
[03:11:34.162 --> 03:11:37.064]  This is important breaking news, so go ahead and roll with it, Alex.
[03:11:37.064 --> 03:11:38.305]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:11:38.305 --> 03:11:39.126]  We're talking flu.
[03:11:39.126 --> 03:11:40.207]  That's more important.
[03:11:40.207 --> 03:11:43.049]  Just, I'm going to cover this with Paul Watson briefly after you leave.
[03:11:43.049 --> 03:11:44.450]  Get him to do a big report on it.
[03:11:44.450 --> 03:11:45.691]  Because it's not enough to just show this.
[03:11:45.691 --> 03:11:49.274]  I'm going to get him to show the Denver stuff and everything else so people forget.
[03:11:49.274 --> 03:11:51.156]  So we want to remind him.
[03:11:51.156 --> 03:11:53.437]  Tanya in Georgia, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[03:11:53.437 --> 03:11:53.798]  Go ahead.
[03:11:55.078 --> 03:11:56.238]  Hi Alex and Mike.
[03:11:56.238 --> 03:12:00.460]  I just want to let you know that I have an insert from my local Walgreens.
[03:12:00.460 --> 03:12:04.461]  It's from the Novartis vaccine for the regular seasonal flu.
[03:12:04.461 --> 03:12:18.705]  It says 2009-2010 formula and right in this document it says it is that fluorine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility.
[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:24.361]  So Alex, you've been saying all along that they're putting steroids in it, and it says right here, you know, we are.
[03:12:24.361 --> 03:12:25.461]  This could make you fertile.
[03:12:25.461 --> 03:12:26.581]  Oh yeah, look, look.
[03:12:26.581 --> 03:12:30.122]  I mean, it's come out with the IEDs and the vaccines, and they always know.
[03:12:30.122 --> 03:12:39.424]  They design it, and now explain what the Fluvorin is, and this Endrolucan-2 that they're adding, Mike Adams, but ma'am, I need to go to Walgreens.
[03:12:39.424 --> 03:12:42.844]  Every time I pull up an internet site, it's Walgreens ads for the flu.
[03:12:42.844 --> 03:12:46.645]  I need to get their insert, but will you scan that and email it?
[03:12:47.145 --> 03:12:50.870]  Yeah, I'd prefer to fax it if that's fine and there's a lot of other information in here too.
[03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:53.393]  They say they've been putting H1N1 in the vaccine since 1977.
[03:13:04.284 --> 03:13:06.467]  And they have a long list of side effects that have been reported.
[03:13:06.467 --> 03:13:07.948]  This is a very informative insert.
[03:13:07.948 --> 03:13:15.878]  Okay, read it to us, read it to us, because I knew all this was in there, and I guess I haven't thought big genius, because I'm not, to go out and get the insert.
[03:13:15.878 --> 03:13:23.327]  I mean, they admit in their literature online they're doing this, but Mike, were you aware of those statements on the Norvitis statement?
[03:13:24.244 --> 03:13:25.346]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:25.346 --> 03:13:27.711]  Remember, those are the ones that are required by federal law.
[03:13:27.711 --> 03:13:31.860]  There's a lot of information that's not required that they're withholding.
[03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:34.766]  So, as she reads the list, keep in mind what you're not hearing, too.
[03:13:35.666 --> 03:13:42.850]  Yeah, thanks for holding so long to tell us this, Marianne, or what caller is this?
[03:13:42.850 --> 03:13:43.811]  Tanya.
[03:13:43.811 --> 03:13:46.993]  Okay, Tanya, they just changed my list and it erased your name.
[03:13:46.993 --> 03:13:48.594]  Tanya in Georgia.
[03:13:48.594 --> 03:13:53.077]  Tanya, recap, I'm going to sit back, so is Mike Adams.
[03:13:53.077 --> 03:13:57.239]  Read the cover sheet, what it says, and read us those parts.
[03:13:57.239 --> 03:14:01.002]  Well, it's really, really long, so I'm just going to go through a few points that I was highlighting for you.
[03:14:01.877 --> 03:14:10.201]  The first thing that I noticed is that it says, fluvorin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.
[03:14:10.201 --> 03:14:23.647]  And then later on, where it's talking about who should and should not get the shot, it says nobody under the age of four, and it also says that it is also not known whether fluvorin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, or can affect reproductive capacity.
[03:14:26.454 --> 03:14:30.575]  It's expectant mothers that are one of the groups being targeted for this virus, by the way.
[03:14:30.575 --> 03:14:31.856]  I just wanted to interject.
[03:14:31.856 --> 03:14:33.516]  Right, and this is regular.
[03:14:33.516 --> 03:14:39.818]  This is just a regular seasonal flu, which hasn't been as controversial, so some of the pregnant women might not even be as scared of this one.
[03:14:39.818 --> 03:14:46.800]  And it also says in here that whoever's giving the vaccine is supposed to tell the person that they're giving the shot to the benefits and the risks.
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:54.683]  Now, I think if they told somebody, hey, this can make you sterile, you know, this has theramerosol in it, which it also says it does, that, you know, people might not take it.
[03:14:54.683 --> 03:14:55.943]  And I don't think they're telling people that.
[03:14:56.417 --> 03:14:57.618]  How did you get the insert?
[03:14:57.618 --> 03:14:59.139]  You asked for it at Walgreens?
[03:14:59.139 --> 03:15:00.320]  Yeah, and let me tell you, it's funny.
[03:15:00.320 --> 03:15:04.123]  I walked into Walgreens and I said, what kind of shot are you getting?
[03:15:04.123 --> 03:15:05.024]  What company is it from?
[03:15:05.024 --> 03:15:05.964]  And they didn't know.
[03:15:05.964 --> 03:15:07.586]  And I said, well, do you have an insert?
[03:15:07.586 --> 03:15:08.306]  And they said, what?
[03:15:08.306 --> 03:15:11.128]  And I go, you know, like a little paper that comes in with your shipment.
[03:15:11.128 --> 03:15:12.489]  So she goes back and she's looking.
[03:15:12.489 --> 03:15:13.630]  I'm assuming this is the pharmacist.
[03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:14.871]  There was two women back there.
[03:15:14.871 --> 03:15:15.572]  They're looking around.
[03:15:15.572 --> 03:15:19.395]  They come back with this piece of paper they pulled out of the bottom of the box of vials.
[03:15:19.395 --> 03:15:20.876]  All folded up, very tiny.
[03:15:20.876 --> 03:15:22.337]  Unfold it right in front of me and say, here.
[03:15:22.765 --> 03:15:26.288]  Let me start, you know, I'm looking at it and it's really long, and I said, can I just take this with me?
[03:15:26.288 --> 03:15:27.508]  And they said, oh yeah, sure, take it.
[03:15:27.508 --> 03:15:28.930]  Like, they had no interest in it.
[03:15:28.930 --> 03:15:35.915]  Well, this is important, and I've read that this stuff's in there, but it's another thing to actually have the insert.
[03:15:35.915 --> 03:15:37.155]  I'm gonna give you our facts.
[03:15:37.155 --> 03:15:44.681]  The problem is, on those tiny, you know, regular-sized sheet of paper, they fold it up tiny to go in the vial, and it's tiny, tiny wording.
[03:15:44.681 --> 03:15:46.482]  I don't know if that'll fax, but you can try.
[03:15:46.482 --> 03:15:48.023]  I blew it up.
[03:15:48.023 --> 03:15:48.644]  Oh, you blew it up.
[03:15:48.644 --> 03:15:48.764]  It's 866...
[03:15:50.925 --> 03:15:52.767]  8-9-4-17-67.
[03:15:52.767 --> 03:15:57.670]  That's 8-6-6-8-9-4-17-67.
[03:15:57.670 --> 03:16:01.593]  Will you go ahead and fax that to us as soon as possible?
[03:16:01.593 --> 03:16:07.857]  Is there no way that, because if you blew it up, can you scan it and email it to Watson?
[03:16:07.857 --> 03:16:09.358]  Because people need to see that.
[03:16:09.918 --> 03:16:10.299]  Yeah, I got it.
[03:16:10.299 --> 03:16:14.504]  I'm going to leave my house right now and go fax it to you, but I had one other question for Mike.
[03:16:29.326 --> 03:16:40.320]  Also in this insert it says that it's very important that you shake the vial in between each dosage and I'm wondering if if they don't shake it does that mean that you can get like an even higher amount of mercury than what they're saying?
[03:16:41.397 --> 03:17:03.164]  Yes, absolutely, and this is one of the reasons why you've got to be very careful if you even get a vaccine, of where you get it, because many of the people administering these vaccines, especially in these retail outlets, they are probably shaking up the vaccine, which means you could get a concentration of the thimerosal or other chemicals that's up to 200 times higher than what it's supposed to be.
[03:17:03.524 --> 03:17:10.408]  So your baby could get the one shot that's 200 times more toxic than the next baby that they actually shook the vial for.
[03:17:10.408 --> 03:17:13.290]  And that's one of the reasons why vaccines are so dangerous.
[03:17:13.290 --> 03:17:18.873]  The people giving these shots are not following the rules, and they probably didn't even read the insert that you read.
[03:17:18.873 --> 03:17:19.914]  No, I don't think they did read it.
[03:17:19.914 --> 03:17:20.714]  I don't think they did.
[03:17:20.714 --> 03:17:24.917]  I'm going to leave right now and go ahead and pack this team and let you move on, but I just wanted to make sure that you were aware that this was coming to you.
[03:17:25.782 --> 03:17:36.051]  You know, the reason that they include that language in that insert, Alex, is so that if infertility problems become widespread, they can say, well, we warned you.
[03:17:36.051 --> 03:17:39.114]  You know, they can just disavow any responsibility.
[03:17:40.205 --> 03:17:44.529]  But then meanwhile, the nightly news says it doesn't sterilize you.
[03:17:44.529 --> 03:17:53.418]  Sure, the White House science czar says he wants to sterilize you through vaccines in your water, but that's okay.
[03:17:53.418 --> 03:17:56.361]  And then you read the insert, oh, it might sterilize you.
[03:17:56.361 --> 03:17:57.402]  Well, that's okay.
[03:17:57.402 --> 03:18:00.425]  You know, the government's good people.
[03:18:00.425 --> 03:18:01.386]  These are good people.
[03:18:01.386 --> 03:18:03.067]  We ought to, you know, be sterilized.
[03:18:06.123 --> 03:18:12.426]  I had a reporter from a mainstream network news organization call me maybe two weeks ago.
[03:18:12.426 --> 03:18:15.288]  He wanted to interview me about swine flu vaccine.
[03:18:15.288 --> 03:18:18.930]  Obviously he was looking for an alternative viewpoint.
[03:18:18.930 --> 03:18:27.354]  He swore to me up and down that he had been told by the drug companies themselves that there was no thimerosal used in any of the swine flu vaccine.
[03:18:28.337 --> 03:18:30.858]  And I tried to educate this reporter.
[03:18:30.858 --> 03:18:31.959]  I said, no, you're wrong.
[03:18:31.959 --> 03:18:34.000]  There's thimerosal in there.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:35.621]  And he said, no, there isn't.
[03:18:35.621 --> 03:18:36.741]  It's not being used.
[03:18:36.741 --> 03:18:45.886]  And to this day, that network, which I don't want to name, but they've been reporting stories on the swine flu vaccine and claiming there's no thimerosal in it.
[03:18:45.886 --> 03:18:53.130]  Even though I can pull up a hundred releases from the medical companies admitting they put a higher dose of the thimerosal in this one.
[03:18:55.336 --> 03:19:03.382]  You know, what has happened to the skepticism and just the common sense of our mainstream journalists these days?
[03:19:03.382 --> 03:19:06.864]  Or when they get caught lying, it's like, oh, you lied to me, that's good.
[03:19:06.864 --> 03:19:09.386]  I would be mad at you if you didn't lie to me.
[03:19:09.386 --> 03:19:11.067]  It's like it's cute and funny.
[03:19:11.067 --> 03:19:13.409]  Oh, Bayer, you knowingly gave me AIDS in the shot.
[03:19:13.409 --> 03:19:14.129]  Oh, thank you.
[03:19:14.129 --> 03:19:15.810]  And it's like, Bayer is trusted.
[03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:16.611]  They like to murder.
[03:19:18.655 --> 03:19:20.516]  Oh, Gardasil's killing a bunch of people!
[03:19:20.516 --> 03:19:21.557]  Oh, how good!
[03:19:21.557 --> 03:19:24.799]  Oh, it's so... How dare you talk bad about them!
[03:19:24.799 --> 03:19:30.944]  Well, listen, Mike Adams, Health Ranger, NaturalNews.com, great job today.
[03:19:30.944 --> 03:19:37.728]  Thank you for all your insight, and I hope to come visit you sometime down in Ecuador, or next time you fly back through into the States, through Texas.
[03:19:37.728 --> 03:19:38.329]  Come and see us.
[03:19:38.329 --> 03:19:40.530]  We really appreciate your time.
[03:19:40.530 --> 03:19:42.071]  Thank you, Alex, and all listeners.
[03:19:42.071 --> 03:19:42.412]  Thank you.
[03:19:42.412 --> 03:19:43.612]  It's been an honor.
[03:19:43.612 --> 03:19:44.813]  Man, it's just been great having you.
[03:19:44.813 --> 03:19:46.815]  By the way, I know a lot of people have these inserts.
[03:19:47.879 --> 03:19:52.128]  Scan them, send them to ridersandinfowars.com with a brief description.
[03:19:52.128 --> 03:19:53.712]  We need to get that up.
[03:19:53.712 --> 03:19:55.496]  I mean, that's simple stuff I forget to do.
[03:19:55.496 --> 03:19:56.538]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:56.538 --> 03:19:56.819]  Thank you.
[03:20:01.468 --> 03:20:08.415]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about Graf Undersafes, the makers of the highest quality safes and vault doors available on the market today.
[03:20:08.415 --> 03:20:11.278]  Graf Undersafes are known as the Rolls-Royce of safes.
[03:20:11.278 --> 03:20:15.923]  Since 1968, they have operated based on their original principle, quality above all else.
[03:20:15.923 --> 03:20:20.427]  Whether it's a custom-fitted vault door safe, you can rest assured that your valuables will be protected.
[03:20:20.427 --> 03:20:22.309]  Do not buy into the illusion of security.
[03:20:22.409 --> 03:20:22.929]  We're good to go!
[03:20:41.903 --> 03:20:42.143]  I think so.
[03:21:01.375 --> 03:21:03.558]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[03:21:03.558 --> 03:21:05.981]  I've come with a message of information.
[03:21:05.981 --> 03:21:08.585]  9-11 was an inside job.
[03:21:08.585 --> 03:21:09.806]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[03:21:09.806 --> 03:21:11.529]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[03:21:11.529 --> 03:21:14.412]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[03:21:14.412 --> 03:21:18.538]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[03:21:27.695 --> 03:21:32.561]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[03:21:36.363 --> 03:21:37.844]  How dare you?
[03:21:37.844 --> 03:21:43.890]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[03:21:43.890 --> 03:21:46.752]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[03:21:46.752 --> 03:21:52.977]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[03:22:01.587 --> 03:22:02.227]  G'day!
[03:22:02.227 --> 03:22:03.948]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:22:03.948 --> 03:22:04.308]  August 31st, 2009.
[03:22:04.308 --> 03:22:05.389]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5470.
[03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:08.670]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8195, $4.9098 for a half-ounce, or $2.4549 for a quarter-ounce.
[03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:09.271]  That's $9.8195, $4.9098, and $2.4549.
[03:22:20.586 --> 03:22:34.239]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[03:22:34.239 --> 03:22:42.807]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[03:22:43.047 --> 03:22:44.148]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[03:22:44.148 --> 03:22:48.510]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[03:22:48.510 --> 03:22:49.610]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:51.451]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[03:22:51.451 --> 03:22:51.692]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:51.692 --> 03:22:51.992]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:23:01.940 --> 03:23:07.101]  Hi, it's MZ wondering how many of us Alex Jones fans intend to take the swine flu vaccine.
[03:23:07.101 --> 03:23:10.602]  I'm not, don't trust it, but then I don't want to get the disease either.
[03:23:10.602 --> 03:23:16.323]  So I use PureWorks, a unique disinfectant that comes in foam or spray form.
[03:23:16.323 --> 03:23:18.883]  PureWorks is not your typical hand disinfectant.
[03:23:18.883 --> 03:23:23.424]  There is no alcohol to dry your skin and it lasts for hours, not minutes.
[03:23:23.424 --> 03:23:26.145]  Use PureWorks to protect yourself from disease and infection.
[03:23:26.605 --> 03:23:32.333]  You can find out all about it and order it online at NoGerms.info.
[03:23:32.333 --> 03:23:34.596]  That's NoGerms.info.
[03:23:34.596 --> 03:23:43.167]  Don't introduce potentially dangerous chemicals or toxins into your body to keep you well when they could actually cause the sickness you want to avoid.
[03:23:43.167 --> 03:23:44.169]  Don't pick your nose.
[03:23:44.509 --> 03:23:49.092]  Don't shake hands and don't handle banisters, rails, and doorknobs.
[03:23:49.092 --> 03:23:54.214]  Do try PureWorks, available online at wholesale pricing to Alex Jones listeners.
[03:23:54.214 --> 03:23:55.955]  Go to no germs dot info.
[03:23:55.955 --> 03:23:58.176]  That's no germs dot info.
[03:23:58.176 --> 03:23:59.897]  Be well and stay well.
[03:23:59.897 --> 03:24:00.618]  Best MZ.
[03:24:07.866 --> 03:24:11.809]  They play us off black, white, old, young against each other.
[03:24:11.809 --> 03:24:14.071]  They divide us along religion.
[03:24:14.071 --> 03:24:17.354]  They divide us across party.
[03:24:17.354 --> 03:24:26.603]  Well, the establishment is a scientific dictatorship who studies what makes humans tick and uses that material, that data, to control us.
[03:24:29.068 --> 03:24:41.981]  Saturday, September 26, three undercover officers attempt to infiltrate a march against police brutality at the University of Pittsburgh, but fail miserably due to their horrendous
[03:24:43.171 --> 03:24:44.832]  Disguise attempts.
[03:24:44.832 --> 03:24:47.432]  During the march, one of them breaks a photographer's camera.
[03:24:47.432 --> 03:24:52.714]  This is just one example of a larger pattern of attempts to silence the media during the G20 protest.
[03:24:52.714 --> 03:24:57.235]  And if you would have dare broke a cop's camera, they'd charge you with assault with a deadly weapon or something.
[03:24:57.235 --> 03:25:02.197]  But it's okay for them to beat up women and use police dogs and break the law and smash your camera.
[03:25:04.178 --> 03:25:07.460]  Because they work for a lawless criminal corporate takeover.
[03:25:07.460 --> 03:25:09.962]  And they love the vaccines they get shot full of.
[03:25:09.962 --> 03:25:11.864]  They love their kids being retarded.
[03:25:11.864 --> 03:25:12.984]  They love the tyranny.
[03:25:12.984 --> 03:25:14.806]  They love having bankruptcy.
[03:25:14.806 --> 03:25:15.206]  They love it.
[03:25:15.206 --> 03:25:19.089]  That's why they have the highest suicide rates, highest rates of drug use.
[03:25:19.089 --> 03:25:21.931]  They're unhappy because they work for the dark side.
[03:25:21.931 --> 03:25:29.296]  I'm not saying all police, but certainly the police they shipped in from Miami-Dade County, and the Border Patrol they shipped in, and the National Guard.
[03:25:29.296 --> 03:25:31.198]  These were un-American pieces of trash.
[03:25:32.782 --> 03:25:35.444]  That video is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:25:35.444 --> 03:25:39.986]  We'll roll some of that in the background without the audio because of all the cussing.
[03:25:39.986 --> 03:25:43.388]  Poor people, as folks watch at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:25:43.388 --> 03:25:46.990]  But let's go to Mary Anne in Maryland.
[03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:47.971]  Mary Anne, you're on the air.
[03:25:50.370 --> 03:25:51.250]  Alex?
[03:25:51.250 --> 03:25:52.171]  Hi.
[03:25:52.171 --> 03:25:53.571]  Hi there.
[03:25:53.571 --> 03:26:02.453]  Listen, first I wanted to tell you that I really appreciate all your work and I do pass on to my friends and family.
[03:26:02.453 --> 03:26:06.835]  But I wanted to talk to you about a couple things that are going on in Maryland.
[03:26:06.835 --> 03:26:19.458]  I was a teacher for 10 years and every year the regular flu shot was offered to us for free on several specific dates at the beginning of the school year.
[03:26:20.371 --> 03:26:24.875]  And, you know, there was a lot of pressure from your peers to get this shot.
[03:26:24.875 --> 03:26:26.597]  I never got the shot.
[03:26:26.597 --> 03:26:31.181]  But, you know, people would be like, you're going to get sick, blah, blah, blah.
[03:26:31.181 --> 03:26:34.984]  Well, there's something going on at the University of Maryland right now.
[03:26:34.984 --> 03:26:41.610]  I'm not sure if you know that, but it has been quote, unquote, rumored that 557 cases of swine flu are going on since classes began.
[03:26:48.725 --> 03:26:51.018]  And the students are actually...
[03:26:52.495 --> 03:26:55.616]  Pressuring each other to go and get the swine flu vaccine.
[03:26:55.616 --> 03:26:56.997]  Yeah, it's all mind control.
[03:26:56.997 --> 03:27:00.179]  No, I have seen that at other big universities.
[03:27:00.179 --> 03:27:02.960]  One in Washington State had 2,000 cases.
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:05.081]  And a lot of times it's even fake announcements.
[03:27:05.081 --> 03:27:10.103]  They're just doing it as a psy-op to test, forcing everyone to stampede.
[03:27:10.103 --> 03:27:13.605]  And that's why little kids come up to my house and they go, look, I got the shot.
[03:27:13.605 --> 03:27:14.505]  Have you had the shot?
[03:27:14.505 --> 03:27:17.947]  And my little kids are asking me now, why aren't we getting shots?
[03:27:17.947 --> 03:27:19.047]  And I said, you don't want them, honey.
[03:27:19.047 --> 03:27:19.628]  They're bad for you.
[03:27:19.628 --> 03:27:20.548]  And they go, but
[03:27:20.868 --> 03:27:21.608]  I want one.
[03:27:21.608 --> 03:27:23.309]  The neighbor kids got them.
[03:27:23.309 --> 03:27:28.650]  So now they've got kids from not wanting shots to thinking, oh, it's a prize I get.
[03:27:28.650 --> 03:27:31.951]  But you read the inserts to know it sterilizes you, but that's okay.
[03:27:31.951 --> 03:27:33.551]  They told you so.
[03:27:33.551 --> 03:27:37.052]  I know, but see, this is like really super weird.
[03:27:37.052 --> 03:27:42.813]  This is totally going along with everything you talk about because... 1984.
[03:27:42.813 --> 03:27:47.454]  Yes, people who do not get the shot have to wear a face mask.
[03:27:48.430 --> 03:27:52.413]  So, it's obvious to other people that they haven't gotten a shot.
[03:27:52.413 --> 03:27:53.814]  Yeah, it's all part of hysteria.
[03:27:53.814 --> 03:27:59.198]  It's the new, it's part of being classified, wearing a yellow star, being in a terror database.
[03:27:59.198 --> 03:28:05.944]  It's all about the new medical tyranny of just like THX 1138 when he's helping the kid put the injector back on his arm.
[03:28:05.944 --> 03:28:07.605]  Oh, you've had your 20 shots this week.
[03:28:07.605 --> 03:28:09.046]  You're of the Lord.
[03:28:09.046 --> 03:28:10.927]  You're of the government.
[03:28:10.927 --> 03:28:13.069]  Obama loves the little children.
[03:28:13.069 --> 03:28:16.051]  Red, yellow, black and white, they are equal in our leader's sight.
[03:28:16.932 --> 03:28:19.173]  You see, you're starting to understand now.
[03:28:19.173 --> 03:28:24.856]  Yes, they're making people wear these at universities and at police departments, and there's no law.
[03:28:24.856 --> 03:28:26.757]  They just make you do it.
[03:28:26.757 --> 03:28:32.039]  And, uh, when you pay to go to college, you pay to go be brainwashed and taught how to worship government.
[03:28:32.039 --> 03:28:34.020]  That's it, basically.
[03:28:34.020 --> 03:28:37.942]  Well, I mean, and I went to... I've been through graduate school at Johns Hopkins.
[03:28:37.942 --> 03:28:38.823]  It's happening there.
[03:28:38.823 --> 03:28:43.225]  So you're saying, well, people need to go shoot video of this.
[03:28:43.225 --> 03:28:43.485]  Yeah.
[03:28:44.156 --> 03:28:59.936]  Well, unfortunately, I had to stop teaching because I'm disabled now, but they're also at the University of Maryland Medical Center saying that young children need to be given two doses of the swine flu vaccine.
[03:29:01.537 --> 03:29:03.119]  Two or three.
[03:29:03.119 --> 03:29:04.460]  Two or three.
[03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:06.542]  See, they said four to give people.
[03:29:06.542 --> 03:29:07.082]  Oh, that's a lot.
[03:29:07.082 --> 03:29:08.363]  They said, oh, it's only two now.
[03:29:08.363 --> 03:29:10.806]  And people went, oh.
[03:29:10.806 --> 03:29:13.408]  Don't worry, there won't be any more pain for the children.
[03:29:13.408 --> 03:29:16.471]  There won't be any more high intelligence or frustration.
[03:29:16.471 --> 03:29:19.634]  You'll just learn how to take your shots.
[03:29:19.634 --> 03:29:22.356]  Come on, the government's good.
[03:29:22.356 --> 03:29:27.040]  But I do have one question for you, and that is regarding Navarro Chip.
[03:29:28.436 --> 03:29:35.860]  I read an article a very long time ago that it was so small that it could be injected through a hypodermic needle.
[03:29:35.860 --> 03:29:40.622]  And I'm wondering if this is part of that.
[03:29:40.622 --> 03:29:42.483]  Let me break it down on the other side.
[03:29:42.483 --> 03:29:47.525]  I'll briefly do that, take more calls, get into some financial news, and more of what happened to the G20.
[03:29:47.525 --> 03:29:48.106]  Stay with us.
[03:29:48.106 --> 03:29:48.806]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:48.806 --> 03:29:51.767]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:51.767 --> 03:29:53.168]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.168 --> 03:29:54.669]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.703 --> 03:30:01.166]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.166 --> 03:30:05.408]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:30:05.408 --> 03:30:07.409]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:30:07.409 --> 03:30:15.933]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:30:15.933 --> 03:30:21.476]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:30:21.476 --> 03:30:23.097]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:30:23.337 --> 03:30:29.840]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:30:29.840 --> 03:30:40.905]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:30:40.905 --> 03:30:42.266]  That's right, clean water.
[03:30:42.546 --> 03:30:42.766]  We're good.
[03:31:01.553 --> 03:31:03.536]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[03:31:03.536 --> 03:31:07.161]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:31:07.161 --> 03:31:09.644]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:31:09.644 --> 03:31:12.708]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:31:12.708 --> 03:31:16.493]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[03:31:16.493 --> 03:31:16.873]  Let's do it!
[03:31:40.148 --> 03:31:44.311]  From tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[03:31:44.311 --> 03:31:49.175]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[03:31:49.175 --> 03:31:52.037]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[03:32:01.977 --> 03:32:07.861]  How many times have you been in a situation where having a hidden audio or video recorder would have made a difference in your life?
[03:32:07.861 --> 03:32:12.984]  In the past, owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry.
[03:32:12.984 --> 03:32:14.205]  That was then.
[03:32:14.205 --> 03:32:15.486]  This is now.
[03:32:15.486 --> 03:32:18.228]  Introducing DigiNet Spy Sunglasses.
[03:32:18.228 --> 03:32:24.271]  These sunglasses contain a small hidden camera that will record up to 4 hours of real-time audio and video.
[03:32:24.271 --> 03:32:29.555]  The DigiNet Sunglasses are perfect for traffic stops, on lawful searches and seizures, town hall meetings,
[03:32:29.815 --> 03:32:33.479]  Proving your innocence, or any other situation you'd like to record.
[03:32:33.479 --> 03:32:36.962]  And if sunglasses aren't for you, check out the DigiPen.
[03:32:36.962 --> 03:32:41.426]  It does the same great job as the sunglasses, but in the form of a functional pen.
[03:32:41.426 --> 03:32:42.947]  Video never lies.
[03:32:42.947 --> 03:32:44.609]  Watch Big Brother back.

[03:32:51.976 --> 03:32:53.057]  Diginet dot net.
[03:33:00.640 --> 03:33:11.044]  We're good to go.
[03:33:23.939 --> 03:33:25.500]  And I was just talking to Rob Jacobson.
[03:33:25.500 --> 03:33:26.701]  I just talked to him during the break.
[03:33:26.701 --> 03:33:32.245]  It looks like it's going to the Supreme Court of the state to reopen the 9-11 investigation.
[03:33:32.245 --> 03:33:37.708]  So, they've gotten the 80,000 plus signatures to do that.
[03:33:37.708 --> 03:33:41.811]  We're going to be talking to him either today or tomorrow, briefly at the end of the show.
[03:33:41.811 --> 03:33:44.333]  But there can be no longer any doubt.
[03:33:45.902 --> 03:33:49.643]  Tyranny is here, marching on every front against humanity.
[03:33:49.643 --> 03:33:55.364]  Big corporations have issued themselves tens of trillions in liquid fiat cash on our backs.
[03:33:55.364 --> 03:33:59.885]  They know they've got to squeeze the labor and taxes out of it to now pay for it all.
[03:33:59.885 --> 03:34:01.105]  And so they're letting us know.
[03:34:01.105 --> 03:34:05.386]  And they've hired police and military and told them the public is scum, trash.
[03:34:05.386 --> 03:34:06.627]  Beat the hell out of them.
[03:34:06.627 --> 03:34:07.227]  They're enemies.
[03:34:08.032 --> 03:34:14.321]  They're training them to take your guns, they're training InfraGard and Clergy Response to tell the public to go along with it.
[03:34:14.321 --> 03:34:15.964]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[03:34:15.964 --> 03:34:22.493]  This is PSYOPs, and if you just become aware of the PSYOPs, we can turn this country around and save our society.
[03:34:23.254 --> 03:34:28.517]  But if we don't, the police are more far gone than I thought watching this G20 stuff.
[03:34:28.517 --> 03:34:32.179]  I mean, when an old woman walks out of a store with a bag and says, what is this officer?
[03:34:32.179 --> 03:34:34.701]  And the cop lets a dog loose to bite her.
[03:34:34.701 --> 03:34:41.325]  See, they love this zero tolerance thing of no one allowed on the streets of Pittsburgh or Oakland, Pennsylvania.
[03:34:41.325 --> 03:34:47.749]  So they drive by neighborhoods and kids are out throwing a football and they go and the cops just swing the sound cannon around and hit them.
[03:34:48.936 --> 03:34:51.318]  The military tortured Luke in jail.
[03:34:51.318 --> 03:34:55.541]  The FBI was running it in a detention center just like Pier 57 in New York.
[03:34:55.541 --> 03:34:59.524]  Just, I mean, folks, this is bad news.
[03:34:59.524 --> 03:35:01.545]  And these guys would torture children in Iraq.
[03:35:01.545 --> 03:35:04.487]  They did, I mean, I've had Marine Corps officers on that talk about it.
[03:35:04.487 --> 03:35:07.329]  How people would just shoot kids for fun.
[03:35:07.329 --> 03:35:11.992]  And all the videos of them shooting families out of their cars for fun and raping kids.
[03:35:11.992 --> 03:35:15.215]  And see, it's a lowest common denominator.
[03:35:15.215 --> 03:35:16.816]  The scum get honored
[03:35:18.548 --> 03:35:20.089]  And so you got Marines.
[03:35:20.089 --> 03:35:24.873]  Remember when the Marines killed the puppy and the neocon site said that's a fake robot dog?
[03:35:24.873 --> 03:35:28.356]  Everybody could see it was pulling its legs up, it was a real puppy.
[03:35:28.356 --> 03:35:36.063]  And then we posted scores of videos of them killing dogs, killing horses, shooting cows, shooting sheep, hand-grenading people, shooting humans.
[03:35:36.063 --> 03:35:41.808]  But see, humans have been taught not to care if they see fellow humans dying through all the murder simulations on TV and movies.
[03:35:43.166 --> 03:35:45.488]  But you see a dog get killed.
[03:35:45.488 --> 03:35:48.610]  Starving dog comes up begging the Marines, laughing, just shoot it.
[03:35:48.610 --> 03:35:51.412]  You know, the army running over dogs, laughing.
[03:35:51.412 --> 03:35:55.035]  People didn't care about seeing kids getting killed.
[03:35:55.035 --> 03:35:57.697]  And there have been hundreds of murders in Iraq of soldiers.
[03:35:57.697 --> 03:36:04.783]  Not officers this time, but soldiers that say, hey, don't shoot this family or don't rape these little girls.
[03:36:04.783 --> 03:36:05.203]  You know what?
[03:36:05.203 --> 03:36:06.344]  They shoot you right in the head.
[03:36:07.560 --> 03:36:12.803]  And all the cases where they come into a family, rape the ten-year-old girl, then grease the whole family.
[03:36:12.803 --> 03:36:18.006]  And then it's all, their officers come in and say, badass men, you've done a great job.
[03:36:18.006 --> 03:36:19.927]  They give them all drop weapons.
[03:36:19.927 --> 03:36:23.770]  When they get upset or get drunk and shoot innocent people, they just drop a weapon on.
[03:36:23.770 --> 03:36:25.971]  They're all coming back to be cops.
[03:36:25.971 --> 03:36:28.973]  And they've got a hunger to kill, a hunger to murder U.S.
[03:36:28.973 --> 03:36:34.016]  citizens, a hunger to rape your wives and children, a hunger, a bloody, vampiric hunger.
[03:36:34.830 --> 03:36:41.873]  I remember videos of the helicopters landing, playing death metal, with skulls hanging off and 666 spray painted on the side.
[03:36:41.873 --> 03:36:44.334]  I mean, it's Hellforce.
[03:36:44.334 --> 03:36:48.616]  And the good men and women in the military that don't go along with this, they get fragged.
[03:36:48.616 --> 03:36:51.757]  They get killed.
[03:36:51.757 --> 03:36:54.538]  And so they are ready to come to your homes and take your guns.
[03:36:54.538 --> 03:36:56.299]  And they know you're trained to stand down.
[03:36:56.299 --> 03:36:58.300]  That encourages them.
[03:36:58.300 --> 03:36:59.120]  They enjoy it.
[03:37:01.256 --> 03:37:03.658]  Our army is an army of darkness now.
[03:37:03.658 --> 03:37:07.161]  It is an army of Satan, an army of Lucifer.
[03:37:07.161 --> 03:37:10.103]  Guys, get me a glass of water, please.
[03:37:10.103 --> 03:37:14.947]  I engulf lunch during a three-minute break, and then a little bit of pepper in there.
[03:37:14.947 --> 03:37:21.392]  Now, I know the whole military isn't evil, and I know our police aren't evil, but the leadership is evil in almost every case.
[03:37:22.293 --> 03:37:26.674]  Abu Ghraib, Halliburton, Dyncor, and Middley Run child kidnapping rings.
[03:37:26.674 --> 03:37:27.634]  It comes out in Congress.
[03:37:27.634 --> 03:37:29.095]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[03:37:29.095 --> 03:37:36.357]  The Army's own report admit they raped children with flashlights with battery acid on them in front of their parents.
[03:37:36.357 --> 03:37:37.037]  They raped them.
[03:37:37.037 --> 03:37:41.938]  They beat them to death with pleasure at camps all over the planet.
[03:37:41.938 --> 03:37:44.059]  This is the system, and this is in the reports.
[03:37:44.932 --> 03:37:46.053]  And they're here now.
[03:37:46.053 --> 03:37:47.534]  They are now among us.
[03:37:47.534 --> 03:37:48.594]  Their minds are blown.
[03:37:48.594 --> 03:37:50.075]  Their souls are gone.
[03:37:50.075 --> 03:37:52.737]  They love the black uniforms they're given by their masters.
[03:37:52.737 --> 03:37:54.218]  They love the injections they're given.
[03:37:54.218 --> 03:37:56.379]  They love the injections they'll force you to take.
[03:37:56.379 --> 03:37:57.980]  They love the evil.
[03:37:57.980 --> 03:38:00.061]  And they're gonna gun people down in the back.
[03:38:00.061 --> 03:38:04.184]  Just like Chicago police announced, if you run now, your car runs, they will shoot you.
[03:38:05.044 --> 03:38:07.006]  They're announcing everywhere they will kill you.
[03:38:07.006 --> 03:38:07.846]  They will kill.
[03:38:07.846 --> 03:38:08.647]  They will kill.
[03:38:08.647 --> 03:38:09.627]  They will kill.
[03:38:09.627 --> 03:38:13.050]  Because the control freak doesn't just want your tax money and to run your life.
[03:38:13.050 --> 03:38:15.531]  They want to be able to kill you.
[03:38:15.531 --> 03:38:17.293]  It's what tyrants have done throughout history.
[03:38:17.293 --> 03:38:19.794]  Stalin, Mao, all of them.
[03:38:19.794 --> 03:38:20.935]  Hitler.
[03:38:20.935 --> 03:38:27.440]  It is the same system over and over and over again.
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:28.961]  This is their New World Order system.
[03:38:30.063 --> 03:38:33.646]  I want to tell you about some final sponsors in this hour, then I'm going to hurry through your calls.
[03:38:33.646 --> 03:38:34.547]  So be ready, everybody.

[03:38:37.869 --> 03:38:41.092]  People all over the world are discovering the benefits of supernatural silver.
[03:38:41.092 --> 03:38:48.578]  The powerful new nanotechnology is a natural antibiotic, and you can read all the information and facts they have about the power of
[03:38:49.278 --> 03:38:55.461]  A Silver Against Bacteria and Viruses there at the website SupernaturalSilver.com.

[03:39:15.205 --> 03:39:17.086]  Another sponsor is the great Acola Blue.
[03:39:17.086 --> 03:39:22.650]  They have a whole line of products, but their smaller unit does seven and a half gallons a day.
[03:39:22.650 --> 03:39:25.773]  Looks like a water cooler without a water bottle on top.
[03:39:25.773 --> 03:39:31.717]  Goes through seven filters, including reverse osmosis, carbon, and a UV antifungal antibacterial light.
[03:39:31.717 --> 03:39:32.818]  Acolablue.com.
[03:39:32.818 --> 03:39:33.739]  Water out of the air.
[03:39:33.739 --> 03:39:36.841]  It's a moisture evaporator, basically.
[03:39:36.841 --> 03:39:37.681]  The same time that the
[03:39:39.312 --> 03:39:42.254]  Fictitious Luke Skywalker worked on, if you want to know what these are.
[03:39:42.254 --> 03:39:44.515]  acolablue.com, acolablue.com, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.

[03:39:50.859 --> 03:39:51.500]  acolablue.com.
[03:39:51.500 --> 03:39:51.900]  And finally,
[03:40:06.249 --> 03:40:08.511]  I want to tell you about Diginet.net.
[03:40:08.511 --> 03:40:13.496]  This unit is a video and audio recording device disguised as a pen.
[03:40:13.496 --> 03:40:15.178]  It fits right into your pocket.
[03:40:15.178 --> 03:40:18.762]  They also have sunglasses that have a tiny hidden camera and recorder on them.
[03:40:18.762 --> 03:40:20.984]  Those are the best.
[03:40:20.984 --> 03:40:26.730]  We have had listeners use this pen to fight the info war and we have used some in the postings on our site ourselves.
[03:40:27.759 --> 03:40:29.800]  We constantly are asked, how do we get involved?
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:32.521]  Be prepared to capture and expose tyranny.
[03:40:32.521 --> 03:40:35.302]  Click on the DigiNet banner at InfoWars.com.
[03:40:35.302 --> 03:40:42.446]  With the date and time listed on the video, you'll be able to use this pen as solid evidence in court, and you will not believe the cost and quality of the different units they have.
[03:40:43.126 --> 03:40:55.954]  Go to and see some of the other amazing surveillance equipment they have at Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T dot net, or 888-344-6681, 888-344-6681.
[03:40:55.954 --> 03:41:05.280]  And in closing, Fall of the Republic, which potentially could be the last film we ever release, as bad as things are going, this tells you who the enemy is, how the bankers did it with detail,
[03:41:07.495 --> 03:41:20.291]  How they mind control the public, the left-right paradigm, and the television set, the police state, the FEMA camps, Homeland Brigade, all available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:41:20.291 --> 03:41:22.654]  Pre-order it today so it ships out to you first.
[03:41:22.654 --> 03:41:25.958]  They ship out and the order of the orders are received.
[03:41:26.752 --> 03:41:30.093]  Hi Alex, I'm a member of Rotary Club and I wanted to bring this to your attention.
[03:41:51.344 --> 03:41:58.529]  Bill Gates has made a large commitment to Rotary for the Polio Plus Program.
[03:41:58.529 --> 03:42:01.532]  $355 million and he gave a speech.
[03:42:01.532 --> 03:42:05.835]  You can Google Bill Gates Rotary Polio Speech.
[03:42:05.835 --> 03:42:09.918]  Anyway, I've got some quotes here from the speech.
[03:42:09.918 --> 03:42:20.125]  He talks about being in a slum in East Delhi and he held a nine-month-old girl named Hashmeen and so this girl had polio.
[03:42:21.329 --> 03:42:34.218]  And then he goes on to say later in the speech, so in the span of just a few days, more than 170 million children in India will be vaccinated against polio.
[03:42:34.218 --> 03:42:35.579]  But even that's not enough.
[03:42:35.579 --> 03:42:45.426]  Hashmeen, the baby I met, had been immunized, but she still got polio because she lived in one of those areas where children need many doses of the vaccine.
[03:42:45.854 --> 03:42:47.134]  Yeah, that's where he spun it.
[03:42:47.134 --> 03:42:53.376]  But if you actually look at the Indian case, in fact, Google this, polio vaccine causes polio.
[03:42:53.376 --> 03:43:05.098]  BBC, two weeks ago, all over Africa, all over Asia, the subcontinent of India and Latin America, suddenly a new strain of polio is out and they're admitting it came from the vaccine.
[03:43:05.098 --> 03:43:07.199]  Reuters, AP, also reported it.
[03:43:07.779 --> 03:43:11.622]  About a polio vaccine causes polio cases.
[03:43:11.622 --> 03:43:14.624]  And so Gates, see, they do this as psych warfare.
[03:43:14.624 --> 03:43:15.945]  They hide it in plain view.
[03:43:15.945 --> 03:43:18.747]  They go, yeah, hepatitis is being caused by the shot.
[03:43:18.747 --> 03:43:19.928]  You need to take more.
[03:43:19.928 --> 03:43:22.770]  Hey, you got polio, little Hajmeen.
[03:43:22.770 --> 03:43:24.572]  I held her.
[03:43:24.572 --> 03:43:28.535]  But see, he does it in a loving way when his dad heads up Planned Parenthood.
[03:43:28.535 --> 03:43:33.559]  And Bill Gates was part of the, quote, secret meeting, world leaders, world's rich meet for
[03:43:34.219 --> 03:43:36.480]  Secret meeting on overpopulation.
[03:43:36.480 --> 03:43:38.160]  How sickeningly obvious.
[03:43:38.160 --> 03:43:40.761]  Does he go on to admit the vaccine did it?
[03:43:40.761 --> 03:43:43.261]  No, he doesn't acknowledge that, but let me give you another quote.
[03:43:43.261 --> 03:43:44.282]  Oh, here it is, New York Times.
[03:43:44.282 --> 03:43:45.462]  Here's the first one they pulled up.
[03:43:45.462 --> 03:43:46.242]  I hadn't seen this one.
[03:43:46.242 --> 03:43:47.283]  Print it for me, guys.
[03:43:47.283 --> 03:43:51.784]  Mutating vaccine causes polio outbreak in Nigeria.
[03:43:51.784 --> 03:43:53.584]  Bill Gates was funding it.
[03:43:53.584 --> 03:43:55.085]  Oh, he loves him.
[03:43:55.085 --> 03:43:56.365]  Oh, he's so good.
[03:43:56.365 --> 03:43:56.745]  I'm sorry.
[03:43:56.745 --> 03:43:57.805]  Go ahead.
[03:43:57.805 --> 03:43:58.826]  Yeah.
[03:43:58.826 --> 03:44:00.326]  In another part of the speech, he says,
[03:44:01.041 --> 03:44:05.405]  And there are some places where it takes multiple doses of vaccine to make a child immune.
[03:44:05.405 --> 03:44:06.606]  I didn't know that.
[03:44:06.606 --> 03:44:09.848]  It says, I didn't know that when I first got interested in polio.
[03:44:09.848 --> 03:44:14.732]  I just assumed the standard number of doses we give in the United States was sufficient.
[03:44:14.732 --> 03:44:24.180]  But in some places, children need as many as 10 doses because they're already infected with so many other viruses that the vaccine can't do its job properly.
[03:44:24.611 --> 03:44:27.614]  Oh yeah, so many viruses because they get vaccinated every week.
[03:44:27.614 --> 03:44:30.736]  There's no money for food, no money for school, no money for books.
[03:44:30.736 --> 03:44:34.319]  But for all those kids sitting in the dirt villages, there's the shots.
[03:44:34.319 --> 03:44:36.741]  And Africans all over have learned to run.
[03:44:36.741 --> 03:44:40.805]  Because they say, they give children in village shots, all die!
[03:44:40.805 --> 03:44:45.909]  You know, I mean, you can pull the videos up, and the people are hiding in caves and hiding in the wilderness.
[03:44:46.850 --> 03:44:48.731]  And I mean, my God, it's so sick.
[03:44:48.731 --> 03:44:54.473]  And by the way, African villagers and others always loved the white man doctors 50 years ago, 100 years ago.
[03:44:54.473 --> 03:44:55.493]  They would beg for it.
[03:44:55.493 --> 03:44:57.714]  Now, they run.
[03:44:57.714 --> 03:44:59.755]  But again, they're just ignorant, aren't they?
[03:44:59.755 --> 03:45:03.656]  Hajmeen, though, was taken care of.
[03:45:03.656 --> 03:45:04.357]  Very sick.
[03:45:04.357 --> 03:45:05.937]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:45:05.937 --> 03:45:15.841]  Well, I just want to, you know, ask your other listeners that are Rotary members to send a letter to the Board of Directors questioning the efficacy
[03:45:16.704 --> 03:45:26.793]  And safety of the vaccines, and also if you give money to the Rotary Foundation, restrict it so it's not used for the Polio Plus program.
[03:45:26.793 --> 03:45:28.575]  The Polio Plus!
[03:45:28.575 --> 03:45:31.157]  Because there's a little something extra in the polio.
[03:45:31.157 --> 03:45:40.345]  You know, we had a top-level analyst, we know her name, we've seen the documents, unbelievable, who worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[03:45:40.345 --> 03:45:42.327]  Did you ever hear that interview?
[03:45:42.327 --> 03:45:42.848]  No, I didn't.
[03:45:43.407 --> 03:45:48.650]  Yeah, just search it out, like Alex Jones interviews Gates Foundation Whistleblower.
[03:45:48.650 --> 03:45:52.392]  And let me tell you, it is bad news, brother.
[03:45:52.392 --> 03:46:00.177]  These people see it, it's so outrageous, and Bill Gates wears a nice sweater with a tie, and he walks in and goes, Hi, kids!
[03:46:00.177 --> 03:46:01.838]  I wanna help!
[03:46:01.838 --> 03:46:04.740]  And it's all so... You know, just like...
[03:46:06.175 --> 03:46:10.978]  Just like Ecoscience wants to help by poisoning the water in the vaccines, they admit it.
[03:46:10.978 --> 03:46:14.740]  Just like John P. Holdren's all, in his sweater, going, Hi kids!
[03:46:14.740 --> 03:46:15.660]  He goes to school.
[03:46:15.660 --> 03:46:16.801]  Take your shots!
[03:46:16.801 --> 03:46:17.761]  Hey!
[03:46:17.761 --> 03:46:26.706]  You know, it's just all so liberal and so... And that's why... Oh, it doesn't matter.
[03:46:26.706 --> 03:46:28.387]  You know, we're trying to educate people about vaccines.
[03:46:28.387 --> 03:46:30.568]  They're already just making pharmacological crops.
[03:46:30.568 --> 03:46:32.850]  Did you know about that?
[03:46:32.850 --> 03:46:33.130]  Uh, yeah.
[03:46:34.411 --> 03:46:38.193]  There's no... I mean, what do you think of these people?
[03:46:38.193 --> 03:46:56.464]  Well, you know, I gotta admit, I was kind of skeptical when you talked about Bill Gates and his father, and, you know, when I read the speech, I just thought, well, either Bill Gates, you know, doesn't do his homework before he puts $350 million into a program, or, you know, he's got another agenda.
[03:46:57.159 --> 03:47:04.246]  Sir, with the Bill and Melinda Gates funded money from him and Buffett, that's where the scourge is.
[03:47:04.246 --> 03:47:08.529]  I mean, they go in and everybody starts getting polio.
[03:47:08.529 --> 03:47:10.892]  They go in and the people start getting HIV.
[03:47:10.892 --> 03:47:14.014]  They go in and they start getting all... No, no, no.
[03:47:14.935 --> 03:47:21.559]  It was Bill and Melinda Gates' money in Africa, Asia, and Latin America with the latest, because it says it's a new special.
[03:47:21.559 --> 03:47:22.459]  Pull up that New York Times.
[03:47:22.459 --> 03:47:29.983]  It says, oh, they gave the kids the shot and it mutated a new deadly polio, because in these third world countries, a lot of people have natural immunity now.
[03:47:29.983 --> 03:47:32.385]  I mean, there it is, New York Times.
[03:47:32.385 --> 03:47:33.025]  Let me ask you this.
[03:47:33.025 --> 03:47:39.669]  Did you know about the fact that the vaccines admittedly did it when you read that from Gates, or that just creeps you out that he didn't know the first part?
[03:47:41.046 --> 03:48:01.702]  Uh, well actually there's a member of the international board in our club and I challenged him about vaccines and I sent him some information about Dr. Len Horowitz and he just kind of responded without responding to any of the factual information and just saying, oh, that guy used to be a dentist and that kind of
[03:48:03.476 --> 03:48:04.356]  You know, that kind of response.
[03:48:04.356 --> 03:48:05.377]  Yeah, I know he's a dentist.
[03:48:05.377 --> 03:48:10.518]  He also has a degree from Harvard in the whole medical science system.
[03:48:10.518 --> 03:48:11.418]  But that doesn't matter.
[03:48:11.418 --> 03:48:13.259]  We've had all these other medical doctors on.
[03:48:13.259 --> 03:48:14.459]  Did you tell him about Blaylock?
[03:48:14.459 --> 03:48:15.979]  Did you tell him about Monteith?
[03:48:15.979 --> 03:48:18.780]  Did you tell him about Tenpenny?
[03:48:18.780 --> 03:48:20.981]  I told him about Dr. Blaylock.
[03:48:20.981 --> 03:48:32.564]  Yeah, and his response was, well, you know, this former head of a medical school,
[03:48:33.396 --> 03:48:36.198]  Has polio, and I'd like you to meet with him.
[03:48:36.198 --> 03:48:38.781]  He'll tell you what he thinks about Dr. Blaylock.
[03:48:38.781 --> 03:48:42.824]  So it's all just, uh... Yeah, no, it's all emotional with what they don't, but listen.
[03:48:42.824 --> 03:48:48.408]  Printing the New York Times and AP and Reuters where the vaccines are what are spreading polio.
[03:48:48.408 --> 03:48:49.830]  It's admitted.
[03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:51.351]  It's admitted.
[03:48:51.351 --> 03:48:54.694]  See, your instinct in reading that going, they need 10 shots now?
[03:48:56.678 --> 03:49:03.401]  Okay, what they're doing is they're putting these new engineered systems in that then mutate, and they know it.
[03:49:03.401 --> 03:49:08.964]  And then they're testing the soft kill, where they just announce openly, oh, we're killing everybody!
[03:49:08.964 --> 03:49:12.406]  Oh, it was an accident, oopsie!
[03:49:13.306 --> 03:49:16.687]  And then they put little kids up on TV.
[03:49:16.687 --> 03:49:20.748]  Hey, where's that video I sent you of the little girl with the cancer thing in Australia?
[03:49:20.748 --> 03:49:27.170]  And the rock star is up there with her and the little girl's hair is falling out and she'll be dead soon, but she has this magic moment.
[03:49:27.170 --> 03:49:31.512]  Why doesn't the rock star find out about the biochemical weapons operation?
[03:49:31.512 --> 03:49:34.053]  Why don't they find out how childhood cancers are up over 2,000%?
[03:49:34.053 --> 03:49:41.235]  See, you called in rightfully, sir, going in this weird that they want to give 10 polio shots, saying one doesn't work anymore.
[03:49:41.815 --> 03:49:43.556]  See, now they're like, oh, it doesn't work!
[03:49:43.556 --> 03:49:45.097]  It doesn't work!
[03:49:45.097 --> 03:49:46.818]  It kills you!
[03:49:46.818 --> 03:49:49.039]  See, but it's worse than what Gates was saying.
[03:49:49.039 --> 03:49:51.020]  That's his spin.
[03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:56.203]  Oh, she died, or she's sick, because we didn't give her enough.
[03:49:56.203 --> 03:50:10.371]  No, it was the shot that did it, and Gates is up there demonically knowing your leaders in your community, soft-soaping, and giving you what Mike Adams called kind of the pre-hypnosis, that none of this is causing a problem.
[03:50:11.607 --> 03:50:18.671]  Okay, so is that powerful info for your quiver of arrows with him that it's the shot doing it?
[03:50:18.671 --> 03:50:26.154]  Yeah, I mean, that was my first thought, you know, when I read later on that she had polio.
[03:50:26.154 --> 03:50:27.375]  But sir, hey, admit that.
[03:50:27.375 --> 03:50:28.456]  Now let me go further.
[03:50:28.456 --> 03:50:32.958]  I've had top scientists on, and I could pull this up if we had time left in the show.
[03:50:32.958 --> 03:50:36.640]  Did you know that the polio outbreak in the West was engineered?
[03:50:38.396 --> 03:50:38.496]  No.
[03:51:01.690 --> 03:51:03.852]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[03:51:03.852 --> 03:51:04.712]  Spy on me?
[03:51:04.712 --> 03:51:05.033]  Yeah.
[03:51:05.033 --> 03:51:10.097]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[03:51:10.097 --> 03:51:11.718]  You should use Startpage instead.
[03:51:11.718 --> 03:51:12.439]  Startpage?
[03:51:12.439 --> 03:51:12.879]  Yeah.
[03:51:12.879 --> 03:51:13.980]  Startpage.com.
[03:51:13.980 --> 03:51:16.942]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[03:51:16.942 --> 03:51:20.806]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[03:51:20.806 --> 03:51:23.608]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[03:51:23.928 --> 03:51:26.569]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[03:51:26.569 --> 03:51:28.150]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.450]  Right!
[03:51:28.450 --> 03:51:31.751]  Go to StartPage.com and start searching with privacy.
[03:51:31.751 --> 03:51:32.331]  Hello, folks.
[03:51:32.331 --> 03:51:33.692]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:51:33.692 --> 03:51:37.533]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[03:51:37.533 --> 03:51:41.335]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.
[03:51:41.335 --> 03:51:46.477]  The next time you're about to look something up on Google, Yahoo, or Bing, go to StartPage.com instead.
[03:51:46.477 --> 03:51:49.398]  Try seven days of StartPage and break the Big Brother habit.
[03:51:49.878 --> 03:51:51.623]  Do yourself and your privacy a favor.
[03:51:51.623 --> 03:51:55.933]  Try StartPage.com for 7 days and start protecting your privacy.
[03:51:55.933 --> 03:51:57.517]  That's StartPage.com
[03:52:02.293 --> 03:52:08.338]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.338 --> 03:52:14.223]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.223 --> 03:52:20.369]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.629 --> 03:52:22.671]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.671 --> 03:52:25.133]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.133 --> 03:52:38.343]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.343 --> 03:52:40.004]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.004 --> 03:52:41.866]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.866 --> 03:52:48.091]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.746 --> 03:52:57.040]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:58.602]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.602 --> 03:52:59.804]  The people strike back!
[03:53:01.806 --> 03:53:06.129]  Did you know that colon cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the US?
[03:53:06.129 --> 03:53:11.812]  Did you know that the number one health problem patients complain to doctors about is gastrointestinal related?
[03:53:11.812 --> 03:53:19.477]  Health experts predict that almost every American will develop some type of colon disease, polyp, tumor, or cancer in their lifetime.
[03:53:19.477 --> 03:53:22.519]  If you suffer from constipation, irritable bowel syndrome,
[03:53:22.819 --> 03:53:23.059]  I think?
[03:53:50.652 --> 03:53:53.054]  That's HealthTruthRevealed.com or call 1-800-593-6273.
[03:53:53.054 --> 03:53:53.534]  That's 1-800-593-6273 today.
[03:53:53.534 --> 03:53:57.417]  Folks, we want Fall of the Republic to be even bigger than the Obama deception.
[03:54:12.776 --> 03:54:15.677]  In about 22 days it's released on October 21st.
[03:54:15.677 --> 03:54:20.277]  Pre-order it now so it's shipped out to you first at InfoWars.com.
[03:54:20.277 --> 03:54:24.038]  There's a photo we've got on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:54:24.038 --> 03:54:26.938]  We're going to link to it up on InfoWars G20 Summit.
[03:54:26.938 --> 03:54:36.600]  An InfoWars.com Obama poster on the light pole as the riot police are marching forward.
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:38.120]  So that's pretty amazing.
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:41.181]  Good photo there by that photographer.
[03:54:42.105 --> 03:55:08.980]  Okay, here at the very end, when we start the rebroadcast on the attack on Iran, the police state, everything that's being set up right now, that's coming up on the restreams at Infowars.com and re-aired on your local AM and FM stations, with Dennis McMahon, the lawyer for the folks in New York, and of course, Manny Medea, who lost his uncle, Thomas Scroi in the attacks, they've gotten the petitions for a new investigation, they're moving forward, it's going to another court level,
[03:55:09.580 --> 03:55:10.981]  This is a big, big deal.
[03:55:10.981 --> 03:55:14.062]  It's making big news in New York, but not outside New York.
[03:55:14.062 --> 03:55:15.022]  This is a big deal.
[03:55:15.022 --> 03:55:17.303]  So, in a nutshell, we've got a few minutes left.
[03:55:17.303 --> 03:55:22.846]  Manny Bedillo, recap what's happening, why this is important, and where it's going now.
[03:55:23.638 --> 03:55:32.161]  Okay, what we've done is we've collected over 80,000 signatures here in New York for a new petition to have an impartial subpoena-powered investigation in November.
[03:55:32.161 --> 03:55:36.382]  We have, the city has competed that we have more than enough signatures.
[03:55:36.382 --> 03:55:41.144]  Both times we've handed in signatures and now we're in the court systems.
[03:55:41.144 --> 03:55:44.845]  It's going to be, all arguments will be heard tomorrow morning at 9.30 a.m.
[03:55:44.845 --> 03:55:48.827]  room 252 in the State Supreme Court here in Manhattan.
[03:55:48.827 --> 03:55:51.207]  I'm asking everyone who can attend, please attend.
[03:55:51.207 --> 03:55:52.428]  We want to pack that courtroom.
[03:55:53.048 --> 03:56:00.593]  We're going to be heard by Edward Lehner, the judge, and a decision will be rendered by Wednesday.
[03:56:00.593 --> 03:56:05.295]  Alright, and again, this is calling for what?
[03:56:05.295 --> 03:56:06.196]  Dennis?
[03:56:06.196 --> 03:56:10.298]  Yes, we're going to put on the ballot to the New York City voters on November 3rd.
[03:56:10.298 --> 03:56:12.520]  Do you want a New York City investigation into 9-11?
[03:56:15.826 --> 03:56:22.228]  And this is very, very exciting because this will be a real poll of the people, though there is some election fraud there.
[03:56:22.228 --> 03:56:26.869]  We have polls as high as 84% of Americans believing they were lied to about 9-11.
[03:56:26.869 --> 03:56:32.510]  We've seen some new polls showing the opposite of that, which are put out by very deceptive companies.
[03:56:32.510 --> 03:56:33.451]  But this is a big deal.
[03:56:33.451 --> 03:56:35.391]  Yes, it is.
[03:56:35.391 --> 03:56:39.812]  And in New York City, luckily, if we do get it on the ballot, we still have the old-fashioned machines.
[03:56:39.812 --> 03:56:42.513]  They didn't get the computer machines in time, so it would be hard to rig it.
[03:56:43.991 --> 03:56:47.296]  Well, I mean, how can they block it going on the ballot now if you have the signatures?
[03:56:47.296 --> 03:56:48.577]  Why does it have to go to court?
[03:56:48.577 --> 03:56:50.821]  Well, there's two parts to that, Alex.
[03:56:50.821 --> 03:56:53.825]  Not only do you have the signatures, but the petition itself.
[03:56:53.825 --> 03:56:55.908]  The language of the petition has to be legal.
[03:56:55.908 --> 03:56:57.910]  And the city clerk is saying, no, it's not legal.
[03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:59.693]  You can't have an investigation like this.
[03:56:59.693 --> 03:57:00.855]  This is a federal matter.
[03:57:02.416 --> 03:57:03.617]  Really?
[03:57:03.617 --> 03:57:07.520]  A city and a people can't have an investigation if they want.
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:10.302]  Only the feds are allowed to investigate anything.
[03:57:10.302 --> 03:57:15.926]  Boy, they're telling the people you have no rights to petition the court for redress of grievances.
[03:57:15.926 --> 03:57:19.209]  I mean, this is the most fundamental right we have in the First Amendment.
[03:57:19.209 --> 03:57:22.231]  Right, and they just view it as their job to disempower the people.
[03:57:23.840 --> 03:57:34.578]  Well, the website is nyccan.org, and if they deny this, if they block 80,000 plus signatures, this really shows they're trying to cover up something.
[03:57:35.934 --> 03:57:42.500]  Well, you know, Alex, I agree with you on so much, but it's really ingrained here, the culture of disempowerment to the people.
[03:57:42.500 --> 03:57:45.122]  It's almost knee-jerk for them to try to stop anything.
[03:57:45.122 --> 03:57:49.386]  In the history of New York City, only one initiative like this has ever succeeded.
[03:57:49.386 --> 03:57:54.431]  That was the term limits, and Bloomberg and the City Council undo that this year so we could run again.
[03:57:54.431 --> 03:57:59.956]  I mean, the whole system is rigged against the people, but it's more the culture than anything else.
[03:58:00.481 --> 03:58:05.444]  It's about dominating the slaves, breaking their backs, letting the people know they're absolute trash and filth.
[03:58:05.444 --> 03:58:09.187]  You are bucking that tide, and you're on the right side of history.
[03:58:09.187 --> 03:58:13.050]  Dennis McMahon, and of course, everybody else out there for the great job you're doing.
[03:58:13.050 --> 03:58:17.853]  Manny Medeo, newyorkcitycan.org, nyccan.org.
[03:58:17.853 --> 03:58:18.814]  God bless you.
[03:58:18.814 --> 03:58:19.734]  We'll talk to you.
[03:58:19.734 --> 03:58:20.815]  Thanks for the update.
[03:58:20.815 --> 03:58:21.215]  Thank you.
[03:58:21.215 --> 03:58:21.876]  God bless you, sir.
[03:58:21.876 --> 03:58:22.096]  Thank you.
[03:58:22.554 --> 03:58:23.434]  Great job.
[03:58:23.434 --> 03:58:26.376]  Okay, back tomorrow live, 11 to 3 Central.
[03:58:26.376 --> 03:58:28.676]  Big guest, power-packed info.
[03:58:28.676 --> 03:58:31.238]  The people are waking up, but will it be fast enough?
[03:58:31.238 --> 03:58:33.939]  Spread the word about this show and the free podcast.
[03:58:33.939 --> 03:58:35.479]  Tell everybody you know about this show.
[03:58:35.479 --> 03:58:37.500]  That's how we're going to grow and counter the globalists.
[03:58:37.500 --> 03:58:38.400]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:38.400 --> 03:58:43.463]  Free transmission starts now.
[03:58:43.463 --> 03:58:46.084]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.084 --> 03:58:49.285]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.260 --> 03:58:54.642]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[03:58:54.642 --> 03:58:58.265]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[03:58:58.265 --> 03:59:02.828]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[03:59:02.828 --> 03:59:08.432]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most, unlike gas generators.
[03:59:08.712 --> 03:59:13.494]  A solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[03:59:13.494 --> 03:59:17.116]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[03:59:17.116 --> 03:59:21.918]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[03:59:21.918 --> 03:59:28.481]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[03:59:28.481 --> 03:59:30.442]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[03:59:30.922 --> 03:59:31.862]  Coast to coast and in your face!
[03:59:31.862 --> 03:59:34.583]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
