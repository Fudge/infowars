[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:37.560]  it is Monday September 28th 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next four
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.900]  hours and you notice that the establishment is launching the flu
[00:42.900 --> 00:47.720]  hype and talk of force inoculations right at the same time that regular Army
[00:47.720 --> 00:52.760]  Marines and National Guard are running unannounced checkpoints all over the
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.520]  country from California to Texas from Michigan to Iowa from Florida to New
[00:57.520 --> 01:04.520]  York from Tennessee to New Mexico it's just happening everywhere remember about
[01:04.520 --> 01:08.000]  eight months ago the Ram Corporation published a report that was big news in
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.160]  Europe saying that the central banks need World War 3 as a pretext to bring in
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.320]  their world government they openly brag about all their criminal activity and
[01:18.320 --> 01:26.280]  then right on time suddenly they bust somebody in Illinois and in Texas why the
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.360]  FBI they admit made the bombs trained them found the people recruited them and
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.520]  then busted them on the same day to create the illusion of this army of
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.920]  terrorists connected to Al Qaeda connected to Iran doesn't matter if CIA
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.400]  created Al Qaeda doesn't matter if Al Qaeda is the arch enemy of Iran doesn't
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.440]  matter if Al Qaeda is attacking Iran for the last six years with covert forces
[01:49.440 --> 01:52.880]  the what doesn't matter the last two White Houses admit they're running Al
[01:52.880 --> 01:58.160]  Qaeda inside Iran the public can't find Iran that hell the public can't find their
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.600]  own state on a map so why not tell them I'm surprised they don't say that Japan
[02:04.600 --> 02:11.360]  runs Al Qaeda next the public will think Japan is South America lambs to the
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.240]  slaughter the ignorance of the public only welcomes abuse from the criminal
[02:17.240 --> 02:22.080]  elite but don't just rob and steal for power they enjoy it they laugh about it
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.120]  they write books about how dumb the public is and how funny all of this is
[02:28.120 --> 02:35.320]  and so right on time you've got this amazing operation where Iran opened
[02:35.320 --> 02:40.640]  hundreds of different uranium enrichment centers because it takes tens of
[02:40.640 --> 02:47.000]  thousands of centrifuges even to make a peaceful system and the UN hasn't been
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  inspecting in the last two years and so Iran openly opens a new facility and
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.600]  then the media hypes it and spends it just like they hyped yellow cake
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.120]  uranium and aluminum tubes in WMDs in Iraq it's the same way they hyped that
[03:02.120 --> 03:06.560]  Russia had launched a sneak attack last year on 888 for the first two days
[03:06.560 --> 03:13.720]  CNN Fox said Russia launched a premeditated dastardly sneak attack
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.400]  of course then it came out that it was the complete opposite that NATO backed
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.400]  forces in Georgia had launched a sneak attack on peacekeepers in South Ossetia
[03:24.400 --> 03:32.040]  and on the borders of the militarized zone Abkhazia facts are facts the lies
[03:32.040 --> 03:37.120]  are so big it's like calling the moon the sun and the sun the moon and saying
[03:37.120 --> 03:43.320]  the sun is solid rock and the moon at night is what really is radiating the
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.920]  sun's rays and it works if they told the public that the moon was actually the
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.120]  sun they believe it I mean they tell the public carbon dioxide's a deadly nerve
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.640]  gas that matter of trees breathe it then put off oxygen that we breathe large
[03:58.640 --> 04:04.400]  portions of the public believe carbon oxide is a deadly nerve agent a toxic
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.560]  chemical a weapon an ultimate weapon pretty soon they'll probably attack Iran
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.560]  and say they're putting off carbon dioxide a public will run screaming in
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.440]  fear in all directions they'll throw their children the author of MOLIC to
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.800]  the government begging the CPS to take more of their children or inject them
[04:20.800 --> 04:29.040]  with deadly mercury filled adjuvant filled vaccines it's amazing so I'm
[04:29.040 --> 04:32.280]  gonna break all this down today they are definitely getting ready to hit Iran
[04:32.280 --> 04:41.800]  mainstream media says the hit is on same propaganda they use in Iraq we'll
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.600]  break it all down coming up today Kurt Nemo Paul Watson then we got Mike Adams

[08:27.640 --> 08:33.760]  prisonplanet.com kind of a roundtable discussion coming up in the second
[08:33.760 --> 08:38.920]  hour today we'll also open the phones up on the situation with Iran let's go
[08:38.920 --> 08:46.600]  ahead and get Ray McGovern back on to let's line him up the next few days and
[08:46.600 --> 08:56.000]  we'll go over all of that throughout the week attack on Iran appears imminent and
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.400]  the media keeps spinning it that they have secret enrichment plants it takes
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.880]  again thousands and thousands and thousands of centrifuges scores of
[09:06.880 --> 09:10.160]  plants to do this they've publicly admitted they've built plants all over
[09:10.160 --> 09:14.760]  the country the inspectors admit they're the type that do not create weapons
[09:14.760 --> 09:20.120]  level fissile material but none of the facts bother the public remember they
[09:20.120 --> 09:25.960]  told you that Iraq had centrifuges and had a nuke and yellow cake from Niger
[09:25.960 --> 09:35.800]  Africa and it just goes on and on all lies all planted is this going to be the
[09:35.800 --> 09:44.440]  big October surprise the November the December surprise Israel saying they're
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.080]  probably going to go ahead and hit Iran we're getting bizarre comments from
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.400]  Zabigny Brzezinski about shooting down Israeli aircraft did they try it giant
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.040]  stack of very very important news and this affects all of us that live on this
[09:58.040 --> 10:03.560]  planet because if Iran is struck it is not going to go like Iraq all of the
[10:03.560 --> 10:08.480]  experts on both sides of the fence pro war and anti-war come out with the same
[10:08.480 --> 10:17.200]  answers we may not have to be too worried about stage terror attacks if Iran is
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.800]  struck they will strike back and are saying they are and they do have real
[10:21.800 --> 10:27.400]  sleeper teams all over the western world especially Europe and it is not going
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.280]  to be pretty get ready for scores of US military bases to have giant truck bombs
[10:33.280 --> 10:41.960]  full of plastic explosive driven into them just get ready for hell and what
[10:41.960 --> 10:47.000]  do you expect Iran to do when the biggest military on earth and the fourth
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.200]  most powerful military on earth the Israelis start blowing the hell out of
[10:50.200 --> 10:54.880]  them and look let's get one thing straight I'm just as tribal as the next
[10:54.880 --> 11:02.240]  person at a certain level I'm a lot more worried about my family than I am the
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.280]  Iranians and their poor people I mean I feel for the million 300,000 dead
[11:06.280 --> 11:10.480]  Iraqis from the last six and a half years of bombardment and siege and
[11:10.480 --> 11:18.040]  occupation and mass murder they've been under siege for 18 years total almost
[11:18.040 --> 11:27.720]  19 years started in 1991 late 1990 a desert shield and desert storm but this
[11:27.720 --> 11:36.480]  is just terrible more and more I'm just speechless and I think about all the
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.320]  things that have been done to Iran I ran that invented modern mathematics that
[11:42.320 --> 11:49.960]  invented our alphabet that we use our alphabet is the Iranian alphabet not the
[11:49.960 --> 11:59.320]  Roman they're good people it's a first-world nation they were pro-USA
[11:59.320 --> 12:07.120]  anti-communist anti-russian mom and mozadek was time magazine man of the
[12:07.120 --> 12:14.000]  year but he would not let British petroleum formerly Anglo-American oil
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.360]  have a total monopoly he said we want 25% of the money for our people and so
[12:21.360 --> 12:27.360]  they staged with the CIA and the MI6 British intelligence or majesty secret
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.200]  service terror attacks in 1953 blamed it on mozadek said he was blowing up
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.960]  moss because he was anti-muslim extremist of course he wasn't blowing up
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.840]  mosque and the CIA's now have declassified this in 1999 was already known by
[12:42.840 --> 12:48.760]  historians but declassified ten years ago and they killed a lot of people and
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.000]  shot up crowds and said that his police were doing it and then they took his
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.800]  ministers and chopped their heads off and put him in prison for the rest of his
[12:55.800 --> 13:00.720]  life I covered that in terror storm and the West is constantly bombing their
[13:00.720 --> 13:06.400]  ships their battleships routinely blowing up their plants bombing them
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.200]  shooting down their aircraft shooting down their jumbo jets and they've been
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.160]  inside I ran for at least six years staging terror attacks that's been
[13:15.160 --> 13:19.400]  declassified trying to overthrow the government they've got four different
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.680]  Sunni Wahabi al-Qaeda groups one headed up by the number three in al-Qaeda under
[13:24.680 --> 13:28.400]  White House funding White House bragged about this three years ago staging
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.240]  terror attacks against them and they the government the media thinks the
[13:32.240 --> 13:37.480]  American people are so stupid that they get on the news and say that Iran is
[13:37.480 --> 13:46.240]  running al-Qaeda remember two and a half years ago the president the puppet
[13:46.240 --> 13:53.760]  president Muhammad Karzai of Afghanistan was in the Rose Garden in a press
[13:53.760 --> 13:58.680]  conference with George W. Bush and Bush said you've been doing a great job
[13:58.680 --> 14:04.480]  fighting al-Qaeda Taliban and Iran backing both groups and Karzai knew that
[14:04.480 --> 14:08.080]  over a billion dollars have been given to him in just the previous year by Iran
[14:08.080 --> 14:14.920]  and then Iran was Shiite and that they were using Iranian secret police who
[14:14.920 --> 14:22.080]  knew how to track the groups to go after real al-Qaeda and arrest them because the
[14:22.080 --> 14:25.680]  West was using al-Qaeda and Taliban to menace Karzai when he got out of line
[14:25.680 --> 14:29.520]  part of their divide and conquer Balkanization scheme they don't want a
[14:29.520 --> 14:32.920]  strong president over there even to be as a puppet and he said Mr. President I
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.200]  respectfully apologize but I must correct you Iran is our quote greatest
[14:37.200 --> 14:45.040]  ally fighting al-Qaeda in the Taliban sir they are Shiite and Bush said no you
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.080]  were wrong we ought to pull that clip up he said no you were wrong and Karzai
[14:49.080 --> 14:54.000]  literally turned red and shut up then he fell out of favor with the West at that
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.160]  point even though he was the unical executive and was put in power they had
[14:58.160 --> 15:07.920]  the pipelines in and the opium flowing so all of that went on and that just shows
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.120]  how stupid they think the American people are because in Central Asia and in
[15:13.120 --> 15:19.440]  the Middle East it is as well known that the Shiites are Iranian base 20% of
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.000]  Islam and that the other 80% roughly there's another subgroup that's less
[15:25.000 --> 15:33.200]  than 1% kind of a well that side issue the point is is that we want to get
[15:33.200 --> 15:47.600]  technical 79% are Sunni 20% are Shiite 1% or a couple other subgroups but that
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.880]  would be like if Muhammad Karzai came to the United States and at the Rose
[15:53.880 --> 16:03.520]  Garden said John McCain is a Democrat and Barack Obama is a Republican Bush would
[16:03.520 --> 16:09.960]  correct him and say no John McCain's a Republican and Barack Obama is a
[16:09.960 --> 16:16.440]  Democrat I mean that's how ridiculous this is to the Arabs and the Muslims and
[16:16.440 --> 16:25.080]  the Central Asians I mean it's just it's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor or
[16:25.080 --> 16:31.280]  it's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the Washington Redskins no they're not
[16:31.280 --> 16:40.640]  and the same stuff is going on today and it's just ridiculous and Kurt Nemo is
[16:40.640 --> 16:44.520]  really an expert on this he's done deep studies he's joining us so is Watson but
[16:44.520 --> 17:00.400]  he's got a excellent article that he wrote and so we're going to be breaking
[17:00.400 --> 17:11.280]  that down coming up in the next hour and I want to get into the financial news as
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.200]  well and of course we're going to be covering the flu with Mike Adams coming
[17:16.200 --> 17:19.840]  up in the third and fourth hour we'll be taking your calls on that subject as
[17:19.840 --> 17:24.720]  well big new developments on that front but here's some of the financial news
[17:24.720 --> 17:32.160]  I've got US must face Armageddon US may face Armageddon of China Japan don't buy
[17:32.160 --> 17:37.120]  debt and they've already been not buying the full offerings of Treasury debt
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.680]  that's being put out every week and open announcements of the end of the dollar
[17:42.680 --> 17:46.320]  I don't know the public realize what it means if they devalue the dollar by
[17:46.320 --> 17:49.680]  third or two-thirds they're talking about either one of those options or
[17:49.680 --> 17:55.600]  somewhere in between a one-third devaluation will be just so devastating
[17:55.600 --> 18:00.400]  I can't even articulate how bad it is a two-thirds is unspeakable and I don't
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.120]  even want to imagine what that's going to do according to the economist we
[18:03.120 --> 18:10.240]  talked to also CNBC is also reporting the biggest government bailout is yet to
[18:10.240 --> 18:28.880]  come so we've got that situation going on as well and they're reporting the
[18:28.880 --> 18:35.400]  biggest government bailout is yet to come even bigger bailouts because they're
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.360]  not gonna it's not a bailout ladies gentlemen it's more power it's a power
[18:38.360 --> 18:42.560]  grab they already gave the private offshore banks unlimited power to steal
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.360]  whatever amount of money they want the new bailout this is not my opinion we've
[18:46.360 --> 18:49.920]  written big articles on in the last 10 months and the only mainstream outlet to
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.520]  really tell the truth is Judge Napolitano on his Fox News internet TV show and he
[18:55.520 --> 18:59.240]  breaks it down but in the legislation it says they'll be given power over the
[18:59.240 --> 19:05.840]  entire economy in all businesses and the power to even levy taxes so this is a
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.640]  private group being given unlimited power over our entire economy so we're
[19:10.640 --> 19:17.720]  going to be breaking that down even CNBC with another story says be wary of

[19:22.440 --> 19:26.560]  that power the World Bank in fact that's the headline be wary of granting Fed
[19:26.560 --> 19:33.520]  more power World Bank and it goes on to admit this is really a transfer of power

[21:56.560 --> 22:02.160]  networks bring down the new world order prison planet TV hello Ted Anderson
[22:02.160 --> 22:05.040]  listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and
[22:05.040 --> 22:09.120]  understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it
[22:09.120 --> 22:12.800]  comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount
[22:12.800 --> 22:16.480]  of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system
[22:16.480 --> 22:20.160]  means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate
[22:20.160 --> 22:23.800]  withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[22:23.800 --> 22:27.840]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[22:27.840 --> 22:31.680]  a current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.280]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[22:35.280 --> 22:39.480]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve
[22:39.480 --> 22:43.880]  strength and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.240]  be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently
[22:48.240 --> 22:53.400]  have been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for

[24:14.360 --> 24:20.880]  it's very simple we have a corrupt elite private empire that has studied for
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.000]  over 100 years psychological warfare psychological manipulation and they're
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.360]  gonna need big crises to get the world government up and on its legs and
[24:30.360 --> 24:38.560]  walking ever watched a female wilder beast on PBS give birth that animals got
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.240]  a few minutes to get up on its feet to get away from any lions that are out
[24:42.240 --> 24:46.760]  there that's kind of what the new world order is like it's given birth to the
[24:46.760 --> 24:52.040]  system and it's now getting up on all four legs it's it's it's already up on
[24:52.040 --> 24:59.360]  its legs and it's shaking a bit and it's just now starting to walk and if it
[24:59.360 --> 25:04.400]  gets completely up on its feet and starts running we're in deep trouble and to
[25:04.400 --> 25:11.920]  get it fully up on its legs it needs crises stage terror attacks staged
[25:11.920 --> 25:19.800]  economic collapses staged bio attacks staged medical emergencies wars that's
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.240]  exactly what the rand corporation said was needed a giant war much bigger than
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.120]  what happened in iraq something on the order of world war two and that is what
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.080]  is lining up and three weeks ago benjamin yet in yahoo made a secret
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.440]  mission the israeli prime minister to russia I had tarply on we argued about
[25:39.440 --> 25:46.440]  it tarply said oh no I think Russia's making a deal with Saudi Arabia on
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.040]  weapons systems and they're buddying up and that certainly came out that they
[25:50.040 --> 25:53.840]  were but I said no I believe they're getting ready for war I'm gonna get
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.080]  Russia to green light an attack on Iran and a green light on sanctions and the
[25:57.080 --> 26:03.160]  brailleur to that and I was correct about a week after that Russia came out
[26:03.160 --> 26:06.760]  and said we're gonna support sanctions and we may have to support a strike on
[26:06.760 --> 26:11.000]  Iran if they don't submit and israel's now said they're getting ready to hit
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.560]  Iran so there's no more debate I don't know I printed about 10 stories this
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.760]  morning hartman looks like he printed no exaggeration this has got to be 20 30
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.160]  stories I didn't count them each one of them more important than the last I'm
[26:23.160 --> 26:29.760]  gonna go over those again next hour but before I do that I want to just talk
[26:29.760 --> 26:37.240]  about philosophy with the listeners the overriding message that I'm trying to
[26:37.240 --> 26:41.160]  get across to people is that we're being manipulated as a society and as a
[26:41.160 --> 26:47.560]  people and I don't expect listeners to necessarily even buy into my worldview
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.280]  and the things I'm saying and the things I'm covering I believe I'm telling the
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.200]  truth we're accurate over 95% of the time in my opinion and the articles we
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.160]  write the films we make in hindsight are evergreen they just get better and
[27:03.160 --> 27:05.520]  better and more important with time because we know what we're talking about
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.320]  but but even if you haven't researched my claims and found out they're true even
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.040]  if you don't want to believe me or you're in denial out there will you at
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.280]  least admit you're being manipulated will you at least admit that there are a
[27:17.280 --> 27:21.240]  lot of different agendas out there operating simultaneously will you at
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.280]  least admit that you're being propagandized and lied to and that the
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.840]  media lies and the government lies more often than they tell the truth we are in
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.280]  a system of control we are in a psychological warfare system that is
[27:35.280 --> 27:44.120]  all around us and it just hits me more and more that instead of debating
[27:44.120 --> 27:47.520]  Republican versus Democrat or black versus white or any of these
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.640]  distractionary issues that if we could just get the public to look at the
[27:51.640 --> 27:54.360]  corruption of government and the corruption of the big corporations that
[27:54.360 --> 28:01.120]  control it no one supports what's happening and going on and they have the
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.200]  daily diversions and distractions but if we could all just stop arguing with
[28:06.200 --> 28:09.120]  each other and and really look at what's happening if you look at all the
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.440]  major polls 90 plus plus percent of Americans don't want open borders 75 to
[28:14.440 --> 28:21.040]  85% depending on the poll don't want new wars over 70% don't want more gun
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.680]  control more victim disarmament the vast majority of Americans 99% major polls
[28:26.680 --> 28:30.240]  don't want the banker bailouts and the banker takeover the majority of
[28:30.240 --> 28:36.520]  Americans and British don't want a new world order right at 60% today in
[28:36.520 --> 28:41.360]  Gallup polls don't want this government health care plan but still it all
[28:41.360 --> 28:48.320]  marches on and if government was big and corrupt and out of control in previous
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.560]  years it's everything they're doing every form of corruption every form of
[28:52.560 --> 28:59.600]  power grab every level of control freak behavior is just exploding right now on
[28:59.600 --> 29:08.880]  every front and to say I'm exhausted is a understatement I'm probably gonna take
[29:08.880 --> 29:12.000]  some time off next week because I've got to recharge my batteries I had my
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.040]  adrenaline up with the Charlie Sheen announcements and the 9-11 information
[29:16.040 --> 29:21.560]  finishing fall the Republic and the flu situation now that I finished the film
[29:21.560 --> 29:25.200]  Friday and it's been delivered and being mass produced right now I'm not
[29:25.200 --> 29:32.080]  complaining I just am absolutely mentally sapped and exhausted right at a
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.840]  time when I need my full capacity to analyze what's happening and deal with
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.920]  it I mean I'm not even mad at the police that beat all these innocent people and
[29:41.920 --> 29:46.560]  did all these horrible things I'm just sad for them and disgusted I'll talk
[29:46.560 --> 29:53.160]  about that when we get back stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the

[33:50.640 --> 33:56.320]  that we have a scientific dictatorship in control of our society to know that
[33:56.320 --> 34:03.880]  their evil knows no limits that it's bottomless fathomless and to know that
[34:03.880 --> 34:07.040]  we really are in a world government run by eugenicist and they really are
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.280]  poisoning people the vaccines water food and air and to know that all the eagles
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.120]  we've seen the last hundred years in their own words were only a beta test
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.280]  because this is a scientific dictatorship they say Iraq and Afghanistan
[34:21.280 --> 34:28.160]  are laboratories they bragged in the news that what happened last week at the
[34:28.160 --> 34:32.440]  G 20 in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania was a laboratory test of the people the
[34:32.440 --> 34:40.120]  police the military I don't like being tested I don't like being manipulated I
[34:40.120 --> 34:45.600]  don't like being conned I don't like control freaks and bad people getting
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.320]  away with evil over and over again I want to open the phones up for listeners
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.800]  on the subject of Iran the flu the G 20 the economy the new world order is here
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.720]  it's not coming anymore we're in it they've openly announced it we are now
[35:00.720 --> 35:08.160]  sliding down the hill into all the hopes and dreams of the globalist they're
[35:08.160 --> 35:13.280]  having their way they're succeeding now yes people are waking up in record
[35:13.280 --> 35:19.920]  numbers and people are upset and people are listening more and more to what we
[35:19.920 --> 35:25.720]  have to say but I liken it to the couple car wrecks I've been in I've been in a
[35:25.720 --> 35:31.360]  few car wrecks always in rain when you start hydroplaning and then you run off
[35:31.360 --> 35:37.760]  a ditch and the car starts flipping that happened when I was 16 we were freezing
[35:37.760 --> 35:42.400]  our butts off at my family ranch two hours south of Dallas it was about 1
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.000]  a.m. we went back to the ranch house called our girlfriends they were going
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.920]  to sneak out we could get back at 3 a.m.
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.920]  and I said okay let's get in the car and drive back to Dallas and I was driving
[35:58.920 --> 36:02.920]  and I said I want to go to sleep my buddy said I'll drive and he was driving
[36:02.920 --> 36:09.160]  long listening to mega death Metallica we're coming into Dallas it was raining
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.000]  real hard and there's these big embankments on I-45 right we're going
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.320]  to Dallas and he kept trying to wake me up he said look I can't stay awake I
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.560]  can't stay awake and I said you're fine just keep driving and then I woke up as
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.680]  the car was spinning down the highway and went rolling down the side flipping
[36:24.680 --> 36:29.920]  but thank God we had our seatbelts on I remember being an upside down as rock
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.800]  and roll music was playing and rain was pouring through the broken windows down
[36:34.800 --> 36:40.080]  in the ditch in about two feet of water and I remember those two or three seconds
[36:40.080 --> 36:46.120]  as I woke up we were spinning off the highway thinking man I wish I could get
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.480]  out of this I wish this wasn't happening and then I guess about four or five
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.800]  years ago time flies I was out visiting family in Fredericksburg Texas big
[36:54.800 --> 37:00.200]  beautiful sunny summer day and storms were blowing in and my aunt said you
[37:00.200 --> 37:04.600]  better get going so we got in our cars we're in two cars my dad and I driving
[37:04.600 --> 37:10.760]  in one and my mother my wife and my two children at the time left about five
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.360]  minutes earlier than us and it was almost blowing us off the road when we
[37:14.360 --> 37:21.040]  got past Fredericksburg into close to Johnson City I guess Stonewall so I
[37:21.040 --> 37:26.000]  slowed down to about 50 and then 45 and then 40 probably saved our lives and
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.760]  all of a sudden we just got picked up and thrown off the road when the state
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.160]  police got there they told us you didn't know you got hit by a tornado look look
[37:33.160 --> 37:41.360]  at that barn 100 200 yards away it's completely knocked down but in this
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.120]  case as we're driving we didn't just spin off the road we got picked up turned
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.360]  around backwards and thrown off another 20 30 foot embankment and as I looked
[37:50.360 --> 37:54.320]  over to my dad it seemed like a minute or two it was really only about five
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.680]  seconds I said brace for impact I could even hear my voice going brace for
[37:59.680 --> 38:04.880]  impact my dad thought that was kind of neat after the wrecking you're pretty
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.080]  pretty calm when that happened what time slowed down didn't it and we spun
[38:09.080 --> 38:14.320]  around backwards shot down the hill like a slingshot you know big big steep
[38:14.320 --> 38:21.680]  embankment down into a creek bottom and flew across the creek into the into
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.760]  three big oak trees and it smashed in over a third of the Tahoe all the way
[38:27.760 --> 38:34.960]  back to our front seats and broke our seats seats broke my dad got a
[38:34.960 --> 38:43.080]  concussion from it I didn't get hurt but it's the same feeling but even more
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.880]  slow motion I mean I know they're putting poison in the water got their own
[38:48.880 --> 38:52.680]  documents I know they're putting poison in the vaccines I know the police and
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.800]  military and FBI and government people aren't my enemies I know even though
[38:57.800 --> 39:00.760]  they've been trained that we are in their macho and think they're winners and
[39:00.760 --> 39:04.880]  have a distorted twisted warrior spirit of adrenaline and they think it's
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.760]  cute to bite old ladies with police dogs and beat up young girls on bikes and in
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.640]  a sick level I can go well at least they're taking the vaccines at least
[39:13.640 --> 39:16.480]  they're drinking the water at least they think they're part of the system but at
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.760]  least they're getting burned by their own system but I actually don't take any
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.440]  pleasure in it at a sick level there's kind of a shadow of that I can
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.240]  intellectually analyze that angle and I know they're gonna get hurt by the
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.000]  banking collapse and they're gonna get hurt by everything but I and maybe two
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.120]  or three four years ago I kind of he didn't feel powerless because at a sick
[39:39.120 --> 39:41.720]  level of my psyche I could say well at least they're gonna get hurt by their
[39:41.720 --> 39:47.120]  own system but I don't even have that anymore I don't even hate them because I
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.400]  understand they don't know what they do I understand that they perish for lack
[39:51.400 --> 39:55.920]  of knowledge and I just wish they'd wake up because I know I'm telling the truth
[39:55.920 --> 40:04.480]  I know this is real and I'm here in this truck spun around backwards flying down
[40:04.480 --> 40:10.000]  an embankment just praying that we don't hit those trees on the side of the truck
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.840]  knowing I'm gonna die I mean they'd all flash in my mind and my life flashed in
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.720]  my mind and I remember just thinking well at least my kids are gonna go on and
[40:18.720 --> 40:23.760]  live after me and at least I've been a good person and I thought man hope it
[40:23.760 --> 40:28.360]  doesn't kill my dad I hope because I could see the trees as we were spinning
[40:28.360 --> 40:33.760]  around backwards and a split second my mind could pull up what I'd seen
[40:33.760 --> 40:44.160]  forwards that was a big cliff and trees and a gully down there and I just
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.000]  remember when I knew that I was on the verge of possible death all I cared about
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.160]  was my family and my father and I just hope that if anybody got killed or hurt
[40:52.160 --> 40:57.320]  real bad it was me and that wasn't because I'm some hero or some even good
[40:57.320 --> 41:02.240]  person because I've got basic instincts basic instinct means I don't want my
[41:02.240 --> 41:05.920]  tribe to be hurt I don't want my people to be hurt I don't want anybody to be
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.400]  living like this and I don't understand how I can have this stuff all figured
[41:10.400 --> 41:15.560]  out and other people can I mean I don't have some lofty view of myself I don't
[41:15.560 --> 41:22.360]  think of myself as special how the hell can you not know I went back in the
[41:22.360 --> 41:28.560]  break room to get some water during the last break and there was a bear
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.520]  pharmaceuticals and tell everybody how great bear is it was one minute out I
[41:33.520 --> 41:36.840]  watched the whole thing in the break room about all the great things they do
[41:36.840 --> 41:41.480]  for science and all the great products they've got for vaccines and aspirin how
[41:41.480 --> 41:48.680]  good they are and how much they love you and it ended with the bear logo blazing
[41:48.680 --> 41:58.520]  and green bear logo is basically the aspirin tablet and then a whole data
[41:58.520 --> 42:02.960]  dump of info flashed in my mind on that and it came back to me what I was
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.360]  thinking as I drove into work I was thinking about bear pharmaceutical making
[42:07.360 --> 42:12.160]  roughly one-fifth of the H1N1 vaccine worldwide I know it's one-fifth in
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.480]  Europe in the US I don't know what it is worldwide I know in the West they're
[42:15.480 --> 42:20.040]  making one-fifth of it at least they got the contract for one-fifth they produced
[42:20.040 --> 42:25.200]  one-fifth I was driving in this morning and I was looking at cars and people in
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.160]  light pole cameras and chemtrails and the surveillance and the control grid and
[42:30.160 --> 42:34.440]  how I was just driving along in this engineered designed technocracy this
[42:34.440 --> 42:46.000]  technological enslavement grid slave grid technological enslavement system and I
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.720]  was driving along and I just had love for the people in their cars and for the
[42:51.720 --> 42:55.000]  police I drove by with their stupid little radar guns out there raising money
[42:55.000 --> 43:06.800]  and saw an eagle on a light pole it's watching for its prey and the surveillance
[43:06.800 --> 43:13.000]  camera a hundred yards away was watching for its prey and I just thought
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.600]  about how they admit in New York daily news that they the CPS comes to because
[43:19.600 --> 43:22.800]  they get the call in New York especially it's where eugenics started in this
[43:22.800 --> 43:26.840]  country and now it was in the New York papers three four years ago quite a few
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.520]  articles we had guessed on about it and the and this and and and the and the
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.920]  chemical companies not just drug companies say we need eight and nine
[43:35.920 --> 43:44.800]  year olds for our studies and the CPS goes out with a quota they get paid to
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.040]  grab eight-year-olds and then how they went to these especially black women
[43:48.040 --> 43:50.840]  because the black community's been in this control grid longer than anybody
[43:50.840 --> 43:55.680]  else and they've been trained to turn their children over since they got off
[43:55.680 --> 44:01.880]  the slave ships I guess and how they mainly in the articles it said that the
[44:01.880 --> 44:08.160]  majority was over 80% of the kids they grab are black and in the new in the
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.320]  New York City and New York State test and how they take those kids and they
[44:12.320 --> 44:16.200]  tell the women you sign your eight-year-old son over to us or you're at
[44:16.200 --> 44:20.160]  nine-year-old daughter and then these had cases and names and I got their
[44:20.160 --> 44:24.720]  lawyers on and they said we're gonna take that two-year-old and that three-year-old
[44:24.720 --> 44:29.520]  and the mother signed their kids over and then they described this one little
[44:29.520 --> 44:35.240]  black boy they took in and they it was a chemical test in this one pesticide test
[44:35.240 --> 44:40.200]  and they put pesticide in his food in his drinks and the first two weeks he
[44:40.200 --> 44:43.600]  threw up and got sick and lost weight and then a couple weeks later he couldn't
[44:43.600 --> 44:49.680]  walk and then he would struggle and fight so they they would force forcing on
[44:49.680 --> 44:56.280]  him and they'd strap him down and they killed him now I'm gonna tell you
[44:56.280 --> 45:02.640]  something police and military that's who we're dealing with here and you better
[45:02.640 --> 45:08.560]  get your hearts and souls right with God because you don't have any excuses in
[45:08.560 --> 45:11.400]  the world for strapping those little boys and girls down and killing them
[45:11.400 --> 45:21.600]  dead or in a hammer torturing them to death and I want you to think about the
[45:21.600 --> 45:25.720]  system you work for and you know what if you're laughing about this driving on
[45:25.720 --> 45:33.240]  your squad car saying I'm a liar you listen to me you listen real good but I
[45:33.240 --> 45:37.680]  just told you is a true story on record and when I tell you that they are
[45:37.680 --> 45:43.520]  pharmaceutical for more than a decade in Australia and in France and in England
[45:43.520 --> 45:48.160]  and in Canada and the US and a bunch of other countries knowingly shipped out
[45:48.160 --> 46:00.360]  factor 8 blood product knowing every injection it's delivered by IV bag every
[46:00.360 --> 46:06.320]  every dosage had HIV and hepatitis and it killed around half the hemophiliacs in
[46:06.320 --> 46:10.360]  this country alone who took it that's half of these people mainly little
[46:10.360 --> 46:17.520]  kids because a lot of times hemophiliacs die but they're 20 or 30 and I want you
[46:17.520 --> 46:21.160]  to understand that it came out in court documents in Australia and France and
[46:21.160 --> 46:29.200]  France actually sent bare executive to prison that they knew it was in there and
[46:29.200 --> 46:32.840]  said we're gonna go ahead and ship it out not just for profits but for eugenics
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.440]  and I can go through thousands of other examples and I want you to understand
[46:37.440 --> 46:40.520]  that they took foster children and radiated them to death I'm just giving
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.160]  you well-known examples there's thousands other bizarre studies they took
[46:44.160 --> 46:46.960]  little two-year-olds and three-year-olds and four-year-olds and five-year-olds
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.160]  they took him into chambers you can go to the Department of Energy they've got
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.160]  photos of it they apologize for it that was apologized but nobody gets in
[46:55.160 --> 47:01.280]  trouble and they radiated them to death and the black men in syphilis with
[47:01.280 --> 47:09.960]  a skiggy you know about that and I want you to understand something the global
[47:09.960 --> 47:13.720]  is target you in their studies more than anybody else in the military project
[47:13.720 --> 47:19.400]  shad and all the other projects where they spray chemicals and biologicals on
[47:19.400 --> 47:24.760]  ships there's confirmed reports from Bob Chapman of them killing people on
[47:24.760 --> 47:29.760]  Navy ships in the Pacific testing the stuff on them this month and I just
[47:29.760 --> 47:34.640]  want you to understand something this isn't a game or a joke and once you know
[47:34.640 --> 47:40.280]  that our government and the Western governments are run by people who did
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.520]  all these tests and studies not just to find out what would kill us or to kill
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.240]  us and reduce our numbers but to find groups of doctors and medical workers
[47:48.240 --> 47:54.440]  and police and military that would take part in nerve-gassing our troops or
[47:54.440 --> 48:06.160]  releasing anthrax on them and these are just the studies we know about and then
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.920]  I see two different groups there's about four different groups of neighbor kids
[48:10.920 --> 48:14.120]  that come over and play in our front yard and play in the other yards and I
[48:14.120 --> 48:27.520]  obviously or my wife when I'm not there goes out and watches them and a couple
[48:27.520 --> 48:33.200]  weeks ago I saw the neighbor kids come over they were showing off they got in
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.560]  their flu shots two different groups of neighbor kids one with was a brother
[48:37.560 --> 48:44.080]  with his sister the other was a little girl her little brother two boys two
[48:44.080 --> 48:50.400]  girls they were all showing me their shots that the school given them free it
[48:50.400 --> 48:53.400]  was the regular flu shot and they said they were gonna get the next shot when
[48:53.400 --> 48:57.240]  it came out and I knew they had mercury and squalene in them and I knew it had
[48:57.240 --> 49:02.320]  adjuvants and I knew it was gonna hurt them and the little kids who I know well
[49:02.320 --> 49:07.640]  did seem kind of dazed and stupid but I thought well maybe that's just me
[49:07.640 --> 49:13.880]  projecting that and then about a week and a half later saw him playing again and
[49:13.880 --> 49:16.560]  I said where's your sister where's your brother and they said oh they're sick at
[49:16.560 --> 49:19.880]  home I said how long's your sister how long's your brother been sick and one
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.720]  said oh she's been in bed about a week we don't know what's wrong with her and
[49:24.720 --> 49:28.800]  the other one was so little they just said yeah my brother's sick he's been
[49:28.800 --> 49:38.200]  sick he's got a rash he's in bed they may have to take him to the hospital
[49:38.200 --> 49:44.600]  those parents don't know what they did to their kids and I like my kids have a
[49:44.600 --> 49:48.640]  neighborhood kids to play with and I know if I go over and give the parents a
[49:48.640 --> 49:51.800]  packet of documentation try to talk to them they're just gonna get uppity and
[49:51.800 --> 49:56.600]  mad and think I'm in their business so I know why you don't talk to your
[49:56.600 --> 50:00.600]  neighbors but I am probably gonna have to go over there and talk to them you
[50:00.600 --> 50:03.880]  know what I care about those little kids and I don't like David Rockefeller I
[50:03.880 --> 50:11.880]  don't like Ted Turner and George Soros and Bella Melinda Gates who openly are
[50:11.880 --> 50:17.560]  involved in all this and who openly talk about population reduction and I don't
[50:17.560 --> 50:24.480]  like the fact that those neighborhood kids now maybe it'll wear off but
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.600]  they're I've seen their IQs reduced not only are two of them too sick to come
[50:28.600 --> 50:32.800]  out and play after they took it now I'm trying to talk to the neighborhood kids
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.720]  and just a couple weeks ago they were there and their eyes were sparkly they
[50:36.720 --> 50:42.960]  look like their borderline retarded now and you know what it's really sick to be
[50:42.960 --> 50:46.920]  powerless just like I'm in that car flying down that embankment I've lost
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.560]  control and I can't even help the neighborhood kids now the government's
[50:50.560 --> 50:54.600]  talking about trying to make my kids take their death you know what don't
[50:54.600 --> 51:00.240]  force me to stand up against you that's all I got to say we'll be right back

[56:16.280 --> 56:19.280]  To be able to attack old women with Billy clubs and police dogs
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.800]  To fire sound cannons at nine-year-old boys in their front yards
[56:27.720 --> 56:29.720]  Think about how they've been twisted
[56:29.720 --> 56:36.840]  Did you mean what you said? Think about the evil bear executive shipping out the tainted blood to kill the hemophiliacs
[56:37.800 --> 56:39.800]  knowing it
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  Think about how they're damned off from humanity
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.720]  Think about how far they've fallen. Yes, we've got to expose them and fight them and stand up to them and bring them to justice

[56:52.120 --> 56:54.920]  Purely hating them. We begin to fall to their level

[1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:53.640]  Thank you. I live in a small town on farm between the suburbs and I'm always out and about you know
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:59.480]  And on the highway for the past month and a half. I've been seeing so much military activity going on
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:05.720]  I have a bunch of videos I want to send you armor like tanks coming in on trails about 13 of them have recorded
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:07.720]  military
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:09.240]  Convoys coming in
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:12.920]  Huey's going up by the old military base by us and they're gay
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:18.360]  It seems like they're getting everything ready for something and we've never seen it. So I lived here for 24 years
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:21.960]  And my mother and father never seen anything that's happened before in their life
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.360]  And I mean I don't know you want to see austin texas
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  armored homeland security vehicles
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:32.040]  photographed by one of my shipping department
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  two weeks ago in san marcus
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.360]  uh
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.920]  Homeland security buses all over the place fema's taken over the old highland mall
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:44.360]  They first took over part of it now. They've taken over the whole thing
[1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:48.520]  Helicopters all over the place military checkpoint videos
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:50.360]  pouring in
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:54.680]  of military coming up to people's cars asking them if they've had their flu shot
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:57.720]  Clearly they're going to try to use the flu
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:04.520]  While an iran attack goes on if they believe the public will buy it as the pretext for a domestic clampdown
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:10.120]  Right and speaking of that too. We live maybe about a thousand feet from the eukon medical center
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:16.680]  And there's so much national guard there. I mean they're giving out in harford the city
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.480]  They're giving out vaccines for money. If you take the vaccine shot you'll get $50
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:25.640]  And you can clearly see the side of wallgreens
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:30.280]  CVS everywhere and all the local cops too even suburb cops
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:36.680]  They all have they're all armed with m16a2s. I mean you can clearly see them inside the cop cars
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.560]  And and they have new be to use now
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:44.760]  And just uh two weeks ago reported. They're not just planning to hit iran and
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.880]  Do all these horrible things they're gonna
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:53.160]  Very soon. They're saying they're planning on it the value of the dollar and when that happens
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:56.120]  We'll be in a depression overnight
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:01.240]  And that's the whole point from a military standpoint. They're openly arming and and building up
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:07.880]  Against us and announcing they're gonna put 379 thousand regular army on the streets of america
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:14.440]  That's why we need listeners to go out and videotape and keep a small camera or photo
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:17.560]  Still camera on them at all times
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  because
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.960]  It's really happening my friend. You were gonna say you took a photo of something
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:28.440]  Well, which I I've taken pictures and I used to have a nice camera
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.920]  And I was filming on the national guard doing training at central connecticut
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:38.760]  And I military personnel walked up to me took my camera threw me on the ground zip tied me and broke the camera
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:43.080]  And now I'm considered domestic terrorist. I can never go out and buy another firearm ever again
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:46.920]  I mean you tried have you tried?
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:49.800]  Oh, I went down actually yesterday
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:55.480]  Um to go down to newington gun exchange to go try buy another rifle and they denied me right away red flag popped up
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.480]  But the computer said you're not allowed to
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.880]  No judge no jury
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:04.440]  You're just put on a list and the attorney general has claimed this power
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.560]  If we give into this chilling effect, we've already lost
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:13.240]  This is the most vicious form of tyranny when you're put on secret list of my guys
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:17.000]  Rob do got arrested and it was the military
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:21.560]  And fbi running that the state penitentiary they were putting people in
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:25.240]  And uh just for asking the military for an interview
[1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:29.480]  Jason douglas was told he was going to be put on a list. So they're reveling
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:33.960]  In their feluja type list just like everybody in feluja got put on a list
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:39.720]  This is the occupation of our country. You need to call your congressman. You need to sue over this
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.280]  You need to uh demand that this be removed. We need to stand up and fight this. God bless you
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:46.760]  Mike. I'm sorry the secret police got you
[1:04:47.320 --> 1:04:52.360]  But if we give into this through fear and then don't ask questions or speak out they win and it's over

[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.040]  With our guests. I wanted to go over
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:32.680]  the iran situation
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:38.760]  Three weeks ago three and a half weeks ago a secret mission by benjamin yahin yahoo was sent to russia to meet with
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:40.840]  Putin and mediedev
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:42.920]  the president and prime minister
[1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:48.360]  We clearly pointed out that that was about getting the green light to strike iran
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:54.920]  A few weeks later russia came out and said yes, we may have to support a strike on iran and sanctions
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:01.480]  A big shift the deal was to at least for now pull the missile systems out of western europe eastern europe
[1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.600]  To get that concession that russia will be left alone
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:13.240]  The bargaining ship, I guess was launching the sneak attack on russia on 888 to say we're serious. You better let us have iran
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:17.560]  Israel helped of course launch that attack according to jerusalem post and haritz
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:24.600]  Along with nato and us forces on 888 in georgian areas of south ossetia and abkhazia
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:28.920]  So we have all of that going on
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:32.120]  We have the open announcements of troops being deployed all over the country
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:39.320]  Searching people at checkpoints new videos coming in every day very chilling open talk of fourth inoculation
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:41.640]  We don't get the word out that's going to end up happening
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:47.880]  Open discussion of the dollar being completely devalued anytime in the next two years, maybe even quicker
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:50.920]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:54.920]  We have the open announcements of troops being deployed all over the country
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:58.680]  Maybe even quicker ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:05.480]  We are going into receivership a foreign group of banks by fraud by fraudulent means has seized control of our government
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:10.280]  They have threatened the congress with marshal law on record senator enhoff's on record
[1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:13.720]  Many other congressmen are on record
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:15.800]  We cover that in the obama deception
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:20.760]  It's on record that they've been threatened with marshal law ron paul has talked about that here on the show
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:25.800]  This is a very very serious time and the military and police
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:31.480]  Have shown themselves on the heels of what happened at the g20. I'm going to talk about that in the fourth hour today
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:34.040]  One of my camera guys being arrested rob do
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.040]  They were taken to a military facility run by the military and the fbi of the state penitentiary
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:47.720]  They pepper sprayed people and tear gassed them once they were handcuffed on the ground
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:55.160]  They tortured look radowski stripped him down made fun of him made fun of rob do's body
[1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:59.560]  When he that's what they did everybody when you go to the bathroom
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:04.440]  Just just really horrible stuff and they went they came and took the guns
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  That was an admitted laboratory test
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:11.400]  In new orleans in the high and dry areas. They wouldn't bring food and water in they followed orders
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.560]  They confiscated the firearms
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:18.600]  They've been training in iowa this year in arcadia for gun confiscation door to door
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:22.200]  I had the kernel on that was in the news. They bragged about how they were doing it
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:27.960]  This is high treason and the military and police have shown themselves and in a mob psychology
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:30.360]  In the heat of the moment, they will take your guns
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.800]  They will take your children. They will forcibly inoculate you
[1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:41.800]  Now are they going to stage a new war as the ran corporation document showed they wanted to do eight months ago that paul watson wrote about
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:47.000]  Is it going to be mixed with the flu outbreak? Is it going to be mixed with the dollar devaluation?
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:50.920]  We don't know but the assets are in place the legislations in place
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:55.320]  This this appears to not be a tabletop exercise where it's a drill on paper
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:02.040]  It appears well. It doesn't appear. It's a fact that the real hardware assets and training is in
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:06.680]  Place and they're drilling openly at a level
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:11.960]  Conservatively 20 30 40 times anything we've ever seen
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:22.280]  I want to now go to curtain mo of info wars dot com paul watson a prison planet dot com both my main editors of those sites
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:27.160]  Kurt let's let's tackle iran first and we'll go through all of this and then paul
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:28.600]  Only get paul's take on it
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:34.280]  He written two excellent articles building a pretext for mass murder. I ran secret enrichment facility and then you read in
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:40.680]  The the u.s. Launched a sneak attack on russia, but they've said russia launched it and later they had to admit it was a lie
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:42.440]  They said
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:45.480]  Iraq had wmd's yellow cake aluminum tubes. That was a lie
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:49.320]  You prove this is just one of many enrichment facilities on record
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:51.880]  And that this is another huge hoax
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:56.440]  Just like iraq and they only do this and then now they put out the fake pats
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:01.640]  He's being busted the fbi created founded gave them the bombs same mo as usual
[1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:05.240]  So they're creating the terror fear again ahead of a staged terror attack
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:11.320]  Everything is happening. They're demonizing the patriot gun owning movement admitting homeland securities for us
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:14.440]  Plaming the american people have linked up with al-qaeda
[1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.160]  It doesn't look good curtain mo
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:19.160]  Yeah, it doesn't look good at all on friday
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.880]  uh, obama went before the g20
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:24.520]  flanked by brown and sarkozy
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:28.360]  and accused iran of building a new
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:33.880]  You rich iranium enrichment plant to produce weapons great iranium
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:40.040]  Turns out this is total nonsense. The united states knew about this plant being under construction for two years
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:48.120]  And also iran doesn't have the capability to to enrich iranium to 95 percent, which is needed for weapons great for bomb
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:54.920]  So in essence, this is just another pretext. Um, you know, the corporate media spun it as they, you know, they're building an atomic bomb
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:15:00.200]  So it's just more nonsense. You know, it's getting ready for an attack on iran
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:07.800]  Just like it was later declassified that the girl who testified about seeing republican guard throw babies out of incubators
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:14.440]  Turned out she'd never been to collate her family owned the big pr firm that was paid to put the story out
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:22.280]  Uh, it's it's it's just classic and they wouldn't be going with a lie this big and this bold if they weren't planning to hit iran
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:27.880]  Absolutely, they're planning on hitting it also a dub cut today reported that and of course, that's a
[1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:31.960]  Suspicious news source, but they reported if you can believe them that
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:37.320]  United States is in the process of developing a new bunker buster that's going to be able to take out these
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:42.520]  Uh, you know reinforced, uh, no, that was admitted six years ago. Uh, that's a
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:45.880]  McDonald Douglas named several other big bunker buster
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.520]  Smaller nukes. So yes
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:50.680]  Yeah, and these are nuclear tipped
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.640]  Uh, bunker busters, which is pretty scary
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.120]  Well, you accuse the country of about to nuke people when you nuke them
[1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:03.960]  Then all the good old boys get a extension feel manly through it
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:06.120]  Even though they can't find it on a map
[1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.920]  Then of course, we'll all breathe that as it rains back down on us
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:14.680]  Uh, your article breaks this down. I mean, they've built these things all over the country. They haven't come clean
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:19.640]  They said, okay, we finish a new enrichment for center come inspect as it opened
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:21.640]  They've got them all over the country
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:28.680]  Um, this is just another mass line, right? And also Iran is not anywhere near bringing this
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:31.160]  A plant online
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:35.640]  So they have followed the rules that are set up by the the uh, IAEA
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:37.480]  as far as
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:40.360]  Under the nuclear uh, the NPT
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:47.720]  To um to come supposedly come clean as as Obama put but but Israel doesn't clean come clean about its 400 to 800
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:51.640]  High techniques and submarines and ICBMs to deliver it and cruise missiles
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:55.240]  I mean, why can israel have all this and then no one's supposed to talk about it
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:59.640]  But iran can't have anything well israel's a preferred client state. They're allowed to do that
[1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:03.320]  In the same way that tax downs allowed to do it
[1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:07.720]  Paul watson, uh
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:11.480]  Another giant hoax we need a headline explaining that this is a hoax
[1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:16.200]  Just like they announced that russia snuck attack georgia
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:18.200]  I mean, this is a giant hoax
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:22.120]  That's right. I like it. I mean if
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:23.960]  if you remember
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:28.360]  Obama won the nomination against hillary by posing as
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:35.320]  This peacenik because hillary kept saying in debates how she wanted to go after iran and obama was
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:43.480]  Positioning himself as the opposite of that, you know, he would seek talks with iran. He was this ambassador for peat
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:46.920]  And now he's involved in one of the biggest
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:56.200]  Stage managed and contrived inventions that we've seen in years, which is acting as a pretext for hostility against iran
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.160]  You know, I mean
[1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:02.200]  The fact is that as curt lays out in his article
[1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:06.440]  Obama claimed that iran was breaking these rules
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:11.960]  But under the march 2007 agreement that iran had with the ia
[1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:14.840]  They're not required to report a nuclear
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:21.000]  Processing installation when it's being when it's first being constructed. They're only required to report it
[1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:26.440]  Six months before any nuclear materials are brought onto the site
[1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:32.440]  So iran reported it as would be routine to the ia ia early last week
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:39.960]  And then obama seized upon that as if iran's cover had been blown and that they were trying to come clean
[1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:47.320]  Complete after the fact when they were just reporting it six months before the nuclear material was going to be on site
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:51.960]  And the plan itself is 18 months away from even being completed
[1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:55.160]  obama himself
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:59.000]  knew of the plant's existence that it was being built
[1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:06.360]  Straight after he got elected in january and the us has been aware of it since 2006
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:10.440]  So they choose the g20. They choose this moment
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:15.640]  And by the way, it's right on the eve of talks with iran. So obama's
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:17.480]  You know
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:23.080]  Characteristic as this statesman this ambassador has been blown wide open again. Well, just like last time
[1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:29.640]  I want to talk about that when we come back. He says I want to be friends with you right when they launched the cia destabilization
[1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.200]  He says I want to be your friend and they go, okay
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:37.560]  We're we're gonna open this plant and they go. Oh my god. We found a secret plant and you read down deeper
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:39.560]  It says iran announced it
[1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:41.320]  I mean, it's just
[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:47.640]  But but just like the public loves to be lied to about how the banks were gonna use the bailout money to unfreeze the mortgages
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:53.240]  And then they get the money and say they're not going to day one. It's all about hoaxes all about giant lies
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:59.880]  Stay there. Let's talk about the timetable for hitting iran. Israel says they could do it anytime now god help us

[1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:13.720]  Kurt Nemo paul watson
[1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.720]  Whoever wants to go first can
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:21.480]  From all these hundreds of articles that we've been reading and scanning the last few weeks the announcements israel's saying they're getting ready to
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:23.960]  Attack israel doing drills to attack
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.680]  Clearly they're beating the drums just like they did up until march
[1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:33.720]  Two thousand and three with the strike on iraq the same folks that lied about wmds
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:40.280]  There are now doing it here, but not worried about pakistan who the west actually gave nukes to and delivery systems
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.640]  They want to go into iran more than anything
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:48.840]  This is a political cover for devaluing the dollar here because as long as they devalue the dollar while we're in a war
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:52.440]  People will wave flags and say great. I'm glad i'm going bankrupt
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:55.320]  The ran corporation talked about that didn't they paul
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:25:00.600]  Yeah, that was about a year ago. They said we want a major new war
[1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:03.640]  You know to get the weapons trade flowing again
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:06.120]  and uh
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:09.880]  We've been talking about this for years, but as kurt mentioned
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:12.200]  the um
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:16.760]  Massive ordered and penetrated the nucleotide bunker buster
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.320]  They're reporting now that it's been uh
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:23.160]  Brought forward by no less than three years
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:30.360]  And they indicate quote the obama administration has been preparing military muftals back up the international condemnation of iran
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:38.040]  So they're getting they're getting ready for the sanctions as you said israel's got those two they what was it two years ago ordered
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.760]  I want to say 50 of them
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:44.040]  I mean this is rich of course they have bunker busting mini nukes
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:51.000]  No, it's but this the first 15 ton super bunker buster bomb. So it's just a bigger version
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Oh
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:59.800]  Because it allows them to get a reach a depth of 60 meters according to this article before exploding
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:02.520]  So they're just beefing up the weapons systems
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:09.320]  Um, and I don't think that we've said all along they can't do it without some kind of major provocation
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:10.920]  um
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:13.400]  You had robert bear on the show
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.600]  About well two years ago now who said that
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:19.960]  They could launch an attack inside the united states
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:24.120]  The Saudis could launch it in a false flag and blame it on iran
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.840]  Which seems to line up with everything we're seeing
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:29.080]  especially with um
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:32.120]  The cia front intel center now saying that
[1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:34.760]  Because uh bin laden
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.560]  Said something on an audio tape, which is completely
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.080]  Ridiculous within itself if you study who's behind it
[1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:42.680]  that
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:49.400]  An imminent al-qaeda attack is to be expected and then the fbi goes out and finds former prisoners
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.440]  Leads them gives them cell phones money and fake bombs and bust them at the same time
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  Clearly to coincide with the g20
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:01.640]  And the iran situation and going back to saudi arabia with israel with the u.s
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:08.600]  Setting up out the taliban and al-qaeda and charlie wilson's war, which is a whitewash, but that part is true
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:14.920]  Uh, it's the same mo. That's why the hijackers were known saudi intelligence according to mr.
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:20.120]  springman of the u.s. Embassy and ordered to come over here and set up thinking they were taking part in drills
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:25.480]  saudi arabia always helps stage attacks to go after its enemy iran and iraq
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.920]  It's very very i i agree with bear when he said that a year and a half ago. We should repost that paul
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:33.880]  Yeah, and um
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:40.120]  Obviously ties in with the fact that the u.s. Government both under bush and al-barma has been funding
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:46.920]  Al-qaeda affiliated groups sunni terrorist groups to go into iran and attack iran
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:50.920]  And there've been attacks on paulman buildings in iran that have all led back to this
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:58.760]  Jundula organization, which was formally headed by collegiate mohammed and it's being funded directly by the cia
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:04.600]  And by the way the white house put out a press release three years ago on that they're proud of this because they know the public
[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:07.880]  Can't tell al-qaeda
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:13.640]  Uh from shia. I mean they it's it's like john mccain during the campaign saying that
[1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:18.040]  I mean they just they they think of the public as absolute trash
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.720]  Well, yeah, they don't care. I mean
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:26.440]  It's black and white. They just portray it as a comic book villain piece every time
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:31.000]  um, I mean they tried to overthrow armadine ish out obviously
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:33.960]  um, a few months ago with this
[1:28:33.960 --> 1:28:41.880]  This election when there were cries of staged elections, which is pretty rich when the most recent election in afghanistan
[1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:47.480]  Is admittedly completely staged for the western puppet to get back in power
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:50.840]  But there's no establishment media outcry about that
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:54.440]  Kurt let me ask you this and we'll come back and ask paul and then take calls
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.400]  When do you believe they're getting ready to hit from all their statements hit iran?
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:03.960]  Is there any way to stop them from saying they've got wmds and we'll do iraq part two?
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.640]  Well, it looks like mass murder by christmas, but not necessarily
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:14.120]  Recall that obama said that they're going to impose some punitive medieval sanctions on iran
[1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:16.120]  prior to
[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:19.000]  You know putting this the war agenda on the table
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:25.160]  And then give them ultimatums and then it's almost like a get the popcorn countdown as americans go
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:30.360]  We feel manly when we see skyscrapers blowing up during shock and awe. We feel manly
[1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:34.200]  We may have lost our jobs and lost our bank accounts, but we want to feel manly
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:40.760]  We want to see some buildings blow up. It's better than going to a bruce willis movie. Come on. We want to feel manly right now
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:44.760]  Bomb that middle eastern country. It's not middle eastern, but they don't care
[1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:51.080]  We'll be right back with kurt nemo paul watson get their take on all this and take your phone calls count down to the strike on iran
[1:29:51.080 --> 1:29:53.880]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:57.560]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network

[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:26.760]  Uh continue with what we're seeing happen with iran
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:30.920]  Well, you ask uh, um
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:33.880]  When it's been when you think they've launched the attack
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:38.840]  Um, I don't think they'll launch it under obama. I think you probably see a
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:45.000]  An attack a single attack on a nuclear facility like israel did against iraq
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Um, but I don't think you'll see a full-scale war until they put a republican back in
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:57.160]  I think obama's the kind of guy to jab them and keep them on the back foot foot and then a
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:37:59.160]  neocon
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.200]  Administrational come in and deliver the knockout blow in
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:03.960]  2012
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:09.080]  So you think he's happy with the 50,000 troop escalation already 30. They want 50,000 more
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:15.800]  Replacing the troops pulled out of iraq sent to afghanistan and pakistan with mercs with mercenaries with contractors
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:21.480]  Uh, and that they're just going to further put sanctions on in circle and soften iran up
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:27.160]  Uh for uh, but but here's the issue clearly they're gearing up on a war footing here in the us
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:34.120]  They're clearly getting ready and telling police departments that the citizens are going to attack all their departments. That's confirmed mainstream news
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:41.480]  I would agree with you paul if he weren't seeing such a massive build-up and now I said if they start staging bust of terrorist
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:44.520]  That's to introduce into the mind that it's real
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:47.960]  That I think that I think you may be wrong paul
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:51.000]  I I hope you're right, but I think you could be wrong
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:55.960]  I'm seeing signs here that they may go ahead and stage terror attacks and say iran did it
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:00.840]  But I do agree iran is 65 million not 20 million like iraq or 21 million
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:06.120]  It was 23 million, but millions are dead and and millions others have left it used to be 25 million total
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  But it's down to 20 21 million now
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  uh that
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:14.360]  That they could just do aerial bombardments, but under bush three years ago
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:20.040]  They attack plans were published to hit more than 300 sites inside iran
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:24.360]  With as much as a month-long bombardment iran has better
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:26.600]  surface to air missiles
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:29.240]  Air to air missiles. They have better anti ship missiles
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:34.600]  They've been testing these missiles that can hit israel. We know they do have powerful chemical weapons
[1:39:34.840 --> 1:39:37.400]  I would imagine they've got biological weapons and iran
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:41.160]  Historically lost a million to have people fighting saddam in the u.s.
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:45.320]  When they had primitive systems these are not Arabs and I must Arabs have a lot of courage
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:48.680]  But historically their armies aren't very well trained iranians
[1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:50.280]  uh
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:53.080]  Are up there in the military science publications
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:57.160]  I've read as some of the most dogged and suicidal fighters out there
[1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:02.280]  Uh, so, uh, I don't think the globals are going to stage any terror attacks if they hit iran
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:07.880]  Well, I don't I don't think they'll be sending troops in anytime soon because
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:14.440]  Those secret documents in relation to afghanistan say they need 500 000 more troops
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.640]  So they're just not going to have the personnel to send in there
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  But yeah, they're probably going to
[1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:23.240]  Conduct aerial bombardments just as they did with iraq so
[1:40:23.240 --> 1:40:26.920]  That's to be expected over the next few years
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:32.520]  But I don't think there'll be anything on the scale of iraq until they put a republic in it again
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:35.420]  Because they'll be able to sell it better to the neocom
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:43.640]  Cardinal your take on all this. Well, that's basically what happened under under um, a bush senior with the gulf war and then
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:47.880]  Is uh, you know with clinton clinton uh oversaw punitive
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.640]  Thanks and murderous sanctions on iran's were more than for almost a decade
[1:40:51.640 --> 1:40:58.440]  So it it could repeat that way body also launched attacks on serbia bombing their infrastructure putting in ground
[1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:03.640]  Horses in pristina here's the deal though if they take out any of these plants
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:09.080]  iran's not going to sit there. They've got sunburn missiles. They've got the high technology that he talked about
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:11.640]  They're going to respond. I don't think they're going to sit back
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  They're going to stabilize the troops in iraq
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:16.920]  And um, it'll be you know
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:25.240]  It'll it'll start those it's going to be human wave attacks like the iran iraq war the pentagon's own reports say that
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:30.760]  We've had top ci analysts retired on agreeing with that which is what the globalists want. They want to get us
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:36.520]  That's what ran corporation says into a war like world war two where we're actually in danger of losing
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:41.880]  So we'll then psychologically join with the government. They've set up the national draft boards again
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:46.440]  And and they're going to have the troops. I think this could be the start of armageddon
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:55.720]  Very well, you know what will happen if they do fight back the media will express absolute shock and indignation that they dare do anything as
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:59.000]  You know hundreds of thousands of their people being liquidated
[1:41:59.720 --> 1:42:03.720]  Well, that's just like g20. I mean we've got them coming up and hitting women in the head
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:07.080]  A woman's riding her bike at the university. They say no one's allowed on the street
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:14.440]  They hit the woman twice she gets up fights back and the media says how dare this cowardly terrorist attack our finest
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:19.320]  I mean you got guys in Darth Vader outfits wantonly rioting beating people up the police
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:24.120]  And then a woman a little woman dare push back at the police and the media
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:29.480]  Literally we could play the clip. It's like, oh my gosh. She just hit an officer. This is horrible
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:32.600]  I mean, it's this sick system where they assault you
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:37.640]  They they shock and awe you that go to youtube pull up a shock and awe them blowing those buildings up
[1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:42.120]  And then it's like, oh my god, they fired back. You're not allowed to it's al-qaeda
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:45.880]  Kurt, I mean yeah people
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:48.680]  abducted off the street
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:50.840]  And then neocons
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:57.000]  Because the infantile mind couldn't accept that america's dead basically tried to claim it was all a hoax
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:42:59.080]  And it was staged by the protesters
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:03.800]  until g20 officials came out Friday night admitted that
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:07.720]  Yeah, they abducted people off the street by unmarked cars
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:12.120]  Yeah, but see the but see the pentagon run michelle malcon who's admittedly pentagon run
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:17.480]  That's even her big sponsors. They knew it was real. It's a military tactic to just deny
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:24.600]  They will as they go. I'm not punching you. Boom. I'm not punching you and it's meant to just get you off balance for a minute
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:28.360]  They knew those were real police cars. They knew those were troops arresting people
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:33.880]  I've seen oh, I've only seen one CNN report where they admitted sound cannons. Go ahead. Kurt
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:36.440]  I was going to say in regard to
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:38.760]  The attack the possible attack on iran
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:44.840]  I think the pentagon's got a whole plan not just to take out the the nuclear facilities
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:49.800]  But take down the whole civilian and military infrastructure in that country like they did in iraq
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:56.360]  They realized that they cannot just take out a couple nuclear facilities and then sit back and see what happens
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:00.280]  And they're going to take down the whole country and and bring it back to the stone age
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:05.960]  They're going to have to well that's like Serbia anybody who becomes first world is a control by the central banks will be bombed
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:08.040]  Yeah, bomb them
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:12.440]  Have internal revolutions and if they can just knock them out and have them be all screwed up. That's good
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.800]  They don't like big listening buildings and sharp dressed people and people making money and being happy
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:20.200]  Well, the difference is is during is when
[1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:25.800]  A bush attacked iraq the country had suffered under more than a decade of of sanctions
[1:44:25.800 --> 1:44:30.600]  That killed a million iraqis and 500,000 children. So they were decimated when they attacked them
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:33.720]  Oh iran's not like that. They're you know
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:36.600]  They're ready to go
[1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:39.080]  Well, iran has said they're going to fire
[1:44:39.640 --> 1:44:45.880]  11,000 sunburned missiles at all the ships right they are and those things have got a several hundred mile range
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:51.000]  They that this that they've got a bunch of missiles to hit israel israel is going to nuke them israel is said
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:53.480]  We're going to bomb you and if you fight back, we're going to nuke you
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:58.840]  And so I guess the world's going to see israel nuking their major cities and it'll be good nuke them
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:04.040]  Israel bombs you you're not allowed to fight back. I mean, it's it's so sick. It's like it's a mic
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:09.720]  The riot police splitting heads and then no one's allowed to stand up to them. It's a microcosm of that
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:15.160]  I think during this though, israel have a benchwarming role. They won't be it involved in the attack
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:17.160]  It'll be the united states that happens at all
[1:45:18.920 --> 1:45:21.720]  I don't know israel went into iraq
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:27.080]  The thing about iran alex and their nuclear facilities is
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:34.360]  All their nuclear facilities are littered with surveillance cameras that are directly wired to the un
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:39.240]  Even if they attempt to to create bombs, which is nuclear weapons
[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:43.960]  Which is completely impossible as curt said earlier because they've only got five percent enrichment
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:47.560]  And everything they do is fed directly back into the un
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:53.160]  Well, why is pakistan allowed to have nukes given to the mother west iran doesn't
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:59.720]  These systems admittedly get nowhere near the 95 percent enrichment. I mean, it's so hypocritical and ridiculous
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:09.480]  Well, it's because like netanyahu said iran like them or not and where by no means fans of armored integer or anything like that
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:15.720]  Stand in opposition to the new world order. They're not in the club. That's what he said a few days ago at the u.n
[1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:20.200]  They're trying to overthrow the world order. That's a direct quote
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  They're not trying to overthrow anything. They're just trying to be a prosperous and peaceful and progressive nation
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:29.160]  and that that's not
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:33.400]  Acceptable in the night in the eye of the u.s. And israeli military industrial complex
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:39.080]  Just like our government has said we got to have our standard of living lowered. And so they're bankrupting us by the time
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:42.520]  Exactly
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:46.680]  Let's take some calls ted in florida. You're on the air. Thanks for holding
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:52.840]  Yeah, hey, alex. Um, listen, of course, they're going to start all these wars because i'm proud of ron paul
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:57.080]  But uh, you cannot audit that federal reserve. That's the source of this whole
[1:46:57.080 --> 1:47:02.360]  Uh apparatus and uh, he's doing a great job, but they're not going to allow that of course
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:07.000]  They're going to divert attention and start these wars and i'm with you alex. I believe that it will be
[1:47:07.720 --> 1:47:11.160]  The final world war. There's just too many things in place
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:13.800]  That fall in line with scripture for one
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:20.120]  But uh, I don't believe there's going to be any military coup like bob Chapman suggests or even my dad
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:22.600]  Who's 60 years old? I think it's more wishful thinking
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:28.360]  Um, there's there's obviously when you look at all these things that are happening whether it's uh, Pittsburgh, seattle denver
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:32.280]  There's obviously way more. Uh, I mean a majority of the
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:34.840]  military and police enjoy being thugs
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:37.800]  And it's a small minority that disagrees with it
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:45.080]  And uh, that carries on through into a government and political, uh, you're right. This is organized evil
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:47.240]  and
[1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.480]  Because the system has authority
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:52.680]  Any order will be followed just like
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:58.520]  Germans would follow orders of hitler to kill children because the furor said so
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:07.080]  And these cops if they're told to do something they will take your guns. They will kill you and uh, we better as a country have a real
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:11.560]  Talk about this because the same banks that hate iran hate this country
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:17.320]  And notice that they're going to use the united states to bring in the new world order and attack all these countries
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.280]  And then bankrupt us in the process taking out both their enemies at the same time
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:27.800]  Well, there's uh, there's something that people need to realize and that's the power they have in numbers
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:32.600]  And uh, bringing up that again to the pittsburgh and Seattle and Denver the things that go on the people
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:36.840]  I'm sorry. I'm not there physically and I have a family here in florida where i'm taking care
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:40.600]  But if there's something going on in orlando and uh, I mean, this is just me
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:43.640]  But if I see somebody uh hitting a woman arresting somebody
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:47.800]  But um all those people standing around sometimes with only three or four little thugs
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.160]  They don't understand their power and I'm sorry. I know you're not for violence. Uh, Alex
[1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:56.600]  I know you always against that you want to reach out to people first and reach as many as we can
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:02.920]  But it's going to come it's inevitable. Well, well more than that and I don't do this from a cold-blooded position
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:09.240]  Let the more images of them burning down churches beating women attacking old ladies with police dogs
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:14.440]  This is waking everybody up. The emails are flowing in the calls people are saying
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:21.240]  Why don't we stand up and and and the police are getting emboldened by the sheet that they're tearing the guts out of
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:28.200]  I don't think they realize that the sleeping giant is rising and they're taking the people's restraint as a sign of weakness
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:32.200]  It's not Pete. Why do you think gun sales are at record levels for the last year?
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:37.400]  Well, I agree and I hope that that's the case. Um, I would I am a christian myself and I'm not one of these rapture freaks
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:44.600]  Uh, revelation 210 uh itself talks about uh, Jesus brings up that many of his followers will be tortured to death
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:48.760]  Basically to test their faith. I mean if you're raptured out, how are you going to be tortured to death?
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Uh, you can read that revelation
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:55.960]  Uh, chapter two verse 10 and you can back up a second to I want to bring up another issue. Uh,
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:49:58.520]  Briefly if you could if you'd allow me got one minute go ahead
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:03.160]  Okay, back up the revelation to nine the verse just before that where it talks about the synagogue of satan
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:06.120]  uh, jesus brings up this one group of of people
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:15.640]  Um, uh, as the the main, uh, cause of of the the the tribulations that are coming and uh, I'm no, uh, uh,
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.440]  A jew basher or anything like that. Uh, but it is brought up in in two nine and three nine
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:26.120]  revelation three nine also and uh, it's it's something that people need to know
[1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:31.080]  And uh, it's it's something that people need to look into and uh, and and and learn about
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:39.320]  Uh, you got to identify the enemy and uh, if we don't address that issue, uh, things will never never be able to be defeated
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:41.480]  I've got two of the real quick things
[1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:45.000]  We're out of time. We got to go to break and we're gonna get to other callers. I appreciate your call
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:47.800]  Dennis roman annie lewis and others

[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:40.120]  um
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:43.240]  I was wondering if I could talk about two things real quick
[1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:45.240]  Go ahead
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:52.520]  Um, you know how um, they predicted 9 11 and uh, simpsons and in those movies, especially the one with samuel jackson
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:55.240]  Yes, the long kiss goodnight
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:00.120]  Yeah, yeah, there's one called the siege with a um predict martial law
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.520]  In new york
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:09.240]  Yeah, I think somebody's gonna be kidnapped actually like in that movie. I don't know what but something's gonna happen and uh
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:14.680]  That's that's what they're going to use instead of swine flu. All right. I appreciate your call curtain emo paul watson
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:17.400]  We we saw the fox news the fox show
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:22.840]  Uh, lone gunman where the government hijacks a jet to fly at the world trade center bringing martial law
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:26.760]  We are seeing all these messages of collapse of society martial law
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:31.160]  Checkpoints in the last decade and now it's all manifesting in reality
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:35.240]  Well, yeah, I look at the question of
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:37.560]  chicken and
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:39.560]  egg, I mean
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.840]  Conspiracy theory if you want to call it that
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:51.560]  Is so popular at the moment that that's the playbook that people in hollywood and tv are all going off because that's what people watch at the moment
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:55.560]  So whereas in the past when it wasn't popular or you could
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.720]  Draw parallels between things like the lone gunman, which definitely was
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:05.320]  Very suspicious now every other program is about martial law. So
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:08.520]  You know, there's not there's not much credence in it now. It's interesting, but
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:13.160]  Yeah, well, there's a massive preparation a massive preparation curtain emo
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:17.720]  Well, it's indicative when you have a a television show like like jericho on
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:22.520]  That talks about this very thing nuclear terrorism and it points back to a uh,
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:29.320]  You know a mercenary group working in the united states, you know, so yeah, it's there's done it the programming is definitely out there
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:31.640]  And um, god only knows what's going to happen
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:37.720]  Belong record the national security council runs everything now and then it's under the control of the u.n. Security council
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:43.000]  That the president is the first president to chair it in violation of article one section nine
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:49.160]  Of the constitution and they said he's now the new world order president. I mean such a throwing it in our face
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  Totally unconstitutional
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:01.720]  All the things that scare me more are the programs made by the government in in england
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:07.400]  There have been numerous programs made by the government in association with the bbc
[1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:14.280]  About mass pandemics quarantines and martial law, you know, when the government's putting about that's when we should uh
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:21.240]  Start to have suspicions about what we're being prepared for and now they've got sesame street with government messages
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:23.240]  Most the children shows
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:29.240]  Children changing the words of jesus loves the little children do obama loves the little children red yellow black and white
[1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:36.360]  They are all equal in the president's site. I mean, it's just total 1984 back in 70 seconds with a few final calls
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.600]  Then rick adam's joining us

[1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:05.080]  They found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:10.520]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases
[1:59:10.520 --> 1:59:17.720]  Now what are you going to do about it the acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:23.720]  And your family's drinking water the acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:59:23.880 --> 1:59:29.960]  And use a state-of-the-art carbon filtration reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization techniques
[1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:37.960]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe order today by calling 1 800 6 9 1 60 43

[1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:58.840]  Waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:11.000]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:19.880]  Well, so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:22.680]  alex jones
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:26.840]  The new world order is coming in like a flood all these years
[2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:30.120]  They said there was no world government being set up now. It's just admitted
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.920]  They're testing the public. They're probing taking some more phone calls here
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:40.840]  Good old paul watson and kurt nemo. We've got mike adams the health ranger coming out the next segment
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:00:43.400]  Annie in new york. You're on the air. Welcome
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:47.480]  Thank you so much alex. I'm the sister of claire the daycare teacher
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:54.280]  Who works for northeast help and we're going to that rally in albany tomorrow and has everybody's on hold
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:59.960]  I was putting out some stuff from your site, you know that the regular flu shot has h1n1 in it and some stuff from dr
[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:03.320]  Horowitz um, we should probably expect that they're going to be
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:06.120]  Feds there in one way or another shouldn't we
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:11.720]  Yeah, you're evil americans. You're not allowed to go out and say we don't want to take the force flu shot
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.800]  That obama says isn't forced though. They are forcing it on health care workers
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:20.600]  Uh, again, that's not american to go out and have free speech. How dare you?
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:24.440]  It's ridiculous. My sister is being ostracized by her boss
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:28.760]  Um, because you know, she's been taken out of the her regular classrooms
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:32.360]  And and given other duties like she's some kind of pariah
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:37.320]  And I just feel so sorry for alex. I mean, they're going to take down the web eventually
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.840]  I wish that shortwave and cp retailers would advertise on your sites because
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:49.320]  Possibly we could get your show then on shortwave, correct? Yes. I'm on shortwave
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:53.320]  All right, I wish they would advertise on your sites and lastly alex
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:02:00.680]  The camera has become mightier than the sword as evidenced by the punishment mook radarski god for making a fool of brian williams
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:05.560]  God bless each and every one of you. God bless you. We'll bring this up to mike adams in the next segment
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:07.640]  but closing out with the flu
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:10.120]  um, and
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:13.960]  With the secret police running around trying to intimidate people that speak out against it
[2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:21.880]  The flu really is the perfect cover for a takeover because it makes everybody a potential enemy and as ron paul said last thursday here on air
[2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.000]  They're setting the precedent for this medicalized tyranny
[2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:28.840]  Yeah, um
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:30.840]  The new story about that today is
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:35.880]  The uk government has come out on the down in street website and said that
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:39.800]  The swine flu vaccine will not be mandatory
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:42.600]  And yet it's as we've discussed before
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:48.840]  Well, their private plans all revolve around it being a compulsory vaccination their preparation
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:52.040]  Revolves around it being a compulsory vaccination
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:56.360]  They're making health workers take it by monday or they're fired
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:03:01.960]  So while governments are publicly saying that it won't be mandatory all their planning indicates that
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:05.240]  The large sectors of the population it will be
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:09.400]  Absolutely
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:13.960]  Kurt nemo your take on that. Well, I think that that he's right. Um, you know
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:18.680]  In this country, they're starting with the health care workers and anybody who's in the in the public
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:24.200]  Domain and trying to work down towards the general populace. I'm not sure they'll make it
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.720]  But they can force the worker the the health care enforcers to do it and the police to do it
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.240]  Then they'll make us do it. Yeah, you know, we're gonna have a hard time doing that though
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:35.240]  They've only got the next two months to do it
[2:03:35.240 --> 2:03:41.880]  Um, I think they're gonna enough people just do this property this pervasive propaganda campaign to go and get the the vaccine
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:46.760]  Um, it's gonna be difficult for them to come and tell me to get a vaccine and my neighbors
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:54.280]  Well, that's the next phase shutting down roads setting shutting down cities right making you have a bracelet or you don't get through
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:00.680]  Well, yeah, if they can if they can make this into a pandemic, you know, there's h1m one which is a total joke
[2:04:00.680 --> 2:04:09.000]  Uh, they may be able to do that. Well, regardless, they are gauging the response of the people worldwide to this for a future
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:11.800]  forced inoculation campaigns or they could go
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.120]  Hot with the program right now. We'll talk about this with mike Adams the health ranger who now lives in ecuador full time
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:20.920]  And he also writes for uh natural news
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:22.440]  So that is coming up
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:29.000]  We'll continue to watch info wars dot com and prison planet dot com for all the piercing analysis of steve watson
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:34.280]  Aaron dykes curt nemo and paul watson gentlemen. I want to thank you both for joining us today
[2:04:34.280 --> 2:04:35.880]  We need to get a story out
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:41.560]  With the with the term hoax in it dealing with iran and this being a secret facility. Good job, man
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.960]  Be careful
[2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  All right, more calls straight ahead
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:48.680]  from uh lewis chris dan tanya
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:53.960]  Mary Ann and others mike Adams the health ranger straight ahead. I'm alex jones
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:04:59.320]  The website's our info wars dot com and prison planet dot com. You can pre-order follow the republic right now
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:03.480]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:07.160]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:13.560]  Solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in toms in illinois these emergency backup systems
[2:05:13.720 --> 2:05:19.560]  Provide lifesaving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly

[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:21.400]  How much do you want? When do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:24.920]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:29.080]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:35.080]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply

[2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:47.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day call

[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:08.440]  From his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:12.200]  It's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:19.640]  A lot of americans and europeans for that matter are bugging out
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:23.640]  They're going to new zealand. They're going to the cook islands. They're going to the south pacific
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:25.960]  They're going to costa rica. They're going to ecuador
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:29.880]  You know the bushes have bought land in south america
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  hundreds of thousands of acres of it
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:38.040]  There are a lot of wealthy people here in austin a lot of wealthy business people that i've run into over the years
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:40.040]  They tell me that a lot of the big money is left
[2:08:40.680 --> 2:08:44.120]  The last three years there's been news articles about that. That's a side issue
[2:08:44.120 --> 2:08:52.280]  But mike adams the health ranger founder of naturalnews.com huge site an online news source covering all areas of personal and planetary
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:54.760]  wellness from nutrition to renewable energy
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:00.040]  And he's written thousands of articles and built a following over 800 000 people across the globe
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:07.320]  It's a lot more than that mike has also found a non-profit organization the consumer wellness center an online retail center better life goods and popular
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:09.320]  Publishing company truth publishing
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:11.160]  He now lives in ecuador
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:14.840]  And he joins us for the rest of the hour we're going to be opening the phones up on a host of issues
[2:09:15.720 --> 2:09:20.280]  But mike you've certainly put your money where your mouth is down there trying to have a real sustainability
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:25.640]  Uh, something that u.n tries to create an evil clone of why did you move to ecuador?
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:31.320]  Well, uh, by the way, thanks for having me on the show alex. It's a great honor to be with you again today
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:37.080]  But you're right sustainability and putting my money where where my mouth is uh, right now
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:41.080]  I'm living 80 off of my own food supply down here
[2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:46.040]  And more importantly i'm able to to make sure that I can stay on the air
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:51.800]  So if things happen in the u.s. With websites, I know that I can host websites in other countries
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:55.880]  And I can continue to help reach people from ecuador without being
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:01.400]  Uh, you know taken away by a u.s. Authority. So there's a lot of reasons. I'm here. Those are a couple of them
[2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:03.960]  What are you doing to keep from getting malaria?
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:10.840]  Uh, i'm not in the jungles. I'm actually in the high elevation andy to the perfect climate year-round
[2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:20.280]  Spring like weather you think you're in paradise here and it it's really just crazy good weather and non-stop food production
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:23.640]  You can feed a family of four on about half an acre here
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:28.760]  Yeah, I've talked to filmmakers like the maker of crude big film that just came out
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:30.120]  It was 25 trips
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:35.960]  I think he said down there and i've seen the videos you've shot and put on your youtube channel really good people there
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:39.240]  Uh, and so you're living in the high andes
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:44.440]  Yeah, that's right. It's uh high enough to get rid of the mosquitoes and the hot weather
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:47.560]  And like you hinted at the top of the hour there, alex
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:50.040]  There are a lot a lot of
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:55.160]  Americans and canadians and and british and australians who are coming here
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:11:01.400]  For many of the same reason they're concerned about the swine flu pandemic vaccine response
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:04.120]  They're concerned about the global currency collapse that's coming
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:08.200]  They're concerned about their freedoms and many of them are coming here. We have great neighbors here
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:11.640]  What about kidnapping? I hear ecuador has got a problem with that
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:16.920]  Up in the north area near colombia. There is a kidnapping issue
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:20.360]  But we have really good relationships with all the local people here
[2:11:20.680 --> 2:11:25.400]  You know, I speak a decent enough spanish now to get by and and we're part of the community. They
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:31.960]  You know, we're valued members of this community. We're not loners here. So, uh, I don't have any concern about that
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:34.200]  Well, yeah, that's the way it is
[2:11:34.200 --> 2:11:39.000]  I guess in central and south america the people are the salty earth. You've usually got a small criminal group feeding on them
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.760]  But uh, from just looking at places to send my family if I have to
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:47.720]  The area of ecuador you're in separate from your research does look like a pretty good area
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.440]  Tell us tell us about your facility. Then I want to get into the flu
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:56.760]  Okay, sure. Well, we we have some acreage here and we grow all kinds of food
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:11:59.720]  We have 80 different types of food and super fruits
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:03.400]  uh, 75 different trees just on our own land here
[2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:09.320]  And we grow far more than we can eat so we donate food to the local community to help people there
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:15.240]  And to help create good good relationships between myself a foreigner and the local people
[2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:22.280]  And like you said, these these are really good people and alex this society cannot collapse
[2:12:22.760 --> 2:12:29.400]  Because they already live so close to the earth. I mean they can do without water. They can do without electricity
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:34.760]  They don't have heating and cooling here because the temperature doesn't require it if the whole world falls apart
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:40.840]  There are certain places on this planet where people are going to be just almost business as usual and this is one of those places
[2:12:42.200 --> 2:12:44.760]  Amazing, um, the flu you're watching this
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:48.040]  You're actually down in the hemisphere where a lot of this cranked up
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:53.640]  Uh, we've seen the flu chart from the cdc. They say it peaks in a week and a half
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:58.440]  Very mild, but people are being forced to take the regular shot. They're being intimidated
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:01.880]  They're now starting this week with the regular h1 in one
[2:13:02.520 --> 2:13:05.960]  We've got vaccine trial deaths with other similar vaccines in europe
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:12.920]  We have the very same vaccine makers like bayer caught knowingly shipping out hiv filled shots with hepatitis
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:19.320]  No one seems to point out. Why do we trust these people that they're deploying troops in major cities everywhere?
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:25.720]  They are savagely attacking peaceful protesters and even going on university campuses saying no one's allowed outside day or night
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:29.080]  A police dog is attacking. I mean, it's it's it's
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:35.480]  Devastating mike to see this break down. You've also written some great articles the 10 lies of the flu pandemic
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:40.520]  You've broken down what's really happening with the government health care mike adams. You've got the floor
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:45.160]  All right, and and I apologize in advance if I do get disconnected
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:50.120]  I'll call right back in because I am talking to you from southern ecuador and sometimes that happens
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.120]  in any case
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:55.720]  The number one thing that I think most americans need to be aware of right now
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:01.160]  Is that even if they never got the vaccine and even if they never showed flu symptoms?
[2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:06.760]  They may already have antibodies for the swine flu. They may have already been exposed
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:09.480]  And and their immune system did its job
[2:14:09.800 --> 2:14:14.840]  You know the job that that god meant our immune system to do which is to overcome infectious disease
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:17.880]  You may be walking around right now immune
[2:14:17.880 --> 2:14:23.880]  To swine flu and yet at the same time these authorities want everybody to be injected
[2:14:24.280 --> 2:14:26.280]  Anyway, regardless of your status
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:32.840]  Regardless of what the side effects might be and without any long-term testing ever being done on any of these vaccines
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:37.880]  So this vaccine I agree with your previous guests over the last several weeks who have said
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:43.400]  This vaccine is more dangerous than the pandemic by far
[2:14:43.400 --> 2:14:49.880]  Let me just interrupt briefly. Dr. Monteef made the point from the cdc zone numbers upwards of 37 percent of americans
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:53.880]  When they get tested who are healthy already have the antibodies for the h1n1
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:15:01.560]  Meaning that it's already massively in the public and a very weak virus that so why would that and they still inoculate people
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:05.560]  Uh, who have the antibodies totally pointless
[2:15:06.520 --> 2:15:12.760]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, it comes down to this they use taxpayer dollars to buy all these vaccines
[2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:16.120]  And if they don't find a way to use them, they're going to look pretty darn stupid
[2:15:16.520 --> 2:15:19.020]  So they are going to push this pandemic
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:24.520]  Regardless of the scientific basis for it, which is really no basis for vaccination at this point
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.920]  And this is going to make sure they use up all these vaccines even if that means injecting
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:32.680]  Babies and children and and immune compromised people
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:37.240]  I mean, they're just going to use them up to justify the decision that they made to buy these vaccines
[2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:40.600]  That's that's not a medical policy. That's politics
[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:43.800]  Did you see the Reuters story two weeks ago where they said, oh
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:47.480]  Millions are going to die of heart attacks and strokes and autoimmune stuff
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:50.760]  They're going to think it's after they take the shot, but it's impossible
[2:15:51.080 --> 2:15:52.760]  The shot can't have a bad reaction
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.360]  So they're getting everybody ready for the bad reactions saying it's a conspiracy
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:16:04.040]  It doesn't exist when their own internal cdc memorandums that were released a month ago said no get ready for adverse effects
[2:16:04.920 --> 2:16:09.240]  Yeah, this is uh, I call that preemptive hypnosis of the consumers
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:11.240]  They're trying to feed people this line
[2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:16.840]  To make them ignore the side effects and and discount them as being just coincident
[2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:22.040]  But we've got a plan to do something about this. We're going to have a website out there where people can post
[2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:27.160]  The side effects that they're experiencing and we'll be announcing that within a few days
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:29.560]  So we're we're going to get some of this on the record Alex because
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:35.240]  The whole medical industry is trying to whitewash this entire thing. They have full immunity
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:39.240]  They take no responsibility and they don't value human life
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:43.800]  We'll talk about conflict of interest. I mean, they're the ones profiting from it running the genocide
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:46.040]  And then they preemptively say
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:52.440]  If you get gillian beret or you get any of these other diseases or you die or get sick. It wasn't the vaccine preemptively
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:59.320]  Right and remember this this is research that has come out of Canada just in the last two days
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:05.240]  That people who get the regular seasonal flu shot may be at an increased risk
[2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.560]  Of being harmed by this wine flu if they do get exposed to this wine flu
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:14.760]  So now we've got a case where one vaccine is worsening potentially the pandemic
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:20.760]  And and yet they're pushing both of these vaccines on everyone. Of course, I say don't take any of the vaccines
[2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.240]  Just take care of your immune system and you're going to be fine
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:27.240]  You know, it's anecdotal, but
[2:17:27.240 --> 2:17:31.240]  Neighborkids playing my yard. They all bunch of them got a shot so we can a half ago
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:37.480]  Now two of the four neighbor kids are sick in bed the last week and a half and their parents can't put two and two together
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:44.760]  It's very common Alex if you look at many of the outbreaks of infectious disease over the last several decades
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:49.720]  You'll find that that many of the people who were infected in some cases the vast majority
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.960]  Were in fact the very people who received the vaccination injection
[2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:58.680]  I've called vaccines Alex that the quackery of modern medicine
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:07.640]  This is the one thing that they cannot give up. They can't tell the truth about vaccines because so much of western medicine and pharmacology
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:13.640]  Depends on this mythology that chemical intervention is the solution to your health problems, but if not
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:16.840]  It's it's just a collection of life
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:20.680]  And we are seeing it now very clearly with this swine flu vaccine
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:25.000]  Amazing continue. We're about to go to break. But
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:32.760]  With the talk of force inoculations trying to force medical workers to do it all obama says don't worry. You don't have to take it
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:39.160]  Well, very clearly we're we're getting lots of reports from people, you know, we get thousands of emails sometimes
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:43.720]  And healthcare workers are complaining to us that they are being threatened
[2:18:43.720 --> 2:18:47.560]  They're being intimidated and they're losing their jobs now because of their refusals
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:52.680]  To get the the swine flu vaccination and this is happening all across america
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:59.960]  So it is being made mandatory in several different ways, even though they don't it. Oh, yeah, they're having big protests in new york and new jersey
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:02.520]  Tomorrow and it's now mainstream news. They're firing people
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:09.000]  Oh, yeah, they are. Yeah, they're just going to kick them right out and the thing is these nurses they know what they're talking about
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.200]  They can go to their bosses in the hospitals and they can present documentation that, you know, I'm a healthy person
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:19.880]  I have a high vitamin D levels. I don't have respiratory problems. I'm not susceptible to swine flu infection
[2:19:20.200 --> 2:19:27.000]  And and I'm healthy, but it doesn't matter. They say take the injection or take a hike. That's what they're being told right now, Alex
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:35.320]  Meanwhile the military propaganda arm is saying no one has to take it. Don't listen to the conspiracy theorist
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:38.360]  Just take the shot of your fired, but no one's making you
[2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.440]  All psych warfare
[2:19:40.440 --> 2:19:45.480]  I want to get the bottom line from Mike Adams the health ranger on what he believes is really going on here
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:51.080]  A lot of scientists are saying this is man-made. They're saying they may release something else. It's mutated. It's more deadly
[2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:56.760]  Why do we see such a massive buildup for something that looks so incredibly mild on the surface? Stay with us

[2:21:01.100 --> 2:21:03.100]  It is a big idea
[2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:06.380]  A new world order in the near future
[2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:12.060]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the builder bird
[2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:15.100]  But their objective being world domination
[2:21:15.900 --> 2:21:18.380]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[2:21:18.380 --> 2:21:26.460]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:21:29.420 --> 2:21:34.460]  For the first time in history the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[2:21:34.860 --> 2:21:38.380]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[2:21:38.700 --> 2:21:43.260]  The old verges make great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money

[2:22:06.620 --> 2:22:14.780]  Unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:17.820]  Is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit?
[2:22:17.820 --> 2:22:23.020]  We call the federal reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes
[2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:29.900]  These questions and more can be answered by reading g edward griffin's book the creature from jackall island congressman ron paul states

[2:23:05.340 --> 2:23:10.220]  Like the uncertain times we live in today. It is vital that you not alter your diet too much
[2:23:10.380 --> 2:23:15.500]  You should only store what you usually eat because one day you may have to eat only what you have stored
[2:23:15.740 --> 2:23:16.460]  Lucky for you

[2:24:12.940 --> 2:24:14.940]  Talk like an angel
[2:24:23.660 --> 2:24:26.540]  You know my gams health rangers running us from ecuador
[2:24:26.540 --> 2:24:28.540]  It's not even a devil in disguise
[2:24:28.540 --> 2:24:34.540]  I mean the history of vaccines the history of these drug makers the history of how they're involved in eugenics not 50 years ago
[2:24:34.540 --> 2:24:37.180]  I mean they were but five years ago a year ago
[2:24:37.660 --> 2:24:43.900]  How they kill us on purpose how they do this by design how we're in this scientific big pharma dictatorship
[2:24:44.860 --> 2:24:46.860]  It's just incredible
[2:24:46.860 --> 2:24:49.340]  You go over the 10 big lies of the vaccine
[2:24:49.340 --> 2:24:54.620]  But before we go into that and take calls in the next segment from your deep study of this and I really respect your
[2:24:54.620 --> 2:24:57.100]  Wide-ranging, you know view and research on this
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:02.380]  Well, and you're probably the biggest alternative media person when it comes to just alternative health
[2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:05.180]  And all the experts you talked to what?
[2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:07.740]  Is this whole flu hype really about?
[2:25:08.700 --> 2:25:14.700]  Well, thanks for asking me that question by the way because there's a lot of information that comes to me that that I really don't
[2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:20.140]  I don't I can't substantiate well enough to publish but it comes to me from several different sources
[2:25:20.140 --> 2:25:25.420]  So it starts to paint a picture for example, I had a physician visiting me here in Ecuador recently
[2:25:26.060 --> 2:25:30.300]  And this position was telling me about the training that they had just received
[2:25:30.780 --> 2:25:38.060]  Or how to handle people who were were refusing to swine flu vaccinations and this is
[2:25:38.780 --> 2:25:45.100]  Totally completely congruent with the reports we're getting from you know, certain law enforcement personnel sheriffs
[2:25:45.100 --> 2:25:50.700]  Especially who are saying that they're receiving either training or instruction on how to deal with a swine flu
[2:25:51.180 --> 2:25:52.780]  vaccine checkpoints
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:59.420]  And the so-called refused mix people who people who refuse a vaccine and that's in the level six literature globally
[2:25:59.740 --> 2:26:04.140]  And a lot of the info we were getting two three weeks ago is now being confirmed. So this is going on
[2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:08.780]  Yeah, absolutely, and I've heard it firsthand from people that I know and trust
[2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:12.540]  It's not just random bloggers emailing me things. These are people that I've known
[2:26:12.540 --> 2:26:17.980]  For many years. So something there's an undercurrent that is definitely happening now
[2:26:17.980 --> 2:26:23.980]  You can't I can't say if it's definitely if it's a if it's a plan to make these things happen
[2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:28.620]  Or if it's just a contingency plan in case these this pandemic get
[2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:32.860]  Or if it's a drill to test military and police to see if they'll do it
[2:26:33.580 --> 2:26:35.580]  Oh, yeah, exactly
[2:26:35.580 --> 2:26:39.100]  There's there's definitely an element of that going on. I think
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:43.020]  Alice, I think that these people are listening to your show. They're reading my website
[2:26:43.340 --> 2:26:48.380]  They're watching what the physicians and the nurses and the healthcare professionals actually
[2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:53.660]  Oh, no, they don't know. They've written about that fox news others have written about this show particularly
[2:26:53.980 --> 2:26:57.020]  I've seen you singled out. No, they admit they're monitoring us right now
[2:26:57.900 --> 2:27:01.820]  Oh, yeah, it's it's all part of the same the same plan to make sure that they can
[2:27:02.300 --> 2:27:06.780]  Properly manipulate the population and that's why you get into that story
[2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:13.660]  that you mentioned before the break about the preemptive hypnosis of people to discount the swine flu vaccine side effects
[2:27:14.060 --> 2:27:17.100]  But if you asked me what I what's the underlying?
[2:27:18.780 --> 2:27:28.460]  Purpose of all of this there are two that really come to mind and one is that vaccines are fantastic at creating future business
[2:27:29.020 --> 2:27:31.020]  for the pharmaceutical companies
[2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:33.020]  Because if you vaccinate everybody
[2:27:33.020 --> 2:27:37.820]  You're going to get down the road a certain percentage of people with liver problems with
[2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:45.420]  Neurological problems, especially and of course the immune system problems and this means future business for the cancer industry
[2:27:45.820 --> 2:27:51.340]  Future business for the transplant industry, which is steeped in all kinds of people doing that we can't even go into
[2:27:51.980 --> 2:27:55.420]  But you know what you see where I'm going with this Alex. This creates a lot of business
[2:27:56.380 --> 2:27:58.380]  And it's all about money
[2:27:58.380 --> 2:28:03.420]  But the second possibility here is about population control
[2:28:03.980 --> 2:28:09.820]  And if you look at the chemicals that are being put into these vaccines, you know the squalene in particular
[2:28:10.380 --> 2:28:14.380]  This is a chemical that is associated with increased infertility
[2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:19.820]  And what a what a brilliant clever evil way to cause widespread infertility
[2:28:19.820 --> 2:28:25.820]  Just get everybody to sign up for an injection and fraying and fraying and fraying
[2:28:25.820 --> 2:28:29.580]  And fraying and fraying and fraying immune systems
[2:28:30.860 --> 2:28:31.900]  Absolutely
[2:28:31.900 --> 2:28:39.100]  I I think that the medical complex in this country wants to keep people immune compromised
[2:28:39.740 --> 2:28:43.420]  And completely ignorant of medical reality
[2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:46.300]  They don't want people to know about natural cures
[2:28:46.620 --> 2:28:50.780]  For example or all the cures for cancer that exists right now all all around the world
[2:28:50.780 --> 2:28:56.220]  I've got I've got cures for cancer growing in my front yard here in Ecuador. They're all over South America
[2:28:56.620 --> 2:28:58.940]  And North Americans haven't heard of many of these
[2:28:59.500 --> 2:29:03.420]  But they exist and they're being censored and oppressed because
[2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:06.780]  The people in charge want to keep the American people ignorant
[2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:09.660]  Well, I agree with that
[2:29:09.660 --> 2:29:16.620]  It's also about reinforcing the lie that you've got to take vaccines setting the precedent that you've got to take vaccines
[2:29:16.620 --> 2:29:20.620]  Uh, it's also as you said a soft kill weapon like look at how they've increased
[2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:26.220]  The vaccinations for hepatitis then suddenly levels of hepatitis explode off the charts
[2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:30.060]  Let's come back and talk about that on the other side with mike Adams the health ranger
[2:29:30.060 --> 2:29:35.420]  I'm alex jones your phone calls as well at 1 800 25 at 99 231

[2:30:15.420 --> 2:30:20.700]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases
[2:30:20.940 --> 2:30:22.700]  Now what are you going to do about it?

[2:36:58.380 --> 2:37:02.140]  I want to go to calls but before we do that Mike again
[2:37:02.140 --> 2:37:05.740]  You've got the floor you keep pausing for me to jump in and that's a great opportunity for me
[2:37:05.740 --> 2:37:12.300]  But I'm trying to break my habit of interrupting. What is most important people should know about the regular shot and the h1n1?
[2:37:12.860 --> 2:37:18.140]  Uh, where do you see all this going and what can we do to get the word out to say no to this?
[2:37:19.820 --> 2:37:22.300]  Yeah, the most important thing people need to know right now
[2:37:22.780 --> 2:37:26.060]  Is that if they're considering a vaccine maybe they're trying to weigh
[2:37:26.060 --> 2:37:29.500]  The the potential upside and the potential downside
[2:37:29.900 --> 2:37:35.580]  They might be doing that from a point of view of believing that they have been told both sides of the story
[2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:40.220]  What they need to know is that these drug companies and merc in particular
[2:37:40.220 --> 2:37:47.660]  I just wrote an article about about merc today has a well documented history of engaging in the intimidation
[2:37:48.220 --> 2:37:53.580]  Of doctors and researchers who disagree with the safety of the company's products
[2:37:53.580 --> 2:37:57.500]  So the question that I asked in today's article in fact was
[2:37:58.140 --> 2:38:02.140]  Our doctors and researchers and health care workers being intimidated
[2:38:02.700 --> 2:38:07.740]  About speaking out against the safety of the vaccines because I think that's what's going on
[2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:13.180]  In fact, I'm sure of it Alex that people need to know that they aren't being given both sides of the story
[2:38:13.420 --> 2:38:16.060]  That these vaccines are not safe and that in fact
[2:38:16.460 --> 2:38:20.940]  They weren't even approved under a system of quote scientific medicine
[2:38:20.940 --> 2:38:28.940]  They were approved under a a a medical dogma a medical tyranny that operates in this country today under an emergency
[2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:35.820]  Under level six under level six flu pandemic emergency. They did it. Absolutely. This isn't scientific
[2:38:36.220 --> 2:38:41.580]  This vaccine isn't based on science. It's based on profits and politics and control
[2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:45.660]  It has nothing to do with medical justification period
[2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:52.780]  Mike you brought up murk interrupting here. You you brought up murk. It was in the abc news australia
[2:38:53.260 --> 2:38:59.420]  Headline murk drew up hit list of doctors with quote seek and destroy missions quote going to where they live
[2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:02.700]  And then murk said we just mean we go after them not that we kill them
[2:39:03.020 --> 2:39:06.780]  But a lot of people in the federal court said no, we believe this is hit teams. Go ahead
[2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:11.740]  Well, yeah, they use those exact terms. They said we are going to quote neutralize doctors
[2:39:11.740 --> 2:39:17.180]  There was another email from a murk employee that surfaced in this australian court case where they said quote
[2:39:17.900 --> 2:39:23.500]  We're going to go after them where they live. We're going to interfere with the funding of academic institutions
[2:39:23.500 --> 2:39:29.580]  We're going to essentially target and destroy any person or organization that speaks out against our drugs
[2:39:29.900 --> 2:39:31.500]  This is a drug company
[2:39:31.500 --> 2:39:37.500]  It was vaccines have been approved by the FDA to be injected into your babies. We think about that
[2:39:37.500 --> 2:39:44.300]  It's it and they brought us Gardasil. They brought us Gardasil. They brought us viox remind folks about that
[2:39:45.340 --> 2:39:50.060]  Yeah, well Gardasil, but it's the same story. In fact, I think the Gardasil propaganda
[2:39:50.380 --> 2:39:52.940]  Was a trial run for this pandemic propaganda
[2:39:53.260 --> 2:39:58.380]  Gardasil they've managed to get more than half of all teenage girls in america
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:06.060]  Injected with this Gardasil vaccine, which is once again medically unjustified in my view and in the view of many many other
[2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:11.260]  Well-educated medical professionals and that this vaccine has been linked with all kinds of problems with
[2:40:12.140 --> 2:40:15.020]  People passing out with deaths deaths have been linked with this
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:17.500]  Neurological problems have been linked with it
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:23.100]  But it's the same story as with the swine flu vaccine. They say couldn't be us couldn't be the vaccine
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:28.700]  Don't blame us. It must be something else. It's it's always this disavowing of responsibility
[2:40:28.700 --> 2:40:34.700]  Well, these are new type of genetically engineered uh hybrid viruses
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:39.500]  They admitted in their own insert during the trials three years ago as you know, but recapping for people
[2:40:40.300 --> 2:40:46.060]  That it was causing autoimmune disorders that there were deaths linked to it in the trials. Now the deaths are mounting
[2:40:46.700 --> 2:40:52.140]  Uh and healthy 13 14 year old girls take it and their lives are over. They die. They get paralyzed
[2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:56.700]  And we know that merc went to governor rick perry to get him to quote make it mandatory
[2:40:56.700 --> 2:41:04.140]  Or on the list of mandatory shots to be in school so that vaccine damage fund federally would kick in this is one
[2:41:04.780 --> 2:41:06.540]  cold-blooded
[2:41:06.540 --> 2:41:08.540]  plan that they're engaged in
[2:41:08.860 --> 2:41:12.860]  This is a very powerful corporation with a lot of strong political ties
[2:41:13.260 --> 2:41:18.060]  Including with governor rick perry there in texas, but many other ties at the national level
[2:41:18.060 --> 2:41:24.780]  I mean this this this company rules the medical world and my concern with that alex is that they're doing so
[2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:28.700]  Purely based on profit and politics and not based on science
[2:41:29.020 --> 2:41:34.380]  I mean the the scientific method has been thrown out the window when it comes to these vaccines
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:41.180]  Yeah, this whole germ theory has been turned on its head and and used exploited as a way to
[2:41:41.980 --> 2:41:47.500]  dominate the the health beliefs of the american citizens now people
[2:41:47.900 --> 2:41:52.700]  People don't realize that they need to take responsibility for their own health. They need to eat better
[2:41:52.700 --> 2:41:57.100]  They need to get some sunshine and vitamin d. They need to you know stop
[2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:01.660]  Using so many chemicals in personal care products if they do those things
[2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:06.860]  They're going to be well protected against this pandemic or or any pandemic really
[2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:12.700]  But absolutely the medical system wants chemical intervention, but that's what they keep driving at
[2:42:13.020 --> 2:42:17.660]  Well now the medical system is telling doctors don't tell people there's any protection
[2:42:17.660 --> 2:42:23.020]  But tamaflu or h1n1 shot don't tell people you need natural vitamin d from the sun
[2:42:23.420 --> 2:42:27.820]  30 minutes of sun every few days direct sun don't tell people vitamin c
[2:42:28.300 --> 2:42:32.700]  Don't tell people fish oil. Don't tell people colloidal silver compounds
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:37.500]  Even though the studies show it's excellent. They're saying you're now not allowed to tell people
[2:42:38.620 --> 2:42:42.620]  Well, exactly. This is the enforced health illiteracy
[2:42:42.620 --> 2:42:47.340]  Of the american people. I mean it really I almost hate to invoke this imagery
[2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:54.460]  But it goes back to the enslavement of people in america and how do you keep people enslaved is you keep them illiterate
[2:42:54.700 --> 2:42:56.300]  And that's what the FDA is doing
[2:42:56.300 --> 2:43:02.940]  That's what the ftc is doing with the way that they attack and go after these companies that try to tell the truth
[2:43:03.180 --> 2:43:08.860]  Online about the benefits of their herbal products or their nutritional products or their superfoods
[2:43:08.860 --> 2:43:14.060]  They are being attacked intimidated arrested. They're having their inventory confiscated
[2:43:14.460 --> 2:43:18.140]  I had I had one of these guys a founder of one of these companies visited me
[2:43:18.700 --> 2:43:22.620]  In ecuador the things he told me i'm i was thought he came out
[2:43:22.860 --> 2:43:25.340]  He was being oppressed in nazi germany
[2:43:25.500 --> 2:43:28.540]  But no he came from the united states of america
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:36.220]  Barely got out of the country with his life with his freedom and now he refuses to go back because he's selling natural products
[2:43:36.220 --> 2:43:42.220]  Well, the people perish right now the people perish for lack of knowledge and certainly there's a lot of quacks out there
[2:43:42.220 --> 2:43:45.100]  But there's more quackery in the in the in the major
[2:43:45.660 --> 2:43:51.900]  md medical system and the drug companies taking over medicine even getting rid of classical western medicine and bringing in this
[2:43:52.220 --> 2:43:54.220]  pharmacia medicine
[2:43:54.860 --> 2:43:57.020]  but uh
[2:43:57.020 --> 2:44:02.540]  I've talked a lot of other medical doctors and they say that the tyranny is really expanding when you can't tell people
[2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:07.500]  Get lots of rest and sunshine when when the cdc says only drugs
[2:44:08.540 --> 2:44:10.540]  only shots
[2:44:10.940 --> 2:44:12.940]  It's just such a crime
[2:44:13.340 --> 2:44:18.860]  Yeah, and there are very few companies and individuals are willing to to stand up to the ftc
[2:44:19.100 --> 2:44:21.420]  There's one company. It's it's actually
[2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:26.380]  A church organization daniel chapter one and i've written about them extensively
[2:44:26.780 --> 2:44:30.540]  And i know you've spoken with them but they are standing up to the ftc
[2:44:30.540 --> 2:44:35.100]  And telling the bluff of these these federal tyrants that are trying to censor
[2:44:35.740 --> 2:44:37.980]  This information and keep the american people
[2:44:38.300 --> 2:44:41.660]  Uninformed about natural health so daniel chapter one could be
[2:44:42.140 --> 2:44:47.980]  You know the david that stands up to the goliath in washington, so we're watching that situation very carefully
[2:44:49.420 --> 2:44:54.220]  Absolutely, i want to take some phone calls now any other key points you haven't added sir
[2:44:55.340 --> 2:44:59.500]  Uh, no, let's go right to the call then and we'll handle any questions that you'd like
[2:44:59.500 --> 2:45:03.580]  Yeah, they'll be all over the map. Uh, lewis in texas. You're on the air go ahead
[2:45:04.460 --> 2:45:06.460]  Hey, can you hear me good? Yes, i can
[2:45:07.500 --> 2:45:13.740]  Uh, yeah, i got uh three quick points on a question for the doctor. Um, he's not a doctor. He's a he's a health researcher
[2:45:14.620 --> 2:45:16.860]  Oh, okay. Yeah, right. Well, uh
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:22.620]  You know i was alive during the vietnam war and a good portion of the, uh
[2:45:23.580 --> 2:45:25.580]  resistance came from the university
[2:45:25.580 --> 2:45:30.140]  And i mean this thing that we witnessed over here at the g20. I mean i don't
[2:45:30.940 --> 2:45:32.940]  Pop anybody's cork, you know
[2:45:33.100 --> 2:45:38.780]  Yeah, a lot of people are a lot of people are saying how do we let the police come up and and and even go into dorms
[2:45:39.260 --> 2:45:45.740]  And attack people and and and shoot kids on their front porches playing ball or in their front yards with sound cannons
[2:45:46.460 --> 2:45:48.460]  Uh, this is just outrageous. Go ahead
[2:45:48.460 --> 2:45:56.780]  Well, i'll tell you i'll tell you uh, what i'm calling for is the nationwide even worldwide demonstrations on all the college campuses
[2:45:57.580 --> 2:46:02.460]  You know against this new world order against, you know, especially here, you know against the priest, you know
[2:46:02.460 --> 2:46:04.940]  They're trying to give us these free speech zones and all this stuff
[2:46:05.660 --> 2:46:09.180]  I mean, uh, you don't want to get out there and get yourself killed like Kent state
[2:46:09.180 --> 2:46:13.180]  But i mean, you know, i mean there's things that we can do, you know, we got to stand up
[2:46:13.180 --> 2:46:19.660]  I mean these students i mean if i was a student in another university i saw what they did to those guys over at pittsburgh there
[2:46:20.140 --> 2:46:24.060]  I'd be like man, you know, how fast can i get in these people's faces, you know
[2:46:24.300 --> 2:46:31.180]  We'll see what's happening is if they set the precedent to be able to beat people up use police dogs on old women in neighborhoods
[2:46:31.580 --> 2:46:34.300]  Then they can chill free speech and that's what this is all about
[2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:37.260]  Telling people if you protest you'll be put on a terror list
[2:46:37.580 --> 2:46:40.540]  They are the terrorists the secret police terrorists doing that
[2:46:40.540 --> 2:46:46.940]  And and because they know that the changes to the dollar the changes to our way of life the tyranny people are going to rebel
[2:46:47.180 --> 2:46:51.900]  So they're trying to cow us and make us submit right now. These are psyops
[2:46:52.540 --> 2:46:58.460]  But but more importantly than just protesting and i think that's important is calling into talk radio starting websites starting
[2:46:58.540 --> 2:47:04.140]  Firing campaigns because they can't stop you coming out of the middle of nowhere putting up flyers with different issues
[2:47:04.220 --> 2:47:06.220]  That's what our joker poster contest was about
[2:47:06.220 --> 2:47:11.020]  And i'm gonna announce the new the contest tomorrow. I promise the limits when i've just been so far behind got behind with
[2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:13.020]  Fall the republic but i'm gonna do that tomorrow
[2:47:13.660 --> 2:47:19.740]  The issue here is that we've done this to show people the power of just getting active. I appreciate your call
[2:47:20.300 --> 2:47:22.300]  What are other things we can do?
[2:47:22.540 --> 2:47:30.060]  rick uh mic adams in your point to really rattle the cage of the establishment and have the people's voice be heard or
[2:47:30.060 --> 2:47:35.340]  Or or do you see my point about what will happen if we just let this chilling effect take place?
[2:47:36.220 --> 2:47:41.660]  Oh, absolutely the the ruling class right now is ruling by fear and intimidation and
[2:47:42.220 --> 2:47:46.380]  What you know more and more people are waking up. I want to point this out about the vaccine
[2:47:46.780 --> 2:47:50.780]  You know a recent poll showed that 60 percent of parents are
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:54.940]  Refusing to give their children the vaccine. That's a huge statistic
[2:47:54.940 --> 2:48:01.260]  Alex that means that people like you and I are are winning this information campaign that against all the
[2:48:01.740 --> 2:48:05.340]  The multimillion dollars worth of public relations and advertising
[2:48:05.740 --> 2:48:12.060]  And and promotional pushes by the drug companies more than half of the parents still won't vaccinate their children against twilight
[2:48:12.460 --> 2:48:18.060]  That's a victory and we need more victories like that because the truth will prevail here
[2:48:18.380 --> 2:48:21.020]  All we got to do is keep on getting the truth out there
[2:48:21.020 --> 2:48:25.180]  Help to awaken other people around us turn them on to the truth
[2:48:25.660 --> 2:48:32.380]  And we we will ultimately be victorious in this I believe but it's it's going to be a difficult process and by the way
[2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:38.220]  Now is the time as the tyranny comes in as everything we talked about beforehand unfolds
[2:48:38.540 --> 2:48:40.540]  We have amazing credibility right now
[2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:45.500]  We've got to reach out to everybody and speak out now because we can wake people up 10 years ago
[2:48:45.500 --> 2:48:50.300]  But not in these numbers people are ready to hear the truth the establishment there
[2:48:50.300 --> 2:48:56.220]  Is they're trying to lead them around into more tyranny right now? We've got to be there to say no there's an alternative
[2:48:57.180 --> 2:49:00.940]  But that's exactly right, you know the american people are smart people
[2:49:00.940 --> 2:49:07.020]  They can figure it out if they have access to the right information now the people in power are trying to keep
[2:49:07.820 --> 2:49:09.820]  the americans blind but
[2:49:10.060 --> 2:49:15.900]  Fortunately websites like yours prison planet many others out there and the information that you are getting out there
[2:49:15.900 --> 2:49:22.780]  This is working. So keep up keep doing a thank thank goodness for what you're doing there Alex
[2:49:23.900 --> 2:49:28.380]  Well, we're gonna go to bright and come back and take some final calls. Thank god for what you're doing your sites are
[2:49:29.260 --> 2:49:31.660]  Rivaling ours in size which excites me
[2:49:32.220 --> 2:49:36.140]  So many other people and alternative media think we're competing with each other
[2:49:36.220 --> 2:49:41.340]  My show has been successful because I bring the little guys on the big guys everybody in between
[2:49:41.340 --> 2:49:48.620]  I just want freedom for my family. I understand I'm in a race against the globalist and I'm not doing this for fame or fortune
[2:49:49.020 --> 2:49:55.260]  We certainly try to fund ourselves and be comfortable and and have some assets so we can defend ourselves if something comes up
[2:49:55.820 --> 2:50:01.660]  We need to be strong and powerful. So we're trying to become strong and powerful and challenge the system
[2:50:02.460 --> 2:50:08.700]  That's why I've noticed cia and an fbi funded and it's come out with some of these grips that they are fbi funded
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:14.140]  They try to create racial division try to make the liberty movement be about race or religion
[2:50:14.300 --> 2:50:17.500]  They try to divide us. They constantly fight with each other
[2:50:18.220 --> 2:50:23.500]  They do this not just out of jealousy or greed, but really to divide us. That's why they attack ron paul
[2:50:23.500 --> 2:50:28.380]  That's why they attack me. That's why they attack you the the establishment knows they're discredited
[2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:31.660]  They can't attack us from their high purchase. They have to attack us from
[2:50:32.300 --> 2:50:34.460]  renomab false grass roots
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:39.820]  And that's because we're effective and it's scaring the system. So I take those attacks as a blessing
[2:50:41.900 --> 2:50:47.020]  Yep, I have well said alex keep let's keep up the good work here. Are you going to break right now?

[2:53:22.060 --> 2:53:25.420]  But the attacks of 7 7 in london were carried out by british intelligence

[2:54:05.420 --> 2:54:11.340]  I was just talking to my guys during the break the fbi has reissued a report they put out seven years ago
[2:54:11.820 --> 2:54:15.180]  Saying cell phones former farmers almanac
[2:54:16.060 --> 2:54:22.300]  Maps are all signed. You're a terrorist go ahead of the police pull you over go ahead and put you in a terror database for life
[2:54:22.380 --> 2:54:24.860]  No firearms. No liberty. No due process. I mean
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:32.060]  Mike adams is that not the ultimate tyranny where they just put you on secret lists for no reason and what two years ago
[2:54:32.860 --> 2:54:40.140]  One of the head federal marshals in denver went public and said we have a quota of innocent people to put on terror lists for life
[2:54:41.100 --> 2:54:44.860]  And and and they put a million two hundred thousand americans on it. We know of
[2:54:45.420 --> 2:54:47.580]  Since a year ago when they made the list secret
[2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:55.180]  Yeah, this is this is one of the the processes of tyranny is putting people on these secret lists outside of the normal
[2:54:55.900 --> 2:54:57.500]  process of
[2:54:57.500 --> 2:54:59.420]  Of law right a new process
[2:54:59.420 --> 2:55:05.580]  I mean this is the way to circumvent the constitution and they are really clever at this they're really good at this
[2:55:05.980 --> 2:55:08.780]  And I think it's going to get a lot worse alex before it gets better
[2:55:09.100 --> 2:55:16.060]  We something has to to happen here the american people have got to to rally again and to stand up for their freedoms
[2:55:16.060 --> 2:55:20.540]  And their rights and to protect the u.s. Constitution, which I thought was a valid document
[2:55:20.540 --> 2:55:25.820]  You know when I was growing up in school and I was being taught american history. Gee, I thought that thing still applied
[2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:29.260]  Only as an adult do you learn that it's been circumvented?
[2:55:29.900 --> 2:55:31.900]  Well, I don't think
[2:55:31.900 --> 2:55:37.100]  People realize the process of tyranny once an elite decides to be ruthless and go all the way
[2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:44.060]  And they believe human life is not just a cheap but a negative once they make that decision the sky's the limit
[2:55:44.060 --> 2:55:49.260]  And it's now the sky is the limit. We're going to keep you another 20 minutes and take calls. We appreciate you joining us
[2:55:49.500 --> 2:55:52.940]  Talk to chris tanya mary and d bob and others
[2:55:53.500 --> 2:55:55.500]  But it sounded like when I mentioned
[2:55:55.820 --> 2:56:00.460]  The concerted attacks that are clearly funded against anybody exposing the corruption
[2:56:00.860 --> 2:56:06.780]  Ron paul in making people take flu shots Ron paul in raising people's taxes. You're not making people take flu shots
[2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:12.860]  You're not sending SWAT teams to people's homes, but all this alternative media attacks anybody who's real
[2:56:12.860 --> 2:56:17.660]  I notice we all get attacked by these concerted operations mainstream and alternative
[2:56:18.460 --> 2:56:21.820]  And as much as I'd like to believe it's just jealous people more and more it's being proven
[2:56:21.820 --> 2:56:28.140]  It's government and that's their counter is to try to throw up such a screen of arguing and fighting and infighting
[2:56:28.540 --> 2:56:30.540]  That nobody can ever get together
[2:56:30.780 --> 2:56:36.460]  And I think when you see somebody being attacked and lied about that's the seal that they're good and can be trusted
[2:56:37.500 --> 2:56:38.860]  Well, there's no question
[2:56:38.860 --> 2:56:44.540]  Well, there's no question we we've been subjected to attacks that were organized and funded by we think
[2:56:45.100 --> 2:56:46.620]  pharmaceutical companies or
[2:56:46.620 --> 2:56:49.500]  Or their front companies and this has just been going on for years
[2:56:49.580 --> 2:56:56.540]  We you know we hardly even really talk about it anymore. It's just a routine part of being a publisher of true information
[2:56:56.860 --> 2:57:00.140]  I mean, you know the only way to not be harassed in our
[2:57:00.700 --> 2:57:05.100]  Our system today is to lie on behalf of the corporation
[2:57:05.100 --> 2:57:10.060]  If you if you go out and you say nice happy things about the drug company
[2:57:10.300 --> 2:57:16.700]  And about the oil companies and about all the politicians who are lying to us and spending us into a complete bankruptcy
[2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:22.140]  If you say happy things about those people, you'll be left alone. You won't be harassed by anybody
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:27.900]  It's only when you go out and start asking questions like like what ron paul does every single day
[2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:32.300]  You know ron paul is being attacked precisely because he is effective
[2:57:32.300 --> 2:57:35.260]  And that's the same reason that you and I are being attacked alex
[2:57:35.660 --> 2:57:38.860]  Well, and also it's a military tactic whenever they deny
[2:57:39.420 --> 2:57:44.860]  They're trying to forcibly inoculate nurses and they are or they lie and say there's no plan to get rid of the dollar
[2:57:44.940 --> 2:57:46.940]  As they openly have debates about doing it
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:53.180]  It's a denial so that we just debate whether it exists or not instead of having a real debate about whether we wanted or not
[2:57:53.420 --> 2:57:55.180]  Or if it's legal or lawful
[2:57:55.180 --> 2:58:00.380]  And it's the same thing by making it about alex jones being bad or ron paul being bad or mike adam's being bad
[2:58:00.380 --> 2:58:05.980]  Or dr. Stan monteef being bad then even our defenders spend their time defending us
[2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:11.740]  Instead of going out and warning new people. So that's why I always tell my listeners. Don't defend me
[2:58:12.540 --> 2:58:17.020]  Go out and reach new people and warn them about fluoride in the water warn them about jingamow food
[2:58:17.420 --> 2:58:21.580]  warn them about vaccines warn them about the attack on iran and lying about
[2:58:22.540 --> 2:58:27.260]  Their processing centers for uranium and how that's a hoax do not defend me
[2:58:27.260 --> 2:58:29.980]  My family doesn't get saved if you defend me
[2:58:30.860 --> 2:58:36.620]  Wake everybody up spend your time doing that and then all of us can be saved from this tyranny back in one minute

[3:00:40.620 --> 3:00:42.620]  Hey, how you guys doing today good
[3:00:43.420 --> 3:00:50.940]  Okay, um, I don't know if you guys got this but I have a document from the federal government today called off of google
[3:00:50.940 --> 3:00:55.900]  It is the international swine flu conference. They had a month ago. Yeah, we covered it
[3:00:55.900 --> 3:00:59.100]  We we originally broke that and we had reporters
[3:00:59.980 --> 3:01:02.700]  Who were there on the show like Wayne madson?
[3:01:02.700 --> 3:01:08.860]  But that that was a force quarantines how to deal with dead bodies lockdowns of cities mike Adams you want to comment on that?
[3:01:09.980 --> 3:01:16.300]  Uh, no, you're exactly right. Uh, that was a very important piece of breaking news that wasn't supposed to break that was supposed to be kept
[3:01:16.300 --> 3:01:21.100]  You know, uh behind the curtain, but it was exposed, but you ever notice now
[3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:26.300]  Caller notice that when you tell people about that they look at they look at you like you're crazy
[3:01:26.300 --> 3:01:28.620]  They don't believe it's real. Have you experienced that?
[3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:33.340]  Oh man people I have my own family calling me a nut job or
[3:01:33.740 --> 3:01:37.900]  Or one of these people that are getting too into it that i'm going to go nuts and i'm like, hey
[3:01:37.900 --> 3:01:40.140]  I'm just trying to find out what's going on around me
[3:01:40.140 --> 3:01:47.660]  Exactly. Well, that's because they know they should be going nuts about this tyranny and they know things are out of control
[3:01:48.060 --> 3:01:51.020]  And so they're telling you what they're afraid of about themselves
[3:01:51.740 --> 3:01:59.820]  I'm sorry. Go ahead one last. Uh, well one couple things. Uh, they had 15 sessions and one of them here in the breakout session one
[3:02:00.460 --> 3:02:03.020]  One of their bullets is conducting morgue operations
[3:02:03.020 --> 3:02:06.380]  So they were obviously planning on mass casualties and mass deaths
[3:02:06.380 --> 3:02:12.300]  No, no, they've got quarantines lockdowns forced inoculations in there. Mike Adams. Yeah, your comments on that document
[3:02:13.100 --> 3:02:19.260]  Well, when I read that document, you know what the first thing that came to my mind was is that the ultimate plan for healthcare reform
[3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:24.540]  Is to reduce the population by 80 percent because then healthcare becomes affordable
[3:02:25.020 --> 3:02:28.700]  Did you see the cover of newsweek or where it said the case for killing granny?
[3:02:29.820 --> 3:02:34.700]  No, no, I haven't seen that one. In fact, if I guys pull up the newsweek cover the case for killing granny
[3:02:34.700 --> 3:02:37.020]  I can't find the actual article the actual
[3:02:37.660 --> 3:02:39.420]  keep going Mike
[3:02:39.420 --> 3:02:40.460]  well
[3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:42.460]  Again, if you if you
[3:02:42.460 --> 3:02:46.540]  This country is growing going broke treating sickness and disease
[3:02:47.020 --> 3:02:52.060]  And at some point it's not unreasonable to think that somebody at high levels would say, you know what?
[3:02:52.220 --> 3:02:57.660]  The only way we can afford healthcare in this country is if we have fewer people to care for
[3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:01.420]  and my goodness that that that whole uh
[3:03:01.420 --> 3:03:07.900]  Uh session that went on there training for body bags and training for quarantines and training for mass deaths
[3:03:08.300 --> 3:03:10.940]  I mean that that was some really concerning stuff
[3:03:11.420 --> 3:03:16.860]  Uh, you know, it should get you thinking hard about what's really being planned for the near future
[3:03:16.860 --> 3:03:19.020]  I agree, but but but I mean see their psych war for a program
[3:03:19.020 --> 3:03:24.300]  They come out in the bill is healthcare rationing in the bill the guy that wrote it tom dashill writes a book
[3:03:24.620 --> 3:03:28.620]  Saying yeah, if you're above 60 need eye surgery, you're not going to get it. They do ration it in europe
[3:03:28.620 --> 3:03:33.980]  Uh, but there's no mention of that then simultaneously. They have all these news articles
[3:03:34.540 --> 3:03:39.980]  Saying there's too many people. We've got to reduce world population having kids as bad for your carbon footprint
[3:03:40.140 --> 3:03:43.420]  And by the way, we need to kill granny the case for killing granny
[3:03:43.740 --> 3:03:47.020]  There's the newsweek headline online from newsweek
[3:03:47.500 --> 3:03:50.540]  Uh, and then they sit there and say we're going to kill you
[3:03:50.780 --> 3:03:55.660]  But then it doesn't exist and then your neighbor even if you show your neighbor newsweek they go you're insane
[3:03:55.660 --> 3:03:57.660]  That's a fake newsweek
[3:03:57.660 --> 3:03:59.660]  No, I'm not kidding
[3:03:59.900 --> 3:04:01.900]  You know this healthcare reform debate right now
[3:04:02.220 --> 3:04:05.100]  Is completely congruent with these kinds of of evil
[3:04:05.820 --> 3:04:06.860]  philosophies
[3:04:06.860 --> 3:04:11.820]  You know, it's it's absolutely true now that if this healthcare reform bill gets passed
[3:04:12.140 --> 3:04:16.300]  And if you don't agree to sign up for healthcare insurance and pay what is it?
[3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:20.940]  $1,900 a year or so for an individual or $13,000 for a family
[3:04:20.940 --> 3:04:27.820]  They will be able to arrest you imprison you for one year and the irs can find you $25,000. I mean
[3:04:28.780 --> 3:04:32.220]  Hold on. Hold on. I'm sorry. Mike. I'm sorry. Mike. We have breaking news
[3:04:32.220 --> 3:04:37.100]  I'm going to cover this with you when we come back. I'd always comes out in hindsight. I look at this video
[3:04:37.100 --> 3:04:45.420]  They're definitely cops age of provocateurs documented at g20 during march info wars.com exclusive article with the video
[3:04:45.820 --> 3:04:49.580]  Right now you can look at them. They're clearly police officers huge guys
[3:04:49.580 --> 3:04:51.580]  I've seen this over and over again
[3:04:52.220 --> 3:04:57.820]  Uh, they oh my god. Oh my god. That's why they attack luke. They didn't like it that he was exposing them
[3:04:58.460 --> 3:05:00.860]  Man, these people are evil. We'll be right back. Stay there, Mike

[3:08:04.540 --> 3:08:07.500]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[3:08:10.060 --> 3:08:16.540]  Ladies and gentlemen the video is flooding in as people have a chance to analyze it. We're analyzing ours finding similar things
[3:08:17.420 --> 3:08:23.340]  You know, I have a limited crew. They just got back Saturday. We've already posted a lot of videos. This video is from another activist
[3:08:23.340 --> 3:08:30.060]  Clearly police officers breaking people's cameras trying to stir up trouble. I can't play the audio because there's so much cussing
[3:08:30.620 --> 3:08:32.620]  But these are just two of the three
[3:08:33.180 --> 3:08:38.780]  And big huge cops they put their biggest cops in to pose as anarchists and we're going to try to match this up with other
[3:08:38.780 --> 3:08:40.780]  video of big scrapping guys
[3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:46.940]  Who will throw stuff at police so the police have a pretext to then fire and attack the general crowd
[3:08:46.940 --> 3:08:51.900]  And uh, I remember
[3:08:53.260 --> 3:08:55.260]  Pardon me
[3:08:55.420 --> 3:08:59.420]  Yeah, breaking breaking demonstrators cameras. Absolutely. That's that's in the video
[3:08:59.900 --> 3:09:02.700]  We can't play it because there's so much cussing but look at these cops
[3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:05.740]  I mean look at these guys now. We caught them in Denver
[3:09:07.180 --> 3:09:11.580]  Last year mainstream news Denver post had lined police caught attacking their own police
[3:09:11.580 --> 3:09:18.300]  We caught them in Canada at the spp meeting last year. They were caught by the bbc admitted it in England
[3:09:18.380 --> 3:09:20.380]  And they killed a guy beating to death
[3:09:20.940 --> 3:09:24.300]  These guys need to be criminally charged. We need to find out who they are
[3:09:24.700 --> 3:09:29.740]  But it's I mean they put these big giant cops in Mike Adams your comment on agent provocateurs
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:36.300]  This is a preview of things to come Alex and great work on your pardon and the contributors who are sending this in
[3:09:36.380 --> 3:09:38.380]  I can't wait to look at this myself
[3:09:38.380 --> 3:09:42.220]  But this is this is what's going to be happening in more cities across the u.s
[3:09:42.700 --> 3:09:49.020]  And this is a test to see how people react to see whether they can they can do this covertly and be exposed
[3:09:49.340 --> 3:09:55.340]  So the fact that you are exposing them is probably going to help save lives down the road because it's going to help
[3:09:55.500 --> 3:09:57.660]  suppress that kind of tactic from being used
[3:09:58.140 --> 3:10:00.140]  Excessively, I mean they're going to try it anyway
[3:10:00.380 --> 3:10:06.540]  But the thing is we keep exposing them and other people do and then the royal mount of police admitted the denver police admitted
[3:10:06.540 --> 3:10:12.940]  And no one gets in trouble. That's why lueber delis key was there and rob do where there were others saying don't be violent
[3:10:13.100 --> 3:10:15.900]  You'll have a couple thousand people or in this case a couple hundred
[3:10:16.060 --> 3:10:18.380]  You'll have 15 people led by cops
[3:10:18.780 --> 3:10:23.980]  They'll yell and scream and tell luke shut up when he calls out against violence and then it's cops
[3:10:24.300 --> 3:10:26.460]  I mean how evil are these police?
[3:10:27.420 --> 3:10:33.580]  What we've got to do is get some long range cameras going from people who are away from the immediate fray
[3:10:33.580 --> 3:10:39.100]  And who are not in the fight. It's a long way away. That happened in greece this year in fact pull up
[3:10:39.580 --> 3:10:41.580]  Greek tv and meet agent provocateurs
[3:10:42.220 --> 3:10:49.980]  Uniform police directing regular cops busting out windows at another global meeting to then blame it on the general protesters
[3:10:49.980 --> 3:10:52.700]  Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, you're exactly right
[3:10:52.700 --> 3:10:58.380]  I mean this this is like a local law enforcement false flag operation and they're gonna keep doing it for as long as they can get away with it
[3:10:58.380 --> 3:11:05.020]  But in the video that you're seeing right now alex can you can you make out the faces very clearly of those responsible?
[3:11:05.340 --> 3:11:08.140]  No, they're wearing masks, but it's big strapping cops
[3:11:08.940 --> 3:11:13.100]  Uh, I mean they stick out like a sore thumb. It's always the same. I mean it's big guys
[3:11:13.580 --> 3:11:15.580]  230 240 pounds
[3:11:15.980 --> 3:11:20.300]  they always dress the same ball caps and and their face covered and uh
[3:11:21.100 --> 3:11:25.340]  They're breaking people's cameras. They're starting fights. They're just absolute scum
[3:11:25.340 --> 3:11:31.100]  Well, Pittsburgh has been turned into a police state. I mean the city is it was a fortress
[3:11:31.660 --> 3:11:36.780]  And this is a sign of things to come. Uh, this is important breaking news. So go ahead and roll with it alex
[3:11:36.780 --> 3:11:39.820]  I'll no, no, no, no, no, no. We're talking flu. That's more important
[3:11:40.060 --> 3:11:44.060]  Just i'm gonna cover this with paul watson briefly after you leave get him to do a big report on it
[3:11:44.300 --> 3:11:48.700]  Because it's not enough to just show this i'm gonna get him to show the denver stuff and everything else so people forget
[3:11:49.100 --> 3:11:53.740]  So we want to remind him uh tanya in georgia. You're on the air with mike adams. Go ahead
[3:11:53.740 --> 3:12:00.300]  Uh, hi alex mike. Um, I just want to let you know that I have an insert from my local walgreens
[3:12:00.380 --> 3:12:08.380]  It's from the nevartis vaccine for the regular seasonal flu. It says 2009 2010 formula and um, right in this document
[3:12:08.460 --> 3:12:10.460]  It says it is um
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:18.700]  That flu run has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility
[3:12:18.700 --> 3:12:23.340]  So alex you've been saying all along that they're putting sterilence in it and it says right here
[3:12:23.500 --> 3:12:26.380]  Yeah, we are this can make you fertile. Oh, yeah, look, look
[3:12:26.460 --> 3:12:32.300]  I mean, it's come out with the ied's and the vaccines and they always know they design it and they now now explain
[3:12:32.380 --> 3:12:34.620]  What the flu run is and this ender lukin
[3:12:35.100 --> 3:12:37.660]  Two that they're adding mike adams, but ma'am
[3:12:38.140 --> 3:12:42.300]  I need to go to walgreens every time I pull up an internet site. It's walgreens ads for the flu
[3:12:42.620 --> 3:12:46.620]  I need to get their insert, but will you scan that and email it?
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:51.820]  Uh to uh writers at info wars dot com or we'll put you on hold and give you a secret email
[3:12:51.980 --> 3:12:54.620]  Will you scan that and send it to us? Um, yeah
[3:12:54.860 --> 3:12:58.300]  I'd refer to facts that that's fine and there's a lot of other information in here, too
[3:12:58.300 --> 3:13:01.980]  They say they've been putting h1 in h1 n1 in the vaccine since
[3:13:02.940 --> 3:13:07.660]  1977 and they have a long list of side effects that have been reported. This is a very informative
[3:13:07.820 --> 3:13:10.860]  Okay, read it to us read it to us because I knew all this was in there
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:15.740]  And I guess I haven't thought big genius because i'm not took it to go out and get the insert
[3:13:15.740 --> 3:13:21.740]  I mean they admit in their literature online. They're doing this, but mike were you aware of those those statements on the norvitas?
[3:13:22.380 --> 3:13:24.140]  uh statement
[3:13:24.140 --> 3:13:27.580]  Yeah, absolutely. Those remember those the ones that are required by federal law
[3:13:27.660 --> 3:13:31.580]  There are there's a lot of information that's not required that they're withholding
[3:13:31.740 --> 3:13:34.700]  So as she reads the list keep in mind of what you're not hearing, too
[3:13:35.500 --> 3:13:37.660]  Yeah, thanks for holding so long to tell us this
[3:13:38.700 --> 3:13:39.420]  um
[3:13:39.420 --> 3:13:40.700]  Marianne
[3:13:40.700 --> 3:13:42.700]  Or what color is this?
[3:13:42.700 --> 3:13:43.660]  Tonya
[3:13:43.660 --> 3:13:47.820]  Okay, Tonya. They just changed my list and it's skid it erased your name Tonya and georgia
[3:13:48.540 --> 3:13:51.020]  Tonya recap i'm going to sit back so as
[3:13:51.900 --> 3:13:54.860]  Mike Adams read the cover sheet what it says
[3:13:55.340 --> 3:13:58.380]  And and and read us those parts. Well, it's it's really really long
[3:13:58.460 --> 3:14:00.940]  So i'm just going to go through two points that I was highlighting for you
[3:14:01.020 --> 3:14:01.740]  um
[3:14:01.740 --> 3:14:03.740]  The first thing that I noticed is that it says
[3:14:03.740 --> 3:14:09.580]  Fluverine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility
[3:14:09.580 --> 3:14:12.940]  And then later on where it's talking about who shouldn't should not get this shot
[3:14:12.940 --> 3:14:14.460]  It says nobody under the age of four
[3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:21.180]  And it also says that it is also not known whether fluverine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman
[3:14:21.340 --> 3:14:23.340]  Or can affect a reproductive capacity
[3:14:24.140 --> 3:14:26.140]  So
[3:14:26.220 --> 3:14:30.940]  It's the expectant mothers that are one of the groups being targeted for this virus by the way. I just wanted to
[3:14:31.420 --> 3:14:33.420]  Right and this is regular
[3:14:33.420 --> 3:14:36.460]  This is just the regular seasonal flu which hasn't been as controversial
[3:14:36.460 --> 3:14:41.740]  So some of the pregnant women might not even be as scared of this one and it also says in here that um
[3:14:41.900 --> 3:14:46.620]  Whoever's giving the vaccine is supposed to tell the person that they're giving the shot to the benefits and the risks
[3:14:46.700 --> 3:14:49.820]  Now, I think if they told somebody hey, this can make you sterile, you know
[3:14:49.820 --> 3:14:50.860]  This has a
[3:14:50.860 --> 3:14:55.900]  Stare marisol in it which it also says it does that you know people might not take it and I don't think they're telling people that
[3:14:56.300 --> 3:15:00.220]  How did you get the insert you asked for it at Walgreens? Yeah, and let me tell you it's funny
[3:15:00.220 --> 3:15:05.580]  I walked into Walgreens and I said what kind of uh shot are you giving what company is it from and they didn't know
[3:15:05.580 --> 3:15:08.460]  And I said well, do you have an insert and they said what and I go?
[3:15:08.460 --> 3:15:12.380]  You know like a little paper that comes in with your shipment so she goes back and she's looking
[3:15:12.380 --> 3:15:14.540]  I'm assuming this is the pharmacist there was two women back there
[3:15:14.700 --> 3:15:16.780]  They're looking around they come back with this piece of paper
[3:15:16.780 --> 3:15:22.300]  They pulled out of the bottom of the box of vials all folded up very tiny unfold it right in front of me and say here
[3:15:22.620 --> 3:15:26.220]  Let me start you know, I'm looking at it and it's really long and I said can I just take this with me?
[3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:28.460]  And they said oh, yeah, sure take it like they had no interest in it
[3:15:28.940 --> 3:15:32.300]  So this is important and and I've read that this stuff's in there
[3:15:32.300 --> 3:15:35.420]  But but it's another thing to actually have the insert
[3:15:35.660 --> 3:15:38.460]  I'm going to give you our facts the problem is on those tiny
[3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:44.540]  You know regular size sheet of paper they fold it up tiny to go in the vial and it's tiny tiny wording
[3:15:44.540 --> 3:15:46.540]  I don't know if that'll fax, but you can try
[3:15:47.820 --> 3:15:49.820]  Oh, you blew it up. It's 866
[3:15:50.380 --> 3:15:51.820]  894
[3:15:51.820 --> 3:15:55.180]  1767 that's 866 894
[3:15:55.820 --> 3:15:57.420]  1767
[3:15:57.420 --> 3:16:02.380]  Uh, will you go ahead and fax that to us as soon as possible? Is there no way
[3:16:03.020 --> 3:16:09.260]  That that because if you blew it up, can you scan it and and email it to watson because people need to see that
[3:16:09.740 --> 3:16:15.500]  That it talks about attacking your fertility and mutagens and cancer because the german news admits that
[3:16:15.900 --> 3:16:18.380]  German scientists are admitting that but it's important
[3:16:18.620 --> 3:16:23.980]  We could save a lot of lives showing people this 866 894 1767. Did you get that?
[3:16:23.980 --> 3:16:27.260]  Yeah, I got it. I'm going to I'm going to leave my house right now and go fax it to you
[3:16:27.260 --> 3:16:30.620]  But I had one other question for Mike. Um, also in this insert
[3:16:30.620 --> 3:16:34.460]  It says that it's very important that you shake the vial in between each dosage
[3:16:34.460 --> 3:16:40.220]  And I'm wondering if if they don't shake it does that mean that you can get like an even higher amount of mercury than what they're saying?
[3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:45.420]  Yes, absolutely. And this this is one of the reasons why you got to be very careful
[3:16:45.580 --> 3:16:50.540]  If you even get a vaccine of where you get it because many of the people administering these vaccines
[3:16:50.540 --> 3:16:54.700]  Especially in these retail outlets, they are properly shaking up the vaccine
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:59.740]  Which means you could get a concentration of the thimerosal or other chemicals
[3:16:59.980 --> 3:17:03.180]  That's up to 200 times higher than what it's supposed to be
[3:17:03.420 --> 3:17:08.620]  So your baby could get the one shot that's 200 times more toxic than the next baby
[3:17:08.860 --> 3:17:13.020]  That they actually shook the vial for and that's one of the reasons why vaccines are so dangerous
[3:17:13.180 --> 3:17:18.460]  The people given these shots are not following the rules and they probably didn't even read the insert that you read
[3:17:18.460 --> 3:17:21.340]  No, I don't think they read it. I don't think they did. I'm going to leave right now
[3:17:21.340 --> 3:17:24.220]  And go ahead and text the team let you move on but um, I just wanted to make sure that you were aware
[3:17:24.220 --> 3:17:25.580]  This was coming to you
[3:17:25.580 --> 3:17:30.780]  You know the reason that they include that language in that in that insert Alex is so that if
[3:17:31.420 --> 3:17:33.900]  infertility problems become widespread
[3:17:34.540 --> 3:17:36.540]  They can say well we warned you
[3:17:37.100 --> 3:17:39.100]  You know they can just disavow any responsibility
[3:17:40.060 --> 3:17:43.420]  But then meanwhile the nightly news says it doesn't sterilize you
[3:17:43.420 --> 3:17:50.940]  Sure, the White House science are says he wants to sterilize you through vaccines in your water
[3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:53.180]  But that's okay
[3:17:53.180 --> 3:17:58.940]  And then you read the insert. Oh, it's gonna might sterilize you. Well, that's okay. You know the government's good people
[3:18:00.220 --> 3:18:03.020]  These are good people. We ought to you know be sterilized
[3:18:03.660 --> 3:18:05.340]  uh, you know
[3:18:05.340 --> 3:18:07.180]  I had I had a
[3:18:07.180 --> 3:18:12.300]  A reporter from a mainstream network news organization call me maybe two weeks ago
[3:18:12.300 --> 3:18:15.180]  I wanted to interview me about about swine flu vaccine
[3:18:15.180 --> 3:18:18.380]  Obviously was looking for you know an alternative viewpoint
[3:18:18.860 --> 3:18:21.180]  He swore to me up and down that he had been
[3:18:21.900 --> 3:18:27.340]  Told by the drug companies themselves that there was no thimerosal used in any of the swine flu vaccine
[3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:33.500]  And I I tried to educate this reporter. I said no, you're wrong. It there's thimerosal in there
[3:18:33.820 --> 3:18:38.860]  And he said no there isn't not it's not being used and to this day that network which I don't want to name
[3:18:39.180 --> 3:18:41.180]  But they've been reporting
[3:18:41.180 --> 3:18:45.100]  Uh stories on the swine flu vaccine and claiming there's no thimerosal in it
[3:18:45.740 --> 3:18:51.340]  Even though I could pull up a hundred releases from the medical companies admitting they put a higher dose
[3:18:51.740 --> 3:18:53.740]  Of the marisol in this one
[3:18:54.060 --> 3:18:55.180]  Yeah
[3:18:55.180 --> 3:18:56.300]  You know
[3:18:56.300 --> 3:19:00.700]  What has happened to the skepticism and that just the the common sense
[3:19:01.260 --> 3:19:06.700]  Of our mainstream journalists these days or when they get caught lying. It's like, oh, you lied to me. That's good
[3:19:06.700 --> 3:19:10.860]  I would be mad at you if you didn't lie to me. It's it's like it's cute and funny
[3:19:10.940 --> 3:19:16.620]  Oh bear, you knowingly gave me aids in the shot. Oh, thank you. It's like bears trusted. They like to murder
[3:19:18.460 --> 3:19:24.300]  Oh, Gardasil's killing a bunch of people. Oh, well good. Oh, it's so how dare you talk that about them

[3:24:20.940 --> 3:24:31.020]  makes humans tick and uses that material that data to control us saturday september 26 three
[3:24:31.020 --> 3:24:36.860]  undercover officers attempt to infiltrate a march against police brutality at the university of
[3:24:36.860 --> 3:24:45.740]  pittsburgh but fail miserably due to their horrendous disguise attempts during the march one of them
[3:24:45.740 --> 3:24:50.540]  breaks a photographer's camera this is just one example of a larger pattern of attempts to silence
[3:24:50.540 --> 3:24:55.420]  the media during the g20 protest and if you would have dare broke a cop's camera they charge you
[3:24:55.420 --> 3:24:59.100]  with assault with a deadly weapon or something but it's okay for them to beat up women and use
[3:24:59.100 --> 3:25:06.060]  police dogs and break the law and smash your camera because they work for a lawless criminal
[3:25:06.060 --> 3:25:11.020]  corporate takeover and they love the vaccines they get shot full of they love their kids being
[3:25:11.020 --> 3:25:15.740]  retarded they love the tyranny they love heaven bankruptcy they love it that's why they have the
[3:25:15.740 --> 3:25:21.740]  highest suicide rates highest rates of drug use they're unhappy because they work for the dark side
[3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:26.460]  i'm not saying all police but certainly the police they shipped in from miami date county
[3:25:26.460 --> 3:25:30.780]  and the board of patrol they shipped in the national guard these were unamerican pieces of
[3:25:30.780 --> 3:25:36.780]  trash and that video is up on info wars dot com we'll roll some of that in the background
[3:25:36.780 --> 3:25:43.180]  without the audio because of all the cussing poor people as folks watch at prison planet dot tv
[3:25:43.180 --> 3:25:47.980]  but let's go to uh mary an in maryland mary an you're on the air
[3:25:50.140 --> 3:25:57.820]  alex hi hi there um listen first i wanted to tell you that uh i really appreciate all your work
[3:25:57.820 --> 3:26:04.700]  and i do pass on to my friends um and family but i wanted to talk to you about a couple things that
[3:26:04.700 --> 3:26:12.220]  are going on in maryland um i was a teacher for 10 years and every year the uh regular flu shot
[3:26:12.220 --> 3:26:20.540]  was offered to us for free on uh several specific dates at the beginning of the school year and
[3:26:20.540 --> 3:26:26.460]  you know there was a lot of pressure from your peers to get this shot i never got the shot
[3:26:26.460 --> 3:26:31.500]  but um you know people would be like you're going to get sick blah blah blah well there's
[3:26:31.500 --> 3:26:36.460]  something going on at the university of maryland right now i'm not sure if you know that but
[3:26:36.460 --> 3:26:47.580]  it has been quote unquote rumored that 557 cases of swine flu are going on since classes began
[3:26:48.460 --> 3:26:56.060]  and the students are actually um pressuring each other to go and get the swine flu yeah it's all
[3:26:56.060 --> 3:27:01.900]  mind control no i have seen that at other big universities one in washington state had 2 000
[3:27:01.900 --> 3:27:08.300]  cases and a lot of times it's even fake announcements they're just doing it as a psi op to test forcing
[3:27:08.300 --> 3:27:13.180]  everyone to stampede and that's why little kids come up to my house and they go look i got the
[3:27:13.180 --> 3:27:17.980]  shot have you had the shot and my little kids are asking me now why aren't we getting shots and i
[3:27:17.980 --> 3:27:22.380]  said you don't want them honey they're bad for you and they go but i want one the neighbor kids
[3:27:22.380 --> 3:27:28.860]  got them so now they've got kids from not wanting shots to thinking oh it's a prize i get but you
[3:27:28.860 --> 3:27:34.940]  read the inserts you know it sterilizes you but that's okay they told you so i know but see this is
[3:27:34.940 --> 3:27:41.020]  like really super weird this is totally going along with everything you talk about because
[3:27:41.020 --> 3:27:50.620]  1984 yes people who do not get the shot have to wear a face mask so it's obvious to other people
[3:27:50.620 --> 3:27:54.940]  that they haven't gotten a shot yeah it's all part of hysteria it's the new it's part of being
[3:27:54.940 --> 3:28:01.260]  classified wearing a yellow star being in a terror database it's all about the new medical tyranny
[3:28:01.260 --> 3:28:05.660]  of just like thx 1138 when he's helping the kid put the injector back on his arm
[3:28:05.660 --> 3:28:10.380]  oh you've had your 20 shots this week you're of the lord you're of the government
[3:28:10.380 --> 3:28:15.100]  gee you know obama loves the little children red yellow black and white they are equal in our
[3:28:15.100 --> 3:28:20.300]  leader's side oh my you see you're starting to understand now yes they're making people wear
[3:28:20.300 --> 3:28:25.820]  these at universities and at police departments and there's no law they just make you do it
[3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:31.500]  and uh when you pay to go to college you pay to go be brainwashed and taught out of worship
[3:28:31.500 --> 3:28:37.020]  government that's it basically oh i mean and i went to i've been through graduate school at
[3:28:37.020 --> 3:28:41.900]  john's hopkins it's happening there and i'm so you're seeing those people need to go shoot video
[3:28:41.900 --> 3:28:49.020]  of this yeah well unfortunately i had to stop teaching because i'm disabled now but uh they're
[3:28:49.020 --> 3:28:57.100]  also at the university of maryland medical center saying that young children need to be given two
[3:28:57.100 --> 3:29:06.300]  doses yes wine flu vaccine and two or three two or three see they said four to give people
[3:29:06.300 --> 3:29:11.420]  who that's a lot they said oh it's only two now and people went oh yeah don't worry there won't
[3:29:11.420 --> 3:29:16.300]  be any more pain for the children there won't be any more high intelligence or frustration
[3:29:16.300 --> 3:29:23.420]  you'll just learn how to be dead take your shots come on the government's good but i do have one
[3:29:23.420 --> 3:29:30.380]  question for you and that is uh regarding the barrett chip i read an article a very long time
[3:29:30.380 --> 3:29:37.580]  ago that it was so small that it could be injected through a hypodermic needle and i'm wondering if
[3:29:38.300 --> 3:29:43.660]  this is part of that if let me break it down on the other side i'll briefly do that take more
[3:29:43.660 --> 3:29:48.700]  calls get into some financial news and more what happened to the g20 stay with us i'm alex jones

[3:32:07.980 --> 3:32:12.780]  past owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry
[3:32:12.780 --> 3:32:19.580]  that was then this is now introducing diginette spy sunglasses these sunglasses contain a small

[3:33:11.340 --> 3:33:26.060]  Rob Wendell barber and Dustin and I was just talking to Rob Jacobson and just talked to him
[3:33:26.060 --> 3:33:31.260]  during the break it looks like it's going to the supreme court of the state to reopen the 9-11
[3:33:31.260 --> 3:33:38.460]  investigation so they've gotten the 80,000 plus signatures to do that we're gonna be talking to
[3:33:38.460 --> 3:33:43.460]  them either today or tomorrow, briefly at the end of the show, but there can be no longer
[3:33:43.460 --> 3:33:46.220]  any doubt.
[3:33:46.220 --> 3:33:49.780]  Terany is here marching on every front against humanity.
[3:33:49.780 --> 3:33:55.420]  Big corporations have issued themselves tens of trillions in liquid fiat cash on our backs.
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:33:59.980]  They know they've got to squeeze the labor and taxes out of it to now pay for it all.
[3:33:59.980 --> 3:34:03.540]  And so they're letting us know and they've hired police and military and told them the
[3:34:03.540 --> 3:34:08.140]  public is scum trash, beat the hell out of them, their enemies.
[3:34:08.140 --> 3:34:09.580]  They're training to take your guns.
[3:34:09.580 --> 3:34:14.180]  They're training infraguard and clergy response to tell the public to go along with it.
[3:34:14.180 --> 3:34:16.060]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:17.060]  This is PsyOps.
[3:34:17.060 --> 3:34:21.740]  And if you just become aware of the PsyOps, we could turn this country around and save
[3:34:21.740 --> 3:34:23.380]  our society.
[3:34:23.380 --> 3:34:27.980]  But if we don't, the police are more far gone than I thought watching this G20 stuff.
[3:34:27.980 --> 3:34:32.260]  I mean, when an old woman walks out of a store with a bag and says, what is this officer?
[3:34:32.260 --> 3:34:34.180]  And the cop lets a dog loose divider.
[3:34:34.180 --> 3:34:38.120]  See, they love this zero tolerance thing of no one allowed on the streets.
[3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:41.420]  It's a Pittsburgh or Oakland, Pennsylvania.
[3:34:41.420 --> 3:34:45.660]  So they drive by neighborhoods and kids are out throwing a football and they go, and the
[3:34:45.660 --> 3:34:48.980]  cops just swing the sound cannon around and hit them.
[3:34:48.980 --> 3:34:53.580]  The military tortured Luke in jail, the FBI was running it in a detention center, just
[3:34:53.580 --> 3:34:59.620]  like peer 57 in New York, just, I mean, folks, this is, this is bad news.
[3:34:59.620 --> 3:35:01.580]  And these guys would torture children in Iraq.
[3:35:01.580 --> 3:35:02.580]  They did.
[3:35:02.580 --> 3:35:05.220]  I mean, I've had Marine Corps officers on that talk about it, how people would just
[3:35:05.220 --> 3:35:09.980]  shoot kids for fun and all the videos of them shooting families out of their cars for fun
[3:35:09.980 --> 3:35:12.060]  and raping kids.
[3:35:12.060 --> 3:35:15.220]  And see it, it's a lowest common denominator.
[3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:18.620]  The scum get honored.
[3:35:18.620 --> 3:35:20.300]  And so you got Marines.
[3:35:20.300 --> 3:35:24.220]  Remember when the Marines killed the puppy and the neoconsights said that's a fake robot
[3:35:24.220 --> 3:35:25.220]  dog?
[3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:26.340]  Everybody could see it was pulling its legs up.
[3:35:26.340 --> 3:35:28.420]  It was a real puppy.
[3:35:28.420 --> 3:35:32.980]  And then we posted scores of videos of them killing dogs, killing horses, shooting cows,
[3:35:32.980 --> 3:35:36.140]  shooting sheep, hand-grenading people, shooting humans.
[3:35:36.140 --> 3:35:39.500]  But see humans have been taught not to care if they see fellow humans dying through all
[3:35:39.500 --> 3:35:46.300]  the murder simulations on TV and movies, but you see a dog get killed, starving dog comes
[3:35:46.300 --> 3:35:51.620]  up begging the Marines laugh and just shoot it, you know, the army running over dogs laughing.
[3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:55.180]  People didn't care about seeing kids getting killed.
[3:35:55.180 --> 3:35:59.300]  And there have been hundreds of murders in Iraq of soldiers, not officers this time,
[3:35:59.300 --> 3:36:04.860]  but soldiers that say, hey, don't don't shoot this family or don't rape these little girls.
[3:36:04.860 --> 3:36:05.860]  You know what?
[3:36:05.860 --> 3:36:07.660]  They shoot you right in the head.
[3:36:07.660 --> 3:36:11.500]  And all the cases where they come into a family, rape the 10-year-old girl, then grease
[3:36:11.500 --> 3:36:12.900]  the whole family.
[3:36:12.900 --> 3:36:18.060]  And then it's all their officers come in and say, badass men, you've done a great job.
[3:36:18.060 --> 3:36:20.060]  They give them all drop weapons.
[3:36:20.060 --> 3:36:23.860]  When they get upset or get drunk and shoot innocent people, they just drop a weapon on.
[3:36:23.860 --> 3:36:26.060]  They're all coming back to be cops.
[3:36:26.060 --> 3:36:27.620]  And they've got a hunger to kill.
[3:36:27.620 --> 3:36:32.780]  A hunger to murder US citizens, a hunger to rape your wives and children, a hunger, a
[3:36:32.780 --> 3:36:34.780]  bloody, vampiric hunger.
[3:36:34.780 --> 3:36:39.660]  I remember videos of the helicopters landing, playing death metal with skulls hanging off
[3:36:39.660 --> 3:36:42.500]  and 666 spray painted on the side.
[3:36:42.500 --> 3:36:44.420]  I mean, it's hell force.
[3:36:44.420 --> 3:36:48.660]  And the good men and women in the military that don't go along with this, they get fragged.
[3:36:48.660 --> 3:36:51.820]  They get killed.
[3:36:51.820 --> 3:36:55.460]  And so they are ready to come to your homes and take your guns and they know you're trained
[3:36:55.460 --> 3:36:56.460]  to stand down.
[3:36:56.460 --> 3:36:58.340]  That encourages them.
[3:36:58.340 --> 3:37:00.660]  They enjoy it.
[3:37:00.660 --> 3:37:03.700]  They, our army is an army of darkness now.
[3:37:03.700 --> 3:37:10.020]  It is an army of Satan, an army of Lucifer does get me a glass of water, please.
[3:37:10.020 --> 3:37:15.020]  I engulf lunch during the three minute break and then a little bit of pepper in there.
[3:37:15.020 --> 3:37:19.780]  Now I know the whole military is an evil and I know our police aren't evil, but the leadership
[3:37:19.780 --> 3:37:22.180]  is evil in almost every case.
[3:37:22.180 --> 3:37:26.940]  Abu Ghraib, uh, Halliburton, Dinecore, and Middley run child kidnapping rings that comes
[3:37:26.940 --> 3:37:27.940]  out in Congress.
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:29.140]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[3:37:29.140 --> 3:37:35.460]  The army's own report admit they rape children with flashlights with battery acid on them
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:36.460]  in front of their parents.
[3:37:36.460 --> 3:37:37.460]  They raped them.
[3:37:37.460 --> 3:37:42.100]  They beat them to death with pleasure at camps all over the planet.
[3:37:42.100 --> 3:37:46.140]  This is the system and this is in the reports and they're here now.
[3:37:46.140 --> 3:37:47.620]  They are now among us.
[3:37:47.620 --> 3:37:48.700]  Their minds are blown.
[3:37:48.700 --> 3:37:50.140]  Their souls are gone.
[3:37:50.140 --> 3:37:52.780]  They love the black uniforms they're given by their masters.
[3:37:52.780 --> 3:37:54.260]  They love the injections they're given.
[3:37:54.260 --> 3:37:56.420]  They love the injections they'll force you to take.
[3:37:56.420 --> 3:38:01.060]  They love the evil and they're going to gun people down the back just like Chicago police
[3:38:01.060 --> 3:38:02.060]  announced.
[3:38:02.060 --> 3:38:05.140]  If you run now, your car runs, they will shoot you.
[3:38:05.140 --> 3:38:07.060]  They're announcing everywhere they will kill you.
[3:38:07.060 --> 3:38:08.060]  They will kill.
[3:38:08.060 --> 3:38:09.060]  They will kill.
[3:38:09.060 --> 3:38:12.420]  They will kill because the control freak doesn't just want your tax money and to run your
[3:38:12.420 --> 3:38:13.420]  life.
[3:38:13.420 --> 3:38:15.620]  They want to be able to kill you.
[3:38:15.620 --> 3:38:20.940]  That's what tyrants have done throughout history, Stalin, Mao, all of them, Hitler.
[3:38:20.940 --> 3:38:27.540]  It is the same system over and over and over again.
[3:38:27.540 --> 3:38:29.140]  This is their new world order system.
[3:38:29.140 --> 3:38:33.100]  I want to tell you about some final sponsors in this hour that I'm going to hurry through

[3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:13.540]  This unit is a video and audio recording device disguised as a pen.
[3:40:13.540 --> 3:40:15.220]  It fits right into your pocket.
[3:40:15.220 --> 3:40:18.900]  They also have sunglasses that have a tiny hidden camera recorder on them.
[3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:21.020]  Those are the best.
[3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:25.220]  We have had listeners use this pen to fight the InfoWare, and we have used some in the
[3:40:25.220 --> 3:40:27.820]  postings on our side ourselves.
[3:40:27.820 --> 3:40:29.820]  We constantly are asked, how do we get involved?
[3:40:29.820 --> 3:40:32.660]  Be prepared to capture and expose tyranny.
[3:40:32.660 --> 3:40:35.420]  Check on the Diginet banner at InfoWars.com.

[3:40:49.860 --> 3:40:59.380] .net, or 888-344-6681, 888-344-6681, and in closing, fall the Republic, which potentially
[3:40:59.380 --> 3:41:02.900]  could be the last film we ever released as bad as things are going, this tells you who
[3:41:02.900 --> 3:41:08.980]  the enemy is, how the bankers did it with detail, how they mind-controlled the public,
[3:41:08.980 --> 3:41:14.060]  the left-right paradigm, and the television set, the police state, the FEMA camps, Homeland
[3:41:14.060 --> 3:41:20.380]  Brigade, all available at InfoWars.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.

[3:41:22.660 --> 3:41:26.340]  They ship out, and the orders are received.
[3:41:26.340 --> 3:41:28.420]  Again, fall the Republic.
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:31.220]  You can now order that at InfoWars.com.
[3:41:31.220 --> 3:41:34.260]  Let us now, very, very exciting, best film I've made yet.

[3:41:38.420 --> 3:41:40.380]  D dropped, okay.
[3:41:40.380 --> 3:41:43.260]  Let's talk to Bob in Arizona, Bob, you're on the air.
[3:41:43.260 --> 3:41:51.420]  Hi, Alex, I'm a member of Rotary, Rotary Club, and wanted to bring this to your attention.
[3:41:51.420 --> 3:41:59.340]  Bill Gates has made a large commitment to Rotary for the Polio Plus program, $355 million,
[3:41:59.340 --> 3:42:04.940]  and he gave a speech, you can Google Bill Gates, Rotary Polio Speech.
[3:42:04.940 --> 3:42:09.940]  Anyway, I've got some quotes here from the speech.
[3:42:09.940 --> 3:42:18.620]  He talks about being in a slum in East Delhi, and he held a nine-month-old girl named Hashmin,
[3:42:18.620 --> 3:42:27.980]  and so this girl had polio, and then he goes on to say later in the speech, so in the span
[3:42:27.980 --> 3:42:33.020]  of just a few days, more than 170 million children in India will be vaccinated against
[3:42:33.020 --> 3:42:35.660]  polio, but even that's not enough.
[3:42:35.660 --> 3:42:41.300]  Hashmin, the baby I met, had been immunized, but she still got polio because she lived
[3:42:41.300 --> 3:42:45.540]  in one of those areas where children need many doses of the vaccine.
[3:42:45.540 --> 3:42:49.340]  Yeah, that's where he spun it, but if you actually look at the Indian case, in fact,
[3:42:49.340 --> 3:42:57.220]  Google this, polio vaccine causes polio, BBC two weeks ago, all over Africa, all over Asia,
[3:42:57.220 --> 3:43:02.340]  the subcontinent of India, and Latin America, suddenly a new strain of polios out, and they're
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:10.220]  admitting it came from the vaccine, Reuters, AP also reported it, about polio vaccine causes
[3:43:10.220 --> 3:43:14.660]  polio cases, and so Gates, see, they do this is psych warfare.
[3:43:14.660 --> 3:43:18.820]  They hide it in plain view, they go, yeah, hepatitis is being caused by the shot, you
[3:43:18.820 --> 3:43:19.820]  need to take more.
[3:43:19.820 --> 3:43:26.380]  Hey, you got polio, little Hashmin, I held her, but see, he does it in a loving way when
[3:43:26.380 --> 3:43:31.380]  his dad heads up Planned Parenthood, and Bill Gates was part of the, quote, secret meeting,
[3:43:31.380 --> 3:43:36.540]  world leaders, worlds rich meet for secret meeting on overpopulation.
[3:43:36.540 --> 3:43:40.300]  How sickeningly obvious, does he go on and admit the vaccine, did it?
[3:43:40.300 --> 3:43:43.300]  No, he doesn't acknowledge that, but let me give you another quote.
[3:43:43.300 --> 3:43:46.300]  Here it is, New York Times, here's the first one they pulled up, I hadn't seen this one,
[3:43:46.300 --> 3:43:52.740]  print it for me guys, mutating vaccine causes polio outbreak in Nigeria, Bill Gates was
[3:43:52.740 --> 3:43:57.900]  funding it, oh, he loves them, oh, he's so good, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:43:57.900 --> 3:44:02.980]  Yeah, and another part of the speech he says, and there are some places where it takes multiple
[3:44:02.980 --> 3:44:08.060]  doses of vaccine to make a child immune, I didn't know that, it says, I didn't know
[3:44:08.060 --> 3:44:11.660]  that when I first got interested in polio, I just assumed the standard number of doses
[3:44:11.660 --> 3:44:16.540]  we given in the United States was sufficient, but in some places children need as many
[3:44:16.540 --> 3:44:22.700]  as 10 doses, because they're already infected with so many other viruses that the vaccine
[3:44:22.700 --> 3:44:24.300]  can't do its job properly.
[3:44:24.300 --> 3:44:27.740]  Oh yeah, so many viruses because they get vaccinated every week.
[3:44:27.740 --> 3:44:31.660]  There's no money for food, no money for school, no money for books, but for all those kids
[3:44:31.660 --> 3:44:35.820]  sitting in the dirt villages, there's the shots, and Africans all over have learned
[3:44:35.820 --> 3:44:41.300]  to run, because they say, they give children an invalid shot, oh, die, you know, I mean,
[3:44:41.300 --> 3:44:46.100]  you can pull the videos up, and the people are hiding in caves, and hiding in the wilderness,
[3:44:46.100 --> 3:44:51.140]  and I mean, my God, it's so sick, and by the way, African villagers and others always
[3:44:51.140 --> 3:44:56.020]  loved the white man doctors 50 years ago, 100 years ago, they would beg for it, now
[3:44:56.020 --> 3:45:02.260]  they run, but again, they're just ignorant, aren't they, Hajmen though was taken care
[3:45:02.260 --> 3:45:06.100]  of, very sick, go ahead, sir.
[3:45:06.100 --> 3:45:11.380]  Well, I just want to, you know, ask your other listeners that are Rotary members to send
[3:45:11.380 --> 3:45:20.060]  a letter to the board of directors questioning the efficacy and safety of the vaccines, and
[3:45:20.060 --> 3:45:25.500]  also, if you give money to the Rotary Foundation, restrict it so it's not used for the Polio
[3:45:25.500 --> 3:45:26.820]  Plus program.
[3:45:26.820 --> 3:45:32.580]  The Polio Plus, because there's a little something extra in the Polio, you know, we had a top
[3:45:32.580 --> 3:45:38.900]  level analyst, we know her name, we've seen the documents, unbelievable, who worked for
[3:45:38.900 --> 3:45:41.660]  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, did you ever hear that interview?
[3:45:41.660 --> 3:45:43.060]  No, I didn't.
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:48.700]  Yeah, just search it out, like Alex Jones interviews, Gates Foundation whistleblower,
[3:45:48.700 --> 3:45:54.460]  and let me tell you, it is bad news, brother, these people see it so outrageous, and Bill
[3:45:54.460 --> 3:46:01.900]  Gates wears a nice sweater with a tie, and he walks in and goes, hi kids, I want to help,
[3:46:01.900 --> 3:46:08.660]  and it's all so, you know, just like, just like eco science wants to help by poisoning
[3:46:08.660 --> 3:46:13.340]  the water and the vaccines, they admit it, just like John P. Holdren's all in his sweater
[3:46:13.340 --> 3:46:23.460]  going, hi kids, he goes to school, take your shot, hey, you know, it's just all so, and
[3:46:23.460 --> 3:46:28.460]  that's why, oh, it doesn't matter, you know, we're trying to educate people about vaccines,
[3:46:28.460 --> 3:46:32.980]  you're already just making pharmacological crops, did you know about that?
[3:46:32.980 --> 3:46:33.980]  Yeah.
[3:46:33.980 --> 3:46:36.700]  There's no, I mean, what do you think of these people?
[3:46:36.700 --> 3:46:42.340]  Well, you know, I got to admit, I was kind of skeptical when you talked about Bill Gates
[3:46:42.340 --> 3:46:46.900]  and his father, and you know, when I read the speech, I just thought, well, either Bill
[3:46:46.900 --> 3:46:53.140]  Gates, you know, doesn't do his homework before he puts $350 million into a program,
[3:46:53.140 --> 3:46:56.540]  or, you know, he's got another agenda.
[3:46:56.540 --> 3:47:02.640]  Sir, with the Bill and Melinda Gates funded money from him and Buffett, that's where the
[3:47:02.640 --> 3:47:04.140]  scourge is.
[3:47:04.140 --> 3:47:08.540]  I mean, they go in and everybody starts getting polio.
[3:47:08.540 --> 3:47:10.900]  They go in and the people start getting HIV.
[3:47:10.900 --> 3:47:16.540]  They go in and they start getting all, no, no, no, it was Bill and Melinda Gates money
[3:47:16.540 --> 3:47:21.180]  in Africa, Asia and Latin America with the latest, because it says it's a new special,
[3:47:21.180 --> 3:47:25.500]  pull up that New York Times, it says, oh, they gave the kids the shot and it mutated
[3:47:25.500 --> 3:47:29.340]  a new deadly polio, because in these third world countries, a lot of people have natural
[3:47:29.340 --> 3:47:30.340]  immunity now.
[3:47:30.340 --> 3:47:34.580]  I mean, there it is, New York Times, let me ask you this, did you know about the fact
[3:47:34.580 --> 3:47:38.340]  that the vaccines admittedly did it when you read that from Gates, or that just creeps
[3:47:38.340 --> 3:47:40.980]  you out that he didn't know the first part?
[3:47:40.980 --> 3:47:47.260]  Well, actually, there's a member of the international board in our club and I challenged him about
[3:47:47.260 --> 3:47:53.220]  vaccines and I sent him some information about Dr. Len Horowitz and he just kind of
[3:47:53.220 --> 3:47:59.380]  responded without responding to any of the factual information, just saying, oh, that
[3:47:59.380 --> 3:48:04.220]  guy used to be a dentist and that kind of, you know, that kind of response.
[3:48:04.220 --> 3:48:08.700]  Yeah, I know he's a dentist, he also has a degree from Harvard in the whole medical
[3:48:08.700 --> 3:48:11.500]  science system, but that doesn't matter.
[3:48:11.500 --> 3:48:13.340]  We've had all these other medical doctors on.
[3:48:13.340 --> 3:48:16.820]  You tell them about Blalock, did you tell them about Monteef, did you tell them about
[3:48:16.820 --> 3:48:17.820]  Tenpenny?
[3:48:17.820 --> 3:48:30.340]  I told him about Dr. Blalock and yeah, and his response was, well, you know, this former
[3:48:30.340 --> 3:48:36.580]  head of a medical school has polio and I'd like you to meet with him, he'll tell you
[3:48:36.580 --> 3:48:38.820]  what he thinks about Dr. Blalock.
[3:48:38.820 --> 3:48:39.820]  So it's all just...
[3:48:39.820 --> 3:48:43.580]  Yeah, no, it's all emotional with what they don't, but listen, printing the New York
[3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:49.900]  Times and AP and Reuters where the vaccines are what are spreading polio, it's admitted,
[3:48:49.900 --> 3:48:50.900]  it's admitted.
[3:48:50.900 --> 3:48:57.180]  See, your instinct in reading that going, they need 10 shots now, okay, what they're
[3:48:57.180 --> 3:49:02.700]  doing is they're putting these new engineered systems in that then mutate and they know
[3:49:02.700 --> 3:49:03.700]  it.
[3:49:03.700 --> 3:49:08.060]  And then they're testing the soft kill where they just announce openly, oh, we're killing
[3:49:08.060 --> 3:49:09.060]  everybody.
[3:49:09.060 --> 3:49:16.980]  Oh, it was an accident, oopsie, and then like they put little kids up on TV, hey, where's
[3:49:16.980 --> 3:49:17.980]  that video?
[3:49:17.980 --> 3:49:22.340]  I sent you the little girl with the cancer thing in Australia and the rock star is up
[3:49:22.340 --> 3:49:25.380]  there with her and the little girl's hair is falling out and she'll be dead soon but
[3:49:25.380 --> 3:49:27.260]  she has this magic moment.
[3:49:27.260 --> 3:49:31.620]  Why doesn't the rock star find out about the biochemical weapons operation?
[3:49:31.620 --> 3:49:34.980]  Why don't they find out how childhood cancers are up over 2,000 percent?
[3:49:34.980 --> 3:49:39.020]  See, you called in rightfully, sir, going in this weird that they want to give 10 polio
[3:49:39.020 --> 3:49:41.900]  shots saying one doesn't work anymore.
[3:49:41.900 --> 3:49:47.580]  See now they're like, oh, it doesn't work, it doesn't work, it kills you, see, but it's
[3:49:47.580 --> 3:49:49.220]  worse than what Gates was saying.
[3:49:49.220 --> 3:49:56.260]  That's his spin, oh, she died or she's sick because we didn't give her enough.
[3:49:56.260 --> 3:50:01.420]  No, it was the shot that did it and Gates is up there demonically knowing your leaders
[3:50:01.420 --> 3:50:07.900]  in your community, soft-soaping and giving you what Mike Adams called kind of the prehypnosis
[3:50:07.900 --> 3:50:10.900]  that none of this is causing a problem.
[3:50:10.900 --> 3:50:16.260]  Okay, so is that powerful info for your quiver of arrows with him that it's the shot doing
[3:50:16.260 --> 3:50:17.260]  it?
[3:50:17.260 --> 3:50:26.220]  Yeah, I mean, that was my first thought when I read later on that she had polio.
[3:50:26.220 --> 3:50:30.940]  But sir, they admit that, now let me go further, I've had top scientists on and I could pull
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:33.060]  this up if we had time left in the show.
[3:50:33.060 --> 3:50:37.300]  Did you know that the polio outbreak in the West was engineered?
[3:50:37.300 --> 3:50:38.300]  No.
[3:50:38.300 --> 3:50:41.940]  I could, I mean, we're gonna do a show on that in the near future just for you.
[3:50:41.940 --> 3:50:48.580]  Yes, it goes far worse and they put SV 40 cancer virus in it, which they admit has killed
[3:50:48.580 --> 3:50:51.220]  hundreds of millions with the cancers that develop.
[3:50:51.220 --> 3:50:52.220]  Thank you, sir.
[3:50:52.220 --> 3:50:55.100]  I'm glad you're fighting back, but find out how deep the rabbit hole really goes.
[3:50:55.100 --> 3:51:01.780]  It goes straight to hell.
[3:51:01.780 --> 3:51:04.020]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[3:51:04.020 --> 3:51:05.020]  Spy on me?
[3:51:05.020 --> 3:51:08.580]  Yeah, don't you know Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and
[3:51:08.580 --> 3:51:10.140]  store them in a giant database?
[3:51:10.140 --> 3:51:11.980]  You should use start page instead.
[3:51:11.980 --> 3:51:12.980]  Start page?
[3:51:12.980 --> 3:51:13.980]  Yeah, startpage.com.

[3:52:02.380 --> 3:52:08.460]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.460 --> 3:52:12.940]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:12.940 --> 3:52:14.260]  us would like to see.
[3:52:14.260 --> 3:52:19.420]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:19.420 --> 3:52:20.420]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.420 --> 3:52:24.860]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one of this election.
[3:52:24.860 --> 3:52:30.260]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.260 --> 3:52:38.380]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.380 --> 3:52:41.940]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[3:52:41.940 --> 3:52:48.860]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:53:01.860 --> 3:53:06.180]  Did you know that colon cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the US?
[3:53:06.180 --> 3:53:10.980]  Did you know that the number one health problem patients complain to doctors about is gastrointestinal
[3:53:10.980 --> 3:53:11.980]  related?
[3:53:11.980 --> 3:53:16.420]  Health experts predict that almost every American will develop some type of colon disease,
[3:53:16.420 --> 3:53:19.500]  polyp, tumor, or cancer in their lifetime.
[3:53:19.500 --> 3:53:24.620]  If you suffer from constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, frequent gas or other intestinal
[3:53:24.620 --> 3:53:27.540]  related problems, you need to take action.

[3:54:17.500 --> 3:54:20.420]  first at infowars.com.
[3:54:20.420 --> 3:54:24.960]  There's a photo we've got on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're going to link to it up on
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:34.180]  InfoWars, G20 Summit, on infowars.com, Obama poster on the light pole as the riot police
[3:54:34.180 --> 3:54:36.660]  are marching forward.
[3:54:36.660 --> 3:54:38.300]  So that's pretty amazing.
[3:54:38.300 --> 3:54:41.540]  Good photo there by that photographer.
[3:54:41.540 --> 3:54:47.100]  Okay, here at the very end when we start the rebroadcast on the attack on Iran, the police
[3:54:47.100 --> 3:54:50.340]  state, everything that's being set up right now, that's coming up on the restreams at
[3:54:50.340 --> 3:54:54.780]  infowars.com and reared on your local AM and FM stations.
[3:54:54.780 --> 3:54:59.620]  With Dennis McMahon, the lawyer for the folks in New York, and of course, Manny Badia who
[3:54:59.620 --> 3:55:06.700]  lost his uncle, Thomas Scroy in the attacks, they've gotten the petitions for a new investigation.
[3:55:06.700 --> 3:55:07.700]  They're moving forward.
[3:55:07.700 --> 3:55:09.620]  It's going to another court level.
[3:55:09.620 --> 3:55:11.020]  This is a big, big deal.
[3:55:11.020 --> 3:55:14.180]  It's making big news in New York, but not outside New York.
[3:55:14.180 --> 3:55:15.180]  This is a big deal.
[3:55:15.180 --> 3:55:21.020]  So, in a nutshell, we've got a few minutes left, Manny Badia, recap what's happening,
[3:55:21.020 --> 3:55:23.180]  why this is important, and where it's going now.
[3:55:23.180 --> 3:55:27.380]  Okay, what we've done is we've collected over 80,000 signatures here in New York for a new
[3:55:27.380 --> 3:55:32.180]  petition to have an impartial, a peanut-powered investigation in November.
[3:55:32.180 --> 3:55:36.900]  We have, the city has competed that we have more than enough signatures, both times we
[3:55:36.900 --> 3:55:41.180]  handed in signatures, and now we're in the court systems.
[3:55:41.180 --> 3:55:47.060]  It's going to, all arguments will be heard tomorrow morning at 9.30 AM, room 252, in
[3:55:47.060 --> 3:55:48.740]  the State Supreme Court here in Manhattan.
[3:55:48.740 --> 3:55:51.140]  I'm asking everyone who can attend, please attend.
[3:55:51.140 --> 3:55:53.060]  We want to pack that courtroom.
[3:55:53.060 --> 3:55:57.820]  We're going to be occurred by Edward Lainer, the judge, and a decision will be rendered
[3:55:57.820 --> 3:55:59.380]  by Wednesday.
[3:55:59.380 --> 3:56:04.100]  All right, and again, this is calling for what?
[3:56:04.100 --> 3:56:05.100]  Dennis?
[3:56:05.100 --> 3:56:10.380]  Yes, we're going to put on the ballot to the New York City voters on November 3rd.
[3:56:10.380 --> 3:56:15.980]  Do you want a New York City investigation into 9.11?
[3:56:15.980 --> 3:56:20.940]  And this is very, very exciting, because this will be a real poll of the people, though
[3:56:20.940 --> 3:56:22.260]  there is some election fraud there.
[3:56:22.260 --> 3:56:27.100]  We have polls as high as 84% of Americans believe, and they relied to about 9.11.
[3:56:27.100 --> 3:56:31.300]  We've seen some new polls showing the opposite of that, which are put out by very deceptive
[3:56:31.300 --> 3:56:33.820]  companies, but this is a big deal.
[3:56:33.820 --> 3:56:38.420]  Yes, it is, and in New York City, luckily, if we do get it on the ballot, we still have
[3:56:38.420 --> 3:56:39.820]  the old-fashioned machines.
[3:56:39.820 --> 3:56:43.100]  They didn't get the computer machines in time, so it would be hard to rig it.
[3:56:43.100 --> 3:56:47.340]  Well, I mean, how can they block it going on the ballot now if you have the signatures?
[3:56:47.340 --> 3:56:48.340]  Why does it have to go to court?
[3:56:48.340 --> 3:56:50.660]  Well, there's two parts to that, Alex.
[3:56:50.660 --> 3:56:54.900]  Not only do you have the signatures, but the petition itself, the language of the petition
[3:56:54.900 --> 3:56:57.900]  has to be legal, and the city clerk is saying, no, it's not legal.
[3:56:57.900 --> 3:56:59.580]  You can't have an investigation like this.
[3:56:59.580 --> 3:57:03.620]  This is a federal matter, and there's a host of other reasons they put it on the ballot.
[3:57:03.620 --> 3:57:07.700]  The city and a people can't have an investigation if they want.
[3:57:07.700 --> 3:57:10.180]  Only the feds are allowed to investigate anything.
[3:57:10.180 --> 3:57:14.720]  Well, they're telling the people, you have no rights to petition the court for redress
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:15.720]  of grievances.
[3:57:15.720 --> 3:57:18.740]  I mean, this is the most fundamental right we have in the First Amendment.
[3:57:18.740 --> 3:57:23.420]  Right, and they just view it as their job to disempower the people.
[3:57:23.420 --> 3:57:32.500]  Well, the website is nyccan.org, and if they deny this, if they block 80,000-plus signatures,
[3:57:32.500 --> 3:57:34.860]  this really shows they're trying to cover up something.
[3:57:34.860 --> 3:57:41.100]  Well, Alex, I agree with you on so much, but it's really ingrained here, the culture of
[3:57:41.100 --> 3:57:42.580]  disempowerment to the people.
[3:57:42.580 --> 3:57:45.180]  It's almost knee-jerk for them to try to stop anything.
[3:57:45.180 --> 3:57:49.460]  In the history of New York City, only one initiative like this has ever succeeded.
[3:57:49.460 --> 3:57:53.740]  That was the term limits, and Bloomberg had the city council undo that this year so he
[3:57:53.740 --> 3:57:54.740]  could run again.
[3:57:54.740 --> 3:57:59.420]  I mean, the whole system is rigged against the people, but it's more the culture than
[3:57:59.420 --> 3:58:00.580]  anything else.
[3:58:00.580 --> 3:58:03.780]  It's about dominating the slaves, breaking their backs, letting the people know they're
[3:58:03.780 --> 3:58:05.540]  absolute trash and filth.
[3:58:05.540 --> 3:58:09.180]  You are bucking that tide, and you're on the right side of history.
[3:58:09.180 --> 3:58:13.140]  Dennis McMahon and, of course, everybody else out there for the great job you're doing,
[3:58:13.140 --> 3:58:18.020]  Manny Medillo, New York CityCan.org, nyccan.org.
[3:58:18.020 --> 3:58:19.020]  God bless you.
[3:58:19.020 --> 3:58:20.020]  We'll talk to you.
[3:58:20.020 --> 3:58:21.020]  Thanks for the update.
[3:58:21.020 --> 3:58:22.020]  Thank you.
[3:58:22.020 --> 3:58:23.020]  God bless you, sir.
[3:58:23.020 --> 3:58:24.020]  Thank you.
[3:58:24.020 --> 3:58:25.020]  Great job.
[3:58:25.020 --> 3:58:28.700]  Okay, back tomorrow live, 11 to 3 central, big guests, power packed info.
[3:58:28.700 --> 3:58:32.740]  The people are waking up, but will it be fast enough, spread the word about the show and
[3:58:32.740 --> 3:58:35.700]  the free podcast, tell everybody you know about the show.
[3:58:35.700 --> 3:58:37.620]  That's how we're going to grow and counter the globalist.
[3:58:37.620 --> 3:58:38.620]  Great job, crew.
[3:58:38.620 --> 3:58:43.620]  Free transmission starts now.
[3:58:43.620 --> 3:58:46.100]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:46.100 --> 3:58:51.340]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.340 --> 3:58:54.660]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:58:54.660 --> 3:58:58.500]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:58:58.500 --> 3:59:02.940]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:59:02.940 --> 3:59:07.420]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:59:07.420 --> 3:59:12.580]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity
[3:59:12.580 --> 3:59:13.580]  for free.
[3:59:13.580 --> 3:59:17.260]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[3:59:17.260 --> 3:59:21.980]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:21.980 --> 3:59:26.460]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer
[3:59:26.460 --> 3:59:28.580]  through painful power outages again.
[3:59:28.580 --> 3:59:31.020]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[3:59:31.020 --> 3:59:36.900]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and
[3:59:36.900 --> 3:59:38.820]  get off the grid today.
[3:59:38.820 --> 3:59:45.340]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[3:59:45.340 --> 3:59:49.580]  877-327-0365.
[3:59:49.580 --> 3:59:50.580]  Don't wait.
[3:59:50.580 --> 3:59:51.580]  Call today.
[3:59:51.580 --> 3:59:55.980]  Coast to coast and in your face.
[3:59:55.980 --> 3:59:58.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
