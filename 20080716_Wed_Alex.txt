[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:14.000 --> 00:30.000]  Welcome, my friends. The global financial meltdown is intensifying as we track it day by day here.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  The zombie population doesn't even have the slightest inkling what's happening,
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  though we are able to unlock some of the zombies out of the false realities.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  They're living in the false constructs that they have been captured by.
[00:47.000 --> 00:57.000]  But still, the enemy operations expand against humanity worldwide with devastating results on the population.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Their black-up eugenics programs of extermination and planting the population with cancer viruses,
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  blocking cancer treatment, carrying out aerial chemical, biological, radiological spring continues.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  Their intensified attacks are mainly focused in the third world and against government forces.
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  Their own forces upon discharge, of course, are implanted with the pathogens to kill them.
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  Because we had another medical doctor, Dr. Stan Montief, on yesterday reading all the declassified public documents
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  where your government is murdering you, police, and military.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  Of course, you're still living in the false paradigm. Most of you have been so programmed you're unable to break out.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  You have been systematically programmed to be laughing right now. It is not funny. That's part of your programming.
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.000]  We hope that just as a challenge, you would check out our claims and find out you and your family are being soft killed right now.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  Richard Cook, a former White House economic analyst, will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:53.000 --> 02:03.000]  Then we have Bob Chapman joining us at 12.30 noon today, an hour and a half for his daily visit during the meltdown.
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  Then I'm going to get some to the esoteric agenda of the New World Order and their language.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  Their ancient esoteric language that is all around us. That's how they all communicate with each other.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  They're all taught the language. It is a code broken centuries ago and available to all of us,
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  but the average person is not even aware of it. The Global Crime Syndicate has its own language.
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  We'll be breaking that down with Freeman coming up today on the radio show for an hour and a half,
[02:34.000 --> 02:42.000]  the last hour and a half of the show in studio that will be live on PrisonPlanet.tv for all PrisonPlanet.tv members
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  and for the listeners on the InfoWars audio streams. We'll be skipping some of the breaks for you there.
[02:47.000 --> 02:57.000]  So that is coming up today. In the news, Bank Run continues as failed IndieMac fails to deliver the money to their people.
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  People show up and say, okay, the feds have backed this bank. I'm here to get my money and the police say,
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  if you complain and yell, we will arrest you. And they say, come back tomorrow and you come back tomorrow.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  We're now three days into this and they say no money. And that's what you're going to look forward to.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  You don't even get your $100,000 back in many cases. And if you complain about it, you will be tasered.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  And if that isn't enough for you, we'll just shoot you. And when the cops' families homeless too, they'll love it.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  You know, it's all part of it. It's all part of loving the private bankers.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  You know, I was thinking about it today. We've told you everything was going to happen.
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  I'm going to talk about that coming up. We just keep laying out everything that's going to happen.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  It just keeps happening. And I care about the police.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  It's just as disgusted with them as I am with the general public.
[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  It is just the mindlessness, the wanton ignorance.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  You're going to serve your masters. I know you are.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  And it isn't until your old men, most of you, and old women, you'll cry your guts out seeing what fools you were.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  But at least then you'll realize that you were wrong and that's what matters, isn't it?
[04:06.000 --> 04:15.000]  Repenting in the end is what matters. Changing your mind and your heart, even if it's the very end,
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  even it's when you're dying of cancer at 35 and you finally go research and find out that we told you the truth
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  and had all the government documents.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  At least before you die, you can tell your children, your wife, and some of your buddies on the force
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  that when they die, it's their government. It's their criminal owners.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  We're going to come back and cover the intensifying criminal activity when we get back.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones, 110% committed.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[05:03.000 --> 05:08.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.000]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[05:38.000 --> 05:44.000]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  That's A-L-K-A-Vision.com or call 269-344-3420 today.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[06:05.000 --> 06:08.000]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[06:14.000 --> 06:21.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  The Old America is making great progress toward a world government.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  They're after power. That's their afternoon.

[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming,
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  but it will be available sometime in the future?
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  At Leysmed Inc., the future is here.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[07:06.000 --> 07:09.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation,
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  And many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Laser technology at its best.
[07:30.000 --> 07:37.000]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255-0528.
[07:37.000 --> 07:45.000]  That's 501-255-0528 or visit our website at leysmedinc.com.
[07:45.000 --> 08:10.000]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  This morning, driving in to the office,
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  I was thinking about all the hundreds of things we've talked about
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  that have come true and happened.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  I went on air and I said the government,
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  criminal elements of it are going to attack the World Trade Centers
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  because I knew they bombed it before.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  By the way, that's publicly admitted,
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  but the average person still doesn't know that.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  The 93 event is open and shut.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  CBS News, New York Times, yeah, the feds created the group,
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  cooked the bomb, gave them the detonator,
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  and commanded the whole operation, but that was provocateur.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  But I'm already digressing.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  You see, I try to just be, you know, give you basic info
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  and I tend to zoom in on each little point and document it.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  But we talked about how they were going to attack the World Trade Center,
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  blaming on their asset, and some have been lauding.
[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  It happened.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  I said it'll happen in the next few months.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  I talked about how in Seattle,
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  they were going to use federalized riot police to attack the people
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  that they would have agent provocateurs there
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  because I'd seen the media prepping the public for that to happen.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  And we told you you'd see bank runs.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  We told you you'd see a devaluing dollar.
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  We told you gas would be $4 a gallon by the summer of 2008.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  We told you that in the late spring of 2006,
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  two-plus years before it happened,
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  we told you they wouldn't attack Iraq in March of 2002.
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  It'll be March of 03.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  They attacked exactly when we said a year before.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  We predicted a year before exactly when it would happen.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  We have basically laid out everything that's going to happen,
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  everything that's going to develop.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  Of course, we've broken down the fact that it will go from 1 in 33 with cancer
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  to 1 in 3, and then 1 in 2, and then everyone having it, basically.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  And now they're preparing to announce that 1 in 2 will now be getting it.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  They've gone from 1 in several thousand getting diabetes to now 1 in 5,
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  some races of groups, 1 in 2.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  These are all genetically engineered bio-weapon plugs with chemical combos,
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  and we have all the documents and all the facts,
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  and the CIA and the Centers for Disease Control,
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  and the Navy and the United Nations World Health Organization.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  They've been caught all over the world doing it,
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  and all these prominent scientists and doctors and Nobel Prize winners
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  blow the whistle, and it might make it in a foreign newspaper.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  Eyewitnesses come out and blow the whistle only to be murdered months later,
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  tortured to death, and then it's a minor footnote.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  The media never points out, oh, they exposed this government program and were murdered.
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  It's just, oh, they got tortured to death by some kids.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  The police came, they were cut up and splattered all over the walls.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  It looked like they'd been tortured for days.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  It's no big deal. Some kids, the police say.
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  Some young kids probably did it, yeah.
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  Over and over again, a message to everybody, keep your mouth shut.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  And I scan around maybe an hour a day looking at what people are saying,
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  and I look on our message boards, I look on the YouTube channels,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  I scan, reading fast, and the debunking sites.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  And the latest thing is that they're saying the dollar is not devalued,
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  prices are not up, they're all saying it in unison,
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  the scent con boys, their minions, their mockingbirds, their weak-minded camp followers.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  They're saying the government doesn't take children and radiate them,
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  or doesn't test pesticides on CPS kidnap kids,
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  that matter if it's in thousands of news articles,
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  or the variant is they're joking about it.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  The new thing is, I guess to keep their morale up is,
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  yeah, we're killing kids.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  So what? We're going to kill you too.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  They're also all over the message boards,
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  and you can track them back by their handles to their MySpaces,
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  they're in uniforms.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  You'll see them bragging in their uniform with their PsiOp patch,
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  and they're just letting everybody know who they are,
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  and we're going to work on some articles showing all this,
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  we're getting snapshots of them and things,
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  and they're just on their saying, yeah, and they're coming on our message boards now saying, yeah,
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  we've built camps and we're going to kill you,
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  and yeah, we're testing stuff on kids, we need to.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  We are the dark side, and that's the end of it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  Don't you understand, you fools, that your masters will destroy you as well?
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  Don't you understand evil's not funny or tough or manly?
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Don't you understand it doesn't intimidate us?
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  Those of us on the side of the goodness and the side of light,
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  those of us working in the light,
[12:43.000 --> 12:47.000]  it only makes us sad for you that you were overtaken and captured by the dark side
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  and have been lost.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  It only reaffirms our courage and our will 100%.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  And I know what the term now means, 110%.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  I joke about it when I played football and would laugh at the coaches.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  110% means you're so dedicated, you're burning with desire,
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000]  and you can't even fathom the will and the commitment.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  It means you want to give more than you've got,
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  and you're disgusted with yourself for not being able to perform
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  at the levels you need to against the enemy.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's what 110% is, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  And I just feel sorry for all of you,
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  and there's different categories.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  There's the mindless, dumbed-down people who believe
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  that mom and apple pie is what the government is
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  and are so weak-minded that they can't admit to themselves what's happening.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  Then you've got some of the more intelligent types
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  who just convince themselves with double-think,
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  because it's too horrifying for them, and they rationalize,
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  and yeah, we're not perfect, but we're the only government there is,
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  and we've just got to keep going and following our orders,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  and they've got to just shut off the thinking process.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  But then you've got the psychopath types,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  who enjoy being sadistic, who love power,
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  who only worship the tyranny above them,
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  and who are scared of their masters and so enthusiastically serve,
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  and then carry out tyranny against those under them.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  And there's other types as well, but the most dangerous type is the very pious,
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  very focused, again pious on the surface,
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  who really is, I don't know what you call it.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  I've run into them, I've read their writings,
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  I've seen interviews with the top globalist.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  They're very focused, they're very professional, they're very serious,
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  and they are very cold, and they say,
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  look, if we don't exterminate the mass of humanity,
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  and if we don't be the most evil force there is on earth,
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  and dominate and take control, and be totally merciless,
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  we will end up being dominated by some other group,
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  and we don't know what that other dominant group will do,
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  and we have the will to protect ourselves and our family, our houses,
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  they call their organization's houses, it's the old royal term,
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  and there's less than 50 main houses,
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  and they cold-bloodedly are in alliance, intermarried,
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  and they say, look, this is too incredible, we're on a planet,
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  and we've got all this advanced technology,
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  we could extend our lives almost indefinitely,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  we are threatened by a mass of humanity,
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  and new elites that may rise and defeat us militarily,
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  and in cold-bloodedly, we don't want to die,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  we want to see the new advanced technologies,
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  we want to be part of the future,
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  and it's too important for us selfishly to have a total lock on the future,
[15:33.000 --> 15:38.000]  and a monopoly of power, and a guarantee that we get life extension,
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  and a guarantee that we get to go to the stars,
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  and a guarantee that we get to go to the next level of human development,
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  and because the mass of 6 billion people and other elites that still exist
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  at a lower level threaten us,
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  we are going to cold-bloodedly set up a computer scanning,
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  tracking control grid on a planetary scale,
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  we are going to put in a military world government,
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  and then we are going to orderly sterilize and exterminate the mass of humanity,
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.000]  and only a few hundred thousand of us,
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  because they tell their minions they're only going to kill 80 to 90%,
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  but you really read the higher level think tank documents,
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.000]  the higher level professors who are managing large sectors of this,
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  and they say that there's going to be a 99.99% extermination,
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  but they can't tell their minions,
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  because a lot of people have been let in on this,
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  that it's going to happen to them too.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  Now I don't know if they're going to be able to carry it out,
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  I don't know if it's going to work, but it looks like it is,
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  and then every day I am crushed every night when I go to bed,
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  I went to bed about 11 o'clock last night,
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  which is early for me,
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  I played there for about 30 minutes in bed with the light,
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  the starlight shining through the windows,
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  and I was looking at the wall and I thought,
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  my God, I'm the biggest thing fighting this individually.
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  I am the most focused, the most articulate, Alex Jones.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  I mean, I thought about the magnitude of that,
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  the responsibility of that,
[17:06.000 --> 17:13.000]  and I am a sputtering, babbling hillbilly
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  who walks almost hunched over,
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  and I'm the best we've got against these people.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Now I am smart, I can't analyze systems and integrate them,
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  I kind of have some idiot savant characteristics,
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  but when it comes to actually leading or trying to organize things,
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  it scares the daylights out of me too,
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  and by scared in the right word, it shakes me,
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  it upsets me that I'm the best there is,
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  and that my listeners are the best there is.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  I mean, you're great compared to other people,
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  but I'm telling you folks, we're all pathetic,
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.000]  we're all weak and decadent,
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  we were brought up in a decadent system,
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  we were brought up in a scientific dictatorship,
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  we were fed false terms and semantics,
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  and we have to really shake ourselves to our core
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  and really be reborn into a greater understanding,
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  and I don't even mean that in a spiritual sense,
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  but when you come down to it, that really is what it is,
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  but I mean just like, shake yourself and dunk your head in some ice water
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  and look around you.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  I mean, I want to tell the military and special ops and people,
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  this is the ultimate battle, this is the ultimate war,
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  whether you believe me or not, whether you join our side,
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  the ragtag little remnants of what's left of free humanity
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  that can only freely think at a degraded level,
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  poisoned as we are.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  I mean, I say to you,
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  whether you know you're under attack or not,
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  whether you know you're in the same ship with us,
[18:46.000 --> 18:47.000]  the same boat as us, you are.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  You're sitting in the same tree with us.
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  You've drawn the same lot as everybody else around you,
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  and the ultimate battle is the information war,
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  and you better look around you and realize
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  you've been fed to Sinfo, you've been fed false ideas,
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  you've been fed false paradigms, fables.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  As Dr. Doug Rocky and so many others have said,
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  they finally just wake up when there he was training troops
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  for martial law in the mid-90s,
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  and he's like, why am I here?
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  It was like suddenly he woke up out of a dream,
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.000]  he's like, my God, I'm here training to take American people's guns.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  I mean, it's just like we had Major General Stubblebine
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  on who was the head of Army Intelligence
[19:34.000 --> 19:35.000]  and all those block-out programs.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  They had special forces.
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  And finally, he just assessed the info and said,
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  my God, it's a global extermination plan.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  Then he went and found that all the documents did say that.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  This is real.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  It's more real than I can articulate.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  You understand?
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  We're in iron jaws right now.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  When making important financial decisions,
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  you should always know the facts.
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  up-to-date financial services.

[20:43.000 --> 20:47.000]  you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  I'm very proud to be here with you.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  9-11 was an inside job!
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR,
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  and you can make a sound shoutout.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  The day that we stop asking questions
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  is the day that we have allowed
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.520]  We've allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[21:19.520 --> 21:22.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[21:22.600 --> 21:25.640]  a global awakening has taken place.
[21:25.640 --> 21:28.200]  An inside job?
[21:28.200 --> 21:29.400]  How dare you?
[21:29.400 --> 21:32.280]  I don't think that the public is just in jail in 9-11.
[21:32.280 --> 21:33.920]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[21:33.920 --> 21:35.840]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:35.840 --> 21:38.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.680]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[21:40.680 --> 21:44.080]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[21:44.080 --> 21:45.120]  Truth rising.

[21:47.920 --> 21:50.200]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[21:50.200 --> 21:53.960]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[21:53.960 --> 21:56.240]  Gas prices are out of control.
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.440]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners
[21:58.440 --> 22:00.160]  to the Alex Jones show have done.
[22:00.160 --> 22:01.720]  Developed by a major oil company,
[22:01.720 --> 22:03.160]  a product that really works.
[22:03.160 --> 22:05.880]  Introducing SFRs protect a complete fuel system
[22:05.880 --> 22:06.960]  and engine treatment.
[22:06.960 --> 22:09.680]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[22:09.680 --> 22:11.440]  Fleet tested by major oil company,
[22:11.440 --> 22:13.480]  showing improvements in every car tested.
[22:13.480 --> 22:15.360]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money
[22:15.360 --> 22:17.160]  to have your injection system cleaned.
[22:17.160 --> 22:20.440]  Protecta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition
[22:20.440 --> 22:23.080]  in just one tank full and is safe for all cars.
[22:23.080 --> 22:25.200]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude
[22:25.200 --> 22:28.960]  fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.480]  due to poor gasoline quality.
[22:30.480 --> 22:33.040]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a protecta
[22:33.040 --> 22:35.360]  fuel system treatment for only $9.95
[22:35.360 --> 22:38.520]  and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.
[22:38.520 --> 22:40.640]  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back,
[22:40.640 --> 22:42.560]  go to OilCompanySecret.com.
[22:42.560 --> 22:47.480]  That's OilCompanySecret.com or call 888-USSFR1.
[22:47.480 --> 22:51.400]  That's 888-873-7371.
[22:53.400 --> 22:55.680]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.920]  was the likely cause of my painful joints,
[22:57.920 --> 22:59.720]  lack of energy and weight gain,
[22:59.720 --> 23:02.120]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet,
[23:02.120 --> 23:04.160]  but it just seems so difficult.
[23:04.160 --> 23:06.960]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer
[23:06.960 --> 23:09.800]  from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body
[23:09.800 --> 23:11.640]  even before I changed my diet
[23:11.640 --> 23:13.960]  by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[23:13.960 --> 23:15.240]  Drinking water?
[23:15.240 --> 23:16.920]  Now that's something I can handle.
[23:16.920 --> 23:18.520]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.120]  to explain all of the different options
[23:20.120 --> 23:22.560]  and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[23:22.560 --> 23:24.960]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything,
[23:24.960 --> 23:26.360]  for drinking, for cooking.
[23:26.360 --> 23:28.000]  And since I've been drinking the water,
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.560]  I have more energy, my joint pains are gone
[23:30.560 --> 23:32.560]  and I already lost seven pounds
[23:32.560 --> 23:34.680]  and my skin looks great.
[23:34.680 --> 23:39.600]  Give them a call today at 877-356-2508
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.720]  to find out which ionizer is right for you.
[23:41.720 --> 23:44.000]  They offer a full 30-day money-back guarantee
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.600]  and free shipping, so there's absolutely no risk.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.400]  You can visit them on the web at SnyderHealth.com.
[23:49.400 --> 23:52.360]  That's S-N-Y-D-E-R-Health.com.
[23:55.240 --> 23:58.280]  The preacher man says it's the end of time
[23:58.280 --> 24:01.760]  and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[24:06.520 --> 24:09.560]  The interest is up and the stock market's down
[24:09.560 --> 24:13.720]  and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.120]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[24:21.120 --> 24:23.520]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and the...
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.680]  Let me try to boil this down as simply as possible.
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.080]  I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive
[24:32.080 --> 24:32.920]  and a country boy...
[24:32.920 --> 24:35.520]  When you're driving along through traffic in your town,
[24:35.520 --> 24:38.080]  country folks can't survive.
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.040]  Look at the people around you.
[24:40.040 --> 24:41.840]  They're looking straight ahead.
[24:41.840 --> 24:45.680]  They don't question how that highway got laid down.
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.800]  They don't question how power is brought to those light poles
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.600]  or the red lights, the traffic lights.
[24:53.600 --> 24:55.880]  They don't question how the police are commanded
[24:55.880 --> 24:59.040]  or how that echelon operates.
[24:59.040 --> 25:01.120]  They don't question the planet they live on.
[25:01.120 --> 25:04.240]  They don't question where food comes from at the grocery store.
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.840]  They just go into their little specialized job
[25:06.840 --> 25:08.440]  and then go home and watch entertainment
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.400]  and play video games or have sex or take drugs
[25:11.400 --> 25:13.080]  and then get up the next day.
[25:13.080 --> 25:14.280]  And they don't care about their neighbor.
[25:14.280 --> 25:16.240]  They've been trained to be isolated,
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.800]  not just selfish but isolated individuals
[25:19.800 --> 25:23.920]  who only interface with their sitcoms or with their movies
[25:23.920 --> 25:26.600]  or maybe their buddies at the bar twice a week.
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.640]  But even then, their discussion is guided by the sports
[25:31.640 --> 25:33.480]  that are on the big screen TVs.
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.200]  And so our culture is dominated and steered
[25:38.200 --> 25:41.040]  by individuals who, when you read the books
[25:41.040 --> 25:42.960]  that they've written for each other,
[25:42.960 --> 25:44.720]  when you look at the ideologies of those
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.600]  that steer and control the media,
[25:46.600 --> 25:48.440]  it isn't liberal or conservative.
[25:49.600 --> 25:51.600]  It isn't black or white.
[25:51.600 --> 25:54.320]  It is, we are the private central banking families.
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.480]  We've taken control of the world's banks 100 years ago
[25:57.480 --> 26:01.080]  and they say we want a scientific dictatorship
[26:01.080 --> 26:02.720]  that can never be overthrown.
[26:02.720 --> 26:04.640]  And they went to the top scientist in Germany
[26:04.640 --> 26:06.320]  and England in the U.S.
[26:06.320 --> 26:09.560]  And they said, tell us and Russia, Pavlov and others,
[26:09.560 --> 26:11.040]  how do we do it?
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.880]  And they all came back with reports
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.040]  and they still have every major psychology department
[26:16.040 --> 26:18.040]  working on different pieces of it today.
[26:20.160 --> 26:22.640]  90% of the UT psychology department,
[26:22.640 --> 26:25.240]  two miles from where I sit is all Pentagon DARPA.
[26:26.480 --> 26:28.920]  Whole floors when I was there a few years ago
[26:28.920 --> 26:31.920]  were just how to flicker a TV rate to mesmerize you.
[26:31.920 --> 26:34.200]  And that was the areas that were declassified
[26:34.200 --> 26:36.080]  that I was allowed into.
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.200]  One research facility, one wing, one university.
[26:43.200 --> 26:45.160]  The whole thing was mind control.
[26:49.080 --> 26:51.800]  And again, that's only one small facet of it.
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.120]  When you're watching CNN or Fox,
[26:55.120 --> 26:56.840]  do you notice that suddenly all your troubles
[26:56.840 --> 26:58.480]  are off your mind even if it's horrible things
[26:58.480 --> 27:00.000]  are happening on television?
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.760]  Suddenly you catch yourself with your mouth hanging open.
[27:02.760 --> 27:04.480]  I was watching the Jesse Ventura announcement
[27:04.480 --> 27:07.040]  a couple of nights ago on this Monday night.
[27:08.120 --> 27:10.880]  So we turned the television on, children were asleep.
[27:10.880 --> 27:13.720]  And I caught myself in five minutes just totally zoned out.
[27:13.720 --> 27:14.720]  And it was relaxing.
[27:14.720 --> 27:18.480]  I wasn't at this height than level of mental activity
[27:18.480 --> 27:21.480]  and awareness, which is invigorating,
[27:21.480 --> 27:24.000]  but you're at this level all the time, it gets exhausting.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.640]  And I caught myself just just watching Anderson Cooper
[27:28.640 --> 27:31.800]  and why they had one screen at an angle
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.640]  with stuff moving on it and letters and words and video.
[27:34.640 --> 27:36.840]  They had five or six other video screens in the back.
[27:36.840 --> 27:38.440]  They had video scrolling at the bottom.
[27:38.440 --> 27:40.560]  They had missed with subliminals,
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.920]  which they admit they're doing all over the screen.
[27:42.920 --> 27:44.960]  And that's one type of mind control.
[27:44.960 --> 27:46.680]  There were scores at work there.
[27:50.680 --> 27:53.880]  And in the video field, there were all those screens
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.960]  and that's 30, 40 year old technology.
[27:57.960 --> 28:00.480]  When they had it down pat, because your mind,
[28:00.480 --> 28:02.800]  your conscious mind can't lock in
[28:02.800 --> 28:04.480]  on more than one television screen.
[28:05.520 --> 28:07.760]  Well, they, you know, one thing happening.
[28:07.760 --> 28:10.240]  Let's say you see a cheetah chasing a gazelle
[28:10.240 --> 28:11.920]  in one of the screens.
[28:11.920 --> 28:13.920]  You'll tend to hone in on the one you wanna look at,
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.000]  but your brain is taking it all in.
[28:19.240 --> 28:22.320]  The other seven screens, not counting the big screen
[28:22.320 --> 28:24.720]  that has Anderson Cooper standing in front of it.
[28:24.720 --> 28:28.720]  And so it is a scientific fact.
[28:28.720 --> 28:30.960]  Your conscious mind, your discernment
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.040]  within seconds is shut off.
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.280]  Within seconds, your discernment is shut off.
[28:45.960 --> 28:48.000]  And you are just accepting and absorbing
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.080]  everything it tells you.
[28:50.080 --> 28:52.960]  An example, my uncle was here during the holidays
[28:52.960 --> 28:54.720]  and he doesn't watch a lot of TV, but he likes
[28:54.720 --> 28:56.000]  to watch college football.
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.080]  And I'm sitting there and I go,
[28:58.080 --> 28:59.600]  don't you see that on the screen?
[28:59.600 --> 29:02.040]  Don't you see that for about a half a second,
[29:02.040 --> 29:03.480]  they are flashing an advertisement.
[29:03.480 --> 29:04.560]  This was public.
[29:05.600 --> 29:06.560]  I forget what game it was.
[29:06.560 --> 29:07.400]  He goes, I don't see it.
[29:07.400 --> 29:10.000]  And I said, you're relaxed in your chair.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.440]  I said, get up, shake your head, focus.
[29:12.440 --> 29:14.520]  I go, they're doing it once a minute.
[29:14.520 --> 29:15.360]  And it was hard for me.
[29:15.360 --> 29:17.120]  I had to stay totally focused.
[29:17.120 --> 29:19.120]  And he finally after about five minutes goes,
[29:19.120 --> 29:19.960]  oh, I just saw it.
[29:19.960 --> 29:23.040]  Oh my God, it was just there.
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.960]  I mean, they've got you so mesmerized folks,
[29:25.960 --> 29:28.920]  you're not even seeing half seconds subliminals now.
[29:30.960 --> 29:31.800]  Understand?
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.240]  And that was just advertising.
[29:35.640 --> 29:36.960]  You see?
[29:36.960 --> 29:39.160]  Now that's only one, one millionth
[29:39.160 --> 29:41.360]  of everything that's going on, but I just told you.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:46.840 --> 29:49.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:53.000 --> 29:55.080]  Of the three million plus edible food plants
[29:55.080 --> 29:57.120]  that grow on earth, no other single plant
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.680]  can compare with the nutritional value of the powder,
[29:59.680 --> 30:01.680]  seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[30:10.360 --> 30:14.760]  that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[30:14.760 --> 30:18.240]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.

[31:54.800 --> 31:56.520]  in your shampoos and detergents?
[31:56.520 --> 32:00.280]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients,
[32:00.280 --> 32:01.680]  most of which are synthetic.
[32:01.680 --> 32:03.200]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[33:47.840 --> 33:51.080]  Old Smokey's got his ears on and he's hot on your trail.
[33:51.080 --> 33:54.040]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[33:54.040 --> 33:57.560]  But Old Smokey doesn't know he's not part of the establishment either.
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.160]  In fact, he's despised by the new world order.
[34:01.160 --> 34:04.520]  That's a question, Smokey.
[34:04.520 --> 34:09.800]  You're gonna realize that you're either with the American people
[34:09.800 --> 34:12.040]  in liberty and freedom or you are with the terrorists?
[34:12.040 --> 34:26.680]  We'll be talking to our guest, Richard C. Cook, here in just a moment.
[34:26.680 --> 34:28.680]  Be sure and check out the new PrismPlanet.com.
[34:28.680 --> 34:31.680]  But if you like the old one, just go to classic.prismplanet.com.
[34:31.680 --> 34:33.680]  And it's all there for you on the old site.
[34:33.680 --> 34:37.680]  He's bound to die, load it up and truck it.
[34:37.680 --> 34:40.680]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[34:40.680 --> 34:42.680]  We've got a long way to go.
[34:42.680 --> 34:45.680]  And it's short time to get there.
[34:45.680 --> 34:48.680]  He's bound to watch your bandit run.
[34:48.680 --> 34:51.680]  Old Smokey's got their ears on.
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.680]  He's hot on your trail.
[34:53.680 --> 34:56.680]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[34:56.680 --> 34:58.680]  So you've got to dodge it.
[34:58.680 --> 35:00.680]  You've got to duck it.
[35:00.680 --> 35:02.680]  You've got to keep that piece for trucking.
[35:02.680 --> 35:05.680]  Just put that hammer down and give it here.
[35:05.680 --> 35:07.680]  He's bound to go dead up high.
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.680]  Quite a few videos that we can play the audio of here.
[35:11.680 --> 35:13.680]  But I'm sure you've all seen it.
[35:13.680 --> 35:15.680]  It's not just IndieMac, though.
[35:15.680 --> 35:18.680]  There have been runs on banks all over the West Coast.
[35:18.680 --> 35:20.680]  Some of them have been running out of money.
[35:20.680 --> 35:23.680]  Then they direct people to other branches.
[35:23.680 --> 35:25.680]  And then they've been able to keep supplying the money.
[35:25.680 --> 35:27.680]  But at IndieMac, they can't do it.
[35:27.680 --> 35:30.680]  It's billions of dollars, even in cash assets,
[35:30.680 --> 35:33.680]  that people are unable to get out in their life savings.
[35:33.680 --> 35:35.680]  And there's video of the police saying,
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.680]  don't yell, don't scream, and come back tomorrow.
[35:38.680 --> 35:40.680]  They have the letters in their hands saying,
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.680]  no, I was here last Friday.
[35:41.680 --> 35:42.680]  I was here Monday.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.680]  I was here Tuesday.
[35:43.680 --> 35:45.680]  And they just say, hey, go.
[35:45.680 --> 35:48.680]  Even some of them showing up are off-duty police.
[35:48.680 --> 35:49.680]  That means nothing.
[35:49.680 --> 35:51.680]  Look, the money isn't there.
[35:51.680 --> 35:54.680]  The banks have just a few percentages,
[35:54.680 --> 35:56.680]  just a few percentage points of actual cash
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.680]  in their vaults compared to the digital dollars that are there.
[36:01.680 --> 36:04.680]  This is all being done by design to implode
[36:04.680 --> 36:06.680]  the economy to consolidate your wealth.
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.680]  This is a neo-feudalism.
[36:08.680 --> 36:12.680]  We have the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked in 2002.
[36:12.680 --> 36:15.680]  I have been warning you weekly and now the last year daily
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.680]  that this is their plan and that political will
[36:20.680 --> 36:23.680]  to inform the public of how this is by design
[36:23.680 --> 36:27.680]  may allow us to put in policies that will reverse this.
[36:27.680 --> 36:29.680]  Whether it's the head of the New York Business School
[36:29.680 --> 36:32.680]  or Joseph Sticklet's former chief economist, World Bank,
[36:32.680 --> 36:34.680]  or whether it's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[36:34.680 --> 36:35.680]  the father of Reaganomics,
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.680]  or whether it's one of the biggest and most successful newsletter
[36:39.680 --> 36:41.680]  guys out there in history, Bob Chapman,
[36:41.680 --> 36:44.680]  or Richard C. Cook, who's written for the Washington Post
[36:44.680 --> 36:46.680]  and all these other big publications,
[36:46.680 --> 36:49.680]  consulted for NASA, Space and Security News,
[36:49.680 --> 36:54.680]  Washington Monthly, Houston Post,
[36:54.680 --> 36:56.680]  of course, worked in the Treasury,
[36:56.680 --> 37:01.680]  a high-level policy and analyst advising the White House.
[37:01.680 --> 37:03.680]  If you name it, he's saying the same thing.
[37:03.680 --> 37:06.680]  We're going to get his analysis right now
[37:06.680 --> 37:09.680]  and he writes for global research.
[37:09.680 --> 37:11.680]  He writes for a lot of other fine publications
[37:11.680 --> 37:14.680]  and has his own website, of course, that we'll tell you about.
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.680]  But I want to get him on for the next hour.
[37:16.680 --> 37:19.680]  Then Bob Chapman joins us as this crisis speeds up
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.680]  even faster than I had thought it would.
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.680]  Mr. Cook, thank you for coming on with us.
[37:24.680 --> 37:26.680]  Good morning, Alex.
[37:26.680 --> 37:27.680]  Can you break down?
[37:27.680 --> 37:29.680]  I know you go over the history of banking
[37:29.680 --> 37:31.680]  and the last time you were on with us
[37:31.680 --> 37:33.680]  and who these elites are.
[37:33.680 --> 37:35.680]  But today, I'd like you to break down
[37:35.680 --> 37:37.680]  your forecast of what you previously said,
[37:37.680 --> 37:39.680]  meshing with what we're now witnessing.
[37:39.680 --> 37:41.680]  It looks like a carbon copy,
[37:41.680 --> 37:43.680]  and then where you see things going in the short term
[37:43.680 --> 37:45.680]  and the midterm and the long term, sir.
[37:45.680 --> 37:49.680]  Well, what we're seeing is the ongoing collapse
[37:49.680 --> 37:52.680]  of the United States economy.
[37:52.680 --> 37:56.680]  It really began this phase last summer,
[37:56.680 --> 37:59.680]  late last summer, almost a year ago,
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.680]  with the beginning of the big financial institutions,
[38:06.680 --> 38:08.680]  particularly the investment banks,
[38:08.680 --> 38:11.680]  being hit by the subprime mortgage crisis
[38:11.680 --> 38:14.680]  and beginning to lose their solvency.
[38:14.680 --> 38:18.680]  The banking directors at the Federal Reserve
[38:18.680 --> 38:22.680]  and the other international bankers out of Europe
[38:22.680 --> 38:24.680]  and the central banks and other countries
[38:24.680 --> 38:27.680]  began to pump what they call liquidity
[38:27.680 --> 38:29.680]  into these institutions.
[38:29.680 --> 38:33.680]  And as we know, beginning a few months ago,
[38:33.680 --> 38:36.680]  the Federal Reserve opened its discount window
[38:36.680 --> 38:38.680]  in New York, not just to the commercial banks,
[38:38.680 --> 38:40.680]  the traditional commercial banks,
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.680]  but also to the investment banks
[38:42.680 --> 38:45.680]  that were so heavily leveraged
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.680]  through the subprime securities that they were holding.
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.680]  Now, all of that has pretty much run its course
[38:53.680 --> 38:56.680]  and we're now seeing the crisis extending
[38:56.680 --> 38:59.680]  into the producing economy.
[38:59.680 --> 39:03.680]  We're seeing huge layoffs at the financial institutions
[39:03.680 --> 39:05.680]  at the investment banks.
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.680]  We saw just recently this huge downsizing plan
[39:08.680 --> 39:10.680]  coming through from General Motors.
[39:10.680 --> 39:13.680]  We're seeing continued outsourcing of U.S. jobs.
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.680]  We're seeing the sale of more and more U.S. businesses
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.680]  to foreigners, including the recent sale
[39:22.680 --> 39:24.680]  of Anheuser-Busch.
[39:24.680 --> 39:27.680]  And so what we are now beginning to witness
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.680]  is not just the collapse of the financial economy,
[39:31.680 --> 39:34.680]  but the domino effect where that begins to roll over
[39:34.680 --> 39:37.680]  into the producing economy of men and women
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.680]  who go to work every day.
[39:39.680 --> 39:41.680]  Their banks are now seizing up.
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.680]  And so it's really the beginning of the phase
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.680]  where everyday life starts to be affected
[39:49.680 --> 39:51.680]  much more than it has in the past.
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.680]  The unemployment figures are going to keep going up.
[39:55.680 --> 39:58.680]  People are going to lose their jobs.
[39:58.680 --> 40:01.680]  Foreclosures are going to continue.
[40:01.680 --> 40:04.680]  So we're really entering the phase that's most similar
[40:04.680 --> 40:11.680]  to what we saw in the Great Recession of 1979 to 83,
[40:11.680 --> 40:13.680]  which was the Paul Volcker-induced recession,
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.680]  which was the worst one since the Great Depression.
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.680]  And then before too long, it does look as though
[40:18.680 --> 40:21.680]  we're going to be starting to get into Great Depression territory.
[40:21.680 --> 40:23.680]  So we're now beginning the wasting,
[40:23.680 --> 40:26.680]  like someone in a lifeboat who hasn't eaten for a week.
[40:26.680 --> 40:28.680]  The body is now eating muscle.
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.680]  Yes, that's a good analogy.
[40:32.680 --> 40:34.680]  The neocons are all over talk radio,
[40:34.680 --> 40:36.680]  running around saying it's a conspiracy theory,
[40:36.680 --> 40:39.680]  the dollar is strong, all is well,
[40:39.680 --> 40:41.680]  and calling us communists.
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.680]  It is unbelievable how delusional their camp followers are.
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.680]  Well, I think we have to realize that the neocons,
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.680]  so-called, this includes the whole party
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.680]  that began the Iraq war, the current Iraq war,
[41:00.680 --> 41:03.680]  which has pretty much been the war party
[41:03.680 --> 41:08.680]  that has driven us to this hugely expensive conflict
[41:08.680 --> 41:10.680]  in the Middle East.
[41:10.680 --> 41:14.680]  They don't really work for the United States.
[41:14.680 --> 41:19.680]  This group really works for the international bankers,
[41:19.680 --> 41:25.680]  the financial elite that straddles all of the nations of the world
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.680]  and who control the monetary systems of all nations,
[41:30.680 --> 41:32.680]  including the United States.
[41:32.680 --> 41:38.680]  And what I believe, Alex, is that what they are really trying to do
[41:38.680 --> 41:42.680]  is to use the financial crisis to drive us
[41:42.680 --> 41:45.680]  into an escalated war in the Middle East.
[41:45.680 --> 41:48.680]  I think this is really the connection between
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.680]  what we're seeing in the financial world
[41:52.680 --> 41:55.680]  and what's going on overseas.
[41:55.680 --> 41:57.680]  There are part and parcel of the same policy.
[41:57.680 --> 41:59.680]  Well, sir, I want to look at the big...
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.680]  The neocons who are driving this.
[42:00.680 --> 42:02.680]  Sure, and I'm going to give you the floor here
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.680]  because I want you to walk through your analysis
[42:05.680 --> 42:07.680]  because I like to get the people on who predicted
[42:07.680 --> 42:09.680]  what's going to happen accurately.
[42:09.680 --> 42:11.680]  You've been doing that for many years now
[42:11.680 --> 42:14.680]  and it meshes, dovetails with the other analysts we're having on,
[42:14.680 --> 42:17.680]  but not just as a choir.
[42:17.680 --> 42:19.680]  You're all seeing a little bit different here,
[42:19.680 --> 42:22.680]  seeing different perspectives from your knowledge base,
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.680]  from your research and being an analyst with NASA
[42:26.680 --> 42:28.680]  and, of course, in the Treasury Department
[42:28.680 --> 42:30.680]  and many other areas.
[42:30.680 --> 42:32.680]  You've got your own unique perspective.
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.680]  When I see the IMF World Bank plans saying they wanted to gut the U.S.
[42:36.680 --> 42:39.680]  like a third-world country by issuing us credit,
[42:39.680 --> 42:41.680]  we know it's predatory.
[42:41.680 --> 42:43.680]  Then you see them writing some, you know,
[42:43.680 --> 42:45.680]  things in the times of London, financial times,
[42:45.680 --> 42:47.680]  saying this is even so bad it may destroy us.
[42:47.680 --> 42:49.680]  They act like they're scared.
[42:49.680 --> 42:52.680]  Have they created something that may actually suck them
[42:52.680 --> 42:53.680]  into their own black hole?
[42:53.680 --> 42:55.680]  I want to get your take on that.
[42:55.680 --> 42:57.680]  I mean, basically, what led us to this?
[42:57.680 --> 43:00.680]  Is it, by design, are they in control of it?
[43:00.680 --> 43:02.680]  Where do you see it going?
[43:02.680 --> 43:04.680]  Is this meant to...
[43:04.680 --> 43:06.680]  I mean, obviously, Congress is even saying
[43:06.680 --> 43:08.680]  the Anheuser-Busch deal is because
[43:08.680 --> 43:10.680]  we're like a third-world country with a devalued currency.
[43:10.680 --> 43:12.680]  They can come in and buy it.
[43:12.680 --> 43:14.680]  I'm in another example.
[43:14.680 --> 43:16.680]  But, I mean, basically, you see those different questions
[43:16.680 --> 43:17.680]  I've thrown out.
[43:17.680 --> 43:19.680]  I want to look at why you think they've engineered this
[43:19.680 --> 43:22.680]  or do you think they've lost control?
[43:22.680 --> 43:25.680]  Well, you know, I'm an historian.
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.680]  I taught history and I write from a historical perspective.
[43:28.680 --> 43:31.680]  In fact, some people complain that my articles are too long
[43:31.680 --> 43:34.680]  because I always go back into history.
[43:34.680 --> 43:37.680]  But you really have to do that to understand what's going on
[43:37.680 --> 43:40.680]  because if people believe that what we're seeing
[43:40.680 --> 43:43.680]  is just a few stupid mistakes that were made,
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.680]  you know, maybe by Alan Greenspan or somebody like that,
[43:48.680 --> 43:51.680]  and what the Federal Reserve really should do
[43:51.680 --> 43:53.680]  is just let the collapse take place
[43:53.680 --> 43:56.680]  and sit tight on a high interest rate.
[43:56.680 --> 43:59.680]  Well, that's absurd because this situation
[43:59.680 --> 44:03.680]  has been developing really for a very long time.
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.680]  I think you have to understand, you know,
[44:08.680 --> 44:11.680]  the people who are learning about this,
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.680]  that you've got two things that have been going on hand in hand
[44:16.680 --> 44:20.680]  really for the last ever since America was founded.
[44:20.680 --> 44:24.680]  One, you have the industrial revolution.
[44:24.680 --> 44:27.680]  You have the application of science and technology
[44:27.680 --> 44:31.680]  to production, which has vastly increased
[44:31.680 --> 44:34.680]  the wealth of the world and the productive capability
[44:34.680 --> 44:36.680]  of the world along with the population
[44:36.680 --> 44:39.680]  and has allowed a gradual increase
[44:39.680 --> 44:45.680]  in the standard of living for decades and decades
[44:45.680 --> 44:48.680]  and generation after generation.
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.680]  Going hand in hand with that,
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.680]  you've had the growth of the private financial industry
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.680]  which has, from one point of view,
[44:59.680 --> 45:03.680]  fed the capital into the industrial system
[45:03.680 --> 45:05.680]  to allow it to grow,
[45:05.680 --> 45:08.680]  but on the other hand has been sitting on top of this,
[45:08.680 --> 45:13.680]  raking the profits off of it however they see fit.
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.680]  And that is what is really going on.
[45:16.680 --> 45:19.680]  What we're seeing is a very late phase
[45:19.680 --> 45:22.680]  of the harnessing of industrial potential
[45:22.680 --> 45:26.680]  by the financial elite, the users,
[45:26.680 --> 45:28.680]  the financial predators who work internationally
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.680]  and across borders.
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.680]  And they have taken down,
[45:32.680 --> 45:35.680]  if you really look at the history of the last century,
[45:35.680 --> 45:38.680]  and we're in really what you could call
[45:38.680 --> 45:41.680]  a hundred years' war if you go back to World War I,
[45:41.680 --> 45:44.680]  they have taken down successfully every nation
[45:44.680 --> 45:47.680]  that has tried to use its own resources,
[45:47.680 --> 45:50.680]  its own population, its own initiative,
[45:50.680 --> 45:53.680]  and its own wealth to create a positive,
[45:53.680 --> 45:56.680]  enduring standard of living for its own population.
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.680]  The financial elite of the world has taken down
[45:59.680 --> 46:02.680]  every nation that's attempted to do that,
[46:02.680 --> 46:04.680]  starting with World War I.
[46:04.680 --> 46:07.680]  Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia,
[46:07.680 --> 46:10.680]  the Ottoman Empire were all destroyed.
[46:10.680 --> 46:12.680]  And let me just add, let me just add,
[46:12.680 --> 46:14.680]  let me just add then go back to World War I,
[46:14.680 --> 46:16.680]  Club of Rome, CFR,
[46:16.680 --> 46:18.680]  Rand Corporation, which you've obviously read,
[46:18.680 --> 46:20.680]  sir, but for the audience,
[46:20.680 --> 46:22.680]  now they say, you're right,
[46:22.680 --> 46:24.680]  they want to fully absorb the industrial revolution,
[46:24.680 --> 46:27.680]  shut it down under bogus carbon tax controls,
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.680]  and bring in a global neo-futilism game over,
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.680]  because they want a monopoly of power,
[46:35.680 --> 46:37.680]  and they've gone to their scientist
[46:37.680 --> 46:40.680]  and behavioral psychologist and said a hundred years ago,
[46:40.680 --> 46:43.680]  how do we create an elite that is invincible,
[46:43.680 --> 46:45.680]  a revolution that is final,
[46:45.680 --> 46:47.680]  and they said, this is how you do it,
[46:47.680 --> 46:49.680]  what you are now describing.
[46:49.680 --> 46:51.680]  Yeah, that's correct.
[46:51.680 --> 46:55.680]  If you go on in history, and you look at World War II,
[46:55.680 --> 46:57.680]  which was fought and won,
[46:57.680 --> 46:59.680]  supposedly by the Allies,
[46:59.680 --> 47:01.680]  World War II really destroyed both the French
[47:01.680 --> 47:03.680]  and the British empires.
[47:03.680 --> 47:05.680]  It destroyed the Italian Empire,
[47:05.680 --> 47:08.680]  and it left standing only two nations.
[47:08.680 --> 47:10.680]  One was the Soviet Union,
[47:10.680 --> 47:12.680]  and one was the United States.
[47:12.680 --> 47:14.680]  Well, the Soviet Union was undermined
[47:14.680 --> 47:16.680]  and collapsed in 1991.
[47:16.680 --> 47:19.680]  That left the only nation
[47:19.680 --> 47:22.680]  that was really flourishing in its own right,
[47:22.680 --> 47:24.680]  the United States,
[47:24.680 --> 47:27.680]  the only nation that had the potential to oppose
[47:27.680 --> 47:29.680]  the international elite,
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.680]  the international financial capitalists,
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.680]  who wanted to take over every nation,
[47:34.680 --> 47:36.680]  and now it's the United States' turn.
[47:36.680 --> 47:39.680]  We are the last nation standing
[47:39.680 --> 47:42.680]  as a truly independent, free, powerful nation,
[47:42.680 --> 47:44.680]  at least we were,
[47:44.680 --> 47:46.680]  and now we are under attack,
[47:46.680 --> 47:48.680]  and it's the United States that's being taken down,
[47:48.680 --> 47:50.680]  and we're being taken down very rapidly.
[47:50.680 --> 47:52.680]  Richard C. Cook?
[47:52.680 --> 47:54.680]  This is not something that's out of control.
[47:54.680 --> 47:56.680]  This is something that was planned and is under control.
[47:56.680 --> 47:58.680]  I've never heard it put more succinctly or better.
[47:58.680 --> 48:00.680]  They admit all of it.
[48:00.680 --> 48:03.680]  I know this is hard to deal with, ladies and gentlemen,
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.680]  but the globalist under Lord Milner's direction
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.680]  and in planning openly wrote and said,
[48:09.680 --> 48:11.680]  we have to go in
[48:11.680 --> 48:14.680]  and destroy any nation that can stand before us,
[48:14.680 --> 48:16.680]  the world population study,
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.680]  the commission on population 44 to 49
[48:19.680 --> 48:22.680]  by the British government
[48:22.680 --> 48:24.680]  had the same findings
[48:24.680 --> 48:27.680]  and said that they even have to sacrifice their empire
[48:27.680 --> 48:30.680]  for this larger empire, this hegemonic system
[48:30.680 --> 48:32.680]  of the banks,
[48:32.680 --> 48:34.680]  and Lord Milner by the 20s
[48:34.680 --> 48:37.680]  described a Hitler type to build him up,
[48:37.680 --> 48:39.680]  pick his psychology,
[48:39.680 --> 48:42.680]  let him tear everything up to destroy Europe.
[48:42.680 --> 48:44.680]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[48:44.680 --> 48:46.680]  The Bazaars,
[48:46.680 --> 48:48.680]  by big banks funding,
[48:48.680 --> 48:50.680]  sending in the Bolsheviks,
[48:50.680 --> 48:52.680]  they are here to now give the U.S.
[48:52.680 --> 48:55.680]  the treatment that Germany and Russia have gotten,
[48:55.680 --> 48:58.680]  or the reorganization we saw with the CIA funding now,
[48:58.680 --> 49:01.680]  we are now about to be reorganized,
[49:01.680 --> 49:04.680]  and that means tens of millions murdered, death camps,
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.680]  if they have their way.
[49:06.680 --> 49:08.680]  Now folks, this is going to happen.
[49:08.680 --> 49:10.680]  Now that's my analysis, Mr. Cook.
[49:10.680 --> 49:15.680]  Yes, that does appear to be the direction that it's going in,
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.680]  and the way that it's being done
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.680]  is through the use of banking and debt,
[49:23.680 --> 49:26.680]  and the United States has, in a way,
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.680]  been set up for this because we have had,
[49:29.680 --> 49:31.680]  since our founding,
[49:31.680 --> 49:35.680]  a bank-based monetary system
[49:35.680 --> 49:38.680]  where the only way that money is introduced
[49:38.680 --> 49:42.680]  into circulation is through bank lending.
[49:42.680 --> 49:48.680]  And gradually, the build-up of that has created a situation
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.680]  where today we have, with a gross domestic product
[49:53.680 --> 49:56.680]  of approximately $13 trillion,
[49:56.680 --> 50:00.680]  a total debt burden that our economy is carrying
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.680]  that we estimate by the year 2010
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.680]  is probably going to hit $70 trillion.
[50:07.680 --> 50:10.680]  And it's a result of the phenomenon of compounding interest.
[50:10.680 --> 50:14.680]  And of course, compounding interest is that which is held by the banks
[50:14.680 --> 50:20.680]  and the people who are the owners and stockholders in the banks.
[50:20.680 --> 50:24.680]  But again, it's necessary to realize, as people are coming to do,
[50:24.680 --> 50:27.680]  that the banks are not really controlled within a nation.
[50:27.680 --> 50:30.680]  They're controlled at an international level.
[50:30.680 --> 50:32.680]  He writes for the Washington Post,
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.680]  Houston Post, consults for NASA,
[50:35.680 --> 50:38.680]  worked at the highest levels of policy in the Department of Treasury,
[50:38.680 --> 50:40.680]  advising the White House.
[50:40.680 --> 50:42.680]  He's Richard C. Cook.
[50:42.680 --> 50:44.680]  We're going to come back and tell you about his website
[50:44.680 --> 50:47.680]  and a lot more and let him continue to break down what's happening.
[50:47.680 --> 51:16.680]  I know it's bad, but at least you know now.
[51:16.680 --> 51:21.680]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[51:21.680 --> 51:27.680]  Now, 12,000 seeds giving you 5,000 pounds of food for just four pennies a pound.
[51:27.680 --> 51:31.680]  Without a long-term food solution, your choices are limited.

[51:46.680 --> 51:48.680]  Go to survivalistseeds.com.
[51:48.680 --> 51:53.680]  Do it now or become property of the New World Order.
[51:53.680 --> 51:58.680]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[51:58.680 --> 52:01.680]  I went to ground zero and we knew what to do,
[52:01.680 --> 52:02.680]  or at least we thought we did.
[52:02.680 --> 52:05.680]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.680]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[52:09.680 --> 52:14.680]  And EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[52:14.680 --> 52:18.680]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[52:18.680 --> 52:21.680]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[52:21.680 --> 52:25.680]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[52:25.680 --> 52:28.680]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[52:28.680 --> 52:34.680]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[52:34.680 --> 52:37.680]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[52:37.680 --> 52:40.680]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[52:40.680 --> 52:43.680]  and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[52:43.680 --> 52:46.680]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[52:46.680 --> 52:48.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[52:48.680 --> 52:52.680]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[52:52.680 --> 52:54.680]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us.
[52:54.680 --> 52:57.680]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.680]  without even knowing they've been robbed.
[52:59.680 --> 53:00.680]  How so, Clyde?
[53:00.680 --> 53:03.680]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[53:03.680 --> 53:04.680]  Just by waving it near you,
[53:04.680 --> 53:07.680]  I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[53:07.680 --> 53:08.680]  Just watch.
[53:08.680 --> 53:10.680]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[53:10.680 --> 53:12.680]  You gotta be kidding me.
[53:12.680 --> 53:15.680]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips,
[53:15.680 --> 53:17.680]  I figure we'll make a fortune.
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.680]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[53:19.680 --> 53:22.680]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[53:22.680 --> 53:23.680]  They make the secure sleeve.
[53:23.680 --> 53:27.680]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[53:27.680 --> 53:30.680]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.680]  No way.
[53:31.680 --> 53:34.680]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[53:34.680 --> 53:37.680]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[53:37.680 --> 53:38.680]  I already got some.
[53:38.680 --> 53:40.680]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[53:40.680 --> 53:45.680]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[53:45.680 --> 53:47.680]  idstronghold.com?
[53:47.680 --> 53:52.680]  Right, or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[53:57.680 --> 54:00.680]  The private banks took control of our nations.
[54:00.680 --> 54:05.680]  The few rogue countries or nations that aren't controlled by them, Serbia, Iraq,
[54:05.680 --> 54:10.680]  you notice they're being taken over, being overthrown, being bombarded.
[54:10.680 --> 54:15.680]  But the big prize, the wars that are meant to destroy our treasury and our name and our dollar,
[54:15.680 --> 54:18.680]  is about making the U.S. the target.
[54:18.680 --> 54:22.680]  I hate to use a child's analogy, but that seems to get through to some people.
[54:22.680 --> 54:27.680]  Remember in the final Star Wars episode, episode 3, Revenge of the Sith?
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.680]  You've got the senator who uses staged attacks to get more power,
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.680]  then he becomes emperor by attacking himself.
[54:35.680 --> 54:38.680]  Okay, well that's because George Lucas has even given interviews.
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.680]  He wrote that off of history, what other empires have done, what Caesar did.
[54:43.680 --> 54:46.680]  Okay, this is the type of thing that happens over and over again.
[54:46.680 --> 54:49.680]  You are the target, and why have they militarized the police?
[54:49.680 --> 54:52.680]  Why are they telling them that we have no rights?
[54:52.680 --> 54:54.680]  Why are they building FEMA camps?
[54:54.680 --> 54:56.680]  Because they're taking the country down.
[54:56.680 --> 55:01.680]  Mr. Cook, again, written for the Washington Post, many other big publications.
[55:01.680 --> 55:05.680]  Financial analysts analyze things for the federal government,
[55:05.680 --> 55:07.680]  Department of Treasury, and NASA.
[55:07.680 --> 55:09.680]  Continue, sir, breaking down now what they're doing.
[55:09.680 --> 55:11.680]  Is it going well for them?
[55:11.680 --> 55:13.680]  How do we fight back?
[55:13.680 --> 55:16.680]  Well, would it be okay if I mentioned my website?
[55:16.680 --> 55:17.680]  Oh, please.
[55:17.680 --> 55:25.680]  My website is www.RichardSeacook.com.
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.680]  The main thing that's on there now is my book on the Challenger Disaster,
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.680]  called Challenger Revealed, but I have a new book coming out this fall,
[55:35.680 --> 55:40.680]  which is called We Hold These Truths, The Hope of Monetary Reform,
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.680]  which is my book on monetary policy and monetary issues,
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.680]  and that will be also advertised on my website.
[55:47.680 --> 55:49.680]  Well, we've got 30 more minutes with you.
[55:49.680 --> 55:50.680]  I believe so.
[55:50.680 --> 55:52.680]  We'll go through that book that's coming out,
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.680]  and I certainly want to have you on when that happens.
[55:54.680 --> 55:56.680]  But give the website out again.
[55:56.680 --> 56:01.680]  It's www.RichardSeacook.com.
[56:01.680 --> 56:02.680]  Okay, we've gotten up to the point.
[56:02.680 --> 56:04.680]  Recap, because I interrupted a few times,
[56:04.680 --> 56:07.680]  Recap, this is by design, their own documents say it,
[56:07.680 --> 56:09.680]  and then where it's going.
[56:09.680 --> 56:16.680]  Well, let's go to the year 1970, 1971,
[56:16.680 --> 56:19.680]  because the current phase that we're seeing
[56:19.680 --> 56:23.680]  is really a result of actions that began during that decade,
[56:23.680 --> 56:27.680]  and I kind of, in my latest article that's come out,
[56:27.680 --> 56:29.680]  I refer to what I call the Three Amigos,
[56:29.680 --> 56:32.680]  trying to have a little bit of tongue-in-cheek there.
[56:32.680 --> 56:35.680]  The Three Amigos I call Henry Kissinger,
[56:35.680 --> 56:38.680]  Paul Volcker, and Alan Greenspan.
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.680]  Kissinger, well, Nixon's Secretary of State
[56:42.680 --> 56:45.680]  was the one who really made the U.S. dependent
[56:45.680 --> 56:47.680]  on the Middle East for oil,
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.680]  who gave billions of dollars to Israel for its war machine
[56:52.680 --> 56:54.680]  and created the Petra dollar
[56:54.680 --> 56:57.680]  to support our trade and fiscal deficits.
[56:57.680 --> 57:00.680]  And that's really when the current hyperinflation
[57:00.680 --> 57:04.680]  of the U.S. dollar began and the erosion of the U.S. dollar,
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.680]  when all of that money began to flow over to the Middle East,
[57:10.680 --> 57:12.680]  to be used by Saudi Arabia to then come back
[57:12.680 --> 57:14.680]  and buy United States debt,
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.680]  because Treasury at that time was starting to run such huge deficits.
[57:18.680 --> 57:20.680]  So we were already set up at that time
[57:20.680 --> 57:22.680]  in a very precarious position.
[57:22.680 --> 57:25.680]  Then Volcker, when he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
[57:25.680 --> 57:29.680]  crashed the U.S. producing economy deliberately
[57:29.680 --> 57:33.680]  in the recession of 1979 and 1983.
[57:33.680 --> 57:37.680]  And that's what began the destruction of our industrial base.
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.680]  And that, again, was a planned destruction.
[57:39.680 --> 57:42.680]  And it gave us what we have today,
[57:42.680 --> 57:44.680]  which is called the service economy.
[57:44.680 --> 57:48.680]  Then, when Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
[57:48.680 --> 57:52.680]  he began to produce these huge financial bubbles,
[57:52.680 --> 57:56.680]  because he couldn't do anything to reverse the decline of the economy,
[57:56.680 --> 57:59.680]  because they were not about to restore our industry.
[57:59.680 --> 58:05.680]  So what they began to do was create this massive official fraud
[58:05.680 --> 58:10.680]  in home mortgage lending that began early in George W. Bush's presidency
[58:10.680 --> 58:12.680]  around the year 2001-2002.
[58:12.680 --> 58:14.680]  We've got a break. We've got a break.
[58:14.680 --> 58:18.680]  And then that was, everybody was told, go ahead and engage in fraud,
[58:18.680 --> 58:20.680]  get the suckers on the line.
[58:20.680 --> 58:23.680]  And when we come back, we're going to get into the current situation
[58:23.680 --> 58:26.680]  and where Mr. Cook sees it going.

[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:15.680]  You know, I may get Richard C. Cook to hold over a little bit
[1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:19.680]  in the next half hour after this one when Bob Chapman is on with us,
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.680]  but we'll see.
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:25.680]  We're covering what's happening with the economy.
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:29.680]  I've got a lot of military news, police state news.
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  Also, the new environmental tyranny they're bringing in, news and information.
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.680]  That's their next big bubble or control system,
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:41.680]  where we'll buy our carbon crads from the private central banks.
[1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:43.680]  And meanwhile, all the real environmental degradation
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:46.680]  will just continue unabated, and it's the new religion though.
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:52.680]  But going back to Richard C. Cook, you were getting into now the 1990s
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:56.680]  with Allen Greenspan and the mortgage fraud.
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:00.680]  They also loosened up the other fractional reserve banking rules,
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:03.680]  allowed the three types of banks to intermingle.
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:05.680]  Take us from there, sir.
[1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:09.680]  Well, what happened with the financial deregulation
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:13.680]  that really began in the 70s and picked up speed with Reagan
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:18.680]  and then under Clinton in the 1990s
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.680]  was essentially turning over the entire producing economy
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.680]  to the financial industry.
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:28.680]  There had been all kinds of fences built around the banking system
[1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:32.680]  up until then because the system we inherited from the New Deal
[1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:37.680]  coming out of World War II era was a very tightly regulated banking system.
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:41.680]  Those regulations were removed and the system was turned over to the banks
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:45.680]  so that the banks are the ones who now run the economy.
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:48.680]  But again, it's really important for people to understand
[1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:50.680]  when you're talking about the banks,
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:53.680]  you're not just talking about United States financial institutions.
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:58.680]  The U.S. banking system is a web that is tightly interwoven
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:03.680]  with the international banking system that is run outside of the United States.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:06.680]  The United States does not make its own financial decisions
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:10.680]  and because of that, we do not make our own economic and industrial decisions.
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:12.680]  And that's the globalist model.
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:13.680]  That's the New World War II.
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:17.680]  When they talk about interdependence, that means taking control of our lives away.
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:21.680]  That's why you can have 90% of Americans on every issue against the government
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:24.680]  and the government just pointed its militarized police force and says,
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:28.680]  you don't run this country anymore and it's because we've been hijacked.
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:32.680]  And to be clear here, the private banks have now looted us.
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:36.680]  You give them unlimited power, they're going to rob you blind,
[1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:41.680]  and now they need a police state to make sure we don't get control of the government again
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.680]  so they can't be punished.
[1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:49.680]  Now, the next thing that I think we all really have to understand
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:54.680]  is the role that is played in all of this by war.
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:58.680]  A war is a contrived event.
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:01.680]  A war is not something that just happened.
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:03.680]  It's made by decision.
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.680]  People make those decisions and they make those decisions
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:10.680]  for reasons that they do not tell you about.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:12.680]  And George Bush didn't make that decision.
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:13.680]  They knew it would be unpopular.
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.680]  They're going to put it all on him.
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:18.680]  He'll go retire in Dallas and then they give us New Bird Cage liner.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:20.680]  That's correct.
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:24.680]  Now, again, if you go back in history over the last century,
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:28.680]  you see the critical role played by the big wars,
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:33.680]  what Patrick Buchanan in his new book, which I've been reading,
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:35.680]  calls the unnecessary wars.
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:40.680]  But the purpose of those wars is to take down the nation states
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.680]  that are furthest ahead in establishing their own independence
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:47.680]  and their own national economic power.
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:49.680]  So World War I, you got rid of Germany.
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:51.680]  You got rid of Austria-Hungary.
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:57.680]  World War II, Britain came out of that without its empire,
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.680]  and so did France.
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:04.680]  Now what they're trying to do is to foment another World War
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:07.680]  because there are two nations left standing.
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:09.680]  One is the United States, of course.
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:11.680]  The other one is Russia,
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.680]  because even though the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:21.680]  Russia is an inherently extremely powerful and advanced nation,
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:26.680]  both technologically, economically, in terms of resources,
[1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:30.680]  and Russia has come back very, very strongly.
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  And if you read the finance here, press.
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.680]  Mr. Cook, stay there.
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.680]  Long segment, plenty of time to lay all this out when we get back.
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:41.680]  Just an amazing overview we're getting here.
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:44.680]  I hope you appreciate the level of knowledge Mr. Cook has
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:46.680]  and how blessed we are to have him.
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.680]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals,
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:21.680]  no animal testing, they're safe,

[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:54.680]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:56.680]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:57.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:05:57.680 --> 1:05:59.680]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:05:59.680 --> 1:06:02.680]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:04.680]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:06.680]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF,
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:08.680]  the police, and the hot shutters.
[1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:11.680]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:14.680]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow
[1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:15.680]  at our own door.
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:18.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:21.680]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:23.680]  An inside job?
[1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:25.680]  How dare you?
[1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:29.680]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:31.680]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:34.680]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:37.680]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:40.680]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[1:06:40.680 --> 1:06:41.680]  Truth Rising.

[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:19.680]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:51.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:54.680]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[1:07:54.680 --> 1:08:23.680]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:27.680]  All right, Mr. Cook, Richard C. Cook
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:31.680]  has written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:33.680]  He's written for the Washington Post,
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:36.680]  Space and Security News, the Houston Post.
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:42.680]  He was on the Presidential Commission to study many different areas.
[1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:46.680]  If I tried to go over his whole bio, it would blow our time.
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:50.680]  He, of course, was one of the senior analysts at the Department of the Treasury,
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:53.680]  and he is a syndicate of columnists, a author,
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:57.680]  and we'll tell you about his website again before he leaves us.
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:01.680]  But if you can, sir, some stations carry the last three hours,
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:02.680]  not the first hour.
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:06.680]  Briefly recap how this is by design predatory
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:09.680]  with the global banks above and outside all the nations,
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:11.680]  wanting to implode the nation-states
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:15.680]  and then put it in an international order controlled by their financial control
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:18.680]  with rapid reaction military forces through NATO,
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.680]  the UN, and other mercenary forces to enforce their will
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:26.680]  and then bring us back up to where we were in the 90s
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:28.680]  and then into the current situation briefly
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:30.680]  and then where we're going in the future.
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:36.680]  Well, again, side-by-side with the development of the modern industrial economies,
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:39.680]  which we've seen over the last really couple hundred years,
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:43.680]  has been the growth of the private financial industry
[1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:49.680]  which gradually has gained control of all of the economies of the world,
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:56.680]  particularly since the period beginning around the early 1900s with World War I.
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.680]  And it was really the financial elite
[1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.680]  that maneuvered the world into the series of wars
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:06.680]  that have taken place in the 20th century
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:10.680]  in order to take down any national economy
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:14.680]  that asserted itself as being independent of international finance.
[1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:17.680]  So we've seen the destruction of the Germans,
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.680]  of the Italians later on in the 20th century
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:24.680]  when Britain was lured into World War II,
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:27.680]  the British Empire collapsed, the French Empire collapsed,
[1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:33.680]  and it left the United States and Russia as the two-standing nationalist powers,
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:35.680]  so-called superpowers.
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:38.680]  The Soviet Union collapsed in 91.
[1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:46.680]  It's now coming back, and the United States really is the only remaining nation
[1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:50.680]  that has had the sense of national identity,
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:55.680]  the economic strength to oppose the bankers,
[1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:58.680]  but since the 1970s through the regulation,
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:01.680]  through buying off of politicians,
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:05.680]  through what I call the policies of the three amigos,
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:08.680]  the rangers, the vokers, the greenspans,
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.680]  creating all of these financial bubbles,
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:13.680]  running up huge amounts of debt,
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:16.680]  exporting United States jobs and industries overseas,
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:21.680]  now the United States itself is threatened with its very existence.
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:24.680]  And the way that the financial elite
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:28.680]  has traditionally sought to take down nations has been through warfare.
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:34.680]  And right now, we are being driven into a very precarious situation
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:38.680]  that very well could lead to World War III,
[1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:42.680]  and that would be a war between the United States on one side
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:46.680]  and Russia, probably China on the other side,
[1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:51.680]  where the last powerful national economies would be totally destroyed,
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:55.680]  and the international financiers could move in at that point
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:01.680]  and establish their one-world headquarters, as it were,
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:05.680]  and control everything through the power of debt and the power of money.
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.680]  Now, stay there, stay there.
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:12.680]  For listeners that just joined us, this is not some wild flight of imagination.
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:15.680]  This is all in hundreds of think tank documents.
[1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:18.680]  We've read them here, I've made films, we've written books,
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:22.680]  we've had endless guests on covering it, top guests, you know,
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:25.680]  heads of business schools, Nobel Prize winners.
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:28.680]  This is what is being engineered,
[1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:31.680]  and this goes for every military man, every police officer.
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.680]  It's us against them.
[1:12:33.680 --> 1:12:36.680]  And they staged terror attacks to try to get you to,
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.680]  as Mr. Brzezinski said, in the grand chess board and in his new book,
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:43.680]  to get you to rally around their international elite
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:46.680]  so they can carry out their policies that are really directed against you.
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:51.680]  They primitively give you a perceived threat to your tribe,
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  use your nationalism that's healthy,
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:58.680]  but at false nationalism so they can then direct you in wars
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:01.680]  that actually destroy your treasury further in debt to them,
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:03.680]  destroy our name worldwide.
[1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:05.680]  I mean, you'll see Rupert Murdoch in newspapers he owns,
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:08.680]  demonizing us overseas and then saying we're good over here.
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:10.680]  This is all totally cold-blooded.
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:13.680]  These guys are very scientific,
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:16.680]  and they do whatever it is that helps their interest.
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:18.680]  And then down to the local level,
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:23.680]  the big central banks come in to smart growth conferences, education conferences,
[1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:26.680]  they say we'll give you unlimited funding, unlimited positions,
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:30.680]  jobs with us after you leave, city managers,
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:35.680]  right down to water district heads, bribery is now legal and public,
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:37.680]  right down to dumbing kids down.
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:39.680]  How many CPS kids have to be taken?
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:43.680]  The banks literally run and own the whole show,
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:47.680]  and what Mr. Cook is telling you is they are the authors and the executors
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:50.680]  of everything you've seen and everything you're going to see.
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:52.680]  Do you agree with that, Mr. Cook?
[1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:58.680]  That's true, and what is happening today is with the financial collapse,
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:04.680]  they're going to attempt to persuade us to escape from our domestic financial problems
[1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.680]  by engaging in more warfare overseas.
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:11.680]  And you can see this very, very clearly, for example,
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:14.680]  in the presidential campaign of John McCain.
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:19.680]  One of the things that McCain has called for very recently
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:23.680]  was to expel Russia from the G8.
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:27.680]  He is engaged in the same demonization of Russia,
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.680]  but the financial press has been engaged in over the last several years.
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:37.680]  If you read, for example, the Daily News reports on Russia by the Washington Post,
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:43.680]  you see over and over again attacks on Putin, attacks on Russia,
[1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:48.680]  because Putin threw out the financial oligarchs who tried to take over Russia
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:53.680]  in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union when Boris Yeltsin was president.
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:57.680]  Let me just throw this in and then continue for those that, again, are joining us.
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:00.680]  You're not even mentioning all the covert operations,
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:06.680]  and I hate to even say the U.S. are captured military that's being used and abused.
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:11.680]  Notice how the Globalist, the New World Order, is using four or five tours
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:15.680]  breaking the military, not carrying, because they're done with us.
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:19.680]  This is the final deal. They're squeezing the last drops of blood out of us,
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.680]  running covert operations, military operations against Russian interest,
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:29.680]  overthrowing countries on their border and traditional satellites of Mother Russia,
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:32.680]  moving missiles, and you better believe nukes in.
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:35.680]  Can you speak to this incredible provocation?
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:39.680]  Well, yes, that's been going on now for a decade.
[1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:44.680]  And one interesting thing that I noticed as I watched the presidential campaign
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:50.680]  is how Obama is now moving more and more toward the Bush positions,
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:55.680]  where he's backing off on his calls to get out of Iraq.
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:01.680]  He is putting out these provocations against Iran, against Pakistan.
[1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.680]  Again, that's the same play that the Democrats used to get into Congress.
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:07.680]  That's exactly right.
[1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:11.680]  And you see the Democratic-controlled Congress under Nancy Pelosi
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:17.680]  continuing to issue the blank checks, not only for the war in Iraq,
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:20.680]  but most recently the Iran war resolution.
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:26.680]  So the entire power structure of the two major parties, along with Bush and the neocons,
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:31.680]  are all marching and locked up now toward World War III.
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:37.680]  And this is really the event that is intended to complete the power play
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:43.680]  by the international financial elite to gain the control that they seek to gain
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.680]  and to get rid of the last remaining strong nations of the world,
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:53.680]  which are the United States, Russia, and perhaps even coming along China and India.
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:55.680]  Okay, Mr. Cook, I want to end.
[1:16:55.680 --> 1:16:57.680]  And then they've got Pakistan threatening India.
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:00.680]  The U.S. helps give them nukes, and then freaks out with Iran.
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:02.680]  It was nowhere near one.
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:06.680]  I mean, anyone who had any geopolitical grasp would know how ridiculous
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:08.680]  what they tell the public is.
[1:17:08.680 --> 1:17:11.680]  Meanwhile, they're attacking Iran using real Wahhabi al-Qaeda,
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.680]  the White House publicly funding them $400 million a year,
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:18.680]  then saying Iran's al-Qaeda when they're the opposite Muslim group, the Shiites.
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:25.680]  Now, we add to all of this the fact that...
[1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:31.680]  Well, before I get into that, let's get now into where we currently are.
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:37.680]  Well, right now we're on the very brink of a complete financial collapse
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:41.680]  that's going to begin to roll out into unemployment,
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:47.680]  a continued closing down of United States manufacturing facilities,
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:52.680]  and we're going to have a population that is in danger of losing their livelihoods,
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.680]  not just their homes, but their ability to produce any kind of income.
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:01.680]  And what we have in the United States financially,
[1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:05.680]  and now and then you'll hear people mention this in kind of an off-handed way.
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:08.680]  They'll say, well, people just don't have any money.
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:12.680]  Well, let's think about that. That's a fact.
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:17.680]  What is most lacking in the United States economy is purchasing power.
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:24.680]  People don't have the money, and they haven't had the money really for the last 10, 15, 20 years,
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:27.680]  because what we've done, not having the money, is borrow.
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:30.680]  Now, let's be clear. Currency is being created,
[1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:35.680]  but that currency is only being created to pay the bankers the fraudulent debt
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:38.680]  they created through their Federal Reserve system.
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:43.680]  Well, all that currency is really is more big loans from the Federal Reserve.
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:44.680]  Yes.
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:46.680]  It's just rolling over of loans.
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:49.680]  That type of lending and that type of bailout...
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:50.680]  Doesn't go to us.
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:56.680]  It does not create any wealth. It does not create anything tangible of value.
[1:18:56.680 --> 1:18:59.680]  It's just refinancing bankrupt institutions.
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:04.680]  So, yeah, you're right. So, it does not go down to the working people.
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:10.680]  The Trino trickle-down economics, which is the essence of Reaganomics,
[1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:14.680]  which came in in the 1980s, was supposed to result in money
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:18.680]  from greater investment in production going down to the working people
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:22.680]  who have jobs, but they left out one thing.
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:27.680]  What they left out was that there's no way to get purchasing power to those people
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:30.680]  if their own incomes don't go up,
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:34.680]  and if their jobs are exported overseas to places like China.
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:36.680]  Well, that's what Roberts now...
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:39.680]  Roberts, the father of that, says every week here,
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:42.680]  that's the problem is that we've moved our industry off,
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:44.680]  so there's no real customers because they don't have money.
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.680]  This is what you just said, which was the globalist plan. Stay with us.

[1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:57.680]  the vast majority of the population of the U.S.,
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.680]  though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:02.680]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:13.680]  and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate

[1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago,
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:29.680]  the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:32.680]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:34.680]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:38.680]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:46:20.180 --> 1:46:48.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:46:48.180 --> 1:47:10.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:47:10.180 --> 1:47:32.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:47:32.180 --> 1:48:00.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:48:00.180 --> 1:48:26.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:48.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:48:48.180 --> 1:49:10.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:38.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:49:38.180 --> 1:50:06.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:50:06.180 --> 1:50:28.180]  Look at this intellectually, it is so out of control.
[1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:54.180]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:50:54.180 --> 1:51:04.180]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:51:04.180 --> 1:51:18.180]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:24.180]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:51:24.180 --> 1:51:28.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:52.180]  Order in game on DVD at www.prisonplanet.com or www.infowars.com or watch it online right now at www.prisonplanet.tv.
[1:51:52.180 --> 1:52:00.180]  You've been there, have a few drinks and you wake up feeling a bit fuzzy, so keep your body in tune.
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:06.180]  Next time, try Drink and Mate Hangover Defense with all natural Guadaloupe extract.
[1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:12.180]  Its proven patented formula helps defend against and prevent alcohol's nasty side effects.
[1:52:12.180 --> 1:52:16.180]  Drop just one Drink and Mate tablet into water and you can hear it work.
[1:52:16.180 --> 1:52:18.180]  And it works fast.
[1:52:18.180 --> 1:52:25.180]  That fizz you hear is rushing those nutrients to your system, accelerating your body's response to a few drinks.
[1:52:25.180 --> 1:52:28.180]  People in Asia have used Guava for centuries to keep the body healthy.
[1:52:28.180 --> 1:52:37.180]  Now scientific research shows taken Drink and Mate before, during or immediately after drinking helps prevent queasy stomach, headache and dehydration.
[1:52:37.180 --> 1:52:43.180]  So keep your body in tune and still have fun while having a few drinks with all natural Drink and Mate.
[1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:46.180]  Nature's great tasting defense against hangovers.
[1:52:46.180 --> 1:52:49.180]  Find Drink and Mate at holiday stores.
[1:53:19.180 --> 1:53:25.180]  And it works at home, the office or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:30.180]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[1:53:30.180 --> 1:53:36.180]  Best of all, you can be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less. It's that simple.
[1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:39.180]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[1:53:39.180 --> 1:53:42.180]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[1:53:42.180 --> 1:53:48.180]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[1:54:15.180 --> 1:54:28.180]  I mean, we have all their own documents and there's still people emailing me on message boards saying we're liars, we hate America, the dollar's not devalued, just living in denial.
[1:54:28.180 --> 1:54:34.180]  And I know a lot of people are starting to wake up like you said earlier, but a lot of other people, they make it political.
[1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:40.180]  They say, you're just saying the economy's bad because you like Barack Obama. It has nothing to do with that.
[1:54:40.180 --> 1:54:47.180]  You know, I love how the media makes it political. Like when it's a Democrat, they go, you Republicans are just saying it's bad because he's a Democrat.
[1:54:47.180 --> 1:54:50.180]  Or you Democrats are saying it's bad because it's a Republican.
[1:54:50.180 --> 1:54:53.180]  George Bush runs nothing, does he, Bob?
[1:54:53.180 --> 1:55:04.180]  I mean, how do we get these childlike minds to realize that if they would wake up to dollar devaluation, we could force the government to engage in policies that might not totally destroy us?
[1:55:04.180 --> 1:55:16.180]  Well, you know, you're dealing with people who have had a limited outlook, and they've never had a challenge like this before.
[1:55:16.180 --> 1:55:22.180]  The challenges have been within their family and their job and on local issues.
[1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:37.180]  It's hard for them to contend that there are a group of people who are evil who do things that are not for their good, but for their own good, these evil people's good.
[1:55:37.180 --> 1:55:43.180]  And it's a little far-fetched for these people. They simply can't believe it.
[1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:52.180]  And, you know, there's thousands of books now on the subject, well-researched, well-written, explaining all these things over the centuries.
[1:55:52.180 --> 1:55:59.180]  I mean, this didn't happen in 1960 or last week. I mean, this has been going on for a long time.
[1:55:59.180 --> 1:56:05.180]  And so people have got to take the time. In time, they will. They'll come along slowly, unfortunately.
[1:56:05.180 --> 1:56:11.180]  And some of them we're going to have to feed when they're living under a bridge who didn't listen, but that's okay.
[1:56:11.180 --> 1:56:19.180]  I mean, we were given a wonderful mind so that we can figure this thing out, and they didn't, and they couldn't. And that's okay. We'll help them.
[1:56:19.180 --> 1:56:26.180]  But there will be people who will wake up along the way, always not enough, but we've got to do what we can.
[1:56:26.180 --> 1:56:33.180]  Well, Bob, you've been talking about this for 50 years, are close to it, and so you do have a wonderful mind.
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:41.180]  Me? I mean, I read Nunder called a conspiracy when I was in high school, and I went to see if those quotes were true at the library.
[1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:47.180]  Because I wasn't even a big bookworm, but I thought, man, if Rockefeller really says he wants to destroy my country and take my guns,
[1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:52.180]  and the private banks funded communism and fascism, I better go find out about this.
[1:56:52.180 --> 1:56:56.180]  And so I went and found it, the quotes, and found out that they really said it.
[1:56:56.180 --> 1:57:00.180]  I mean, I guess the only gift I had was I took it serious.
[1:57:00.180 --> 1:57:07.180]  I guess because I saw the sheriff deal drugs where I lived and go to prison, and I saw the cops deal drugs and then be on the news fighting drugs.
[1:57:07.180 --> 1:57:13.180]  I guess I saw a few things when I was a kid in a suburb of Dallas, so I wasn't naive.
[1:57:13.180 --> 1:57:23.180]  I knew that what you saw in the news wasn't necessarily the truth, but I don't know how the public now can't realize that we are in deep trouble.
[1:57:23.180 --> 1:57:33.180]  Well, there's a vast store of knowledge out there, in part, started by Gary Allen, and Gary was my partner.
[1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:39.180]  He wrote Nunder called a conspiracy, and there were others at that time in the early 60s.
[1:57:39.180 --> 1:57:44.180]  Gary's book came out in the late 60s, such as G. Edward Griffith and Alan Stang,
[1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:51.180]  and they both were prominent writers of the time, and they were very good friends of mine, and they still are.
[1:57:51.180 --> 1:58:04.180]  Unfortunately, Gary is deceased, but there's been a crusade going on, sort of undercover, so to speak, for a long time, and now it's in the open.
[1:58:04.180 --> 1:58:10.180]  Bob, it's got to feel good for you, though, to have been out there when nobody was listening,
[1:58:10.180 --> 1:58:16.180]  and today, a half a century later, there's a young people everywhere talking about it.
[1:58:16.180 --> 1:58:19.180]  We've got a one-minute break. I want to just come back and plug your newsletter and then let you go.
[1:58:19.180 --> 1:58:21.180]  Bob, do you have time to do that?
[1:58:21.180 --> 1:58:22.180]  That's fine, you sure?
[1:58:22.180 --> 1:58:24.180]  I know you've got another interview coming up.
[1:58:24.180 --> 1:58:27.180]  All right, Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com is our guest.
[1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:30.180]  My website's PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:58:32.180 --> 1:58:40.180]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:48.180]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:50.180]  Stop it, sir. Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:58:50.180 --> 1:58:53.180]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:58:53.180 --> 1:58:57.180]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFAR.
[1:58:57.180 --> 1:58:59.180]  They sit down and shout out.
[1:58:59.180 --> 1:59:06.180]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:06.180 --> 1:59:12.180]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:12.180 --> 1:59:16.180]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:59:16.180 --> 1:59:22.180]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:22.180 --> 1:59:25.180]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:50.180]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[1:59:50.180 --> 1:59:58.180]  Media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:59:58.180 --> 2:00:04.180]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:24.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.180 --> 2:00:28.180]  In closing with Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.com.
[2:00:28.180 --> 2:00:30.180]  I want to plug that here in the three or four minutes we've got with you.
[2:00:30.180 --> 2:00:35.180]  First off, where do you see the market going in the short term, and then where do you see gold and silver?
[2:00:35.180 --> 2:00:38.180]  I mean, gold and silver, obviously, are both exploding again today.
[2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:41.180]  When do you think they'll hit 1,000, Bob?
[2:00:41.180 --> 2:00:46.180]  Well, I think it's not far away, probably in the fall, maybe even before that.
[2:00:46.180 --> 2:00:54.180]  And probably next month is a good bet because it's very strong, even though it's been banged around today, but it was up yesterday.
[2:00:54.180 --> 2:01:00.180]  And I see the stock market continually lower. It's going to be under tremendous pressure. The earnings aren't there.
[2:01:00.180 --> 2:01:08.180]  There's all this bad news, and it's got to soak into the heads of money managers, and they've got to be withdrawing from the market.
[2:01:08.180 --> 2:01:13.180]  And so I think that's the course. People should be out of the stock market.
[2:01:13.180 --> 2:01:19.180]  If you have money in banks and you want to move it, and you don't want to go into gold and silver assets,
[2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:25.180]  then you can always buy Swiss franc government bonds, strongest currency in the world.
[2:01:25.180 --> 2:01:32.180]  And there are ways to avoid getting in trouble. You email us, we'll tell you what to do.
[2:01:32.180 --> 2:01:40.180]  We don't charge for it, and we don't have any money that we receive from anybody other than these subscribers.
[2:01:40.180 --> 2:01:51.180]  And so with that said, I think that a lot of you have a lot of questions, particularly in view of your bank accounts,
[2:01:51.180 --> 2:01:57.180]  and I think it's better to be out of there. And we've been doing that for some time.
[2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:02.180]  What would you do if you were a business that, say, takes $100,000 a month to operate,
[2:02:02.180 --> 2:02:07.180]  and you just need the bank because that's how you pay your employees and pay for stock and pay for things,
[2:02:07.180 --> 2:02:12.180]  and you're not a business that makes a lot of money that doesn't have a huge margin,
[2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:19.180]  but you operate, operation takes up most of your funds. What would you do?
[2:02:19.180 --> 2:02:27.180]  Open up three different bank accounts, the one you have and two others, and split the money up 30, 30, 30, approximately.
[2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:30.180]  And you'll have to operate with three bank accounts.
[2:02:30.180 --> 2:02:38.180]  Well, that's what we're doing, and it's a nightmare with the InfoWars operation with 15, 16 employees, about to be about 22 employees.
[2:02:38.180 --> 2:02:42.180]  We're just expending all of the funds we have in the fight against the globalists.
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:47.180]  We don't operate as a business to run around and wear fancy clothes, folks.
[2:02:47.180 --> 2:02:50.180]  It's about defeating the globalists, unlocking minds.
[2:02:50.180 --> 2:02:55.180]  But I tell you, it makes business hard having to do this because the banks are so unhealthy.
[2:02:55.180 --> 2:03:01.180]  In fact, one of the banks we have a little bit of money in for the business is one of the ones now that they say is bad.
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:07.180]  But of this list of 200 banks they're talking about, most of them are, quote, U.S.-based consumer banks.
[2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:11.180]  And I guess it's bigger banks that are involved in all the fraud that are gobbling them up, Bob.
[2:03:11.180 --> 2:03:14.180]  And that will continue to happen.
[2:03:14.180 --> 2:03:18.180]  You know, just take a walkover as an example. It's not going to go under.
[2:03:18.180 --> 2:03:25.180]  If they don't come in and rescue it, then the alternative is to merge it with somebody else.
[2:03:25.180 --> 2:03:29.180]  Oh, that was my final question. That was my final question. I forgot to ask you, Bob.
[2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:36.180]  They're not giving people their money. They're telling most of them to go away at the IndieMax.
[2:03:36.180 --> 2:03:40.180]  Now, the government could clearly have the cash and give it to them or give them cashier's checks.
[2:03:40.180 --> 2:03:43.180]  Are they wanting to make it look worse?
[2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:48.180]  No, I don't think so. I just think that bureaucracies move slowly.
[2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:55.180]  And if they don't have the money, then, you know, the FDIC will get the money to them.
[2:03:55.180 --> 2:03:59.180]  I don't think getting your money is a problem. But why go through the hassle?
[2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:03.180]  You know, move it out before your bank has a problem.
[2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:06.180]  And, you know, banks just not safe places anymore.
[2:04:06.180 --> 2:04:09.180]  And neither is yours government paper.
[2:04:09.180 --> 2:04:14.180]  Well, I was about to say, even if your money's out of the bank, it's devaluing in the safe.
[2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:18.180]  And that's why I recommend golden silver-related assets, which are appreciating,
[2:04:18.180 --> 2:04:22.180]  and Swiss franc government bonds, which are a stopping off place.
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:23.180]  Okay, folks.
[2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.180]  We can get you a broker to buy them and help you and everything else.
[2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:31.180]  Theinternationalforecaster.com. Fire out the phone number, Bob.

[2:06:48.180 --> 2:06:53.180]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[2:06:53.180 --> 2:06:56.180]  already destroying millions of American families.
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:00.180]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[2:07:00.180 --> 2:07:04.180]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[2:07:10.180 --> 2:07:14.180]  that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[2:07:23.180 --> 2:07:26.180]  The cost about five dollars a day.
[2:07:26.180 --> 2:07:33.180]  efoodsdirect.com also has a complete bulk supply of super food at half the cost of last year's groceries.
[2:07:33.180 --> 2:07:36.180]  Call 800-409-5633.
[2:07:36.180 --> 2:07:41.180]  The rest of the world is starving, but what happens in your piece of America is up to you.
[2:07:41.180 --> 2:08:07.180]  Call 800-409-5633.
[2:08:13.180 --> 2:08:19.180]  He's made some documentary films with Tex Mars and he's really studied the New World Order,
[2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:22.180]  but also their subliminals, their brainwashing, their mind control.
[2:08:22.180 --> 2:08:26.180]  I want to talk with him today about the elite's mindset, their belief system,
[2:08:26.180 --> 2:08:32.180]  what makes them tick and the type of planet they're trying to set up, they're trying to create.
[2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:36.180]  And we'll get into the mind control, a whole bunch of stuff for an hour and a half with Freeman.
[2:08:36.180 --> 2:08:39.180]  We'll have him back up in the near future for a little bit longer.
[2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:45.180]  He will not be streaming live on the web in the fourth hour today, as we've been doing for the last four months.
[2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:50.180]  That's why I'm about to move into a bigger office and get extra board operators,
[2:08:50.180 --> 2:08:56.180]  because my one guy trained to work all the computers into the live streaming has the flu right now.
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:09:00.180]  So that's why we're moving to a bigger office, because this place has no more room for more people.
[2:09:00.180 --> 2:09:04.180]  And I got to get back up, folks, but we're going to tape it and then upload it.
[2:09:04.180 --> 2:09:07.180]  It'll be on the web for you in the next few days.
[2:09:07.180 --> 2:09:15.180]  I guess it'll be the old-fashioned system where our info warriors at Nuff said and YouTube channel and the Alex Jones channel
[2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:23.180]  and the gatekeeper invasion and all those great folks can do the old-fashioned deal of putting images up over the hour and a half interview.
[2:09:23.180 --> 2:09:24.180]  I know that's tough on them.
[2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:27.180]  They've really appreciated the fact that we've added video to most of our interviews.
[2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:33.180]  Because what we do for prisonplanet.tv members is when they are, when we have guests in studio,
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:38.180]  whether it's the first hour, second hour, third hour, fourth hour, which we have every week,
[2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:43.180]  we will have live cameras on myself, them, a document cam, a video cam, a video feed cam,
[2:09:43.180 --> 2:09:48.180]  like six different feeds we can have for you all mixed live and sent out to you,
[2:09:48.180 --> 2:09:53.180]  and then also archive for prisonplanet.tv members.
[2:09:53.180 --> 2:10:00.180]  But then we also tape other interviews behind the scenes, extras, the weekly TV report,
[2:10:00.180 --> 2:10:03.180]  the Sunday show, we also put those on the web for you.
[2:10:03.180 --> 2:10:09.180]  So this will be put up on the web for prisonplanet.tv members who then slice it and dice it in every which way
[2:10:09.180 --> 2:10:12.180]  and put it all over the web, which we love, the prisonplanet.tv members.
[2:10:12.180 --> 2:10:14.180]  Don't just get it in higher quality.
[2:10:14.180 --> 2:10:21.180]  More importantly, they support us to be able to pay for the staff, the cameras, the equipment to then get it out to people on the web.
[2:10:21.180 --> 2:10:23.180]  So you're providing the seed money.
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:26.180]  And I love the fact that our members understand this.
[2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:30.180]  This isn't a thing of, hey, we're members and we pay for it and everybody else gets it for free.
[2:10:30.180 --> 2:10:31.180]  That isn't what it's about.
[2:10:31.180 --> 2:10:37.180]  It's about you provide the seed money by being prisonplanet.tv members that allows us to do everything we're doing
[2:10:37.180 --> 2:10:47.180]  and you get first exclusive viewing of it in higher quality, better downloads, 10, 15, 20 times better than YouTube and Google.
[2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:54.180]  And a lot of stuff is on the site that never ends up on the web, too, which is actually to my chagrin.
[2:10:54.180 --> 2:11:02.180]  My goal is to get it out to people, but I just appreciate the prisonplanet.tv members because without you, we couldn't fund this operation.
[2:11:02.180 --> 2:11:06.180]  And we really do appreciate all of you out there.
[2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:09.180]  We've gotten seven servers, two CDNs.
[2:11:09.180 --> 2:11:11.180]  We're almost never down.
[2:11:11.180 --> 2:11:12.180]  When it rains, it pours.
[2:11:12.180 --> 2:11:18.180]  We have one of our big servers down today because of a network problem in Chicago, not our server itself.
[2:11:18.180 --> 2:11:21.180]  Some of the prisonplanet.tv stuff is down, but just for a few hours.
[2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:28.180]  But because it's redundant, a lot of it is up because we've got it on three different servers and two CDNs.
[2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:30.180]  So we're trying here.
[2:11:30.180 --> 2:11:31.180]  We're trying to do our best.
[2:11:31.180 --> 2:11:35.180]  And as the economy goes to hell in a handbasket, stuff's going to get worse.
[2:11:35.180 --> 2:11:39.180]  And so we're not a greedy corporation that tries to maximize profits.
[2:11:39.180 --> 2:11:42.180]  I take any new money that comes in to put it right back into the fight.
[2:11:42.180 --> 2:11:44.180]  That's why I'm getting more servers.
[2:11:44.180 --> 2:11:48.180]  That's why we're getting an extra IT guy on top of the people we've got.
[2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:51.180]  That's why we're going to hire another video editor.
[2:11:51.180 --> 2:11:53.180]  That's why we're going to hire more webmasters.
[2:11:53.180 --> 2:11:55.180]  And please don't flood us with resumes.
[2:11:55.180 --> 2:11:58.180]  We've got to get in a bigger office, get set up there in the next month.
[2:11:58.180 --> 2:12:01.180]  We're moving to the next week and a half.
[2:12:01.180 --> 2:12:03.180]  And we're a small operation.
[2:12:03.180 --> 2:12:04.180]  I wish we could move quicker.
[2:12:04.180 --> 2:12:05.180]  We can't.
[2:12:05.180 --> 2:12:08.180]  We move at Lightspeak compared to other Patriot groups.
[2:12:08.180 --> 2:12:14.180]  And that's why you're continued support with your prisonplanet.tv memberships and buying the books and DVDs on the website
[2:12:14.180 --> 2:12:18.180]  and calling the toll-free number to get them, like Truth Rising.
[2:12:18.180 --> 2:12:19.180]  That's what makes it all possible.
[2:12:19.180 --> 2:12:23.180]  I tend to get all these guests up on air and then never even plug my own books and videos,
[2:12:23.180 --> 2:12:25.180]  which not only support us, that's secondary.
[2:12:25.180 --> 2:12:28.180]  The fact is they're waking people up.
[2:12:28.180 --> 2:12:30.180]  Truth Rising is a cinema verite masterpiece.
[2:12:30.180 --> 2:12:32.180]  It is so well done.
[2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:35.180]  It really reaches people who are unreachable or finding.
[2:12:35.180 --> 2:12:38.180]  And I don't, frankly, don't want to sit there and talk about myself in my film all day.
[2:12:38.180 --> 2:12:40.180]  I just want you to get it.
[2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:44.180]  I think you're going to have the same appreciation for it on DVD and make copies of that and get it out to people.
[2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:45.180]  That's the best way to do it.
[2:12:45.180 --> 2:12:51.180]  Or we have it up there on DivX for quick download and burning the disc that plays on most DVD players.
[2:12:51.180 --> 2:12:54.180]  You know, it's not DVD quality, but it's getting close.
[2:12:54.180 --> 2:12:56.180]  Put ourselves out of business here if this continues.
[2:12:56.180 --> 2:12:58.180]  But that's pretty much our mission.
[2:12:58.180 --> 2:13:08.180]  Believe me, folks, I want to go live on a ranch and run cattle and have a big garden and look through my telescope at the stars
[2:13:08.180 --> 2:13:11.180]  and, you know, go rock climbing and go deep sea fishing.
[2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:14.180]  I mean, I am not into status and power and trinkets.
[2:13:14.180 --> 2:13:18.180]  I wish we could defeat the new World Order today and I could just fade away.
[2:13:18.180 --> 2:13:21.180]  That's why my new film and make it with Burmese, Burmese is the director.
[2:13:21.180 --> 2:13:23.180]  Alex Jones is an infaible enemies.
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:25.180]  That's a real pleasure, by the way, for me.
[2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.180]  I'm not infaible enemies.
[2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:29.180]  Though folks want to stick me in.
[2:13:29.180 --> 2:13:34.180]  I'm hardly in Truth Rising because, you see, I want to recede.
[2:13:34.180 --> 2:13:36.180]  I want to see you be leaders.
[2:13:36.180 --> 2:13:38.180]  I want to see you be champions.
[2:13:38.180 --> 2:13:40.180]  I want to see you take the field in the Info War.
[2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:43.180]  I know there's people out there listening right now that can make films 10 times better than mine.
[2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:46.180]  I saw some criticism of Truth Rising.
[2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:49.180]  Well, then you make a film and I don't mean that as a smart mouth.
[2:13:49.180 --> 2:13:50.180]  No, let's see you do it.
[2:13:50.180 --> 2:13:53.180]  I believe you can do a better job than I do.
[2:13:53.180 --> 2:13:56.180]  I know I've gotten to be a better filmmaker, making 19 films.
[2:13:56.180 --> 2:14:01.180]  I mean, look, I'm pouring myself out for you because I know that's how I save myself.
[2:14:01.180 --> 2:14:03.180]  He who tries to save his life loses it.
[2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:07.180]  He who gives up his life or is willing to do it gains it.
[2:14:07.180 --> 2:14:11.180]  And I know we are in a life and death situation.
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:16.180]  And consciously letting that burn in really gets your head screwed on straight.
[2:14:16.180 --> 2:14:23.180]  You're not worried anymore how you look or what people think of you or a piece of grandma's china breaks.
[2:14:23.180 --> 2:14:26.180]  And even though you're sentimental, you're like, hey, life ends.
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:28.180]  You know, even people die.
[2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:30.180]  A thousand-year-old trees die.
[2:14:30.180 --> 2:14:32.180]  We're all going.
[2:14:32.180 --> 2:14:33.180]  You know, suns burn out.
[2:14:33.180 --> 2:14:36.180]  I mean, you know, I'm learning to turn the loose of things.
[2:14:36.180 --> 2:14:41.180]  I've even had to come to grips with that my children are in danger in this fight.
[2:14:41.180 --> 2:14:47.180]  And I love them more than I love them before, but I realize that the fight is even greater than them.
[2:14:47.180 --> 2:14:51.180]  It is a full commitment, ladies and gentlemen, a full commitment.
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:58.180]  Now, speaking of funding or operation, there's a win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win situation.
[2:14:58.180 --> 2:15:02.180]  You get gold bullion, silver.
[2:15:02.180 --> 2:15:03.180]  Well, they didn't really go bullion.
[2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:07.180]  Gold bullion is just raw gold coins that these are collector coins at bullion prices.
[2:15:07.180 --> 2:15:10.180]  Silver coins that are collectible at silver bullion prices.
[2:15:10.180 --> 2:15:14.180]  And it's a commodity that's only going up.
[2:15:14.180 --> 2:15:15.180]  I mean, I can't see it going down.
[2:15:15.180 --> 2:15:16.180]  Who knows what will happen in the future?
[2:15:16.180 --> 2:15:18.180]  I know the dollar is being devalued.
[2:15:18.180 --> 2:15:24.180]  And your purchase of these, these metals, I think Teddy says got like a 3% markup.
[2:15:24.180 --> 2:15:28.180]  He offered something on money that didn't even have a markup to even pay his brokers.
[2:15:28.180 --> 2:15:32.180]  He lost money on that to pay his employees who are metals experts.
[2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:35.180]  The point is, Ted is doing this to introduce you to it.
[2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  You can really physically own gold and silver.
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:41.180]  And I'm, Ted was actually on business and I called him back to the office today.
[2:15:41.180 --> 2:15:44.180]  I said, no, I want you on again today, Ted.
[2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:50.180]  You put your entire savings from other companies into this network and almost went bankrupt twice.
[2:15:50.180 --> 2:15:53.180]  Ted still dumped all his money into it.
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:56.180]  The old house, the house he owned to do it, he kept it afloat.
[2:15:56.180 --> 2:15:58.180]  Now it's stronger than ever, bigger than ever.
[2:15:58.180 --> 2:15:59.180]  That was years ago.
[2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:00.180]  We almost went under.
[2:16:00.180 --> 2:16:01.180]  Nobody knew about that at the time.
[2:16:01.180 --> 2:16:04.180]  Ted held it afloat and he deserves the support now.
[2:16:04.180 --> 2:16:06.180]  But that isn't even the reason to get the gold and silver.
[2:16:06.180 --> 2:16:11.180]  It is that these are great deals and Ted has week and a half, two week delivery.
[2:16:11.180 --> 2:16:13.180]  He has this stuff in hand now.
[2:16:13.180 --> 2:16:14.180]  He has to get your check.
[2:16:14.180 --> 2:16:15.180]  It has to clear.
[2:16:15.180 --> 2:16:16.180]  Then he ships it to you.
[2:16:16.180 --> 2:16:20.180]  I mean, folks, you know, Ted does it in an immediate turnaround.
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:22.180]  A lot of the other gold brokers and people don't do that.
[2:16:22.180 --> 2:16:26.180]  Ted Anderson, things are continuing to unravel.
[2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:28.180]  Gold is gyrating up and down.
[2:16:28.180 --> 2:16:30.180]  People need to move in and get it now.
[2:16:30.180 --> 2:16:32.180]  What are you offering it for today?
[2:16:32.180 --> 2:16:36.180]  Well, right now, Alex, we have the British sovereigns.
[2:16:36.180 --> 2:16:41.180]  Currently right now, the British sovereigns are at $286.
[2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:46.180]  We also have the Frank coins that are $212.
[2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:49.180]  Man, the walking Liberty halves, I can't say it enough.
[2:16:49.180 --> 2:16:54.180]  Silver being the short supply that it is and that I couldn't even deliver it here just a few months ago.
[2:16:54.180 --> 2:16:58.180]  That is such a great buy at 202 per roll of 20.
[2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:01.180]  You simply should be getting involved in the precious metals.
[2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:02.180]  I mean, come on, let's face it.
[2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:04.180]  We have indie bank with people standing in line.
[2:17:04.180 --> 2:17:06.180]  It's gone all the way throughout the entire world.
[2:17:06.180 --> 2:17:11.180]  I mean, getting all the way to Australia to affect their economy.
[2:17:11.180 --> 2:17:13.180]  The world right now is in big trouble.
[2:17:13.180 --> 2:17:16.180]  I wasn't here to hear your first part of your show,
[2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:19.180]  but from what I understand, you have an economist up there.
[2:17:19.180 --> 2:17:22.180]  Most everybody is agreeing right now, even Bloomberg,
[2:17:22.180 --> 2:17:25.180]  that gold and silver prices are going to go up.
[2:17:25.180 --> 2:17:28.180]  Bloomberg calling for what? $3,000 gold.
[2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:29.180]  I mean, that's crazy.
[2:17:29.180 --> 2:17:32.180]  These people are stock people, not gold and silver bugs.
[2:17:32.180 --> 2:17:35.180]  And I have to say it myself.
[2:17:35.180 --> 2:17:39.180]  I mean, anybody that's sitting in the United States dollar right now looking at the economy,
[2:17:39.180 --> 2:17:41.180]  you have to be nervous.
[2:17:41.180 --> 2:17:44.180]  And of course, if anybody is a resident of the United States,
[2:17:44.180 --> 2:17:46.180]  they're all affected by this.
[2:17:46.180 --> 2:17:51.180]  And just think if you had more than $100,000 sitting in a bank account at Indy right now,
[2:17:51.180 --> 2:17:53.180]  you wouldn't have anything coming back to you.
[2:17:53.180 --> 2:17:56.180]  There's no disclosure on fractional reserve banking
[2:17:56.180 --> 2:17:58.180]  and what the risks are when you put your money in the bank.
[2:17:58.180 --> 2:18:00.180]  They just promise that you're going to get your money back
[2:18:00.180 --> 2:18:02.180]  and it's insured by FDIC.
[2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:05.180]  FDIC is a U.S. government agency
[2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:09.180]  that will be bailed out by the Federal Reserve system.
[2:18:09.180 --> 2:18:11.180]  But it's only got $53 billion in it.
[2:18:11.180 --> 2:18:14.180]  Yeah, but the thing about it is, Alex, they're going to cover every last penny they have to
[2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:16.180]  because they're obligated to.
[2:18:16.180 --> 2:18:20.180]  And they're going to look to the Fed to print money to give it to them through the purchase of U.S. Treasuries.
[2:18:20.180 --> 2:18:26.180]  And that just dumps money into the system and waters down the money supply we already have.
[2:18:26.180 --> 2:18:28.180]  And we've been dealing with too much of that already.
[2:18:28.180 --> 2:18:30.180]  The United States dollar is dropping.
[2:18:30.180 --> 2:18:34.180]  It's reflecting on oil prices, grain, gold and silver, everything that's out there.
[2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:39.180]  Anybody that has any sort of education at all
[2:18:39.180 --> 2:18:42.180]  and can understand economics to even the simplest degree
[2:18:42.180 --> 2:18:46.180]  can understand that if you add more money to the system, the prices are going to go up.
[2:18:46.180 --> 2:18:48.180]  It causes inflation.
[2:18:48.180 --> 2:18:52.180]  And we're experiencing that now live as we speak.
[2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:55.180]  And that's why the precious metals are a good buy at this time.
[2:18:55.180 --> 2:18:57.180]  It's a much better store of wealth.
[2:18:57.180 --> 2:19:01.180]  If your bank closes down and you have some gold and silver in your hands,
[2:19:01.180 --> 2:19:03.180]  it doesn't matter how bad things get.
[2:19:03.180 --> 2:19:07.180]  You've got something that's of value.
[2:19:07.180 --> 2:19:10.180]  I absolutely agree with you, Ted.
[2:19:10.180 --> 2:19:12.180]  I want to hold you over.
[2:19:12.180 --> 2:19:14.180]  I want to talk about what's happening in Australia.
[2:19:14.180 --> 2:19:17.180]  Read a few news articles on what's happening on the economy in the next segment.
[2:19:17.180 --> 2:19:19.180]  Then we're going to have Freeman in here.
[2:19:19.180 --> 2:19:20.180]  You've never heard Freeman.
[2:19:20.180 --> 2:19:24.180]  It's like Tex Mars and Jordan Maxwell and David Icke all rolled into one.
[2:19:24.180 --> 2:19:25.180]  He's coming up.
[2:19:25.180 --> 2:19:27.180]  He's done some great research, made some great films.
[2:19:27.180 --> 2:19:35.180]  And we'll be talking to him in studio coming up after the bottom of the hour in T minus 12 minutes.
[2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:37.180]  This is when we're going to be coming out of that break.
[2:19:37.180 --> 2:19:39.180]  Final segment with Ted Anderson.
[2:19:39.180 --> 2:19:42.180]  I got a lot of other insane news as well.
[2:19:42.180 --> 2:19:44.180]  Hey, you're not an environmentalist.
[2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:46.180]  You're going to have to ride on the back of the bus.
[2:19:46.180 --> 2:19:48.180]  I'm not kidding. We'll cover that too.
[2:19:48.180 --> 2:19:52.180]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard,
[2:19:52.180 --> 2:19:54.180]  the US dollar has been evaluating.
[2:19:54.180 --> 2:19:58.180]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[2:19:58.180 --> 2:20:01.180]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[2:20:01.180 --> 2:20:03.180]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[2:20:03.180 --> 2:20:06.180]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[2:20:06.180 --> 2:20:14.180]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now,
[2:20:14.180 --> 2:20:18.180]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[2:20:18.180 --> 2:20:22.180]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3 million.
[2:20:22.180 --> 2:20:24.180]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:31.180]  Call me John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:47.180]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[2:20:47.180 --> 2:20:52.180]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:20:52.180 --> 2:20:55.180]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[2:20:55.180 --> 2:20:57.180]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:57.180 --> 2:21:04.180]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:21:04.180 --> 2:21:13.180]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:20.180]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:23.180]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:21:23.180 --> 2:21:29.180]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:32.180]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:38.180]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[2:21:38.180 --> 2:21:41.180]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:47.180]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:21:47.180 --> 2:21:55.180]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[2:21:55.180 --> 2:22:01.180]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[2:22:01.180 --> 2:22:05.180]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[2:22:05.180 --> 2:22:10.180]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:18.180]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[2:22:47.180 --> 2:22:53.180]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[2:22:53.180 --> 2:22:55.180]  But there is something you can do.

[2:23:10.180 --> 2:23:14.180]  saving you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.
[2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:16.180]  Now there's a boost for your budget.

[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:08.180]  We don't pull any punches. We tell it like it is. There are no sacred cows here.
[2:24:08.180 --> 2:24:12.180]  Our guests come on and they can talk about whatever they wish.
[2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:20.180]  And we go right to the heart of the matter, a scientific, planetary dictatorship setting up world government.
[2:24:20.180 --> 2:24:25.180]  And you better believe it. I believe in gold and silver.
[2:24:25.180 --> 2:24:31.180]  I was pitching silver when it was $7 an ounce. It was five, but I really started pitching it was about seven.
[2:24:31.180 --> 2:24:37.180]  I've been pitching gold since it was $264, $265 an ounce.
[2:24:37.180 --> 2:24:42.180]  I've been buying a coin here, a coin there since it hit about $300.
[2:24:42.180 --> 2:24:47.180]  And, ladies and gentlemen, gold is up, up this morning, then down, then back up.
[2:24:47.180 --> 2:24:49.180]  In fact, I meant to check that earlier.
[2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:53.180]  Bottom line, Ted has gold locked in at what price?
[2:24:53.180 --> 2:24:54.180]  Ted?
[2:24:54.180 --> 2:24:58.180]  You're right around $9.60 and we've seen $9.81 today.
[2:24:58.180 --> 2:25:02.180]  So it's a good buy at this particular time. No question about it.
[2:25:02.180 --> 2:25:08.180]  Also, with the problems that we've been seeing, I mean, you just heard Bob Chapman yesterday.
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:11.180]  I can't explain it any better than that.
[2:25:11.180 --> 2:25:17.180]  I mean, right now, every time the United States runs into trouble, the Federal Reserve system has to come to the rescue.
[2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:21.180]  And that just means more money being printed and dumped into the system.
[2:25:21.180 --> 2:25:31.180]  Given time, anybody that buys a commodity that's outside of the United States dollar is going to find that they're going to be better off a few years down the road than when they originally purchased it.
[2:25:31.180 --> 2:25:36.180]  I believe the Federal Reserve claimed that in the last month, there was 1% inflation.
[2:25:36.180 --> 2:25:44.180]  I mean, increase, give, may or break, folks, you've seen a doubling in fuel prices in the last year.
[2:25:44.180 --> 2:25:45.180]  Yeah.
[2:25:45.180 --> 2:25:47.180]  Well, you know the statistics that they've given us.
[2:25:47.180 --> 2:25:52.180]  I mean, when they said that they're no longer going to publish their money supply statistics, you know, they're lying to us.
[2:25:52.180 --> 2:25:55.180]  You know, they want to make it look rosier than it is.
[2:25:55.180 --> 2:25:56.180]  And it's just not.
[2:25:56.180 --> 2:25:58.180]  People know that.
[2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:00.180]  Absolutely, Ted.
[2:26:00.180 --> 2:26:08.180]  Getting into, I mean, I see all the analysts, the mainstream analysts talking 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 ounce gold.
[2:26:08.180 --> 2:26:11.180]  I don't think any of us know what's going to happen with gold.
[2:26:11.180 --> 2:26:15.180]  I mean, the evidence, all the evidence points towards going straight up, but we don't have crystal balls.
[2:26:15.180 --> 2:26:18.180]  But we do know the dollar is continually sliding.
[2:26:18.180 --> 2:26:20.180]  We know it's losing value.
[2:26:20.180 --> 2:26:28.180]  And when the yuppies and know it all and trendies, you know, all about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but nothing about the Republic when they find out.
[2:26:28.180 --> 2:26:34.180]  And I'm starting to find some of the dumbest people I know are finally starting to figure out the dollars dropping even without the media.
[2:26:34.180 --> 2:26:39.180]  That lets me know that it's we're getting really into dangerous waters.
[2:26:39.180 --> 2:26:45.180]  Well, Alex, in my experience, I was expecting some real big things here this fall and it's coming this summer already.
[2:26:45.180 --> 2:26:47.180]  And that just means it's going to get that much bigger this fall.
[2:26:47.180 --> 2:26:52.180]  It's just things that are happening that you just wouldn't believe could be possibly true.
[2:26:52.180 --> 2:26:54.180]  Like these big banks that are failing.
[2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:59.180]  It's just it's hard for me to comprehend what's actually really going on in the economy.
[2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:01.180]  And I'm an economist.
[2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:06.180]  It's just, you know, it boggles my mind that we're actually looking at a depression.
[2:27:06.180 --> 2:27:08.180]  Who would ever believe that could happen?
[2:27:08.180 --> 2:27:12.180]  I would call 1-800-686-2237 and ask for the deals.
[2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:15.180]  Even if it's something small that you can't do a whole lot, that's fine.
[2:27:15.180 --> 2:27:18.180]  If you want to have more literature, that's okay too.
[2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:23.180]  But, you know, start doing something about your financial affairs now.
[2:27:23.180 --> 2:27:26.180]  I still can because paper might not buy gold.
[2:27:26.180 --> 2:27:29.180]  Folks, you're probably going to hear Bermas a few days next week.
[2:27:29.180 --> 2:27:31.180]  And I love doing the show and I got a lot of passion.
[2:27:31.180 --> 2:27:33.180]  And I know you want me to be here.
[2:27:33.180 --> 2:27:38.180]  Bermas, though, while he's still in town finishing this film is one of the few people that can sit in here and do the show.
[2:27:38.180 --> 2:27:40.180]  And frankly, I think he's the best we've ever had sitting in.
[2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:43.180]  So while he's still here for the next month and a half, you'll hear him sit in.
[2:27:43.180 --> 2:27:48.180]  But that's so I can go get this company in order so we can weather storms.
[2:27:48.180 --> 2:27:53.180]  Because, I mean, I'm so busy fighting the new order, making films, trying to move into a bigger office,
[2:27:53.180 --> 2:27:56.180]  and all this that I don't even have time to take care of myself.
[2:27:56.180 --> 2:28:00.180]  I mean, like, go in and get my yearly tooth cleaning or get my hair cut.
[2:28:00.180 --> 2:28:01.180]  I'm looking like a hippie over here.
[2:28:01.180 --> 2:28:04.180]  And that's how dedicated I am.
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:06.180]  But I've got to start thinking about myself too.
[2:28:06.180 --> 2:28:11.180]  I mean, we get comfortable, especially those of us that aren't into our finances and money.
[2:28:11.180 --> 2:28:17.180]  Those of us that just want to go fishing in our off time, not prance around in jewelry like a lot of these effeminate men do.
[2:28:17.180 --> 2:28:20.180]  But we still have a responsibility to think about our money.
[2:28:20.180 --> 2:28:22.180]  And I only pitch what I believe in.
[2:28:22.180 --> 2:28:25.180]  You know, gold and guns.
[2:28:25.180 --> 2:28:28.180]  And I know these are good deals Ted's offering you.
[2:28:28.180 --> 2:28:31.180]  And I believe gold's only going to go up.
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:32.180]  And it has been.
[2:28:32.180 --> 2:28:37.180]  And I told you, remember two weeks ago when it was 860, get into it, it's about to go up because of what I saw with the banks.
[2:28:37.180 --> 2:28:39.180]  Now, it happened sooner than I thought.
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:41.180]  And it's worse than I thought.
[2:28:41.180 --> 2:28:46.180]  You know, we had a big analyst on today, another top economist saying year and a half till total depression.
[2:28:46.180 --> 2:28:47.180]  These are saying two and a half.
[2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:48.180]  Look, I don't know.
[2:28:48.180 --> 2:28:50.180]  This just looks bad now with all these bank runs.
[2:28:50.180 --> 2:28:53.180]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:28:53.180 --> 2:28:57.180]  The brokers are there till midnight right now because it's not just my listeners calling.
[2:28:57.180 --> 2:29:02.180]  It is going crazy because this company's been around for decades and people are really calling right now.
[2:29:02.180 --> 2:29:04.180]  So be sure and get your call and get your order in.
[2:29:04.180 --> 2:29:10.180]  And make sure you tell them it's the Alex Jones special that you heard it here or you're going to be paying higher prices.
[2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:14.180]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:29:14.180 --> 2:29:15.180]  Don't wait.
[2:29:15.180 --> 2:29:16.180]  Put them out.
[2:29:16.180 --> 2:29:17.180]  Call up and buy one coin.
[2:29:17.180 --> 2:29:19.180]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:29:19.180 --> 2:29:21.180]  Ted Anderson, thank you for spending time with me.
[2:29:21.180 --> 2:29:22.180]  Hey, it's a pleasure again.
[2:29:22.180 --> 2:29:23.180]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[2:29:23.180 --> 2:29:24.180]  You bet.
[2:29:24.180 --> 2:29:25.180]  That number if you want to call.
[2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:28.180]  800-686-2237.
[2:29:28.180 --> 2:29:29.180]  Give them a call.
[2:29:29.180 --> 2:29:30.180]  Ask them questions.
[2:29:30.180 --> 2:29:32.180]  We'll be right back with the Freeman perspective.

[2:33:25.180 --> 2:33:32.180]  Are you skankin'? Are you skankin'?
[2:33:32.180 --> 2:33:39.180]  Or Top Rankin'? Oh, did you mean what you said?
[2:33:39.180 --> 2:33:45.180]  Are you? Are you? Are you?
[2:33:45.180 --> 2:33:50.180]  No, no, no. They say the blood runs,
[2:33:50.180 --> 2:33:54.180]  and it runs through our lion,
[2:33:54.180 --> 2:33:57.180]  and the whore,
[2:33:57.180 --> 2:34:01.180]  whore, the whore, the thang.
[2:34:01.180 --> 2:34:09.180]  And John saw them come.
[2:34:09.180 --> 2:34:12.180]  Oh, with the truth,
[2:34:12.180 --> 2:34:16.180]  come an ancient day.
[2:34:16.180 --> 2:34:19.180]  The brother-in-law.
[2:34:19.180 --> 2:34:23.180]  The sister-in-law.
[2:34:23.180 --> 2:34:28.180]  I feel this morning.
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:33.180]  I love you all that love goodness and life.
[2:34:33.180 --> 2:34:38.180]  The sister-in-law.
[2:34:38.180 --> 2:34:40.180]  The evil is growing.
[2:34:40.180 --> 2:34:45.180]  There's nothing cute or funny about it.
[2:34:45.180 --> 2:34:49.180]  They don't want us to unite.
[2:34:49.180 --> 2:34:54.180]  They don't want us to unite against the darkness.
[2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:57.180]  All they want us to do is
[2:34:57.180 --> 2:35:02.180]  because they are spiritual birds of carrion.
[2:35:02.180 --> 2:35:06.180]  They eat and feed off of dead societies,
[2:35:06.180 --> 2:35:09.180]  dead cultures.
[2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:14.180]  They are the order of death.
[2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:16.180]  And again, to everybody out there,
[2:35:16.180 --> 2:35:19.180]  I offer you an olive branch.
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:22.180]  All those that have falsely attacked me,
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:24.180]  I reach out to you now
[2:35:24.180 --> 2:35:27.180]  and tell you the time is too short.
[2:35:27.180 --> 2:35:29.180]  The evil is too great.
[2:35:29.180 --> 2:35:32.180]  It's time to really focus on the new world order
[2:35:32.180 --> 2:35:34.180]  and warn as many of the people
[2:35:34.180 --> 2:35:36.180]  who are still captured by the enemy,
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:38.180]  psychologically and spiritually,
[2:35:38.180 --> 2:35:40.180]  who are still in the matrix.
[2:35:40.180 --> 2:35:42.180]  It is time to unlock them now,
[2:35:42.180 --> 2:35:45.180]  or the destruction is going to be almost complete.
[2:35:45.180 --> 2:35:47.180]  Things are going to be bad regardless,
[2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:49.180]  but if we wake up and stand up and find evil
[2:35:49.180 --> 2:35:51.180]  and are bold and have courage now,
[2:35:51.180 --> 2:35:53.180]  we have got a fighting chance.
[2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:55.180]  Now is the time to quit screwing around,
[2:35:55.180 --> 2:35:58.180]  join forces in waking people up.
[2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:00.180]  That means we don't all join forces
[2:36:00.180 --> 2:36:02.180]  and that means follow one person
[2:36:02.180 --> 2:36:04.180]  or all even totally agree.
[2:36:04.180 --> 2:36:07.180]  Focus our energies like our lives depend on it.
[2:36:07.180 --> 2:36:09.180]  This is the eleventh hour
[2:36:09.180 --> 2:36:13.180]  on exposing the beast system, the new world order.
[2:36:13.180 --> 2:36:15.180]  Like I said earlier in the hour
[2:36:15.180 --> 2:36:17.180]  when I was getting ready to introduce him,
[2:36:17.180 --> 2:36:20.180]  was that Freeman, he just goes by Freeman.
[2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:22.180]  I've known him, I guess, eight years, maybe nine years.
[2:36:22.180 --> 2:36:25.180]  He started coming around doing shows with Chris Athanas
[2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:28.180]  and others on the local cable channel here,
[2:36:28.180 --> 2:36:30.180]  has a great online radio show, makes great films,
[2:36:30.180 --> 2:36:34.180]  made several documentaries, made one with Tex Mars,
[2:36:34.180 --> 2:36:36.180]  and I'm told him and Tex may work
[2:36:36.180 --> 2:36:39.180]  on making a documentary out of mysterious monuments.
[2:36:39.180 --> 2:36:40.180]  In fact, I was thinking to you,
[2:36:40.180 --> 2:36:42.180]  that's why I thought to have you on when I had Tex on
[2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:43.180]  a few weeks ago, I thought,
[2:36:43.180 --> 2:36:45.180]  I bet Freeman's going to take this and make a documentary
[2:36:45.180 --> 2:36:48.180]  and I can't wait to see it about what we're dealing with.
[2:36:48.180 --> 2:36:51.180]  And to simplify it, there is an ancient subculture,
[2:36:51.180 --> 2:36:53.180]  an ancient secret society.
[2:36:53.180 --> 2:36:55.180]  Secret society is just, in a modern term,
[2:36:55.180 --> 2:36:57.180]  is an intelligence agency.
[2:36:57.180 --> 2:37:01.180]  And what they're doing is they're setting up
[2:37:01.180 --> 2:37:03.180]  their world plan, their world system,
[2:37:03.180 --> 2:37:07.180]  and their symbols, their language is all around us,
[2:37:07.180 --> 2:37:13.180]  and you can learn by studying it what their language is
[2:37:13.180 --> 2:37:15.180]  and then what they're planning to do
[2:37:15.180 --> 2:37:16.180]  and what's happening in the world.
[2:37:16.180 --> 2:37:18.180]  I mean, even if you're an evil person,
[2:37:18.180 --> 2:37:20.180]  that means you don't care about others,
[2:37:20.180 --> 2:37:21.180]  you only care about yourself.
[2:37:21.180 --> 2:37:22.180]  Don't realize that that's destroying yourself
[2:37:22.180 --> 2:37:24.180]  with that process.
[2:37:24.180 --> 2:37:26.180]  This is interesting and important information
[2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:28.180]  because in business and in life,
[2:37:28.180 --> 2:37:30.180]  this is powerful info.
[2:37:30.180 --> 2:37:32.180]  I mean, just from a secular perspective,
[2:37:32.180 --> 2:37:35.180]  studying it, you know, for the last decade or so,
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:38.180]  seeing how they operate, I have learned a great deal
[2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:40.180]  and have been able to predict a lot of what
[2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:41.180]  is going to happen.
[2:37:41.180 --> 2:37:44.180]  So for the next hour and 20 minutes or so,
[2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:47.180]  we are joined by Freeman of the Freeman perspective.
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:50.180]  It'll give you your website and talk about a lot more
[2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:52.180]  coming up in that time with him.
[2:37:52.180 --> 2:37:54.180]  Freeman, it's good to have you here, my friend.
[2:37:54.180 --> 2:37:55.180]  It's great to be here, Alex.
[2:37:55.180 --> 2:37:56.180]  You bet.
[2:37:56.180 --> 2:37:58.180]  Out of the gates, I want to get something straight
[2:37:58.180 --> 2:38:00.180]  because I saw a video or something months ago
[2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:01.180]  with you on the web saying,
[2:38:01.180 --> 2:38:03.180]  I love Alex because a lot of great work,
[2:38:03.180 --> 2:38:05.180]  infiltrated the Bohemian Grove, great guy,
[2:38:05.180 --> 2:38:08.180]  but he keeps saying that the owl at Bohemian Grove
[2:38:08.180 --> 2:38:11.180]  is Molek and it's not, you know, it's Lilith
[2:38:11.180 --> 2:38:13.180]  and it's this God, it's that God,
[2:38:13.180 --> 2:38:15.180]  and I just want to make clear to Freeman, I know that.
[2:38:15.180 --> 2:38:19.180]  The Bohemian Grove guys address it as a male
[2:38:19.180 --> 2:38:22.180]  and then as a female and so because it is an idol
[2:38:22.180 --> 2:38:25.180]  they burn kids to, they let the owl,
[2:38:25.180 --> 2:38:27.180]  which really isn't an owl, it's just a giant.
[2:38:27.180 --> 2:38:29.180]  They call it an owl, they call it a goddess,
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:32.180]  they call it Molek in some of their writings
[2:38:32.180 --> 2:38:35.180]  and some of their literature when they burn the child.
[2:38:35.180 --> 2:38:37.180]  So as you know, as you know more about
[2:38:37.180 --> 2:38:39.180]  this certain esoteric area than I do,
[2:38:39.180 --> 2:38:40.180]  they flip back and forth.
[2:38:40.180 --> 2:38:42.180]  So when I was there, I heard them really address it
[2:38:42.180 --> 2:38:46.180]  three different ways, a horn god, goddess,
[2:38:46.180 --> 2:38:49.180]  the owl that comes to heal, I heard them address it
[2:38:49.180 --> 2:38:53.180]  as being worshiped in Babylon and Goodly Tire
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:56.180]  and then their literature, they call it Molek,
[2:38:56.180 --> 2:38:58.180]  so it's become somewhat of a controversy.
[2:38:58.180 --> 2:39:00.180]  I just wanted to make that clear.
[2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:02.180]  Right, I absolutely understand that
[2:39:02.180 --> 2:39:05.180]  and their symbolism is somewhat confusing to us
[2:39:05.180 --> 2:39:08.180]  because well, there's society with secrets.
[2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:11.180]  But we got to understand that this is the reason
[2:39:11.180 --> 2:39:14.180]  our capital is known as the District of Columbia.
[2:39:14.180 --> 2:39:16.180]  Who is this goddess? Who is Columbia?
[2:39:16.180 --> 2:39:18.180]  We have all of the Columbia Broadcasting,
[2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:21.180]  Columbia University, Columbia Records
[2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:24.180]  and no one in America has any clue
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:28.180]  as to who their goddess is or that they even have one.
[2:39:28.180 --> 2:39:29.180]  Where should we start today?
[2:39:29.180 --> 2:39:31.180]  Let's start with who Freeman is
[2:39:31.180 --> 2:39:33.180]  and if you want to tell folks your full name,
[2:39:33.180 --> 2:39:35.180]  that's fine if you don't, you can just stick with Freeman
[2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:37.180]  and then go over your awakening process, your family
[2:39:37.180 --> 2:39:40.180]  and then let's get first off into
[2:39:40.180 --> 2:39:43.180]  who the New World Order are, what their mindset is
[2:39:43.180 --> 2:39:44.180]  and then how they control us.
[2:39:44.180 --> 2:39:47.180]  Absolutely, well, I've been Freeman for so long
[2:39:47.180 --> 2:39:50.180]  that I don't know how to answer anything else.
[2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:53.180]  I got into this as a young child
[2:39:53.180 --> 2:39:56.180]  studying different esoteric adventures
[2:39:56.180 --> 2:39:58.180]  such as the pyramids or extraterrestrials
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:39:59.180]  and things of that nature
[2:39:59.180 --> 2:40:02.180]  and as I got deeper and deeper into this study,
[2:40:02.180 --> 2:40:05.180]  I came finally across the Freemasons.
[2:40:05.180 --> 2:40:07.180]  This wasn't until I was in college
[2:40:07.180 --> 2:40:10.180]  and when I was in college and started to understand
[2:40:10.180 --> 2:40:14.180]  this secret society, I realized very quickly
[2:40:14.180 --> 2:40:16.180]  that my father was involved.
[2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:19.180]  So I started discussing this with my father
[2:40:19.180 --> 2:40:21.180]  and I found out that he was worshipful master
[2:40:21.180 --> 2:40:23.180]  for the Kaiser-Slatan Lodge,
[2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:25.180]  Freemasonic German Lodge
[2:40:25.180 --> 2:40:28.180]  and not only as this, he was chasing flying saucers
[2:40:28.180 --> 2:40:29.180]  for the government.
[2:40:29.180 --> 2:40:31.180]  Now the only thing my dad ever said to me about that
[2:40:31.180 --> 2:40:33.180]  was, yeah, flying saucers are real.
[2:40:33.180 --> 2:40:35.180]  He was very close mouth about all of this.
[2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:37.180]  It was only when I discovered it for myself
[2:40:37.180 --> 2:40:39.180]  that he gave me any clues whatsoever.
[2:40:39.180 --> 2:40:41.180]  So here's my dad, worshipful master
[2:40:41.180 --> 2:40:43.180]  of the Kaiser-Slatan Freemason Lodge
[2:40:43.180 --> 2:40:46.180]  who was building nuclear missiles for Martin Marietta,
[2:40:46.180 --> 2:40:48.180]  was on Killer One Submarine with Jimmy Carter
[2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:51.180]  and also chasing flying saucers in Project Blue Book.
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:53.180]  So I had to come up my reality
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:55.180]  from an entirely different perspective.
[2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:58.180]  It wasn't, is this going on? It's what's going on?
[2:40:58.180 --> 2:41:01.180]  It was more, I had to get deeper into these
[2:41:01.180 --> 2:41:04.180]  more esoteric ideas and not such the political.
[2:41:04.180 --> 2:41:07.180]  Absolutely.
[2:41:07.180 --> 2:41:09.180]  And of course, your website is
[2:41:09.180 --> 2:41:12.180]  thefreemanperspective.blogspot.com
[2:41:12.180 --> 2:41:15.180]  or just Google Freeman in New World Order
[2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:18.180]  and it'll come up for you.
[2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:22.180]  Let's get into some of your research, your study.
[2:41:22.180 --> 2:41:26.180]  Who the globalists are, who the Illuminati are,
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:28.180]  who the New World Order are, what their highest councils are,
[2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:32.180]  how many of them make up their great-white brother
[2:41:32.180 --> 2:41:36.180]  or their penultimate brotherhood of the serpent
[2:41:36.180 --> 2:41:39.180]  and then why they want to turn the world
[2:41:39.180 --> 2:41:41.180]  into what they're turning it into
[2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:44.180]  and what that world is going to look like.
[2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:47.180]  Now, I began with a study of corporate logos
[2:41:47.180 --> 2:41:50.180]  with trying to understand what all of these signs and symbols
[2:41:50.180 --> 2:41:52.180]  around us meant and where they came from.
[2:41:52.180 --> 2:41:54.180]  And as I studied and studied into this,
[2:41:54.180 --> 2:41:57.180]  I quickly realized that each of the corporate logos
[2:41:57.180 --> 2:42:01.180]  that we see daily are references
[2:42:01.180 --> 2:42:04.180]  to the inner rituals of Freemasonry.
[2:42:04.180 --> 2:42:06.180]  So you have your star of Texaco
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:09.180]  and your shell of Panic, of Shell.
[2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:11.180]  These are symbols of Lucifer.
[2:42:11.180 --> 2:42:14.180]  These are the same symbols you'll see of the Statue of Columbia
[2:42:14.180 --> 2:42:17.180]  out in front of the UT campus.
[2:42:17.180 --> 2:42:19.180]  We have our goddess Columbia sitting there
[2:42:19.180 --> 2:42:22.180]  with a star and a pentagram in a shell.
[2:42:22.180 --> 2:42:24.180]  Just like we see Obama with the rising sun
[2:42:24.180 --> 2:42:27.180]  or we have the torch that symbolizes the new day,
[2:42:27.180 --> 2:42:29.180]  the morning star Lucifer.
[2:42:29.180 --> 2:42:31.180]  And you can go through it again and again
[2:42:31.180 --> 2:42:33.180]  and again going through Hollywood.
[2:42:33.180 --> 2:42:35.180]  Phoenix Pictures uses the Lucifer,
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:37.180]  which is a friction match as their logo.
[2:42:37.180 --> 2:42:40.180]  They do film on genetic manipulation,
[2:42:40.180 --> 2:42:44.180]  on child labor camps, on starring Sigourney Weaver,
[2:42:44.180 --> 2:42:47.180]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, they do movies on Hitler Love
[2:42:47.180 --> 2:42:49.180]  written by Stephen King.
[2:42:49.180 --> 2:42:51.180]  And all of these movies come through one production company
[2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:53.180]  that has Lucifer, which is a friction match,
[2:42:53.180 --> 2:42:56.180]  which becomes the rising sun as their symbol.
[2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:58.180]  So as I was going through these different symbols
[2:42:58.180 --> 2:43:02.180]  and I came up with Philip 66, what does that mean?
[2:43:02.180 --> 2:43:05.180]  Well, what I've researched and discovered is that...
[2:43:05.180 --> 2:43:06.180]  Kabbalah.
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:08.180]  Freemasonry is Kabbalah.
[2:43:08.180 --> 2:43:11.180]  And 66 is the number of the dark side.
[2:43:11.180 --> 2:43:13.180]  And so I'm looking at Philip 66
[2:43:13.180 --> 2:43:16.180]  and I realize in Kabbalah, Kabbalah is an ancient Hebrew mysticism.
[2:43:16.180 --> 2:43:19.180]  And that's why 66 is the dark side number
[2:43:19.180 --> 2:43:22.180]  then combined with a man practicing it as 666.
[2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:23.180]  Exactly.
[2:43:23.180 --> 2:43:27.180]  And you get to this with the symbols that we'll see in Volkswagen.
[2:43:27.180 --> 2:43:30.180]  So in Hebrew, 6 is V.
[2:43:30.180 --> 2:43:33.180]  And so when Hitler came to power through the Thule Society,
[2:43:33.180 --> 2:43:37.180]  through this occult agenda, his war machine, the Volkswagen,
[2:43:37.180 --> 2:43:39.180]  took on the double V, but the two Vs interlaced,
[2:43:39.180 --> 2:43:42.180]  making a third V, making 666.
[2:43:42.180 --> 2:43:45.180]  And then they say 666, 666 because they double the W.
[2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:46.180]  Yeah.
[2:43:46.180 --> 2:43:47.180]  Absolutely.
[2:43:47.180 --> 2:43:48.180]  And then, of course, for those that don't know,
[2:43:48.180 --> 2:43:49.180]  it's mainline history.
[2:43:49.180 --> 2:43:53.180]  Hitler and the double thunderbolts in runes means Lucifer falling to Earth.
[2:43:53.180 --> 2:43:56.180]  I mean, just everything, everything they did.
[2:43:56.180 --> 2:43:59.180]  They admittedly have the SS castle chopping SS people's heads off
[2:43:59.180 --> 2:44:01.180]  to portend things.
[2:44:01.180 --> 2:44:03.180]  I mean, whether you believe in this or not, they do.
[2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:04.180]  Yes.
[2:44:04.180 --> 2:44:08.180]  You've got the deputy Fuhrer parachuting out of his airplane
[2:44:08.180 --> 2:44:12.180]  over the castle with all these runes and magic ambulance,
[2:44:12.180 --> 2:44:15.180]  Rudolph Hess, I mean, it just, and then they grabbed him real quick.
[2:44:15.180 --> 2:44:16.180]  Yes.
[2:44:16.180 --> 2:44:19.180]  And as we start to discover these Kabbalistic symbols
[2:44:19.180 --> 2:44:22.180]  and realize that I used this knowledge of the 66
[2:44:22.180 --> 2:44:25.180]  to predict W being railroaded into office,
[2:44:25.180 --> 2:44:28.180]  I knew that they were calling them W for a reason.
[2:44:28.180 --> 2:44:32.180]  And it was at this moment when I realized that I had made this connection.
[2:44:32.180 --> 2:44:38.180]  I knew that that would be the year that they would instigate the false flag terrorist event.
[2:44:38.180 --> 2:44:39.180]  We know it's not.
[2:44:39.180 --> 2:44:43.180]  And his father, in two separate speeches on 9-11 years before,
[2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:47.180]  kept saying it's going to come forth because they believe they do the rituals,
[2:44:47.180 --> 2:44:50.180]  but then by the public symbol, that's the lesser magic
[2:44:50.180 --> 2:44:52.180]  or the doorway bringing the power in.
[2:44:52.180 --> 2:44:54.180]  You want to explain that to people?
[2:44:54.180 --> 2:44:55.180]  Exactly.
[2:44:55.180 --> 2:44:57.180]  It was the same with Hitler's Prestidigitation,
[2:44:57.180 --> 2:45:00.180]  when he would stand before all of them with the big wall of light
[2:45:00.180 --> 2:45:03.180]  and have them all compacted in a religious frenzy.
[2:45:03.180 --> 2:45:05.180]  This is reality manufacturing.
[2:45:05.180 --> 2:45:10.180]  It is a way of instilling a mindset pattern programming into us.
[2:45:10.180 --> 2:45:12.180]  And so they know about these things.
[2:45:12.180 --> 2:45:16.180]  They have been doing this type of intelligence for decades or millennia,
[2:45:16.180 --> 2:45:20.180]  and they are very masterful at this.
[2:45:20.180 --> 2:45:24.180]  Now, as we look into this picture, and as I was saying, we have our goddess Columbia,
[2:45:24.180 --> 2:45:28.180]  but we got to take this all to Hebrew to understand the Masonic connections.
[2:45:28.180 --> 2:45:33.180]  And so in Hebrew, the goddess is known as the Shekinah, or the Shachinah.
[2:45:33.180 --> 2:45:37.180]  And so when I saw that this Shachinah campaign was coming out,
[2:45:37.180 --> 2:45:40.180]  and then of course we put Saddam Hussein in power,
[2:45:40.180 --> 2:45:43.180]  and he's announcing he's Nebuchadnezzar reincarnated.
[2:45:43.180 --> 2:45:45.180]  He was saying that publicly.
[2:45:45.180 --> 2:45:46.180]  Absolutely.
[2:45:46.180 --> 2:45:48.180]  He's totally out of his mind believing this.
[2:45:48.180 --> 2:45:52.180]  And it doesn't stop there.
[2:45:52.180 --> 2:45:55.180]  You have Bush always saying, we're going to bring order out of chaos.
[2:45:55.180 --> 2:46:01.180]  He even says that one of their main maxims, he said it repeatedly.
[2:46:01.180 --> 2:46:04.180]  They also believe that they need to manifest it.
[2:46:04.180 --> 2:46:07.180]  Why in this black magic is what we're talking about?
[2:46:07.180 --> 2:46:11.180]  Why do they believe it's so important to tell you, like when Bush said twice,
[2:46:11.180 --> 2:46:12.180]  I'm going to be a dictator.
[2:46:12.180 --> 2:46:16.180]  It's going to be a lot easier when he's always saying I'm going to bring order out of chaos,
[2:46:16.180 --> 2:46:18.180]  or he'll get up and say, yeah, we're going to have a draft,
[2:46:18.180 --> 2:46:21.180]  and then laugh and say, I mean, no draft, and then smile.
[2:46:21.180 --> 2:46:24.180]  I mean, you can see them doing all of this.
[2:46:24.180 --> 2:46:28.180]  Now, the thing that I've gathered from all of this is the power of free will.
[2:46:28.180 --> 2:46:32.180]  And as I've looked into Freemasonry, looked into the occult practices,
[2:46:32.180 --> 2:46:36.180]  I've seen that what you must do, I mean, the first thing you say when you walk into a Freemason temple
[2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:39.180]  is that you come of your own free will and accord.
[2:46:39.180 --> 2:46:42.180]  And so it is this free will that you must give up.
[2:46:42.180 --> 2:46:47.180]  And I believe that this is the spiritual key that's hiding in the midst of it all,
[2:46:47.180 --> 2:46:49.180]  that we must give up our free will.
[2:46:49.180 --> 2:46:51.180]  And so they put it in front of us.
[2:46:51.180 --> 2:46:54.180]  And that's what the Bohemian Grove ritual, I mean, there's lots of parts to it,
[2:46:54.180 --> 2:46:57.180]  but just like they take something from foul, something from Babylon,
[2:46:57.180 --> 2:47:01.180]  something from Greece, you know, they bring in the Canaanite god, Moloch,
[2:47:01.180 --> 2:47:05.180]  the bull, Lilith, the owl, they do all of this.
[2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:10.180]  And that one part about dull care is where they lock your conscience in the box,
[2:47:10.180 --> 2:47:13.180]  and it's a ritual to take their conscience away.
[2:47:13.180 --> 2:47:15.180]  And people say, oh, that's just a theatrical thing.
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:17.180]  No, I was with those thousand-plus men.
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:19.180]  They were in religious ecstasy.
[2:47:19.180 --> 2:47:20.180]  Yes.
[2:47:20.180 --> 2:47:22.180]  And they bring this stuff before us.
[2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:25.180]  They do high-profile rituals right in front of us constantly.
[2:47:25.180 --> 2:47:29.180]  Now, a lot of people don't recognize that, well, back with the Shakanah,
[2:47:29.180 --> 2:47:34.180]  of course, that was a ritual of theirs, but many people died in this.
[2:47:34.180 --> 2:47:38.180]  But the Shakanah comes down, strikes Nebuchadnezzar, Saddam Hussein,
[2:47:38.180 --> 2:47:41.180]  using the mother of all bombs, which is the Moab,
[2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:42.180]  and I challenge you to go-
[2:47:42.180 --> 2:47:43.180]  Yeah, even call it the Moab.
[2:47:43.180 --> 2:47:44.180]  Exactly.
[2:47:44.180 --> 2:47:48.180]  Go look in Isaiah and see who Lucifer was, and that was Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:47:48.180 --> 2:47:52.180]  and who was Nebuchadnezzar taken out with, but by the Moabites.
[2:47:52.180 --> 2:47:53.180]  All right?
[2:47:53.180 --> 2:47:56.180]  So the Shakanah comes down, strikes Nebuchadnezzar, using the Moabs.
[2:47:56.180 --> 2:47:58.180]  This is a ritual ceremony.
[2:47:58.180 --> 2:48:02.180]  This is not warfare, and all of our people are dying in the middle.
[2:48:02.180 --> 2:48:06.180]  Now, they use these high-profile rituals in front of us constantly.
[2:48:06.180 --> 2:48:10.180]  And they also believe that they can't just only kill the enemy forces
[2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:11.180]  because of the Illuminati.
[2:48:11.180 --> 2:48:15.180]  They believe in this balance, and we see the Illuminati with Star Wars,
[2:48:15.180 --> 2:48:18.180]  where the good guys are trying to bring balance to the force.
[2:48:18.180 --> 2:48:20.180]  They believe it's not right for our soldiers to not die,
[2:48:20.180 --> 2:48:24.180]  so they use DEU, and they give a certain percentage shots that are going to kill them.
[2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:26.180]  You understand that, troops?
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:27.180]  They believe in balance.
[2:48:27.180 --> 2:48:28.180]  They're going to kill you.
[2:48:28.180 --> 2:48:29.180]  Go ahead.
[2:48:29.180 --> 2:48:32.180]  Absolutely, and if you realize in that Revenge of the Sith,
[2:48:32.180 --> 2:48:37.180]  that when they took out the Republic and announced the Empire,
[2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:39.180]  it was upon Execute Order 66.
[2:48:39.180 --> 2:48:41.180]  Execute Order number 66.
[2:48:41.180 --> 2:48:42.180]  Which is W.
[2:48:42.180 --> 2:48:43.180]  Which is Dark Side.
[2:48:43.180 --> 2:48:44.180]  Yes, exactly.
[2:48:44.180 --> 2:48:46.180]  I mean, it's all right there in front of us,
[2:48:46.180 --> 2:48:49.180]  but it's all coded in this Kabbalistic esoteric event.
[2:48:49.180 --> 2:48:54.180]  Now, I was at the WTO IMF protest after the Seattle fiasco.
[2:48:54.180 --> 2:48:55.180]  All right?
[2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:56.180]  Now, people are talking about the rainbow attack.
[2:48:56.180 --> 2:49:00.180]  Well, let's think about Seattle when they attacked all of those protesters
[2:49:00.180 --> 2:49:01.180]  against the WTO.
[2:49:01.180 --> 2:49:02.180]  IMF.
[2:49:02.180 --> 2:49:05.180]  I went to Washington D.C. and said, do that to me.
[2:49:05.180 --> 2:49:10.180]  And as I was standing there, I walk up on a line of riot squads
[2:49:10.180 --> 2:49:13.180]  that had blocked 600 people in the middle of a street,
[2:49:13.180 --> 2:49:17.180]  and they arrested all of these 600 people that were little old ladies,
[2:49:17.180 --> 2:49:23.180]  little boys, zip tied them all, put them all on city buses, on school buses,
[2:49:23.180 --> 2:49:24.180]  hauled them all away.
[2:49:24.180 --> 2:49:27.180]  14 hours, these people were held without bathrooms, without water,
[2:49:27.180 --> 2:49:29.180]  for nothing, for walking down the street.
[2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:32.180]  Now, there were 1,000 of us on the other side of the police line,
[2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:34.180]  and they're not bothering with us.
[2:49:34.180 --> 2:49:36.180]  They had trapped these 600 in the middle.
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:38.180]  No, they admittedly, and I've been there in New York and everywhere,
[2:49:38.180 --> 2:49:41.180]  and seen it, they will just randomly get a group.
[2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:44.180]  It's all about training, taking them to the facility, exactly.
[2:49:44.180 --> 2:49:46.180]  Now, what I did now with my information,
[2:49:46.180 --> 2:49:49.180]  I was yelling at all of these officers in their riot gear,
[2:49:49.180 --> 2:49:54.180]  yelling about these people's rights and how they were just offensive,
[2:49:54.180 --> 2:49:56.180]  and are you American?
[2:49:56.180 --> 2:50:03.180]  And as I saw, I got no response from these bullies at all, these jack-booted thugs,
[2:50:03.180 --> 2:50:07.180]  but what I did is I pulled out some of my freemasonic knowledge,
[2:50:07.180 --> 2:50:09.180]  and I yelled to these officers,
[2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:11.180]  how many of you are widow's sons?
[2:50:11.180 --> 2:50:13.180]  Which is code word for freemason.
[2:50:13.180 --> 2:50:15.180]  Alex, I got their attention then.
[2:50:15.180 --> 2:50:16.180]  Oh, yeah.
[2:50:16.180 --> 2:50:17.180]  They all looked at me.
[2:50:17.180 --> 2:50:22.180]  All the riot squads, the officers, everyone standing there was a widow's son.
[2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:24.180]  Every single one of these men was a freemason
[2:50:24.180 --> 2:50:27.180]  that was holding these American people in the middle of this.
[2:50:27.180 --> 2:50:30.180]  And how dare them claim that they are like George Washington,
[2:50:30.180 --> 2:50:36.180]  the masons of old, when they are there violating what our forefathers fought and died for.
[2:50:36.180 --> 2:50:37.180]  Absolutely.
[2:50:37.180 --> 2:50:40.180]  So there's been a shift to order number 66.
[2:50:40.180 --> 2:50:41.180]  Exactly.
[2:50:41.180 --> 2:50:42.180]  Execute order number 66.
[2:50:42.180 --> 2:50:44.180]  Bring in the dark side.
[2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:45.180]  Kettle the younglings.
[2:50:45.180 --> 2:50:46.180]  Yes.
[2:50:48.180 --> 2:50:50.180]  Have you heard about American Free Press?
[2:50:50.180 --> 2:50:52.180]  American Free Press.
[2:50:52.180 --> 2:50:56.180]  The only national newspaper that endorsed Ron Paul for president.
[2:50:56.180 --> 2:50:58.180]  American Free Press.
[2:50:58.180 --> 2:51:01.180]  Written by patriots, for patriots.
[2:51:01.180 --> 2:51:04.180]  Standing firm for our constitution.
[2:51:04.180 --> 2:51:07.180]  Standing firm against the New World Order.
[2:51:07.180 --> 2:51:09.180]  Hammering the enemies of freedom.
[2:51:09.180 --> 2:51:12.180]  Exposing the intrigues of the global elite.
[2:51:12.180 --> 2:51:16.180]  American Free Press hits the Bilderbergers and trilateralists.
[2:51:16.180 --> 2:51:20.180]  And the whole council on foreign relations gang head on.
[2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:24.180]  Here's your chance to catch up with the news from American Free Press.

[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:35.180]  It's just like it sounds.

[2:51:42.180 --> 2:51:44.180]  American Free Press.
[2:51:44.180 --> 2:51:47.180]  The voice of the Second American Revolution.
[2:51:47.180 --> 2:51:49.180]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:52.180]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:51:52.180 --> 2:51:55.180]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[2:51:55.180 --> 2:51:56.180]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:51:56.180 --> 2:51:58.180]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:51:58.180 --> 2:52:01.180]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a state?
[2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:03.180]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[2:52:03.180 --> 2:52:05.180]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:07.180]  Can we sit down and shout out?
[2:52:07.180 --> 2:52:09.180]  The day that we stop asking questions
[2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:12.180]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:52:12.180 --> 2:52:14.180]  to grow at our own door.
[2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:17.180]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:20.180]  a global awakening has taken place.
[2:52:20.180 --> 2:52:22.180]  An inside job?
[2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:24.180]  How dare you?
[2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:28.180]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[2:52:28.180 --> 2:52:30.180]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:52:30.180 --> 2:52:33.180]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:52:33.180 --> 2:52:35.180]  And if the government has not told the truth
[2:52:35.180 --> 2:52:38.180]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:39.180]  Truth Rising.

[2:53:01.180 --> 2:53:03.180]  and demoed our new product in Boston.

[2:53:14.180 --> 2:53:18.180]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[2:53:56.180 --> 2:53:59.180]  Tell all the folks in Russia
[2:53:59.180 --> 2:54:04.180]  It's time to do
[2:54:04.180 --> 2:54:07.180]  Don't you know that it's time
[2:54:07.180 --> 2:54:10.180]  To get on board
[2:54:10.180 --> 2:54:12.180]  And let this train
[2:54:12.180 --> 2:54:17.180]  Keep on riding, riding on board

[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:21.180]  Get on board
[2:54:21.180 --> 2:54:23.180]  Freeman is our guest.
[2:54:23.180 --> 2:54:26.180]  My websites, of course, are prisonplanet.com
[2:54:26.180 --> 2:54:29.180]  infowars.net, jonesreport.com
[2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:31.180]  We have a redesign at prisonplanet.com
[2:54:31.180 --> 2:54:33.180]  But if you like the old prisonplanet.com
[2:54:33.180 --> 2:54:35.180]  Just go to classic.prisonplanet.com
[2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:38.180]  Or click on the big fat banner on the front of prisonplanet.com
[2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:42.180]  And we update the old main page every day just for you.
[2:54:42.180 --> 2:54:45.180]  The forum is down today because out of all of our servers
[2:54:45.180 --> 2:54:48.180]  That's the one server that's down that has the forum on it.
[2:54:48.180 --> 2:54:52.180]  And we're working like the devil as they say to get that back up.
[2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:54.180]  Freeman, we were just talking during the break
[2:54:54.180 --> 2:54:56.180]  And I've checked this for myself.
[2:54:56.180 --> 2:54:59.180]  The cornerstone of the Twin Towers late on 9-11.
[2:54:59.180 --> 2:55:02.180]  The cornerstone of the Pentagon late on 9-11.
[2:55:02.180 --> 2:55:06.180]  All the Masonic things dealing with what happened.
[2:55:06.180 --> 2:55:08.180]  But we'll get into that in a minute. Go back to the police.
[2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:11.180]  So you start talking to them in Masonic
[2:55:11.180 --> 2:55:13.180]  Of course, they're porch masons.
[2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:16.180]  But you can see them doing their evil deeds now, though.
[2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:19.180]  So they shouldn't claim to the good guys anymore.
[2:55:19.180 --> 2:55:21.180]  What else did you say? What happened?
[2:55:21.180 --> 2:55:24.180]  Well, at that point, I kind of ducked.
[2:55:24.180 --> 2:55:27.180]  When I noticed that I had really gotten their attention
[2:55:27.180 --> 2:55:30.180]  At that point, I just kind of was like, oh, wow.
[2:55:30.180 --> 2:55:32.180]  Okay, I know what's going on here.
[2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:35.180]  Now, as far as porch masons go,
[2:55:35.180 --> 2:55:38.180]  My father, being the worshipful master within the lodge,
[2:55:38.180 --> 2:55:43.180]  He told me, well, you know, I don't really like all the gobbly gook of the Scottish, right?
[2:55:43.180 --> 2:55:45.180]  So here's a man who is running the rituals,
[2:55:45.180 --> 2:55:48.180]  Who is doing the ceremonies for the initiations,
[2:55:48.180 --> 2:55:51.180]  And he doesn't have a clue as to what they mean.
[2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:54.180]  You know, it's something that they don't research themselves.
[2:55:54.180 --> 2:55:58.180]  There's not many masons who are going to go in and try and understand Kabbalah.
[2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:00.180]  Well, if you tell a Mason that Albert Pike,
[2:56:00.180 --> 2:56:03.180]  Who's hanging on all their walls at the lodge,
[2:56:03.180 --> 2:56:05.180]  Said, I worship Lucifer. We are Lucifer worshipers.
[2:56:05.180 --> 2:56:07.180]  We're going to murder everybody in World War III.
[2:56:07.180 --> 2:56:09.180]  We're going to have three World Wars.
[2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:11.180]  He said that 120-something years ago.
[2:56:11.180 --> 2:56:14.180]  They'll just tell you're a liar until you pull it out and they'll freak out.
[2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:16.180]  Or if you tell a manly people, Hall says you worship Lucifer.
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:17.180]  Right.
[2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:20.180]  And they'll say, no, and then you show them. They go, whoa.
[2:56:20.180 --> 2:56:23.180]  Yeah, yeah. And I, you know, I get deep into the different Masonic studies.
[2:56:23.180 --> 2:56:25.180]  I mean, it's simple, folks. Devil worshipers run things.
[2:56:25.180 --> 2:56:27.180]  Yes, it's true. It's true.
[2:56:27.180 --> 2:56:29.180]  They're God Lucifer.
[2:56:29.180 --> 2:56:31.180]  He gives power to those on the earth.
[2:56:31.180 --> 2:56:34.180]  I mean, they figured that out 2,000 years ago when Christ spoke.
[2:56:34.180 --> 2:56:35.180]  Yeah.
[2:56:35.180 --> 2:56:37.180]  Well, this is their hermaphroditic God.
[2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:40.180]  And this is why you'll see the solar symbol, the sun symbol.
[2:56:40.180 --> 2:56:43.180]  In the passion, the devil is male and female, but go ahead.
[2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:48.180]  Yeah, yeah. And that's why you see all that confusion with the owl at Bohemian Gryff.
[2:56:48.180 --> 2:56:50.180]  Because they are into this hermaphrodite.
[2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:53.180]  And we see a lot of this symbolism in Hollywood.
[2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:57.180]  A lot of the hermaphroditic symbolism that comes out with Madonna and Prince.
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:57:01.180]  I mean, Prince's symbol is the hermaphroditic symbol of Venus and Mars.
[2:57:01.180 --> 2:57:08.180]  Or you have the Star of David, which is on the Scottish Rite Temple in Denver, Colorado,
[2:57:08.180 --> 2:57:11.180]  along with the Rosie Cross, the Rosa Crucians.
[2:57:11.180 --> 2:57:16.180]  The, the, the very symbol of Freemasonry, the compass square and G is a hermaphroditic symbol.
[2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:20.180]  And so we constantly see these very same symbols to Lucifer.
[2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:22.180]  And that's absolutely what they are.
[2:57:22.180 --> 2:57:24.180]  And that is who our goddess Columbia is.
[2:57:24.180 --> 2:57:30.180]  Because once you realize that we are looking at the goddess out in front of the UT campus,
[2:57:30.180 --> 2:57:33.180]  we see the, the symbols of Lucifer, the pentagram and the shell.
[2:57:33.180 --> 2:57:37.180]  Now the reason these are the symbols of Lucifer is because she is Venus.
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:40.180]  And these are the symbols of Venus, the shell and the pentagram.
[2:57:40.180 --> 2:57:43.180]  Venus in the dictionary is Lucifer.
[2:57:43.180 --> 2:57:45.180]  And so the morning star.
[2:57:45.180 --> 2:57:46.180]  Exactly.
[2:57:46.180 --> 2:57:48.180]  Because it's, it's best seen in the morning.
[2:57:48.180 --> 2:57:51.180]  Yes. Yes. It brings the sun.
[2:57:51.180 --> 2:57:56.180]  And this is the, the codes that we will see over and over and over again in front of us.
[2:57:56.180 --> 2:57:58.180]  Columbia sportswear clothing.
[2:57:58.180 --> 2:58:00.180]  Their symbol is the Canton Swastika.
[2:58:00.180 --> 2:58:01.180]  Right.
[2:58:01.180 --> 2:58:08.180]  And then inside you'll see a dove, which is the symbol of Samaramus or the ancient Sumerian goddess.
[2:58:08.180 --> 2:58:14.180]  And so we can follow this goddess from the ancient times on the way up from Samaramus to Athena to Minerva.
[2:58:14.180 --> 2:58:17.180]  From my studies, they, they do defer mainly to the goddess.
[2:58:17.180 --> 2:58:18.180]  This is a goddess cult.
[2:58:18.180 --> 2:58:19.180]  Yes.
[2:58:19.180 --> 2:58:22.180]  I stay there Freeman, back in 70 seconds.
[2:58:22.180 --> 2:58:24.180]  Fourth hour, transmission continues.

[2:59:34.180 --> 2:59:36.180]  Bring down the new world order.
[2:59:36.180 --> 2:59:46.180]  Prisonplanet.tv Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:08.180 --> 3:00:10.180]  This is a quick segment.
[3:00:10.180 --> 3:00:12.180]  So many stories to tell, so much to go over.
[3:00:12.180 --> 3:00:16.180]  You were explaining to people there's symbolism everywhere.
[3:00:16.180 --> 3:00:22.180]  I would say 75% of the worship I see and the symbols I see are to the goddess.
[3:00:22.180 --> 3:00:29.180]  The rest of when they show the male symbol, they will show the all seeing eye, which I know can be both, but tends to be male.
[3:00:29.180 --> 3:00:34.180]  With the phallus, the capstone of that.
[3:00:34.180 --> 3:00:36.180]  I was just in DC.
[3:00:36.180 --> 3:00:38.180]  It just plastered everywhere.
[3:00:38.180 --> 3:00:40.180]  Everybody knows that, but to be there.
[3:00:40.180 --> 3:00:44.180]  Let's just keep breaking down whatever you think is most important.
[3:00:44.180 --> 3:00:46.180]  I want to get into their master plan and what they're wanting to build.
[3:00:46.180 --> 3:00:50.180]  I just went on a major film campaign, went to the Georgia guide stones.
[3:00:50.180 --> 3:00:54.180]  I went all over St. Augustine and I ended up in Nashville.
[3:00:54.180 --> 3:00:56.180]  Nashville seems to be their new Atlantis.
[3:00:56.180 --> 3:01:02.180]  That's another thing that this brotherhood holds dear and close to their heart is this Atlantis story.
[3:01:02.180 --> 3:01:06.180]  Whether or not Atlantis was real, I don't know, but they definitely hold on to it.
[3:01:06.180 --> 3:01:14.180]  When I got to Nashville, I found that they have, of course, the Parthenon there with a 42 foot golden goddess standing inside.
[3:01:14.180 --> 3:01:21.180]  A complete recreation of the ancient Parthenon, but just down the street from this temple of the goddess is the temple to Mars.
[3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:24.180]  You'll find a big statue of Mars within there.
[3:01:24.180 --> 3:01:31.180]  Nashville is very interesting because what you'll find is that the Freemasonic rituals are all based out of Solomon's temple.
[3:01:31.180 --> 3:01:37.180]  When you're in a Masonic ritual and you're initiation, you're dealing with Solomon's temple.
[3:01:37.180 --> 3:01:41.180]  If you look into Solomon, of course, Solomon was a worshiper of Mollach.
[3:01:41.180 --> 3:01:48.180]  He was also a worshiper of Asherah, which means growth, and also Shamash, which is their solar deity.
[3:01:48.180 --> 3:01:55.180]  Out in front of the Capitol in Nashville is a large Bicentennial Mall that was put up in 1996,
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:01:59.180]  which just happened to be the same year that Saddam Hussein was recreating Babylon.
[3:01:59.180 --> 3:02:09.180]  This giant Bicentennial Mall out in front of the Capitol, built by your money, was a giant seal of Solomon to bind spirits.
[3:02:09.180 --> 3:02:12.180]  You can look at it straight. It's on freementv.com.
[3:02:12.180 --> 3:02:18.180]  They call it the Star of David is one of their symbols. That's not really the Star of David.
[3:02:18.180 --> 3:02:24.180]  That's the seal of Solomon that God supposedly gives him after he has all these wives and has problems with these genies.
[3:02:24.180 --> 3:02:30.180]  Believe it or not, it's the Bible folks. These devils running around, he's loose, and this is the seal God gives him, correct?
[3:02:30.180 --> 3:02:35.180]  Correct. Now, the seal of Solomon to bind spirits is slightly different than the Star of David.
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:40.180]  It looks more like a keyhole, but this whole device that is built out in front of the Nashville Capitol
[3:02:40.180 --> 3:02:49.180]  is an acoustic device that has the triple pentagram and it has 50 columns surrounding it that all radiate the sound right back to the center of the pentagram.
[3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:54.180]  They have a smaller one of those behind the Texas Capitol for dead Texas peace officers.
[3:02:54.180 --> 3:03:01.180]  It's black granite, huge pentagram, and they always do this to the goddess that they're saying these cops are to you.
[3:03:01.180 --> 3:03:03.180]  Yes, absolutely.
[3:03:03.180 --> 3:03:06.180]  So we're looking at these massive building campaigns.
[3:03:06.180 --> 3:03:15.180]  When they blew up City Hall in Orlando and announced that it was the first point of light and a thousand point of light system for George H.W. Bush,
[3:03:15.180 --> 3:03:24.180]  they blew up City Hall. It was a lethal weapon, too, I believe, and they erected this large ballast and then a gushing vagina right next to it.
[3:03:24.180 --> 3:03:28.180]  And so they will always have these hermaphroditic symbols placed right in front of us.
[3:03:28.180 --> 3:03:34.180]  And of course, everybody in Orlando was like, why did we pay $140,000 for this large asparagus?
[3:03:34.180 --> 3:03:38.180]  They didn't know. They didn't know what they were seeing. And we see this daily.
[3:03:38.180 --> 3:03:39.180]  The Washington Monument.
[3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:40.180]  Exactly.
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:46.180]  And he is a how many feet almost that is 555 giant male member.
[3:03:46.180 --> 3:03:47.180]  Absolutely.
[3:03:47.180 --> 3:03:52.180]  And by the way, I had a Russian film crew with me and I had a tour when I was a kid.
[3:03:52.180 --> 3:03:59.180]  I read it in history books that the Texas Capitol has the goddess on top of it and is a temple dedicated to her and was dedicated.
[3:03:59.180 --> 3:04:02.180]  The Russian TV crew didn't believe it. When we got there, they happened to put a display up.
[3:04:02.180 --> 3:04:06.180]  I don't know if it's still there, but last year saying, yes, this is the goddess.
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:09.180]  This is her temple and they got the state police to admit it on tape.
[3:04:09.180 --> 3:04:10.180]  Awesome.
[3:04:10.180 --> 3:04:14.180]  Now, that's the same thing when we're looking at the clock tower, where of course,
[3:04:14.180 --> 3:04:22.180]  Mind Control agent Charles Whitman shot everybody from the UT tower, which also has owl-like features,
[3:04:22.180 --> 3:04:28.180]  but is of course in due relation to the Capitol dome, which is your male female again, the hermaphroditic symbols.
[3:04:28.180 --> 3:04:33.180]  And in between, you've got George Washington and the goddess Columbia with her symbols elucifer.
[3:04:33.180 --> 3:04:37.180]  So you've got your hermaphroditic symbols right there, just as the capital of DC.
[3:04:37.180 --> 3:04:41.180]  Stay there. Stay there. These people run everything. They want to kill you and your family.
[3:04:41.180 --> 3:04:45.180]  We'll come back and talk about it.
[3:04:45.180 --> 3:04:53.180]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do.
[3:04:53.180 --> 3:04:54.180]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:04:54.180 --> 3:05:01.180]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:05:01.180 --> 3:05:10.180]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:05:10.180 --> 3:05:17.180]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:05:17.180 --> 3:05:20.180]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:05:20.180 --> 3:05:26.180]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:05:26.180 --> 3:05:33.180]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv

[3:05:38.180 --> 3:05:44.180]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:05:47.180 --> 3:05:55.180]  Once America was led by real politicians, now politicians in the U.S., City, County, State and Federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:05:55.180 --> 3:05:58.180]  They have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[3:05:58.180 --> 3:06:02.180]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[3:06:02.180 --> 3:06:05.180]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:06:05.180 --> 3:06:08.180]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:06:08.180 --> 3:06:13.180]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[3:06:13.180 --> 3:06:17.180]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.

[3:07:15.180 --> 3:07:18.180]  First John states, the Antichrist is already in the world.
[3:07:18.180 --> 3:07:23.180]  What is the truth? And what is a lie? Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:07:23.180 --> 3:07:25.180]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.
[3:07:25.180 --> 3:07:32.180]  For free books, DVDs, and Bible studies, exposing the Antichrist, the Beast, and its mark right to the Bible says,

[3:07:49.180 --> 3:07:54.180]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[3:07:54.180 --> 3:07:57.180]  You want answers? Well so does he.
[3:07:57.180 --> 3:08:02.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:02.180 --> 3:08:07.180]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:15.180]  Freeman is our guest. FreemanTV.com is the website.
[3:08:15.180 --> 3:08:18.180]  Also, the premium perspective.blotspot.com.
[3:08:18.180 --> 3:08:23.180]  Our website is yourprisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[3:08:23.180 --> 3:08:27.180]  Continuing with the rest of the hour, I want to have you back soon.
[3:08:27.180 --> 3:08:32.180]  Freeman, I want to get more into their mindset again, more of how they're conducting these rituals in front of us.
[3:08:32.180 --> 3:08:35.180]  I know you're wanting to show people how this is all out in front of them,
[3:08:35.180 --> 3:08:38.180]  but from studying the Great White Brotherhood and the rest of it,
[3:08:38.180 --> 3:08:43.180]  let's get into what their penultimate higher counsels from your study, who's in them,
[3:08:43.180 --> 3:08:47.180]  what their main plan is, and how things are going for them.
[3:08:47.180 --> 3:08:52.180]  Well, the best thing that we can do is discern their motives by their actions and...
[3:08:52.180 --> 3:08:53.180] ...motherfridge.
[3:08:53.180 --> 3:08:58.180]  Exactly. And really, what I see is one is a timeline.
[3:08:58.180 --> 3:09:02.180]  Of course, they had 9-1-1 scheduled forever,
[3:09:02.180 --> 3:09:08.180]  being that the Pentagon and the Twin Towers were masonically dedicated on 9-1-1.
[3:09:08.180 --> 3:09:15.180]  So we see that they are forming a timeline that this has most likely been thought about since the creation of America.
[3:09:15.180 --> 3:09:20.180]  And what we see are the programming of our children.
[3:09:20.180 --> 3:09:28.180]  And so they use pop icons like Madonna and Brittany and Christina Aguilera as these high-profile ritual goddesses.
[3:09:28.180 --> 3:09:31.180]  Now, where do they come from? How did this end up to be?
[3:09:31.180 --> 3:09:39.180]  Now, by the way, years ago, you and Tex and others were saying they were conducting rituals in the concerts.
[3:09:39.180 --> 3:09:44.180]  Now, the last two years, they've said, yeah, it's all Kabbalistic ritual, black magic, Hal Hitler, basically.
[3:09:44.180 --> 3:09:51.180]  Absolutely. I mean, when Rick Perry came back from Istanbul at the Bilderberg meeting, what did he do when he got back here?
[3:09:51.180 --> 3:09:55.180]  He went to a secret Prince concert that no one was allowed to, right?
[3:09:55.180 --> 3:09:59.180]  Curious. You know, these are the type of things that I like to catch upon.
[3:09:59.180 --> 3:10:08.180]  And so as I'm looking into this picture and I find out that, of course, all of these stars that we're looking at with Brittany, Christina Aguilera, Lindsay Lohan, Hanna Montana,
[3:10:08.180 --> 3:10:12.180]  these are all Mouseketeers. They're all straight from Walt Disney World.
[3:10:12.180 --> 3:10:18.180]  So as we start to look at this picture, we realize that Walt Disney was a high-level Freemason that was hired by J. Edgar Hoover,
[3:10:18.180 --> 3:10:25.180]  who was a 33rd degree Freemason. I was at the Temple of the 33rd and played with J. Edgar Hoover's gold-plated phone,
[3:10:25.180 --> 3:10:33.180]  that they hired Walt Disney as a Mason to instill mind-pattern programming into us and into the children.
[3:10:33.180 --> 3:10:37.180]  And so as we see all of his different movies that bring about different ideas...
[3:10:37.180 --> 3:10:42.180]  And now they've been caught. They put fallacies, all this little mermaid...
[3:10:42.180 --> 3:10:47.180]  Absolutely. So let's have a look at Walt Disney World. What is this? What are we looking at?
[3:10:47.180 --> 3:10:52.180]  What we find is that every ride in Walt Disney World is, of course, sponsored by a military industrial corporation,
[3:10:52.180 --> 3:10:56.180]  which will be holding a Masonic symbol as their seal.
[3:10:56.180 --> 3:11:02.180]  And they have the future cities and how you're going to live and everybody's going to have an RFID bracelet and be thumbprinted to get in.
[3:11:02.180 --> 3:11:05.180]  All an indoctrination center. All a temple.
[3:11:05.180 --> 3:11:11.180]  Yes, exactly. You get into Space Mountain and you come off of RCA, RCA's Space Mountain,
[3:11:11.180 --> 3:11:16.180]  and then they use predictive programming to tell you what your future will hold.
[3:11:16.180 --> 3:11:20.180]  And so they're telling us constantly what our future will be.
[3:11:20.180 --> 3:11:25.180]  And now you go through a roller coaster like Space Mountain and you get somewhat traumatized,
[3:11:25.180 --> 3:11:30.180]  and then they use this to program you. They do the same thing in films and all of Hollywood.
[3:11:30.180 --> 3:11:37.180]  Hey, the Georgia Guidestones are surrounded by Hollywood. That seal of Solomon I was talking about in Nashville is surrounded by Hollywood,
[3:11:37.180 --> 3:11:42.180]  the Holly Plants, and these are their symbols of death and resurrection from the druidic past.
[3:11:42.180 --> 3:11:47.180]  So we will find that the blockbusters, of course, are the free masons.
[3:11:47.180 --> 3:11:51.180]  Or the masons, you know, they break the blocks.
[3:11:51.180 --> 3:11:53.180]  And Hollywood's what they make the little wands out of.
[3:11:53.180 --> 3:11:55.180]  Exactly. And so...
[3:11:55.180 --> 3:12:01.180]  And they use Harry Potter to indoctrinate everybody. All of this just boiling everyone, rendering them down
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:04.180]  in this huge occult language now being revealed.
[3:12:04.180 --> 3:12:07.180]  Why do they believe it has to be revealed now?
[3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:13.180]  Well, I think they want us all on their page. I really am not sure,
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:19.180]  but they definitely have been gathering more and more people into this mindset as they open the Kabbalah to the public.
[3:12:19.180 --> 3:12:25.180]  They keep saying Kabbalah. I mean, obviously, the Jews, the Israelites, wrote a lot of stuff down.
[3:12:25.180 --> 3:12:29.180]  So they picked up stuff out of Egypt and then Solomon brought it in.
[3:12:29.180 --> 3:12:32.180]  They also went into captivity in Babylon and amalgamation there.
[3:12:32.180 --> 3:12:38.180]  And I understand the modern rites all go back to Solomon, but I just want to be clear, it goes back to Egypt.
[3:12:38.180 --> 3:12:42.180]  Absolutely, absolutely. There is a reason there's pyramid on our dollar bill.
[3:12:42.180 --> 3:12:48.180]  So absolutely, yes. The whole Y2K ceremony was a celebration of Horus.
[3:12:48.180 --> 3:12:50.180]  Oh my gosh, I watched that on TV.
[3:12:50.180 --> 3:12:56.180]  Giant fire shooting out of the pyramids, huge movie projectors of demons hopping around.
[3:12:56.180 --> 3:13:03.180]  And they cut to London and Paris and they were, we worship you anti-beast. Who is this anti-beast?
[3:13:03.180 --> 3:13:05.180]  I hadn't heard of that.
[3:13:05.180 --> 3:13:09.180]  Well, you know, in London, they burnt the River Thames to the speed of the sun.
[3:13:09.180 --> 3:13:13.180]  This was their river sticks, you know, and then when we got to America.
[3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:16.180]  I mean, they're just doing wild giant rituals in front of everyone.
[3:13:16.180 --> 3:13:18.180]  In front of everyone.
[3:13:18.180 --> 3:13:26.180]  And they're girding their police in these Darth Vader outfits, which Lucas will tell you that's an archetypal executioner or torturer.
[3:13:26.180 --> 3:13:31.180]  That's why, and then now police chiefs admit it's to intimidate you. These are the forces of death.
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:36.180]  Yes. And that's what they're inculcating is this police state of mind.
[3:13:36.180 --> 3:13:40.180]  And everybody's going, oh, I better not say anything. I better not get out of line.
[3:13:40.180 --> 3:13:43.180]  And this is exactly what they actually win.
[3:13:43.180 --> 3:13:49.180]  Exactly. This is exactly what they want from you is for you to go back and hide and cower.
[3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:54.180]  And, you know, this is where the rainbow kind of stands out where they don't cower.
[3:13:54.180 --> 3:13:56.180]  They all come out there every year.
[3:13:56.180 --> 3:14:02.180]  I don't know how many of those people realize that they're stepping into being quote unquote terrorists by going out there.
[3:14:02.180 --> 3:14:06.180]  But when you go out there, you're taking your life at risk. You really are.
[3:14:06.180 --> 3:14:12.180]  And your fear is not of anybody but the police and these jackbooted thugs.
[3:14:12.180 --> 3:14:16.180]  You know, they're going to torment you and traumatize you the whole way.
[3:14:16.180 --> 3:14:21.180]  Now, I have suffered what seemed to be barium poisoning at the gathering.
[3:14:21.180 --> 3:14:25.180]  And many of us, a lot of us in 1996 got ill, very ill.
[3:14:25.180 --> 3:14:29.180]  And once I ended up in the hospital, I had many tests done.
[3:14:29.180 --> 3:14:32.180]  Of course, getting a barium test is too expensive.
[3:14:32.180 --> 3:14:37.180]  But what you'll find is that we openly discussed giving barium to the Al Qaeda.
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:40.180]  It was open news that they were feeding barium.
[3:14:40.180 --> 3:14:47.180]  Now, why barium? Because it is a radioactive isotope that they can use the X-band radar to determine where you are.
[3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:50.180]  Well, actually, the Stasi did that.
[3:14:50.180 --> 3:14:54.180]  That came out in the news that they used that to track dissidents in East Germany.
[3:14:54.180 --> 3:15:02.180]  Yes, exactly. And so they fed us all barium as far as I can decipher from my symptoms and from ending up in the hospital.
[3:15:02.180 --> 3:15:06.180]  I had every symptom of barium poisoning and so did everyone else.
[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:09.180]  That was at the Missouri Gathering in 1996.
[3:15:09.180 --> 3:15:13.180]  Well, they give it to their own priest of death.
[3:15:13.180 --> 3:15:16.180]  They all give them the DU and the shots.
[3:15:16.180 --> 3:15:20.180]  Again, don't just think you're in a black uniform and that you're going to get away with me.
[3:15:20.180 --> 3:15:23.180]  You get death, too. They believe in being fair, don't they?
[3:15:23.180 --> 3:15:27.180]  Absolutely. They don't want their jack-o'-lantern thugs coming to get them.
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:30.180]  They need to get these men under control as well.
[3:15:30.180 --> 3:15:34.180]  So absolutely, everybody's going to suffer if this goes through.
[3:15:34.180 --> 3:15:36.180]  You're going to suffer real bad.
[3:15:36.180 --> 3:15:40.180]  Continue with what they want to turn the world into.
[3:15:40.180 --> 3:15:43.180]  Answer that question again. Who is the ruling counsel from your study?
[3:15:43.180 --> 3:15:45.180]  How many people are really in the inter-counsel?
[3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:49.180]  Give us that pyramid power structure from your decades of research, Freeman.
[3:15:49.180 --> 3:15:55.180]  Well, my studies have taken this story off-planet, so I don't know if you're ready to go there.
[3:15:55.180 --> 3:15:58.180]  Let's just get to what they believe, and I understand they believe that, too.
[3:15:58.180 --> 3:16:04.180]  For me, just in a secular, mechanical way, I already know much of what you're saying.
[3:16:04.180 --> 3:16:07.180]  Your perspective, and the reason I'm saying that is, I know what he's saying is accurate,
[3:16:07.180 --> 3:16:09.180]  and he knows a lot. That's what we have for Freeman here.
[3:16:09.180 --> 3:16:16.180]  But I just want to get the basics of the power structure we can prove
[3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:18.180]  and the things that we know they're doing.
[3:16:18.180 --> 3:16:23.180]  We have seen this tri-city-state control with the Vatican, with the City of London,
[3:16:23.180 --> 3:16:26.180]  and with the District of Columbia, all of which have no nation.
[3:16:26.180 --> 3:16:28.180]  We see that this power...
[3:16:28.180 --> 3:16:31.180]  That's right, private. That's a key you just brought up.
[3:16:31.180 --> 3:16:37.180]  Explain that. You've got these three corporate blocks, these three squares, again,
[3:16:37.180 --> 3:16:43.180]  and they dominate the planet. These are the kind of base, like if you're playing a game of tag.
[3:16:43.180 --> 3:16:45.180]  And Israel is now kind of a base, too.
[3:16:45.180 --> 3:16:49.180]  But there's three main ones where they can jump from square to square,
[3:16:49.180 --> 3:16:54.180]  and that are sovereign corporate entities. Talk about that.
[3:16:54.180 --> 3:16:57.180]  Absolutely. Well, the Vatican, of course, is the religious arm.
[3:16:57.180 --> 3:17:03.180]  The City of London is the economics, and we're the military arm of this major globalization.
[3:17:03.180 --> 3:17:07.180]  This is something that has been in power that long.
[3:17:07.180 --> 3:17:13.180]  These guys have been working towards this top production all this time.
[3:17:13.180 --> 3:17:19.180]  Well, when we look at the Georgia Guidestones, we see that the eugenics program is one of their main things.
[3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:25.180]  What I see them doing, first of all, is, of course, they're the ones that came up with the nuclear missiles.
[3:17:25.180 --> 3:17:27.180]  They're the ones that were destroying matter.
[3:17:27.180 --> 3:17:33.180]  Now we have CERN and the grid that are trying to recreate matter and try to bust through to the other dimension.
[3:17:33.180 --> 3:17:40.180]  So as we look into these, they've been trying and trying to get to this technological advanced state.
[3:17:40.180 --> 3:17:41.180]  They want to be gods.
[3:17:41.180 --> 3:17:45.180]  Yes. And then once they've achieved this, using all of us as their slave labor,
[3:17:45.180 --> 3:17:49.180]  then they intend to kill us all off. And that's where we're at today.
[3:17:49.180 --> 3:17:51.180]  And that's stated in all their documents.
[3:17:51.180 --> 3:17:58.180]  And so we watch as they are doing this occult practice, which is science to us today, of course,
[3:17:58.180 --> 3:18:04.180]  where they are first destroying matter, then creating matter and trying to open a portal to the other side.
[3:18:04.180 --> 3:18:07.180]  And that goes back to all the highest level Egyptian rituals.
[3:18:07.180 --> 3:18:09.180]  Absolutely. Death and rebirth.
[3:18:09.180 --> 3:18:13.180]  Exactly. Those pyramids are frequency modulation devices.
[3:18:13.180 --> 3:18:17.180]  Just as we see on many of these structures, like the one I was talking about in Nashville,
[3:18:17.180 --> 3:18:21.180]  these are frequency modulation devices. Harp is a frequency modulation.
[3:18:21.180 --> 3:18:25.180]  And everything being frequency, that's what these people are after.
[3:18:25.180 --> 3:18:26.180]  But they needed all of us.
[3:18:26.180 --> 3:18:32.180]  They had to create an America in order to bring about the technological advancements necessary for their occult agenda.
[3:18:32.180 --> 3:18:38.180]  So the first thing you'll notice is that they were going to get these things out of the way.
[3:18:38.180 --> 3:18:40.180]  They were going to destroy matter with the atomic bomb.
[3:18:40.180 --> 3:18:42.180]  They were going to create matter with CERN.
[3:18:42.180 --> 3:18:47.180]  And now they have achieved their goals. And of course CERN's logo is 666.
[3:18:47.180 --> 3:18:51.180]  If you look at it with a hyper-dimensional portal combined in there.
[3:18:51.180 --> 3:18:54.180]  Yeah, it's really just totally wicked.
[3:18:54.180 --> 3:18:56.180]  It looks like an old black magic seal.
[3:18:56.180 --> 3:19:02.180]  And what stands out in front is Shiva got a destruction along with the skull and bones on its head.
[3:19:02.180 --> 3:19:04.180]  Oh yeah, these are nice people.
[3:19:04.180 --> 3:19:11.180]  So we're looking at this picture that we don't fully understand because, well, we've been kept out of the loop.
[3:19:11.180 --> 3:19:14.180]  But as you said, most of the Masons are low level.
[3:19:14.180 --> 3:19:17.180]  They don't know most of the occultists. They've got all the fake little subsidiaries.
[3:19:17.180 --> 3:19:22.180]  I want to talk about the penultimate top of the pyramid in the power structure.
[3:19:22.180 --> 3:19:27.180]  I know they believe there's gods and angels up the rest of the circle.
[3:19:27.180 --> 3:19:32.180]  But I want the human element of what we can prove what these lunatics believe.
[3:19:32.180 --> 3:19:38.180]  Then we'll talk about their master plan and then more about their symbolism and where you see all this going with Freeman.
[3:19:38.180 --> 3:19:45.180]  Let's open the phones at the last 20 minutes or so for questions specifically to him on the occult 1-800-259-9231.
[3:19:45.180 --> 3:19:49.180]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, July 16, 2008.
[3:19:49.180 --> 3:19:51.180]  Gold opened at 9.7970.
[3:19:51.180 --> 3:19:58.180]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $1,007.45, 4.9605 for half ounce and 2.4803 for quarter ounce.
[3:19:58.180 --> 3:20:03.180]  That's 1,745, 4.9605 and 2.4803.
[3:20:03.180 --> 3:20:09.180]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S. hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[3:20:09.180 --> 3:20:13.180]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[3:20:13.180 --> 3:20:20.180]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike,
[3:20:20.180 --> 3:20:23.180]  hammering the U.S. housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[3:20:23.180 --> 3:20:27.180]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[3:20:27.180 --> 3:20:33.180]  Economist Ambrose Evans Prichard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[3:20:33.180 --> 3:20:36.180]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[3:20:36.180 --> 3:20:39.180]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[3:20:39.180 --> 3:20:45.180]  Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[3:20:45.180 --> 3:20:49.180]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:20:49.180 --> 3:20:54.180]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:20:54.180 --> 3:20:57.180]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[3:20:57.180 --> 3:21:00.180]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:21:00.180 --> 3:21:03.180]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:21:03.180 --> 3:21:13.180]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:13.180 --> 3:21:19.180]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:21:19.180 --> 3:21:23.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:21:23.180 --> 3:21:26.180]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[3:21:26.180 --> 3:21:29.180]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[3:21:29.180 --> 3:21:54.180]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[3:21:54.180 --> 3:21:59.180]  Because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:21:59.180 --> 3:22:10.180]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:22:10.180 --> 3:22:16.180]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[3:22:16.180 --> 3:22:22.180]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[3:22:22.180 --> 3:22:29.180]  What about you? Order your KDF Shower Filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:23:43.180 --> 3:23:50.180]  All right, from your study, from their own documents.
[3:23:50.180 --> 3:23:54.180]  What is the master plan? Are they on schedule?
[3:23:54.180 --> 3:24:03.180]  Well, the question comes, what is the point of ceremony? What is the point of these initiation rituals?
[3:24:03.180 --> 3:24:13.180]  Why do they do all of this? That's when we start to get into understanding of where they're going.
[3:24:13.180 --> 3:24:23.180]  Now, I had just performed a ritual at the Mayans for the winter solstice. I was down there to document that at Tikal.
[3:24:23.180 --> 3:24:28.180]  And then, during that whole time, I'm questioning, what is the point? Why?
[3:24:28.180 --> 3:24:37.180]  And I have the same questions with the Freemasons and the Illuminati as they do all of these initiation rituals.
[3:24:37.180 --> 3:24:40.180]  And as I say, my father didn't even know what they meant.
[3:24:40.180 --> 3:24:44.180]  Well, we know a lot of what they mean, though, because it's all symbolized.
[3:24:44.180 --> 3:24:49.180]  But really, it's to carry on the brotherhood they need the ritual to keep it bound together.
[3:24:49.180 --> 3:24:56.180]  I mean, what in their tradition they're supposed to carry out is the whole point, like you said, the fruits.
[3:24:56.180 --> 3:24:59.180]  Yes. And we're looking at their fruits, and they're awful.
[3:24:59.180 --> 3:25:05.180]  We live in a corporatized fascist state, and I feel that this was the ultimate goal.
[3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:12.180]  As they were building up this, everyone acts like America was set up as the city paved with gold.
[3:25:12.180 --> 3:25:20.180]  But when we start to look into the picture, you start to see that all the heads of the top corporations are all freemasonic.
[3:25:20.180 --> 3:25:26.180]  You find that I went to a lodge in Lawrence, Kansas, and they're all telling me,
[3:25:26.180 --> 3:25:29.180]  well, you know, if you join the Freemasons, you won't get killed.
[3:25:29.180 --> 3:25:33.180]  I've been spared. My life has been spared on numerous occasions.
[3:25:33.180 --> 3:25:39.180]  When we look into the Revolutionary War, and 95% of the generals on both sides, British and American,
[3:25:39.180 --> 3:25:42.180]  were Freemasons, warned not to hurt one another.
[3:25:42.180 --> 3:25:46.180]  So we've got these men that are doing these initiatic rituals.
[3:25:46.180 --> 3:25:51.180]  They're bringing themselves up, and of course, they're the ones that get shot into space.
[3:25:51.180 --> 3:25:55.180]  They're the ones that become the military intelligence.
[3:25:55.180 --> 3:25:58.180]  They're the ones that are chasing flying saucers, like my father.
[3:25:58.180 --> 3:26:05.180]  They're the ones that dedicated our space shuttles as the Columbia endeavor for the discovery of Atlantis.
[3:26:05.180 --> 3:26:12.180]  So I have constantly seen these men moving forward in this progression of technological advancement,
[3:26:12.180 --> 3:26:16.180]  getting off of the planet. They discuss this utopia.
[3:26:16.180 --> 3:26:20.180]  They've got their books like Sir Francis Bacon's New Atlantis,
[3:26:20.180 --> 3:26:31.180]  or The Secret Destiny of America by Manly P. Hall, that outline their goals to build this utopia of theirs.
[3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:34.180]  Really, it's the ultimate selfishness, because they go into the future.
[3:26:34.180 --> 3:26:37.180]  They get to know all the secrets and have the cool lives, and then they say,
[3:26:37.180 --> 3:26:41.180]  well, you're profane. You didn't care about it, so you deserve to be a slave.
[3:26:41.180 --> 3:26:45.180]  But they do everything they can to dumb us down. They're just the ultimate criminals.
[3:26:45.180 --> 3:26:48.180]  Exactly, and they are damn proud of it.
[3:26:48.180 --> 3:26:50.180]  You will know the mother fruits.
[3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:53.180]  Yes, and that was always Lucifer's fall. Was it not the pride?
[3:26:53.180 --> 3:26:59.180]  Quite honestly, Merica, the star of the Templars, is Lucifer once again, Venus.
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:02.180]  Merica, and that's where our capital name comes from.
[3:27:02.180 --> 3:27:04.180]  America!
[3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:08.180]  So you've got to start to look at this picture different.
[3:27:08.180 --> 3:27:15.180]  I was able to predict WB and railroad in the office because of the Kabbalistic connections to 66.
[3:27:15.180 --> 3:27:20.180]  I was able to predict the 9-1-1 events, because I knew that these guys were ceremonial bastards,
[3:27:20.180 --> 3:27:22.180]  and that they needed to stick to their dates.
[3:27:22.180 --> 3:27:27.180]  Yeah, go over some of the open ceremonies with 9-11, the two pillars, all of it.
[3:27:27.180 --> 3:27:33.180]  Yeah, well, we're looking at... Now, I did talk with the Kabbalist magician that designed the Twin Towers,
[3:27:33.180 --> 3:27:40.180]  and he said that they were designed in honor of the Rockefeller brothers, and that's why one tower stands six foot higher than the other.
[3:27:40.180 --> 3:27:45.180]  Now, he also told me that it was the Bin Laden Construction Company that built the Twin Towers,
[3:27:45.180 --> 3:27:48.180]  and that they had asked them where to put the demolition charges.
[3:27:48.180 --> 3:27:51.180]  And of course, you can see all of this on Freeman TV.
[3:27:51.180 --> 3:27:57.180]  We are looking at this Twin Towers symbolism, which is a symbol of the Hegelian dialectic.
[3:27:57.180 --> 3:28:00.180]  It's there always been their power. That's always been their way.
[3:28:00.180 --> 3:28:05.180]  And where this comes from is the ancient story of Salon that goes back to Egypt,
[3:28:05.180 --> 3:28:10.180]  and he has brought to the Subterranean Chambers, which they now have announced are real,
[3:28:10.180 --> 3:28:15.180]  and shown on Fox News, the Subterranean realms under Giza Plateau.
[3:28:15.180 --> 3:28:21.180]  And he found these twin columns, or he was shown these twin columns, which the Freemasons called Jack and Imboas.
[3:28:21.180 --> 3:28:27.180]  And on it was given the concepts of how to rule civilization, and this is what they follow.
[3:28:27.180 --> 3:28:30.180]  I mean, it was agriculture, mathematics, politics.
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:32.180]  Absolutely.
[3:28:32.180 --> 3:28:37.180]  So they understand these dueling powers, and they will create the good side and the bad side.
[3:28:37.180 --> 3:28:43.180]  And that's what we need to recognize, is that we may want to rally behind these good forces,
[3:28:43.180 --> 3:28:48.180]  but it's mind pattern programming that is coming to an agenda.
[3:28:48.180 --> 3:28:51.180]  And so we must recognize that they are fulfilling both roles.
[3:28:51.180 --> 3:28:57.180]  This was explained in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, all about the Masons running both sides.
[3:28:57.180 --> 3:29:02.180]  Of course, V for Vendetta, another scary film that they put out, which is...
[3:29:02.180 --> 3:29:07.180]  Well, they openly tell you, we release the bio weapons, we stage the terror attacks, and we're taking your rights away.
[3:29:07.180 --> 3:29:11.180]  Exactly. And they get everybody to dress up as the fall guy, Guy Fox,
[3:29:11.180 --> 3:29:15.180]  when actually it's this Percy bloodline that blew up the, or tried to blow up parliament.
[3:29:15.180 --> 3:29:22.180]  Now, as we come down this structure, and we get to, the Percy's, of course, had to change their name to Pierce to hide their shame.
[3:29:22.180 --> 3:29:28.180]  And we get to Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of America, who is a direct descendant of the guy who tried to blow up King James.
[3:29:28.180 --> 3:29:32.180]  Well, then Franklin Pierce is replaced by James Buchanan, who has...
[3:29:32.180 --> 3:29:35.180]  Stay there. Stay there. We'll come back.
[3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:39.180]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.180 --> 3:29:45.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:48.180 --> 3:29:51.180]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[3:29:51.180 --> 3:29:56.180]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.

[3:30:45.180 --> 3:30:50.180]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[3:30:50.180 --> 3:30:52.180]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:30:52.180 --> 3:30:55.180]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:30:55.180 --> 3:30:58.180]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:30:58.180 --> 3:31:02.180]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF,
[3:31:02.180 --> 3:31:05.180]  and we sit on the shadow.
[3:31:05.180 --> 3:31:11.180]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:31:11.180 --> 3:31:17.180]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:31:17.180 --> 3:31:22.180]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:31:22.180 --> 3:31:28.180]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:31:28.180 --> 3:31:32.180]  What the hell is breaking news on 6th Avenue?
[3:31:32.180 --> 3:31:36.180]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:31:36.180 --> 3:31:42.180]  Truth Rise. Download the film at PrismPlanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:31:42.180 --> 3:32:11.180]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:32:16.180 --> 3:32:22.180]  I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[3:32:22.180 --> 3:32:28.180]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have it delivered to your door.
[3:32:28.180 --> 3:32:32.180]  Let me tell you how. Go to efoodsdirect.com right now.
[3:32:32.180 --> 3:32:43.180]  efoodsdirect.com or call the toll free number 800-409-5633.
[3:32:43.180 --> 3:33:06.180]  I got those food costs now.
[3:33:06.180 --> 3:33:11.180]  We'll be right back with Freeman here in just a few minutes.
[3:33:11.180 --> 3:33:20.180]  Maybe you can IM me the callers too, John. We'll be taking some calls for our guests here later in this segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[3:33:20.180 --> 3:33:28.180]  Before we go back to our guests, efoodsdirect is the longest-continuing operating storeable foods company in the nation.
[3:33:28.180 --> 3:33:33.180]  And with headlines on prismplanet.com about gas lines this fall.
[3:33:33.180 --> 3:33:36.180]  Mainstream news.
[3:33:36.180 --> 3:33:43.180]  World War 3 and the rest of it are discussing. I think it's smart even if we've got a 10% chance bad stuff is going to happen.
[3:33:43.180 --> 3:33:45.180]  I think it's a little bit higher than that.
[3:33:45.180 --> 3:33:48.180]  They get some high-quality, clean, non-GMO food.
[3:33:48.180 --> 3:33:53.180]  Big fat links on the top of infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[3:33:53.180 --> 3:33:58.180]  The toll free number. They can also give you a free brochure, a free audio CD about what they do.
[3:33:58.180 --> 3:34:01.180]  Longest-continuing operating company in the U.S. Storeable Foods.
[3:34:01.180 --> 3:34:06.180]  That's where I've gotten my storeable foods four times now. I've been stockpiling them up, giving them to family.
[3:34:06.180 --> 3:34:11.180]  1-800-409-5633. 1-800-409-5633.
[3:34:11.180 --> 3:34:18.180]  You think it's dangerous to...
[3:34:18.180 --> 3:34:26.180]  You think it's dangerous to have runs on the banks out there.
[3:34:26.180 --> 3:34:29.180]  You think that that is bad.
[3:34:29.180 --> 3:34:35.180]  Well, food can be an even bigger problem and they use food as a weapon as they say on their own U.N. documents.
[3:34:35.180 --> 3:34:38.180]  So again, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:34:38.180 --> 3:34:44.180]  Also, folks, we have another fabulous sponsor and that is the folks at Interfood.
[3:34:44.180 --> 3:34:49.180]  They're patriots. This company was founded by one of George Humphrey's friends right here in Austin, Texas, but around for a long time.
[3:34:49.180 --> 3:34:52.180]  They're known for their main product, Interfood.
[3:34:52.180 --> 3:34:56.180]  They have a big line of other great products, healthy coffees, healthy cocos.
[3:34:56.180 --> 3:34:59.180]  Infused with all these great rainforests, super nutrients.
[3:34:59.180 --> 3:35:05.180]  And the foods you're eating have been debased of value with the farming methods.
[3:35:05.180 --> 3:35:07.180]  You know that. It's an admitted fact.
[3:35:07.180 --> 3:35:12.180]  Well, these are foods raised organically that have been fed on super nutrients.
[3:35:12.180 --> 3:35:22.180]  And then when you get to the fact that they don't pasteurize it, 20 different super foods, you get full absorption, other nutrients, the trace elements,
[3:35:22.180 --> 3:35:27.180]  dulse kelp, barley grass, wheatgrass, spirulina, spirulina, and 14 other power-packed ingredients.
[3:35:27.180 --> 3:35:29.180]  Interfood.com.

[3:35:46.180 --> 3:35:48.180]  1-866-7629238.
[3:35:48.180 --> 3:35:50.180]  This really is a great product.
[3:35:50.180 --> 3:35:53.180]  It's so important with all the things we're being bombarded with to be healthy.
[3:35:53.180 --> 3:35:54.180]  I believe in this.
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:55.180]  Give them a call.
[3:35:55.180 --> 3:35:56.180]  I trust this product.
[3:35:56.180 --> 3:35:57.180]  I think it's great.
[3:35:57.180 --> 3:36:00.180]  866-7629238.
[3:36:00.180 --> 3:36:06.180]  And in closing, I have done three and a half hours of the radio show and haven't really plugged the films.
[3:36:06.180 --> 3:36:09.180]  I mean, in passing, I've said you need to get the films.
[3:36:09.180 --> 3:36:13.180]  If you don't have a prisonplanet.tv membership, you need one.
[3:36:13.180 --> 3:36:20.180]  They are 15 cents a day or even less if you get a year membership, but a month membership is $5.95.
[3:36:20.180 --> 3:36:26.180]  We've not raised prices on that since we started the website four years and three months ago.
[3:36:26.180 --> 3:36:31.180]  There's thousands of pieces of media, all 19 of my films in ultra high quality.
[3:36:31.180 --> 3:36:33.180]  I mean, it's almost as good as DVD.
[3:36:33.180 --> 3:36:36.180]  And the number one reason to be a member is then burn them to disc.
[3:36:36.180 --> 3:36:37.180]  There's instructions.
[3:36:37.180 --> 3:36:40.180]  It's totally easy.
[3:36:40.180 --> 3:36:43.180]  I'm not net savvy and it's easy for me to burn discs.
[3:36:43.180 --> 3:36:46.180]  You can burn them on DivX, which a lot of new players have.
[3:36:46.180 --> 3:36:51.180]  So it's really high quality or you can crunch it down and put it on normal CDs or discs with some of the other systems.
[3:36:51.180 --> 3:36:53.180]  But I don't want you to think there's a bunch of work.
[3:36:53.180 --> 3:36:56.180]  It's just, it is wonderful work.
[3:36:56.180 --> 3:37:02.180]  I mean, get in there, burn copies or get a prisonplanet.tv membership and you can plug right into your big screen TV.
[3:37:02.180 --> 3:37:06.180]  I mean, it'll look good on a big screen and have friends over to watch it online tonight.
[3:37:06.180 --> 3:37:07.180]  I don't care if it's two people.
[3:37:07.180 --> 3:37:12.180]  This is how we're going to do it is believing we can win, believing we can show people first they're being lied to.
[3:37:12.180 --> 3:37:15.180]  There's a real world out there versus what they're being taught.
[3:37:15.180 --> 3:37:25.180]  Let me tell you, this Illuminati world is a lot more real than the world of what, you know, these, these, these Hollywood people are doing or these distractions and these diversions.
[3:37:25.180 --> 3:37:30.180]  So go to prisonplanet.tv, get a membership today or this is important.
[3:37:30.180 --> 3:37:38.180]  Get the hard DVD, the super eye quality, 1995, get a second copy, 9.95 of my new film, Truth Rising, about 9.11.
[3:37:38.180 --> 3:37:43.180]  The first responders, the truth movement, how we're being demonized, the police trying to plant bombs on us.
[3:37:43.180 --> 3:37:46.180]  I mean, this is an incredible adventure film and it's real.
[3:37:46.180 --> 3:37:49.180]  Get the DVD, make as many copies as you can.
[3:37:49.180 --> 3:37:51.180]  Go out and buy a DVD duplicator.
[3:37:51.180 --> 3:37:52.180]  They're cheap.
[3:37:52.180 --> 3:37:54.180]  Start making them, get them out and know you're having an effect.
[3:37:54.180 --> 3:37:55.180]  Look how far we've come.
[3:37:55.180 --> 3:38:01.180]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[3:38:01.180 --> 3:38:05.180]  Now is the time to get in game, to get these films and get them out to people.
[3:38:05.180 --> 3:38:06.180]  Okay.
[3:38:06.180 --> 3:38:07.180]  Going back to Freeman.
[3:38:07.180 --> 3:38:12.180]  Freeman, I'm going to take calls in about 10 minutes, but other areas, other symbolism, other things people should know about.
[3:38:12.180 --> 3:38:14.180]  This is just an introductory interview with you.
[3:38:14.180 --> 3:38:16.180]  We're going to have you back soon and you'll do it.
[3:38:16.180 --> 3:38:23.180]  Whatever you think is most important for people to, to, to, you know, to know and understand and to see around them.
[3:38:23.180 --> 3:38:34.180]  These guys have been encoding things into these structures for, for millennia as we had the Templars building the cathedrals and, and putting in sacred geometry to pass this knowledge down.
[3:38:34.180 --> 3:38:43.180]  We also find that a 33rd degree Freemason put across in the hen day that was coded to show a major catastrophe coming up.
[3:38:43.180 --> 3:38:46.180]  Now, of course, I was saying I was at the Mayan ritual.
[3:38:46.180 --> 3:38:50.180]  They also believe that a major catastrophe is coming and we'll begin next year.
[3:38:50.180 --> 3:38:53.180]  And of course, they've got their end date for 2012.
[3:38:53.180 --> 3:39:02.180]  What we find is that this brotherhood are secretly encoding things into these structures and into different symbols that they put out.
[3:39:02.180 --> 3:39:05.180]  And like I said, I was at the Georgia guide stones.
[3:39:05.180 --> 3:39:08.180]  Now, when you look at the Georgia guide stones, of course, you've gone over this.
[3:39:08.180 --> 3:39:17.180]  They've got the rules of their new civilization on there about limiting the population of 500 million, creating a new world court and a new living language.
[3:39:17.180 --> 3:39:23.180]  And as we start to look into language and the frequency and who created language for us, then that's a whole nother study.
[3:39:23.180 --> 3:39:30.180]  But what I noticed was that this structure, the Georgia guide stones is authored by R.C. Christian.
[3:39:30.180 --> 3:39:34.180]  And it says a pseudonym, which is a misspelling of pseudonym.
[3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:36.180]  And, you know, that's not a mistake.
[3:39:36.180 --> 3:39:37.180]  This is code.
[3:39:37.180 --> 3:39:38.180]  And so when we...
[3:39:38.180 --> 3:39:39.180]  Rose accrucian.
[3:39:39.180 --> 3:39:40.180]  Exactly.
[3:39:40.180 --> 3:39:45.180]  R.C. Christian is code for Christian Rosencruz is the mythical founder of the Rose accrucian order.
[3:39:45.180 --> 3:39:51.180]  And when you start to get deeper and deeper into Freemasonry, you find that their deepest secrets are from these Rose accrucians.
[3:39:51.180 --> 3:39:57.180]  So that is why in Denver, capital, they have the Rosie Cross on their temple there.
[3:39:57.180 --> 3:40:03.180]  So they are encoding these things throughout time that we keep finding in these structures.
[3:40:03.180 --> 3:40:05.180]  And we'll find out what they want.
[3:40:05.180 --> 3:40:11.180]  And that is the death of all of us easily and straight from their own works.
[3:40:11.180 --> 3:40:18.180]  This is something that you can follow back through generation after generation.
[3:40:18.180 --> 3:40:25.180]  There's a reason there's an obelisk in front of the Vatican, an obelisk in front of the city of London, an obelisk in Washington, D.C.
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:29.180]  These symbols of Osiris, of his phallus.
[3:40:29.180 --> 3:40:31.180]  They believe they're sucking in the male energy.
[3:40:31.180 --> 3:40:33.180]  They're like, it's an antenna.
[3:40:33.180 --> 3:40:38.180]  And they throw it in our face in movies like Ghostbusters where they say he was a crazy, eccentric man.
[3:40:38.180 --> 3:40:41.180]  He built the whole building as a spiritual antenna.
[3:40:41.180 --> 3:40:43.180]  Well, that's what they really do.
[3:40:43.180 --> 3:40:46.180]  That's not us getting that from Ghostbusters.
[3:40:46.180 --> 3:40:48.180]  That's what the elites believe.
[3:40:48.180 --> 3:40:49.180]  That is what they believe.
[3:40:49.180 --> 3:40:53.180]  And then you notice when it's Zool, the refrigerator opens up the other dimension.
[3:40:53.180 --> 3:40:59.180]  It's a woman with these big attack dogs guarding her with obelisk in front of a huge pyramid.
[3:40:59.180 --> 3:41:01.180]  And then she's flipping down the pyramid.
[3:41:01.180 --> 3:41:02.180]  Exactly, exactly.
[3:41:02.180 --> 3:41:03.180]  They tell us all the time.
[3:41:03.180 --> 3:41:05.180]  And I believe that that is the key.
[3:41:05.180 --> 3:41:12.180]  I believe that that is the one thing that I've brought out from my studies is this need to usurp our free will.
[3:41:12.180 --> 3:41:16.180]  That we have to give our free will agreement to allow them to do this.
[3:41:16.180 --> 3:41:18.180]  They have to tell us, we're doing this even if it's available.
[3:41:18.180 --> 3:41:21.180]  That's the old, you see this in all the old fables in all the cultures.
[3:41:21.180 --> 3:41:29.180]  The vampire, and they believe you they were real in Greece, had to trick you to let them in.
[3:41:29.180 --> 3:41:31.180]  He had to trick you to give them permission.
[3:41:31.180 --> 3:41:32.180]  It's like contract.
[3:41:32.180 --> 3:41:34.180]  Exactly, exactly.
[3:41:34.180 --> 3:41:36.180]  And that's what I see.
[3:41:36.180 --> 3:41:42.180]  That's what I see as the main focus of what we should be working on is not giving up our free will agreement.
[3:41:42.180 --> 3:41:44.180]  We cannot go into V for Vendetta and cheer.
[3:41:44.180 --> 3:41:50.180]  We can't say because they're going to show you them blowing up buildings and taking down the government.
[3:41:50.180 --> 3:41:56.180]  But if you read V for Vendetta from Alan Moore, who is a Freemason, a capitalist magician,
[3:41:56.180 --> 3:42:00.180]  then you'll see that it's actually the philosophies of Adam Weishaupt,
[3:42:00.180 --> 3:42:03.180]  coupled with the magic of Aleister Crowley.
[3:42:03.180 --> 3:42:08.180]  This is what V for Vendetta's actual storyline is, but Hollywood coded it.
[3:42:08.180 --> 3:42:09.180]  Well, look at the last matrix.
[3:42:09.180 --> 3:42:12.180]  It's all about the Merovingians and all these groups.
[3:42:12.180 --> 3:42:13.180]  It's all Illuminati.
[3:42:13.180 --> 3:42:15.180]  The great architect is Lucifer.
[3:42:15.180 --> 3:42:17.180]  He's saying this has happened over and over again.
[3:42:17.180 --> 3:42:20.180]  Sean Connery was supposed to play that part, by the way.
[3:42:20.180 --> 3:42:22.180]  And then also, I thought the guy they had was better.
[3:42:22.180 --> 3:42:25.180]  But the Colonel Sanders looking guy looked pretty evil.
[3:42:25.180 --> 3:42:27.180]  But then also, Neo becomes Jesus at the end.
[3:42:27.180 --> 3:42:28.180]  Exactly.
[3:42:28.180 --> 3:42:29.180]  And is absorbed with the Illuminati.
[3:42:29.180 --> 3:42:30.180]  They need that.
[3:42:30.180 --> 3:42:32.180]  Again, the two sides.
[3:42:32.180 --> 3:42:33.180]  Exactly.
[3:42:33.180 --> 3:42:34.180]  Exactly.
[3:42:34.180 --> 3:42:35.180]  And they do believe in these powers of us.
[3:42:35.180 --> 3:42:41.180]  I mean, there is a government psychic corporation, Psytech, right here in Austin.
[3:42:41.180 --> 3:42:43.180]  We've got Paul Smith with his remote living.
[3:42:43.180 --> 3:42:45.180]  We've got that stubble bind on.
[3:42:45.180 --> 3:42:46.180]  Yeah, all right.
[3:42:46.180 --> 3:42:48.180]  So they know that we have these powers.
[3:42:48.180 --> 3:42:51.180]  They know that we transmit into the frequencies of reality.
[3:42:51.180 --> 3:42:54.180]  And this is the subtle energies that they manipulate.
[3:42:54.180 --> 3:42:57.180]  This is why they build giant structures like the pyramids
[3:42:57.180 --> 3:43:00.180]  or this seal of Solomon to bind spirits in Nashville.
[3:43:00.180 --> 3:43:05.180]  They understand these subtle frequencies and they have been manipulating this throughout time
[3:43:05.180 --> 3:43:08.180]  while conditioning us to believe what we should believe.
[3:43:08.180 --> 3:43:13.180]  And they have used all of their methods of intelligence and predictive programming
[3:43:13.180 --> 3:43:19.180]  to get us to fall right into line and to follow them down their path of darkness to destruction.
[3:43:19.180 --> 3:43:22.180]  And they also believe there is a major catastrophe coming.
[3:43:22.180 --> 3:43:26.180]  I mean, there is a reason they built a giant seed vault in Norway under a mountain.
[3:43:26.180 --> 3:43:28.180]  Well, that's one of many.
[3:43:28.180 --> 3:43:29.180]  Exactly.
[3:43:29.180 --> 3:43:33.180]  And since the 40s, they admit they've been building giant underground bases.
[3:43:33.180 --> 3:43:36.180]  There's one hooked up out of Crawford, one out at Fort Hood.
[3:43:36.180 --> 3:43:40.180]  It's connected out here underneath the Hilton Hotel that was the SAC command base.
[3:43:40.180 --> 3:43:43.180]  Some people that have been in there and back when it was SAC.
[3:43:43.180 --> 3:43:47.180]  And then there's all these railways and they admit they spent trillions on it.
[3:43:47.180 --> 3:43:48.180]  But they just say, you can't see it.
[3:43:48.180 --> 3:43:49.180]  Shut up.
[3:43:49.180 --> 3:43:51.180]  We'll kill you if you try to come in here.
[3:43:51.180 --> 3:43:52.180]  I mean, they just run it all.
[3:43:52.180 --> 3:43:53.180]  Absolutely.
[3:43:53.180 --> 3:43:54.180]  Meanwhile, they're giving us cancer.
[3:43:54.180 --> 3:43:56.180]  Meanwhile, they're pulling all their scams, hurting us.
[3:43:56.180 --> 3:43:57.180]  And I wanted to stop.
[3:43:57.180 --> 3:43:58.180]  I do too.
[3:43:58.180 --> 3:44:01.180]  And it is within our free will to do so.
[3:44:01.180 --> 3:44:03.180]  Yeah, well, I'm not acquiescing.
[3:44:03.180 --> 3:44:05.180]  I'm not giving myself over to them.
[3:44:05.180 --> 3:44:07.180]  And I tell them they're trespassing on me.
[3:44:07.180 --> 3:44:08.180]  Absolutely.
[3:44:08.180 --> 3:44:09.180]  And that's our goal.
[3:44:09.180 --> 3:44:10.180]  And that's what we must do.
[3:44:10.180 --> 3:44:13.180]  We must stand up and we must start acting like sovereign beings.
[3:44:13.180 --> 3:44:17.180]  We can't sit back and just say, oh, well, somebody's going to make it better for us.
[3:44:17.180 --> 3:44:18.180]  We can't sit back.
[3:44:18.180 --> 3:44:19.180]  I'm getting past all fear.
[3:44:19.180 --> 3:44:22.180]  I mean, I always say I haven't had fear in a long time and I haven't.
[3:44:22.180 --> 3:44:25.180]  But I mean, I'm really just turning loose of everything.
[3:44:25.180 --> 3:44:29.180]  I mean, that means even, you know, just, just, just getting to the point where I'm worried
[3:44:29.180 --> 3:44:33.180]  about nothing but the truth and, and, and just that's it.
[3:44:33.180 --> 3:44:35.180]  I mean, forget the maneuvers.
[3:44:35.180 --> 3:44:36.180]  Go straight at them.
[3:44:36.180 --> 3:44:37.180]  Absolutely.
[3:44:37.180 --> 3:44:38.180]  Like a juggernaut.
[3:44:38.180 --> 3:44:39.180]  Yeah, we can't, we can't falter.
[3:44:39.180 --> 3:44:42.180]  We can't sit back and wait and hope maybe Obama will change things.
[3:44:42.180 --> 3:44:43.180]  No, we can't do this.
[3:44:43.180 --> 3:44:46.180]  We must start changing our own mind pattern.
[3:44:46.180 --> 3:44:47.180]  Obama's total new world.
[3:44:47.180 --> 3:44:48.180]  Oh God.
[3:44:48.180 --> 3:44:49.180]  CFR is a big new.
[3:44:49.180 --> 3:44:50.180]  Yeah.
[3:44:50.180 --> 3:44:51.180]  Give me a break.
[3:44:51.180 --> 3:44:53.180]  And the poor left just can't see it.
[3:44:53.180 --> 3:44:55.180]  There's like the phony environmental movement.
[3:44:55.180 --> 3:44:58.180]  The globalists are destroying the environment and so they're not going to fix any of the
[3:44:58.180 --> 3:44:59.180]  real problems.
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:03.180]  They're going to tax what humans exhale and they admit that it's about controlling us.
[3:45:03.180 --> 3:45:09.180]  In fact, now at office depot in places, they're going to make you park in the back like making
[3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:11.180]  black people sit on the back of the bus.
[3:45:11.180 --> 3:45:15.180]  If your car isn't, you know, proper with emissions, you're going to have stickers on your car
[3:45:15.180 --> 3:45:18.180]  in California and all over the world where, where it shows your emissions.
[3:45:18.180 --> 3:45:20.180]  Everybody can hate you all over Austin.
[3:45:20.180 --> 3:45:21.180]  They pop SUV tires.
[3:45:21.180 --> 3:45:23.180]  I'm not saying SUVs are good.
[3:45:23.180 --> 3:45:28.180]  The point is we need to get off oil because that gives them control, but they admit the
[3:45:28.180 --> 3:45:32.180]  new 10 million man Maoist green core, big article up on prison planet.
[3:45:32.180 --> 3:45:34.180]  I mean, I mean, this is going to be the new earth religion.
[3:45:34.180 --> 3:45:38.180]  And the UN says the religion will be killing our fellow men.
[3:45:38.180 --> 3:45:43.180]  And then Richard in Haas at the club of Rome and now CFR chairman says the state will wage
[3:45:43.180 --> 3:45:44.180]  war against humanity.
[3:45:44.180 --> 3:45:46.180]  I mean, this is a hellish thing they're doing.
[3:45:46.180 --> 3:45:47.180]  Yeah.
[3:45:47.180 --> 3:45:48.180]  And it's been in action for so long.
[3:45:48.180 --> 3:45:50.180]  I mean, I read limits to growth.
[3:45:50.180 --> 3:45:53.180]  I, I understood that they were programming us for this destruction.
[3:45:53.180 --> 3:45:55.180]  I was a 93.
[3:45:55.180 --> 3:46:00.180]  I was standing protest in front of Bill Clinton's White House about the takeover of public lands
[3:46:00.180 --> 3:46:01.180]  and turning them into parks.
[3:46:01.180 --> 3:46:05.180]  When you're at the rainbow gathering, do they understand that the main environmental movement
[3:46:05.180 --> 3:46:07.180]  is totally controlled and anti-human?
[3:46:07.180 --> 3:46:08.180]  Not at all.
[3:46:08.180 --> 3:46:10.180]  So they're like, we've got it because I've talked to people.
[3:46:10.180 --> 3:46:12.180]  I understand the government wants to kill everyone.
[3:46:12.180 --> 3:46:13.180]  It's needed.
[3:46:13.180 --> 3:46:14.180]  I'm ready to die.
[3:46:14.180 --> 3:46:15.180]  Yeah.
[3:46:15.180 --> 3:46:16.180]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[3:46:16.180 --> 3:46:19.180]  I mean, but you know, when it gets to really dying, they're going to be squealing, fighting
[3:46:19.180 --> 3:46:20.180]  for their lives.
[3:46:20.180 --> 3:46:22.180]  Without cancer, they've been given bastards.
[3:46:22.180 --> 3:46:23.180]  That's right.
[3:46:23.180 --> 3:46:24.180]  That's right.
[3:46:24.180 --> 3:46:25.180]  And there's, I mean, and here you go.
[3:46:25.180 --> 3:46:29.180]  Well, I know we're killing the third world, but you know, they have to die.
[3:46:29.180 --> 3:46:31.180]  No, no, you're going to die too, Schmuck.
[3:46:31.180 --> 3:46:33.180]  They've already injected you and your family.
[3:46:33.180 --> 3:46:35.180]  And now they know you're not taking the shots.
[3:46:35.180 --> 3:46:37.180]  So they're putting in the water and the food and sprain us.
[3:46:37.180 --> 3:46:38.180]  Okay.
[3:46:38.180 --> 3:46:39.180]  Get ready to die, folks.
[3:46:39.180 --> 3:46:41.180]  Your love of lies is now coming to a head.
[3:46:41.180 --> 3:46:45.180]  I want everybody to know that this is the time of great death that's coming.
[3:46:45.180 --> 3:46:47.180]  And don't say we didn't warn you.
[3:46:47.180 --> 3:46:48.180]  That's right.
[3:46:48.180 --> 3:46:52.180]  I've been told by globalist and through other intermediaries, people that they're like,
[3:46:52.180 --> 3:46:57.180]  no, the reason we leave you alone is we, we are actually fulfilling their need to tell
[3:46:57.180 --> 3:46:58.180]  everyone.
[3:46:58.180 --> 3:47:03.180]  And they're saying, see, you, and I've had globalist tell me, you know, oh, Mr. Jones.
[3:47:03.180 --> 3:47:04.180]  And people say, well, why don't I say their names?
[3:47:04.180 --> 3:47:06.180]  Cause it's always, well, this is the confidence that we say this.
[3:47:06.180 --> 3:47:07.180]  You have to promise them confidence.
[3:47:07.180 --> 3:47:10.180]  Of course, it was a thing of a total obvious crown about that.
[3:47:10.180 --> 3:47:13.180]  And I would say it, but then I would lose any of these sources, but it's like, look,
[3:47:13.180 --> 3:47:14.180]  they don't want your help.
[3:47:14.180 --> 3:47:15.180]  They don't care.
[3:47:15.180 --> 3:47:16.180]  They want to die.
[3:47:16.180 --> 3:47:17.180]  Look at them.
[3:47:17.180 --> 3:47:19.180]  You've programmed them that way and it's wrong.
[3:47:19.180 --> 3:47:22.180]  And then you find out the people that you're talking to are even supposedly high up.
[3:47:22.180 --> 3:47:23.180]  They aren't even that high up.
[3:47:23.180 --> 3:47:24.180]  Right.
[3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:26.180]  I mean, this thing is really a blind system.
[3:47:26.180 --> 3:47:27.180]  That's right.
[3:47:27.180 --> 3:47:28.180]  Everybody in it's blind.
[3:47:28.180 --> 3:47:29.180]  They claim they're illuminating.
[3:47:29.180 --> 3:47:30.180]  They're doing the opposite.
[3:47:30.180 --> 3:47:32.180]  There's no doubt about that.
[3:47:32.180 --> 3:47:34.180]  They, they are blind to their whole agenda.
[3:47:34.180 --> 3:47:35.180]  They don't know.
[3:47:35.180 --> 3:47:38.180]  Well, they all think it's 90% that are going to be killed or 80%.
[3:47:38.180 --> 3:47:41.180]  When you really get into their documents, they're talking 99.9.
[3:47:41.180 --> 3:47:43.180]  See, they don't want to tell their minions that.
[3:47:43.180 --> 3:47:45.180]  No, no, you're going to die too.
[3:47:45.180 --> 3:47:46.180]  Yeah.
[3:47:46.180 --> 3:47:51.180]  And we just, you could see it left and right as they're starting to manipulate the weather,
[3:47:51.180 --> 3:47:54.180]  starting to manipulate our water, our food.
[3:47:54.180 --> 3:47:58.180]  I mean, good God, genetically modified foods, all of this.
[3:47:58.180 --> 3:47:59.180]  And they know it's killing us.
[3:47:59.180 --> 3:48:00.180]  All the studies show it.
[3:48:00.180 --> 3:48:01.180]  Yeah.
[3:48:01.180 --> 3:48:02.180]  Cell phones.
[3:48:02.180 --> 3:48:03.180]  Let's take some calls for Freeman.
[3:48:03.180 --> 3:48:04.180]  All right.
[3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:05.180]  Amazing interview.
[3:48:05.180 --> 3:48:06.180]  John in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[3:48:06.180 --> 3:48:07.180]  Go ahead.
[3:48:07.180 --> 3:48:08.180]  Hello there.
[3:48:08.180 --> 3:48:09.180]  Hello there, gentlemen.
[3:48:09.180 --> 3:48:10.180]  I appreciate all of your time.
[3:48:10.180 --> 3:48:11.180]  Are you, you got me on there?
[3:48:11.180 --> 3:48:12.180]  Yes, sir.
[3:48:12.180 --> 3:48:13.180]  Okay.
[3:48:13.180 --> 3:48:15.180]  This is pretty simple.
[3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:18.180]  We have 66 books in the Bible.
[3:48:18.180 --> 3:48:22.180]  Me being a man, reading the Bible, man in number six.
[3:48:22.180 --> 3:48:25.180]  That kind of, kind of shook me up there.
[3:48:25.180 --> 3:48:28.180]  You know, is that, what is your comment on that?
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:34.180]  Well, let's look at House Resolution 33 that established Freemason Day, first one ever
[3:48:34.180 --> 3:48:35.180]  this year.
[3:48:35.180 --> 3:48:39.180]  Put it on June 24th, which of course is St. John's Day.
[3:48:39.180 --> 3:48:44.180]  But June 24th, 6 and 2 and 4 is 6, and it's House Resolution 33, which is 6.
[3:48:44.180 --> 3:48:46.180]  So you're back at Freemason Day being 6.
[3:48:46.180 --> 3:48:52.180]  Well, from the Christian faith, the true one, everything, the devil, the Lucifer, also counterfeits
[3:48:52.180 --> 3:48:53.180]  and expropriates.
[3:48:53.180 --> 3:48:54.180]  We'll go ahead.
[3:48:54.180 --> 3:48:55.180]  Okay.
[3:48:55.180 --> 3:48:56.180]  That's cool.
[3:48:56.180 --> 3:49:01.860]  With the Septuagint or with other books that may have been eliminated from the Bible, do
[3:49:01.860 --> 3:49:07.180]  you know how many, how many books are made, might have been, all together if it hadn't
[3:49:07.180 --> 3:49:08.180]  been?
[3:49:08.180 --> 3:49:09.180]  I don't know.
[3:49:09.180 --> 3:49:10.180]  I don't know.
[3:49:10.180 --> 3:49:12.180]  There's three or four that really were part of it they took out, but then there's a whole
[3:49:12.180 --> 3:49:13.180]  debate about that.
[3:49:13.180 --> 3:49:14.180]  Yeah.
[3:49:14.180 --> 3:49:15.180]  I don't know either.
[3:49:15.180 --> 3:49:18.180]  I know that they're very into the book of Enoch and Enoch is very important to the Freemasonic
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:19.180]  Order.
[3:49:19.180 --> 3:49:20.180]  And they took that out.
[3:49:20.180 --> 3:49:21.180]  Yeah.
[3:49:21.180 --> 3:49:22.180]  Or is Enoch in there?
[3:49:22.180 --> 3:49:23.180]  Is it taken out?
[3:49:23.180 --> 3:49:24.180]  No, it's taken out.
[3:49:24.180 --> 3:49:28.060]  Now is the whole story of the fallen angels and Azrael coming down.
[3:49:28.060 --> 3:49:31.900]  Now it's just another subtle programming when they killed off Superman and they killed
[3:49:31.900 --> 3:49:34.340]  off Batman back in 2000.
[3:49:34.340 --> 3:49:38.820]  They replaced Batman with Azrael, which is the original fallen angel that brought everybody
[3:49:38.820 --> 3:49:41.540]  to have sex with the humans here on earth.
[3:49:41.540 --> 3:49:44.100]  And they replaced Superman with Hellspawn.
[3:49:44.100 --> 3:49:49.020]  So they've begun the programming, you know, this mind pattern programming again straight
[3:49:49.020 --> 3:49:51.100]  through comic books as Batman.
[3:49:51.100 --> 3:49:54.340]  Well, they admit they're using comic books and things to program people.
[3:49:54.340 --> 3:49:56.540]  Anything else, sir?
[3:49:56.540 --> 3:50:01.780]  I appreciate all your endeavors and I hope they are fruitful and you guys have a great
[3:50:01.780 --> 3:50:02.780]  day.
[3:50:02.780 --> 3:50:03.780]  Yeah.
[3:50:03.780 --> 3:50:04.780]  I'm going to have to have Freeman back.
[3:50:04.780 --> 3:50:05.780]  I don't want to wait.
[3:50:05.780 --> 3:50:06.780]  Time's short.
[3:50:06.780 --> 3:50:07.780]  I got Mark Corky, by the way, coming on Friday for two hours.
[3:50:07.780 --> 3:50:10.580]  I want to get you back in here for two hours next week.
[3:50:10.580 --> 3:50:11.580]  We got it.
[3:50:11.580 --> 3:50:12.580]  We got a final segment coming up.

[3:54:08.780 --> 3:54:12.660]  I'm not into all this stuff, a lot of atheists think, well, you're crazy, you believe in
[3:54:12.660 --> 3:54:13.660]  all this.
[3:54:13.660 --> 3:54:15.420]  It is real whether you believe in it or not.
[3:54:15.420 --> 3:54:19.620]  That is the elites believe in it, whether it's, quote, real or not, they are practicing
[3:54:19.620 --> 3:54:20.620]  it.
[3:54:20.620 --> 3:54:23.620]  Let's take some final calls for our guest, Scott Narazona, Chris and Elliott.
[3:54:23.620 --> 3:54:24.620]  Scott, you're on the air.
[3:54:24.620 --> 3:54:25.620]  Go ahead.
[3:54:25.620 --> 3:54:26.620]  Hey, guys.
[3:54:26.620 --> 3:54:31.460]  My question, I got a couple of them real quick, and one of them is that Aleister Crowley,
[3:54:31.460 --> 3:54:38.540]  when he was alive, I read something that he was supposed to try to bring in the Antichrist,
[3:54:38.540 --> 3:54:41.540]  and that he did some rituals, and I don't know how he talked about it.
[3:54:41.540 --> 3:54:46.980]  Well, Aleister Crowley was more of their clown frontman to kind of introduce things to people,
[3:54:46.980 --> 3:54:51.420]  kind of like IBM really owns Applied Digital Solutions and uses them as the front to promote
[3:54:51.420 --> 3:54:52.420]  the chip.
[3:54:52.420 --> 3:54:53.420]  That's my take on him.
[3:54:53.420 --> 3:54:57.940]  The guy was an incredible clown, and I mean, he murdered his kids and stuff, and they thought
[3:54:57.940 --> 3:55:01.780]  that was kind of cool, the higher-ups, but you want to comment on him?
[3:55:01.780 --> 3:55:05.540]  Oh, what to say about old Uncle Aleister.
[3:55:05.540 --> 3:55:10.580]  Actually, this man was a major influence for the 20th century.
[3:55:10.580 --> 3:55:15.460]  He had every rock and roll group, everything that we see, and many are following Aleister
[3:55:15.460 --> 3:55:16.460]  Crowley.
[3:55:16.460 --> 3:55:23.620]  You've got the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, David Bowie, the list goes on and on about
[3:55:23.620 --> 3:55:27.820]  people that were following Aleister Crowley into these pits of despair, and he did call
[3:55:27.820 --> 3:55:29.820]  himself the Beast 666.
[3:55:29.820 --> 3:55:34.420]  Yeah, but my point is, is that there were a lot more evil people behind him.
[3:55:34.420 --> 3:55:36.060]  This wasn't the grand poo-bop.
[3:55:36.060 --> 3:55:37.060]  No.
[3:55:37.060 --> 3:55:38.060]  No.
[3:55:38.060 --> 3:55:39.060]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[3:55:39.060 --> 3:55:40.660]  He was somebody they just let run around.
[3:55:40.660 --> 3:55:44.940]  And by the end of it, he was a chicken-necked, old, pathetic drug addict.
[3:55:44.940 --> 3:55:45.940]  Right.
[3:55:45.940 --> 3:55:48.340]  That's what the evil gave him was weakness.
[3:55:48.340 --> 3:55:49.340]  Weak.
[3:55:49.340 --> 3:55:50.340]  Okay.
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:51.340]  Anything else?
[3:55:51.340 --> 3:55:52.340]  Yes.
[3:55:52.340 --> 3:55:53.860]  We were quick on this one, too.
[3:55:53.860 --> 3:55:57.500]  I was reading some stuff on the Knights of Malta, and they said in there that they believed
[3:55:57.500 --> 3:56:01.540]  that the Masons were used to do their dirty work, but at the end, that they would destroy
[3:56:01.540 --> 3:56:05.100]  them like, you know, the Protestants, and they kind of, you know, they put that in their
[3:56:05.100 --> 3:56:06.100]  order.
[3:56:06.100 --> 3:56:07.300]  It gets all run by the same people.
[3:56:07.300 --> 3:56:11.460]  You've got folks that are obsessed with one group or the other.
[3:56:11.460 --> 3:56:13.780]  You've got Protestant groups that say it's all the Catholics.
[3:56:13.780 --> 3:56:15.660]  You've got Catholic groups that say it's all the Protestants.
[3:56:15.660 --> 3:56:17.220]  It's all the same group.
[3:56:17.220 --> 3:56:22.380]  And they want to get you limited into obsessing on one group, Jews, or this or that.
[3:56:22.380 --> 3:56:25.340]  When you get to the bottom line, it's all the same group.
[3:56:25.340 --> 3:56:26.820]  And people say, oh, you're covering up for them.
[3:56:26.820 --> 3:56:28.180]  No, all of these groups are evil.
[3:56:28.180 --> 3:56:30.060]  I mean, it's simple.
[3:56:30.060 --> 3:56:31.700]  And then the debate's over, and you can move on.
[3:56:31.700 --> 3:56:34.860]  They want you to get caught up in sectarianism, divide and conquer.
[3:56:34.860 --> 3:56:38.460]  It's free humanity against the illuminated ones who are not illuminated.
[3:56:38.460 --> 3:56:40.180]  They're in the black sunshine of hell.
[3:56:40.180 --> 3:56:41.180]  You want to comment on that?
[3:56:41.180 --> 3:56:42.180]  I mean, do you agree with that statement, Freeman?
[3:56:42.180 --> 3:56:45.300]  Yeah, I completely agree with you there, Alex.
[3:56:45.300 --> 3:56:49.780]  Yeah, you can't get focused on one group or the other because, yeah, it's the different
[3:56:49.780 --> 3:56:50.780]  arms of the same beast.
[3:56:50.780 --> 3:56:54.900]  And then you're playing into their trick, but no doubt, I mean, Vatican's calling for
[3:56:54.900 --> 3:56:55.900]  world government.
[3:56:55.900 --> 3:56:57.340]  There's no doubt in what it is.
[3:56:57.340 --> 3:56:58.340]  Anything else?
[3:56:58.340 --> 3:57:02.580]  Yeah, the reason I, a lot of people that, you know, say it's this group or that group
[3:57:02.580 --> 3:57:06.580]  are just so vicious and crazy and liars and put out so much this info, you know, the Jews
[3:57:06.580 --> 3:57:08.700]  did it group are totally unsavory.
[3:57:08.700 --> 3:57:12.420]  The Catholics run it all group are just out of their minds and make stuff up and lie about
[3:57:12.420 --> 3:57:13.420]  everybody.
[3:57:13.420 --> 3:57:14.740]  So I know I don't have a lot of respect for them.
[3:57:14.740 --> 3:57:16.500]  And then I come out and criticize the Vatican.
[3:57:16.500 --> 3:57:17.980]  See that isn't good enough for them.
[3:57:17.980 --> 3:57:18.980]  Right.
[3:57:18.980 --> 3:57:21.060]  I've got about out of their leaders and their lives.
[3:57:21.060 --> 3:57:24.180]  And I mean, if I was really thinking it was the Vatican, I would think that the Vatican
[3:57:24.180 --> 3:57:27.500]  run it all crowd work for them to make it look stupid and ridiculous.
[3:57:27.500 --> 3:57:28.500]  You see what I'm saying?
[3:57:28.500 --> 3:57:29.500]  Yes.
[3:57:29.500 --> 3:57:30.500]  Absolutely.
[3:57:30.500 --> 3:57:31.500]  We're out of time.
[3:57:31.500 --> 3:57:33.500]  I can't, I don't have time to get to Chris and Elliot.
[3:57:33.500 --> 3:57:36.700]  We're just out of time with Freeman and Freeman.
[3:57:36.700 --> 3:57:37.700]  Let's go back there with Frank.
[3:57:37.700 --> 3:57:40.660]  Get your setup for two hours next week because I want to really fully introduce you to the
[3:57:40.660 --> 3:57:42.620]  audience and all the fine work you're doing.
[3:57:42.620 --> 3:57:43.620]  Thanks for coming in.
[3:57:43.620 --> 3:57:44.620]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[3:57:44.620 --> 3:57:45.620]  It's been great.
[3:57:45.620 --> 3:57:46.620]  You bet.
[3:57:46.620 --> 3:57:50.060]  Folks, retransmission starts now at infowars.com.
[3:57:50.060 --> 3:57:54.020]  Any of the big guests and multiple economists on the day about what's happening, the economy
[3:57:54.020 --> 3:57:55.020]  covered a lot of other news.
[3:57:55.020 --> 3:57:56.500]  There's a lot I didn't get to.
[3:57:56.500 --> 3:58:03.060]  The news is totally revealing on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, and both sites have different
[3:58:03.060 --> 3:58:04.060]  news on them every day.
[3:58:04.060 --> 3:58:06.700]  They have a lot of the same news, but a lot more than it used to be.
[3:58:06.700 --> 3:58:11.580]  I mean, there might be 40 stories or 20 stories on the site or 10 that aren't on the other.
[3:58:11.580 --> 3:58:14.820]  Just wild stuff we didn't have time to cover, cover it all tomorrow.
[3:58:14.820 --> 3:58:15.820]  God bless you.
[3:58:15.820 --> 3:58:20.540]  All retransmission starts now on the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.

[3:58:24.900 --> 3:58:25.900]  Take care.

[3:58:31.060 --> 3:58:35.780]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:35.780 --> 3:58:41.380]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra
[3:58:41.380 --> 3:58:44.940]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:44.940 --> 3:58:50.220]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:58:50.220 --> 3:58:51.900]  to tell their story.
[3:58:51.900 --> 3:59:00.780]  Kidman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:59:00.780 --> 3:59:05.540]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[3:59:05.540 --> 3:59:07.820]  take action against their global masters.
[3:59:07.820 --> 3:59:10.940]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[3:59:10.940 --> 3:59:16.780]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:59:16.780 --> 3:59:23.740]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and

[3:59:28.820 --> 3:59:32.500]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[3:59:32.500 --> 3:59:40.020]  and bring in martial law.
[3:59:40.020 --> 3:59:45.060]  You are listening to GCN.
