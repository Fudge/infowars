[00:59.280 --> 01:04.200]  via the webcam will be live at prisonplanet.tv for a full three hours

[01:09.800 --> 01:18.000]  the latest economic developments with the Dow going below below seven thousand
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.760]  yesterday and continuing that today and we're going to have state rep Dan it's a
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.320]  back on who's got national attention for his bold resolutions that are pretty
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.800]  close to passing up in New Hampshire they're having a big rally coming up
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.240]  what in two days there to try to get that passed in New Hampshire declaring
[01:36.240 --> 01:46.120]  state sovereignty so that is coming up as well the news I have here in front of
[01:46.120 --> 01:50.760]  me is a very very important obviously Dow finishes below seven thousand for
[01:50.760 --> 02:06.440]  first time since 97 the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted below seven
[02:06.440 --> 02:11.800]  thousand the opening bell and kept driving lower all day finishing at six
[02:11.800 --> 02:15.560]  thousand seven hundred and sixty three and it's still below seven thousand this
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.920]  morning last time I checked a loss of nearly three hundred points each of the
[02:20.920 --> 02:26.440]  thirty stocks the index loss of value for the day so we'll be going over the
[02:26.440 --> 02:32.080]  details of that thousands of Mexican soldiers poured into the country's most
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.640]  violent city in crackdown on drug gangs yeah drug gangs they're trying to take
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.760]  over so they can have all the profits for themselves also Obama released a
[02:42.760 --> 02:49.040]  secret bush anti-terror memos I guess you could say this was a good thing
[02:49.040 --> 02:55.160]  though he's not releasing most of the secret Bush communiques these are the
[02:55.160 --> 03:01.520]  John you memos and Attorney General Alberta Gonzalez memos and guess what
[03:01.520 --> 03:07.480]  they planned to ban free speech in the United States they were testing whether
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.480]  they could get away with it or not and that's notice that about three years
[03:11.480 --> 03:19.320]  ago I went on air and I said folks they are strongly considering banning free
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.360]  speech in the United States and I could tell that because suddenly O'Reilly
[03:25.360 --> 03:32.160]  suddenly Sean Hannity suddenly the MSNBC host the CNN host were saying you
[03:32.160 --> 03:39.280]  know these 9-11 truthers and you know these anti-war protesters this is a
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.200]  time of war and in protesting the war aids terrorist is the war is against
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.120]  terrorist and so this should be banned Michael Weiner the beatnik poses as a
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.160]  conservative he came out and said that you should be put in a labor camp because
[03:53.160 --> 03:56.680]  you shouldn't have the taxpayer pay for you to be in prison so it being forced
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.640]  a labor camp and then even the deputy attorney general of California at the
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.720]  time I'll never forget in the Oakland Tribune said we're not gonna allow anti
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.960]  war protest anymore in the state because the feds have handed down directives to
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.240]  us that protesting is aiding terrorists because we protest a war that's
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.600]  supposedly against terrorists because you know Saddam Hussein carried out 9-11
[04:22.600 --> 04:25.800]  they were still putting out that lie at the time then you're aiding terrorists
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.200]  and so under the war powers act and trading with the enemy and other such
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.520]  acts we're banning it but people still went out protested demonstrated they
[04:34.520 --> 04:46.120]  tried the same thing they tried the same situation over in Australia but people
[04:46.120 --> 04:49.400]  just said no to it so see the tyrants are trying to tell us to go under
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.680]  tyranny we're just saying no this is vital information we'll cover when we

[08:17.720 --> 08:22.760]  bush considered revoking of the first amendment that's the international
[08:22.760 --> 08:28.400]  herald from you and you and others also said in the October 23rd memorandum that
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.920]  quote first amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the
[08:33.920 --> 08:39.800]  overriding need to wage war successfully and the memos went through how they will
[08:39.800 --> 08:45.160]  abolish posicom and taught us by claiming that it's a national security
[08:45.160 --> 08:50.800]  issue and that's why you began hearing oh there's bomb disposal teams with the
[08:50.800 --> 08:55.040]  army they're going to work with every county and every city to look for road
[08:55.040 --> 09:00.080]  side bombs from al-qaeda and then now we have their training manuals we've had
[09:00.080 --> 09:03.400]  police call in it's been in the mainstream news that they're preparing
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.520]  them for the american people to fight the government see the entire homeland
[09:07.520 --> 09:13.480]  security system was set up to be a tyranny it is homeland security for the
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.440]  corrupt bankers to rob and loot us at will where no one can block them no
[09:18.440 --> 09:23.040]  state governments can stop them no grand juries can indict them this is all a
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.680]  larceny system this is all a crime system so that they can loot and steal
[09:28.680 --> 09:35.280]  and control the population at will this is high treason but notice that they
[09:35.280 --> 09:40.400]  tried to float the idea not just in the united states but in england also in
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.120]  australia they said it's a war on terror you can't criticize the government you
[09:44.120 --> 09:51.360]  can't protest that's a key article that was in the oakland tribune what four
[09:51.360 --> 09:55.040]  years ago where the deputy attorney general said we're banning protest of
[09:55.040 --> 10:00.600]  the war because again protesting the war aids terrorist because this war is
[10:00.600 --> 10:04.800]  against terrorist and so if you're protesting you're protesting in support
[10:04.800 --> 10:14.320]  of terrorist and they cited different memos and confidential advice they were
[10:14.320 --> 10:20.960]  getting from the white house and then we saw bellow reilly shan hannity but not
[10:20.960 --> 10:27.400]  just them cnn msnbcs cnbc host come out and beat the drum that we need to ban
[10:27.400 --> 10:33.400]  free speech when it protest this war and anybody that protests the war needs to
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.080]  be put in a fema camp anybody who's a 9-11 truth is that ask questions or
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.200]  protest needs to be arrested quote taken to guantanamo bay and tasered and
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.440]  tortured these are quotes that I'm giving you and I would see the same
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.120]  quotes and they would look at the teleprompters and say the exact same thing
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.680]  in the exact same order by the way a bunch of that is in truth rising we have
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.240]  those clips in my film truth rising where we show them one after the other
[11:00.240 --> 11:06.560]  saying the same thing on every channel I mean how diabolical is that how wicked
[11:06.560 --> 11:11.560]  and underhanded is it that they hired 25,000 executives and individuals quote
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.680]  in key infrastructure with license to kill orders under fbi and homeland
[11:16.680 --> 11:23.520]  security orders with firearms saying we'll give you orders of who to shoot
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.520]  to kill and they've got 25,000 and growing mainstream news last year in
[11:29.520 --> 11:35.040]  regard and then three years ago we got the secret directives and documents to
[11:35.040 --> 11:41.200]  the pastors at that time 13,000 they then doubled it 26,000 in 2008 and then it
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.320]  became mainstream news exactly what we told people I mean I don't blame folks
[11:46.320 --> 11:49.640]  not being able to believe it when we posted secret FEMA documents with the
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.240]  preachers being prepared and to teach their flocks to take injections force
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.200]  inoculations to go to camps to have their families broken up I mean it's in
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.600]  the documents and then it comes out on mainstream news oh yes pastors are being
[12:05.600 --> 12:08.520]  prepared to get the people ready for martial law to do as they're told
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.960]  because the government's biggest problem in martial law is us we're bad the
[12:12.960 --> 12:19.600]  people are the enemy now they didn't get away with this you know they tried to
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.480]  five and a half years ago they ordered 14 million first responders every police
[12:24.480 --> 12:31.160]  officer every firefighter every nurse every government employee of county
[12:31.160 --> 12:42.920]  city state federal every doctor every EMS driver to take to take smallpox and
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.960]  experimental anthrax shots remember that they said you've got to take it and the
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.320]  police and firemen and medical workers and doctors led the charge they said
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.680]  there's no law here that I have to take this smallpox shot and then it came out
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.560]  the law people that were taking it it would cause an auto immune flare up in
[13:00.560 --> 13:04.320]  the arteries mainly in men above 45 and they were having heart attacks and
[13:04.320 --> 13:10.400]  dying and troops were taking it and dying mainly officers because they were
[13:10.400 --> 13:15.640]  older and reporters were taking it and dying in Iraq but also here in the US
[13:15.640 --> 13:24.560]  and so only 4,000 first responders took it and close to 100 died according to the
[13:24.560 --> 13:32.880]  LA Times of this smallpox shot that was live smallpox and then remember Tommy
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.560]  Thompson wouldn't take it and it came out that Ridge wouldn't take it either and
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.520]  so it just collapsed I remember having police in two separate occasions walk up
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.200]  to me in gas stations when I was paying for gas and getting Gatorade or whatever
[13:45.200 --> 13:50.720]  walking over on Alex heard your show none of us are taking it I was like well
[13:50.720 --> 13:57.360]  good job well sure you know surely don't make us take it then because they admit
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.200]  their training police to drive the buses to go door to door to make people load
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.680]  on them to then go to the local sports stadium this is public this is on record
[14:05.680 --> 14:11.680]  and be forcibly inoculated and they've done drills we were told by Walmart
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.720]  managers in 2002 that there was a secret program with Walmart distribution
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.400]  centers and Walmart facilities under martial law to be where people are
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.640]  taken to be given the force inoculations and people didn't believe us then two
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.240]  years ago it came out in mainstream news that Walmart was indeed involved in
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.240]  quote helping during emergencies with emergency inoculations and they did
[14:34.240 --> 14:40.680]  drills all over the country you can Google all of this you know Walmart does
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.640]  vaccination drill or Walmart does emergency preparedness drill and people pull
[14:47.640 --> 14:54.440]  into the Walmart and drive through and they give you shots now first thing that
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.400]  it would jelly beans they did drills where they would give you a jelly bean
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.000]  as if it was your pill then they now have drills where you actually show up
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.480]  for the drill and they advertise it locally and the citizens get free flu
[15:06.480 --> 15:14.280]  shots and you drive up and the army sits there and injects you with the flu
[15:14.280 --> 15:18.720]  vaccine so they're beta testing this and drilling the firemen drilling the
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.120]  police drilling the National Guard drilling the Walmart employees other
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.160]  businesses are involved this is a massive program that they're engineering and
[15:29.160 --> 15:37.840]  gearing up for the world right now in a big big way but think of the magnitude
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.120]  of this you know we could tell by the propaganda that they were seriously
[15:42.120 --> 15:46.280]  considering in increased speech and now they're announcing they are going to
[15:46.280 --> 15:49.920]  shut down the old web force us on to a new web where everything you do is
[15:49.920 --> 15:55.320]  control where you have a subdomain with one of 50 universities or 50
[15:55.320 --> 16:00.840]  corporations 100 total globally you will have a subdomain like on myspace or
[16:00.840 --> 16:06.120]  YouTube they can delete your area they can restrict you they can censor you and
[16:06.120 --> 16:10.400]  the New York Times and have the article two weeks ago saying oh yes you'll lose
[16:10.400 --> 16:15.120]  your freedom for security and then the government will be gatekeepers and now
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.320]  the Pentagon and North com are openly taking over quote cyber security and the
[16:20.320 --> 16:25.760]  architecture of the Internet so they're going to incrementally through
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.360]  ending net neutrality taxation regulation control force everybody over into
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.200]  the censored Chinese style Internet now here they don't call it a Chinese
[16:35.200 --> 16:38.780]  censored Internet but in Australia they come right out and say yes we're
[16:38.780 --> 16:42.400]  setting up Australian net style censorship there'll be a few thousand
[16:42.400 --> 16:48.440]  websites you can visit they're doing it now they are shutting down and trying
[16:48.440 --> 16:52.560]  to curtail free speech but they're not going to get away with it this is the
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.120]  international herald for me and it's also AP Reuters it's everywhere Bush
[16:56.120 --> 17:01.200]  considered revoking First Amendment you and others in the White House of the
[17:01.200 --> 17:04.440]  October 23rd memorandum that First Amendment speech and press rights may
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.640]  also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully the secret
[17:09.640 --> 17:13.000]  legal opinions issued by Bush administration lawyers after September
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.760]  2001 attacks included assertions that the president could use the nation's
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.040]  military within the United States to combat people deemed as terrorist and
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.080]  conduct raids without obtaining search warrants the opinion was among nine
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.680]  that were disclosed publicly for the first time yesterday by the Justice
[17:30.680 --> 17:32.840]  Department and what the Obama administration portrayed as a step
[17:32.840 --> 17:36.240]  towards greater transparency and I have to admit this is the first thing good
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.720]  I've seen Obama do them and this this is this is good the opinions showed a
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.160]  broad interpretation of presidential authority asserting as well that the
[17:46.160 --> 17:52.640]  president could unilaterally abrogate foreign treaties deals with detainees
[17:52.640 --> 17:57.320]  suspected of terrorism while rejecting input from Congress and conduct a
[17:57.320 --> 18:04.160]  warrantless eavesdropping program and I am just stunned and amazed right now
[18:04.160 --> 18:08.720]  that Obama actually did something good I mean I wish he did all the stuff he said
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.280]  he was gonna do a year and a half ago in the war not hire any lobbyist close down
[18:13.280 --> 18:18.000]  Guantanamo we were up here working late last night and I went and picked up
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.760]  hot dogs from another from a local hot dog place that's what the guys wanted
[18:23.760 --> 18:27.920]  and I go in and the two people behind the counter were fans of the show
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.360]  everybody that came in three different people that came in while I was there
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.920]  getting hot dogs they were all fans just an example of how big this show's
[18:35.920 --> 18:39.560]  getting and how effective thanks to you out there spreading the word and but
[18:39.560 --> 18:42.640]  one guy said you know you're kind of down on Obama didn't he really close
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.480]  Guantanamo and I said no he'll look at closing it in one year and he has said
[18:47.480 --> 18:52.000]  they're gonna continue rendition secret arrest and not follow the Constitution
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.800]  Bill of Rights Geneva Convention and I gave him some of the headlines you know
[18:55.800 --> 19:01.200]  Obama backs Bush on no rights for detainees and I said just Google that but
[19:01.200 --> 19:06.400]  and I had another guy when I was walking down the street the other day you
[19:06.400 --> 19:08.960]  come over start talking to me and said hey we you know I liked when you were on
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.680]  Bush but seems like you're even more against Obama that's because the
[19:12.680 --> 19:17.520]  globalist are making their move right now like never before and in dowing him
[19:17.520 --> 19:28.560]  with this godlike messianic messiah type system and I mean bush was weak bush
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.760]  was a petulant little devil looked like a goblin acted like a goblin no one
[19:33.760 --> 19:38.120]  bought into what he was saying with Obama he's slick he's dangerous but but
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.400]  regardless there's another story here out of the mainstream news kind of
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.400]  documenting that Obama is doing his own bush style secrecy and declaring a lot
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.080]  of the executive powers that Bush did but this is something releasing these
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.600]  memos but sadly federal courts had already ordered them released and they
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.880]  were gonna lose in court so it's something they basically had to do it's
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.920]  kind of given the dog a bone

[24:39.200 --> 24:43.080]  trillions of dollars in the private banks and brokerage firms and then say
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.760]  it's secret where the money's going and then they have the gall to say we're
[24:50.760 --> 24:54.400]  going to set up a world government that regulates the controls every facet of
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.640]  your life through carbon taxes and other financial taxes and we're not going to
[24:59.640 --> 25:04.680]  turn the world economy back on until you do that I'm going to get back into this
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.720]  and the other financial news coming up in the next segment but I was listening
[25:09.720 --> 25:16.520]  to BBC radio in my car last night going home at midnight and I heard them do a
[25:16.520 --> 25:28.320]  report on a novel mortgage plan in the United States and this dovetails with
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.240]  what I've seen happen in England and other countries and what I've seen
[25:32.240 --> 25:36.040]  happen in the surrounding area of San Francisco government bureaucrats use
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.600]  environmental operations to kick people out of their houses and the bureaucrats
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.560]  themselves move into the homes in Seattle I've seen Seattle Times articles
[25:45.560 --> 25:51.760]  going back over a decade where in some areas the majority of bars are owned by
[25:51.760 --> 25:56.320]  police and the police will go into the bathroom of a nice bar and restaurant
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.840]  sell another officer cocaine and and then they seize the entire restaurant
[26:01.840 --> 26:04.760]  saying drug dealing was happening when they sell drugs to each other I mean
[26:04.760 --> 26:09.920]  it's completely illegal but they don't care because they're so lawless and they
[26:09.920 --> 26:18.040]  always present it like it's completely reasonable this is out of the news or
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.000]  newspaper Virginia County holds unique lottery to help county employees buy
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.320]  homes lower foreclosures and it's billed like it's completely normal what's
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.520]  happening and they give it that deceptive headline this is exactly how the BBC
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.680]  reported on it almost word for word there's only one problem they took $50
[26:39.680 --> 26:48.600]  million of taxpayer money from property taxes and bought the mortgages and they
[26:48.600 --> 27:00.080]  are giving police firemen county workers homes giving them homes with taxpayer
[27:00.080 --> 27:04.480]  money and so this is how they're boosting the economy it says but the
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.600]  county also did not want to commit taxpayer funds so they struck a deal
[27:08.600 --> 27:12.920]  with Sun Trust Bank the county put 50 million of its investment portfolio
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.640]  listen to how deceptive that headline is see this is a very wicked press when
[27:17.640 --> 27:23.280]  it being said so that you know they craftily put this idea out of how it's
[27:23.280 --> 27:29.480]  being done and everything is deception listen to this carefully but the county
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.360]  also did not want to commit taxpayer funds so there's no taxpayer money so
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.160]  they struck a deal with Sun Trust Bank the county put 50 million of its
[27:40.160 --> 27:48.440]  investment portfolio into certificates of deposit with Sun Trust do you
[27:48.440 --> 27:53.880]  understand that that was tax money but see counties through the comprehensive
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.280]  annual financial report they claim that everything they put in these investment
[27:58.280 --> 28:05.760]  funds is separate from the budget and in most cases more than 75% of your tax
[28:05.760 --> 28:12.480]  money goes in to the second set of books this is the big scam the mafia set
[28:12.480 --> 28:17.720]  this up in the 20s 30s 40s and 50s in Chicago it's called the 1313 model and
[28:17.720 --> 28:23.920]  it was exported all over the country and the world in the early 1950s under the
[28:23.920 --> 28:29.040]  program a person taking out a $200,000 mortgage would receive 2,500 in credits
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.840]  at closing the money could be used to reduce closing cost or to buy lower
[28:32.840 --> 28:36.640]  interest rate participants are required to open a Sun Trust banking account but
[28:36.640 --> 28:41.080]  they also receive an additional $250 for doing so and when I heard the BBC
[28:41.080 --> 28:44.800]  report they have the county officials on there just admitting that they just go
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.600]  into these four closed homes below $300,000 is the cap and they're even
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.000]  given money to take the loan and given money to fix it up and they had
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.560]  firefighters people on there bragging about it didn't realize what they were
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.720]  part of but the county also do not want to commit taxpayer funds so they struck
[29:02.720 --> 29:06.200]  a deal with Sun Trust Bank the county put 50 million of its investment portfolio
[29:06.200 --> 29:12.200]  into certificates of deposit with Sun Trust the bank agreed to offer a series
[29:12.200 --> 29:15.840]  of financial incentives to a select number of county employees and they're
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.120]  now basically getting free houses and remember the case a month ago in England
[29:20.120 --> 29:24.160]  where they caught them all over the country where they go kick old people
[29:24.160 --> 29:27.640]  out of their houses elder care does and then they take over the house and say
[29:27.640 --> 29:32.840]  the house had a thousand pound a month bill they'll reduce it down to 150 pounds
[29:32.840 --> 29:35.280]  you know not even what it's worth because the government's paying for the
[29:35.280 --> 29:41.960]  housing these people are sick so that's what's going on that's your bailout
[29:41.960 --> 29:47.440]  yeah let's just you know move people into $300,000 houses for 500 bucks a

[33:19.880 --> 33:23.400]  one of our producers is in studio he's been reading over this article again I
[33:23.400 --> 33:27.360]  just heard the BBC report last night and pulled up the story he's working on
[33:27.360 --> 33:31.160]  getting somebody on to cover this and give us more info but the headlines
[33:31.160 --> 33:35.880]  Virginia County holds unique lottery to help county employees buy homes lower
[33:35.880 --> 33:40.280]  foreclosures and they spend it and say there's no taxpayer money but it's a
[33:40.280 --> 33:45.480]  50 million dollar county investment fund money that they're putting in the
[33:45.480 --> 33:51.400]  SunTrust Bank so that is that is taxpayer money and then it says here in
[33:51.400 --> 33:57.800]  the story its incentives are generous approved applicants county employees
[33:57.800 --> 34:04.120]  only receive interest-free second mortgages worth up to $92,000 homeowners
[34:04.120 --> 34:07.560]  are not required to make payments on that mortgage while they live in the home
[34:07.560 --> 34:11.160]  and at the end of the 30-year mortgage the homeowner still lives there the
[34:11.160 --> 34:15.920]  entire mortgage is forgiven and it says other counties are doing similar
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.840]  things in the state to the four billion to state and local governments from the
[34:20.840 --> 34:26.760]  neighborhood stabilization program passed by Congress I mean so these programs
[34:26.760 --> 34:30.360]  are only for government employees Rob yeah that's nice I wish I was a
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.160]  government employee get a bigger house you know but maybe they can all have
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.820]  their own Air Force One like Nancy Pelosi has now oh yeah yeah and and the free
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.280]  cars and everything else they get and that's off of our our money so don't
[34:43.280 --> 34:46.920]  forget that but what are they gonna do while everybody else is losing their
[34:46.920 --> 34:50.160]  jobs and going bankrupt and they're just raising raising raising taxes and more
[34:50.160 --> 34:54.360]  cops outriding tickets and they're just it's like a swarm of locusts yeah well
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.280]  we've got a group hopefully coming on today from New Jersey they're getting
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.680]  their property tax rates in one year going up 67% even though actual property
[35:04.680 --> 35:07.920]  values have gone down right right I'm seeing other counties around the
[35:07.920 --> 35:12.040]  country where in some cases housing prices have dropped by close to 50% and
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.480]  they go okay it's no longer called a property tax we're passing a new thing a
[35:15.480 --> 35:20.200]  one-time fee for everybody in the city of $14,000 for roads yeah an
[35:20.200 --> 35:23.360]  assessment is what they call it that's the nice word and if you don't like it
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.840]  the police will come and throw you out of your house and take your home and
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.160]  they'll move in you know and the county that they're talking about they say
[35:30.160 --> 35:33.280]  they've been hit hard by foreclosures and you know the problem is their
[35:33.280 --> 35:36.840]  inflated property rates I mean these people you know for a 3,000 square foot
[35:36.840 --> 35:42.600]  home they want five five hundred thousand dollars it's ridiculous so well it's
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.720]  like that I mean only housing used to be very affordable and awesome just the
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.440]  last ten years it went where a house it should be a hundred thousand dollars is
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.640]  four hundred thousand dollars and we're talking a two thousand square foot house
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.320]  you want a three thousand square foot no you're okay we want seven hundred
[35:56.320 --> 36:00.040]  thousand dollars that house was 200 grand you know six seven years ago yeah
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.520]  that was the that was part of the Ponzi scheme keep inflating the property rates
[36:03.520 --> 36:06.440]  and then and then all of a sudden nobody can afford the housing and so then they
[36:06.440 --> 36:10.440]  have to move out but I mean how can this county and others with a straight
[36:10.440 --> 36:16.240]  face sit there and say we're doing this incentive that amounts to basically 75
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.440]  percent off is the way I see it here two mortgages right and well I mean how do
[36:20.440 --> 36:23.280]  you break this down there's different ways to look at it you know you got 90
[36:23.280 --> 36:26.400]  and ninety two thousand dollars second mortgage I mean if you're buying a
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.240]  three hundred thousand dollar house it's pretty much a third off is what you're
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.680]  looking at and you know you don't have to pay that back if you stay in the home
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.640]  for 30 years so that's a that's a really good deal well also on the BBC they
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.000]  were announcing just huge amounts of money they had a firefighter on there I
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.560]  couldn't drive you know write notes I was driving to the whole country at
[36:47.560 --> 36:52.960]  midnight but it was going and I'm getting another 20 grand to fix it up and
[36:52.960 --> 36:57.880]  then another 10 grand as a bonus because I did it and and then basically so this
[36:57.880 --> 37:00.440]  is great I'm getting a three hundred thousand dollar house for basically a
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.320]  hundred thousand that's where I come up with the two-thirds off because that's
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.480]  how they were implying it on the BBC I don't know I just know this is only for
[37:07.480 --> 37:11.640]  county people and well yeah we're gonna do some investigating on this and find
[37:11.640 --> 37:14.880]  out what's going on maybe even interview this one of these people who's
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.360]  going through the process so the county they're doing so the county raises your
[37:19.360 --> 37:24.760]  rates on it on your home your property tax till you can't keep it and then they
[37:24.760 --> 37:30.480]  move in yeah I mean the tax rates here you know it's an extra five grand on
[37:30.480 --> 37:34.480]  top of on top of what you're paying for your mortgage well my house in the last
[37:34.480 --> 37:40.960]  few years has lost probably 25% of its value and doesn't matter I got the
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.800]  property taxes it says my house is worth even more yeah it's going up 10% and
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.560]  then I've got to spend time I don't have to go down and contest it and go to
[37:48.560 --> 37:52.200]  court or whatever and I probably won't probably say okay you know you you want
[37:52.200 --> 37:56.040]  to cheat me out of a thousand dollars or whatever here it is yeah and that's
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.080]  that and that's the scheme and now that now they're gonna take that money and
[37:59.080 --> 38:02.440]  go buy four closed properties and then give them to their county employees it's
[38:02.440 --> 38:07.920]  I mean that's just you know it's not fair at all and to take that take money
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.520]  that we're putting into the system and you know spending it on on theirs on
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.360]  themselves so sounds like the Soviet Union or or party officials and
[38:17.360 --> 38:20.600]  communist China that's how they do it there yeah oh it has a nice face they
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.640]  put a nice spin on it I mean as I'm reading the article I'm like well it's
[38:23.640 --> 38:26.680]  not so bad and then you start reading more and then you start looking at it
[38:26.680 --> 38:31.280]  and you're like wait a minute 92,000 for a free second mortgage who gets that
[38:31.280 --> 38:36.680]  nobody gets that unless you're in Prince William County so well they go on to
[38:36.680 --> 38:40.000]  say that other counties are doing similar things quote even more aggressive
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.760]  sure it's all to help the greater good Alex the greater good well this is how
[38:45.760 --> 38:49.560]  they're gonna buy loyalty and I kept telling people this happens in every
[38:49.560 --> 38:52.680]  third world country it happened in Germany this is how England was run for
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.800]  hundreds of years I told you the police and the government officials are going
[38:56.800 --> 39:02.200]  to move into your houses they're going to move into your houses do you read me
[39:02.200 --> 39:05.920]  if I was getting my house foreclosed on and I was in Prince William County I
[39:05.920 --> 39:09.040]  wouldn't move out now would apply for one of those free second mortgages and
[39:09.040 --> 39:12.440]  then they don't give it to you I'd sue yeah because that is discrimination it
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.160]  definitely is and what do you call it job discrimination I don't work for the
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.120]  county so I can't get the same deals as the county well I mean there's a lot of
[39:19.120 --> 39:22.080]  laws on this it's like when they wouldn't give black folks or Native
[39:22.080 --> 39:27.040]  Americans loans mm-hmm even though they have the same job as a white person in
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.880]  the same amount of years and had good credit they'd say no we're not giving
[39:30.880 --> 39:34.360]  you this to you right well now it's another class a superclass it's
[39:34.360 --> 39:40.360]  government or kind of a lordship right the government workers well the
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.400]  government workers are worth more than you well they're gonna buy incredible
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.360]  loyalty from them pulling these copies shenanigans but I've seen cases like in
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.440]  San Francisco where they'll just well there's a ten thousand plus acre piece
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.120]  of land right across the Golden Gate Bridge and there were a lot of homeowners
[39:57.120 --> 40:01.800]  that had that property and 15 years ago or so you can pull up San Francisco
[40:01.800 --> 40:06.000]  Chronicle they just said you know what now no more building here and we're
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.440]  making this a nature preserve and we're gonna force people because it's now
[40:09.440 --> 40:13.720]  gonna be a county nature preserve to sell their houses and then they set the
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.680]  price and basically an imminent domain and then now they describe it as they
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.080]  built clubhouses for the county people and the police you know government
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.720]  officials live in these lavish homes right off the beach or in the gorgeous
[40:25.720 --> 40:30.680]  I mean it's most people place in the world and it's and and then then the
[40:30.680 --> 40:33.520]  public because it was supposedly a parkland or supposed to be able to hike
[40:33.520 --> 40:37.560]  in there the police arrest you they go this is ours get out of here right so
[40:37.560 --> 40:41.640]  they're actually seizing their own little fiefdoms they did something similar
[40:41.640 --> 40:46.520]  to that and one of the dock areas a bunch of hippies were living in you know
[40:46.520 --> 40:49.640]  abandoned boats and they kind of made that their little community and they
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.040]  wanted the property so they went in and kicked them out and the police just ran
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.120]  them all out and they came in and seized the and sunk all the boats and then
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.560]  started building on top of it that was over in San Francisco Bay area yeah
[40:59.560 --> 41:05.720]  well that's not even that case here in Austin mayor Kirk Watson through the
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.160]  SOS plan seized and one grabbed 15,000 acres a bunch of other separate parcels
[41:10.160 --> 41:15.320]  and then now he owns the bank because he controlled the deals that were made that
[41:15.320 --> 41:20.200]  gives the loans to companies to build a million dollar ranchettes on it because
[41:20.200 --> 41:23.320]  that's what the elite want they want to have you know hundred acre fifty acre
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.920]  parcels and it was going to be quote this 15,000 acre nature preserve and they've
[41:27.920 --> 41:31.880]  and then they grabbed a bunch of other land in East Austin you know and they
[41:31.880 --> 41:37.400]  built a huge spa five-star resort golf courses and that was going to be our
[41:37.400 --> 41:41.560]  parkland and no one was ever going to build on it because if you built the
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.520]  runoff would kill the salamanders right right I mean this is so low down I went
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.200]  to a smart growth conference in 1998 in Austin and they had all these former
[41:51.200 --> 41:55.400]  Dallas Cowboys and the head of Bank of America and this bank that bank and there
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.560]  was like 4,000 people there with giant screens they were speaking and they were
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.480]  going this is wonderful our profits will be insane and I would walk up and say
[42:03.480 --> 42:06.480]  but you're stealing the property they would go that's right it's ours if there's
[42:06.480 --> 42:11.000]  video this out there and they would just laugh it was all just it was mafia it
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.840]  was it was it nothing to do with the environment yep this is your government
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.800]  but but meanwhile they have these darling hippies who would come in with the
[42:19.800 --> 42:22.760]  tide eyes and along here in the sandals I'm not bashing I don't care how you look
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.440]  I care less the point is they were the darlings oh you know kind of a
[42:27.440 --> 42:31.480]  microcosm of these UN non-governmental organizations that they point at and
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.200]  say that's who represents the people some group they fund right and then they
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.640]  would you know we're not going to let anybody build here or not let anybody
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.360]  build there we're taking this guy's ranch we're taking this guy's farm and all
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.040]  the surrounding area around Austin as it was exploding in size and they were the
[42:44.040 --> 42:47.400]  little darlings at city council all the time they wanted the people of Austin
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.000]  wanted oh it's so good we're gonna get these rich developers we all was
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.400]  developers funding it the land grab and as soon as they got it passed then the
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.200]  hippies were like wait you're building on it you lied and they said we're
[42:58.200 --> 43:02.960]  banning speaking except once a month for people and we've got to sign up a week
[43:02.960 --> 43:06.240]  in advance and we're not gonna hear from you and maybe we'll just get rid of
[43:06.240 --> 43:10.320]  citizens communication all together and no longer are they the little darlings
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.800]  mm-hmm now they'll tell the police escort them from the building so you're
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.200]  done you were the little sucker now now they're through with you yeah it'll be
[43:19.200 --> 43:22.280]  interesting to see how this this new program works out because they're
[43:22.280 --> 43:25.680]  using it you know they manufactured the crisis and now they have the solution
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.860]  you know which is buying the property up and giving it to their employees
[43:28.860 --> 43:32.880]  honestly Kirk Watson he was in KLBJ 590 a few months ago with some state other
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.800]  state senators in the show right after me because beyond the belt ways syndicated
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.560]  show from Chicago was in Austin doing the show locally and so I believe the
[43:42.560 --> 43:46.120]  studio doing the syndicated show and in comes the next syndicated show and Kirk
[43:46.120 --> 43:52.120]  Watson saw me and turned white like like like like he had seen a 45 foot goblin
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.280]  and then he starts going oh Alex I really like you oh hi buddy hi shaking my
[43:56.280 --> 44:00.080]  hand because he knows I know what he's up to and I was like come on Watson how
[44:00.080 --> 44:09.160]  how's all that land you grab and he's all good I mean it's just incredible it's
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.800]  a good old boy network keep getting bigger yeah well let me tell you they
[44:12.800 --> 44:16.160]  know we know because let me tell you I walk out and he's there and he and
[44:16.160 --> 44:26.360]  literally went white I mean he thought I was gonna I don't know cuz I used to
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.440]  like follow him around and yell at him and stuff at city council meetings I was
[44:30.440 --> 44:33.760]  like how dare you steal this you know I'd have the poor rancher going our
[44:33.760 --> 44:39.560]  thousand acres we've had it since you know 1847 my great-great-grandpa my
[44:39.560 --> 44:44.800]  cemetery and and they're taking the land and paying me two cents on the dollar
[44:44.800 --> 44:54.440]  for it and no yeah and now it's luxury homes all right it's making more tax
[44:54.440 --> 45:00.160]  money for them they had a Supreme Court ruling a new London versus kilo mm-hmm
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.040]  and in that case they said if the Supreme Court said if private interests
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.000]  come in lobby and pay money to local officials to take your land it's legal
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.520]  they said open Roman style theft what about listen have you read the decision
[45:16.520 --> 45:21.800]  no it actually says that it says if it says if we decide something has a better
[45:21.800 --> 45:25.000]  economic aim even for private interest we're taking your land and it said
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.960]  they're allowed to give money to lobby to take your land well what'll be
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.000]  interesting to see is what what what this new ruling that Hillary Clinton
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.520]  supposedly signed this deal with China you can come in imminent domain it'll be
[45:38.520 --> 45:41.200]  interesting to see how they're gonna pull that well what's really happening
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.880]  is under the IMF and World Bank receivership that's why they're giving
[45:45.880 --> 45:49.640]  the Arabs all the ports and handing over whole highway systems to Spanish
[45:49.640 --> 45:52.760]  companies because that is collateralized and that's true
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.000]  hell Turner who always kind of exaggerates or spins things are you know a
[45:57.000 --> 46:01.400]  private company puts out on a marrow coin is a joke mm-hmm and then he comes
[46:01.400 --> 46:04.480]  out and says it's a real a marrow coin and then he's come out and he's kind of
[46:04.480 --> 46:10.080]  simplified it and said oh the Chinese you know have done this but but unlike his
[46:10.080 --> 46:16.520]  normal hoaxes it's almost true it's almost true that story yeah it's it's uh
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.520]  I mean it basically is true he just oversimplifies it and says it's China
[46:20.520 --> 46:23.520]  doing it and links to a Reuters article we're trying to say we want more
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.360]  guarantees on collateralization right and then Hillary meets in secret and they
[46:27.360 --> 46:34.840]  say okay so it's probably true yeah but again it's from him so know your
[46:34.840 --> 46:40.480]  neighbor yeah well we certainly know how he's quite an individual hey thanks for
[46:40.480 --> 46:44.920]  coming in here and I tell us about some of the guests that are coming up on the
[46:44.920 --> 46:49.360]  show today we got Richard C. Cook he's written a new article that he wants to
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.600]  talk about microvera is coming on monthly visit yeah through Skype and then we
[46:53.600 --> 46:58.680]  have a Dan Itza and Paul Ingritson coming up from New Hampshire they're

[47:02.320 --> 47:07.360]  for their HCR six I believe it is having a rally very close to passing it
[47:07.360 --> 47:10.800]  there they're very close right now this week to passing through the Senate in
[47:10.800 --> 47:15.160]  Oklahoma past the house it's now over 30 states have gotten on board with the
[47:15.160 --> 47:18.520]  sovereignty movement Oregon I've actually got a guy coming on Monday from

[47:36.760 --> 47:40.360]  to get these guys on and talking with them and it's really interesting because
[47:40.360 --> 47:44.640]  it's happening across America as we speak right now and now we're having
[47:44.640 --> 47:48.520]  tax revolts all over the country so so in the next few weeks we're gonna shift

[50:49.240 --> 50:54.080]  boss us around and say the police are spying on you to stop al-Qaeda not to
[50:54.080 --> 51:00.280]  protect us from our crimes I mean it's asinine arrest them all

[54:52.680 --> 54:58.160]  nests in our capitals the international crime syndicate known as the new world
[54:58.160 --> 55:05.680]  order I was on Karang radio out of London national radio in England yesterday
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.840]  for 45 minutes and the host came on I've been on the show many times and he said
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.680]  Alex I was driving down the road in London today and saw a huge yellow truck
[55:13.680 --> 55:18.720]  with info wars comm on the side are you paying for that and I said no and he
[55:18.720 --> 55:24.720]  kind of didn't believe it and people all over the world are seeing info wars
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.080]  dot com sprayed his graffiti on walls it's on cars it's on trucks it's in
[55:30.080 --> 55:34.600]  people's yards we get photos sent all the time from New Zealand and Russia and

[55:41.840 --> 55:46.440]  you know where people put up signs or carpet and rocks at waterfalls I mean
[55:46.440 --> 55:52.600]  it's just everywhere and we're just one little group in this fight it's just
[55:52.600 --> 55:59.320]  growing exponentially and I have to tell you all hype aside the Obama deception
[55:59.320 --> 56:06.480]  is the most powerful film I have ever made you know I I tend to say in game is
[56:06.480 --> 56:09.120]  the most powerful film I've ever made you know and before that terror storm was
[56:09.120 --> 56:11.240]  the most powerful because they just get better and better we get better at this
[56:11.240 --> 56:15.360]  we get more informed more knowledge more info more professional better
[56:15.360 --> 56:20.120]  equipment thanks to your support but this one just because of the hype of
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.360]  Obama it's going to go completely viral and the information is all just
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.400]  devastatingly accurate and hardcore all his lies is corruption the bankers
[56:29.400 --> 56:37.040]  agenda the new world order it shatters the left right paradigm it is 100 and
[56:37.040 --> 56:43.040]  10 minutes long so 10 minutes shy of two hours and then has 20 minutes of
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.240]  extras and a little Easter egg or two in there too but a few little hidden
[56:47.240 --> 56:56.480]  goodies just an amazing film is all I can say and I can't wait the cover has
[56:56.480 --> 57:04.120]  been sent off to be printed the film is been sent off to be mass produced this
[57:04.120 --> 57:13.280]  is very very very very exciting and to be in this position just everything I
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.320]  basically in my life I guess was building towards this point I mean I had
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.840]  no intentions I just want to get on the media and warn people locally that they
[57:22.840 --> 57:25.640]  were land grabbing that was my main reason for trying to get on air and they
[57:25.640 --> 57:28.200]  laugh at me in radio stations I was taking RTF they said you got to become an
[57:28.200 --> 57:32.040]  intern and basically wait 10 years to get on air and I'd call the talk shows
[57:32.040 --> 57:35.280]  they make fun of me when I'm trying to warn people and warning about gun
[57:35.280 --> 57:38.160]  legislation they restrict the second amendment so I went down and got an
[57:38.160 --> 57:41.880]  access TV show and literally ran the whole thing for several years by myself
[57:41.880 --> 57:45.840]  learned how to edit on a big real to real three-quarter inch tape learned how
[57:45.840 --> 57:51.480]  to splice tape learn how to cut tape and they had primitive stuff from like
[57:51.480 --> 57:58.200]  basically 1970s technology in the mid-1990s and so can you imagine when I
[57:58.200 --> 58:05.840]  discovered computers and got the money to buy computers what it was like and I
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.640]  would sit there and voice it over myself you know live on the tape as it was
[58:09.640 --> 58:13.760]  rolling over the video I would you know do a quick voiceover and then stay up
[58:13.760 --> 58:18.400]  all night long and you know make my first films and then I got the radio show
[58:18.400 --> 58:25.160]  and right at the time video was starting to go viral on the internet and we had
[58:25.160 --> 58:29.760]  some of the first viral videos I didn't know I was pioneering this new form of
[58:29.760 --> 58:33.560]  gonzo journalism of confronting politicians and then putting it on the
[58:33.560 --> 58:41.840]  web and it was we really trailblaze so much and it was all by accident thank

[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:10.200]  about the Obama deception this is an amazing film and my main message to you
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.840]  out there is it needs to go mega viral and that could only happen if you do it
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:19.360]  and it is the film to go viral it is probably gonna go viral without even
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:27.200]  too much of a push but I mean mega viral supernova viral as I call it but if you
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:32.480]  push it it's kind of like pushing a boulder downhill it's easier and you
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:35.440]  have more bang for the buck the more copies of the film you make from the
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:39.080]  DVD you get from us the more copies you burn off prisonplanet.tv the more
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:45.400]  people you give it to it's just gonna go absolutely completely insanely viral I
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.320]  can feel it in my bones I know it I mean I knew in game was gonna explode I knew
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:57.400]  terror storm was gonna explode I know that the Obama deception is going to be
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:02.880]  huge because it lays out all of Obama's lies it lays out his betrayal it lays out
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:06.560]  who controls him the new order agenda how the banks are taking over how they're
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:11.960]  making their move for world government this is a film that has to be seen

[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.480]  kernel of truth like an enzyme you can drop it ends you know tiny kernel of an
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:54.640]  enzyme into a you know chemistry test and it'll just neutralize and totally
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:01.440]  change the content of the entire beaker or tested and it's the same thing here I
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:05.640]  mean this sucker well that's why they call it viral because it's like a virus
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:10.920]  but it's a good virus I mean it's tiny man it just shoots out I mean holding

[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:50.840]  with us with your once a month visit aloha Alex thanks for having me on the
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:55.320]  show again good to have you here okay let's get into the economy first they
[1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:58.680]  won't tell us where the money is going in specifics they just say another 30
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:04.480]  billion to AIG well over 200 plus billion dollars their third bailout now
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:07.680]  they're saying it's nationalized but when you really look at it it's the
[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:13.480]  private central banks through the government are just basically taking the
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:16.440]  money and won't say where it's going but CBS News reported as you know last
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:20.760]  week 250 plus billion of the bailout money to all these companies is going to
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:25.680]  the Caimans now and they're literally going offshore with it made-offs family
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:30.480]  is run down to South America most the other bankers have been running to South
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:37.680]  America and to areas around the Pacific Ocean they're going to the Cook Islands
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:45.840]  and other places I mean to me it's just such a such a fraud to know their
[1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:49.400]  criminals to know criminals run the government to know Wall Street is run
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:53.400]  by crooks to know they're setting up a world government I mean it's so obvious
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:56.680]  they should all be arrested the new order should end but it's come out that
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:09:59.960]  bush did one in the first amendment America we saw those talking points in
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:03.360]  the news it's come out that Obama's lied about everything he said he would do
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:09.880]  and it they just continue forward but at the same time people are waking up I
[1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:13.320]  keep saying this but I mean it's exploding by the day now so can you
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:18.040]  speak to that yeah obviously you know Barack Obama's been this incredible
[1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:21.080]  disappointment he's starting to talk about going after the second amendment
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:26.120]  despite the US Supreme Court decision that the second amendment does confer an
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:30.600]  individual right to keep and bear arms to all American citizens and again my
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:34.480]  biggest gripe with Barack Obama right now is that he's still campaigning
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:38.480]  every day he's out there someplace else doing another speech and trying to rally
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:42.360]  support and cheer us on and that's all well and good for the campaign but he's
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:46.920]  got the job now and I'm wondering when is he going to start actually doing it
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:50.600]  because I know he's a wonderful public speaker but he's starting to give the
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:54.440]  impression that he's going out making all these rah-rah speeches and cheerleading
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:59.400]  because he has no other idea what to do now as far as the economy and the bailouts
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:03.720]  are concerned and everything it really it's a grand looting is what it is
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:07.320]  they're looting the American taxpayers they're looting the Treasury they're
[1:11:07.320 --> 1:11:10.600]  sticking it in their own pockets and they're making for the border and it is
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:15.000]  indeed very very obvious more and more people are waking up I got a very nice
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:18.640]  email from somebody I've known for many many years just this morning who said
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:22.240]  I thought you were a nutcase all those years ago and here you are you were
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:26.520]  absolutely correct and you know we're starting to see this all over the place
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:30.360]  I know I'm getting a lot more angry callers to my show and to my website
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:35.280]  people are indeed waking up now they've got to decide what are they going to do
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.280]  and more to the point it is obvious that the United States as we have known it to
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:42.960]  this point cannot survive much longer we need to start planning what are we
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:47.160]  going to do afterwards and meanwhile for thirty years but people pay attention to
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:52.080]  him in the last year I kept explaining to people folks even if Ron Paul doesn't
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:56.320]  win it's a victory because we create a massive buzz we educate the college
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:01.080]  students and adults everybody else during the debates that the private banks
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:04.880]  have an inflation tax they're scamming us derivatives are fraud they're going to
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.760]  inflate the currency he did that and now he's bigger than he was a year ago no
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:14.520]  one can ignore him everybody's waking up now through Ron Paul movement they're
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:19.160]  coming to us just as they went to him through us and he even said that on air
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:24.800]  that half his early support was from this show alone it's symbiotic and so now
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:29.600]  the hottest thing on the college campuses is true libertarian ideas anti-new
[1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:33.520]  ruler ideas and the establishment is openly saying they're starting to get
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:37.680]  scared and British newspapers yesterday said the British government is ready for
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:41.800]  martial law against the people if they try to remove the illegitimate
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:45.600]  government there they admit they're ready for martial law here but I talked
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:51.120]  to the troops and they're all waking up if the police are waking up that's
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.840]  absolutely true the bottom line is that the government by itself cannot impose
[1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:59.800]  a dictatorship they've lost the trust of the soldiers they've lost the trust of
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:03.520]  the law enforcement community they break basically broken trust with the entire
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:06.920]  American people and a government that has lost the trust of its people is a
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:11.240]  government that can no longer function I truly am convinced that the United
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:14.840]  States is going to go the way of the Soviet Union it is simply going to
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:19.680]  collapse from its own rot corruption and death and we seriously not mean to
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:23.080]  start thinking what are we going to do let's look at how the Russians handled
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.720]  the collapse of the USSR learned from their mistakes what did they do right
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:30.160]  let's do that what did they do wrong let's avoid that getting rid of the
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:34.200]  oligarchs yeah we need to look at that and and so forth I really do feel we're
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:37.760]  on the verge of this tremendous transition and yes you are right there
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.200]  are people who were trying to take advantage of this upset to impose their
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:45.400]  idea of what the new form of government should be we need to be ready to say no
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:50.760]  we're going to take it back to this constitutionally based system where the
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.200]  central federal government does not have all of this incredible power the
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:58.840]  states have the power and anything the states don't control we the people have
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:03.080]  our own sovereignty to take care of and to protect and to support micro vero
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:11.400]  joining us from hawaii live on the video of that present planet dot tv mic the
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:15.000]  message I want to get out to people is that the elite is not invincible they're
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.840]  not god they have a lot of fancy toys a lot of supercomputers to war game
[1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:23.560]  things out and they've wargamed it out and they see their new world order being
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:28.320]  defeated they know they have a very small window and I want listeners to
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:32.320]  understand you have affected change you have changed the destiny of the world
[1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:36.160]  we're in the fight now that doesn't mean we're winning but we're in the fight now
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.280]  you realize that your enemy is not invincible now at the same time we have
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:47.440]  other problems though as things implode the government will be the only group
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:52.880]  that supposedly has fiat money to put you know money on people's welfare cards
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.160]  on their food stamp cards you know a lot of government employees will be loyal
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.160]  just because they've got to have the job and the money for the house and I have
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:07.280]  the new story from bbc it was also another publications were basically in
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:13.440]  virginia counties are in one county taking fifty million dollars of taxpayer
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:21.800]  money and pledging it to sun trust bank to then have a lottery and give ninety
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:27.120]  plus thousand dollars free nine two thousand dollars to select county
[1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:33.480]  employees on top of other incentives to basically get houses that were repossessed
[1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:38.800]  from citizens for free yeah it's getting pretty absurd out there and more and
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:41.960]  more americans beginning to wake up and realize that your average government
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:46.520]  worker is paid considerably more for the same kind of work that's being done in
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:50.400]  the private sector something like a one-third gain plus additional guaranteed
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:55.440]  benefits all of it on the taxpayers back if you will and the american taxpayers
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:59.120]  are getting tired of working their lives away in order to support the government
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:03.400]  in a little in an elevated status and certainly now they're seeing the work of
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:07.400]  an entire lifetime dissolve as the government loots us to give the money
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:12.240]  to the wall street investment brokerages many of whom are now suspected of having
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:16.760]  gone bankrupt with these pyramid schemes that seem to have become the de facto
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:20.960]  substitution for actually manufacturing and selling products over the last thirty
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:28.040]  years well we have the stock market down by over fifty percent now below seven
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:34.360]  thousand as we speak that key psychological threshold and the government
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:37.320]  just accelerates the looting and stealing and thieving and is raising
[1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:43.000]  hundreds of new taxes eighty plus in new york state alone i mean don't they
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.760]  understand that the people just can't pay all this money
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:51.440]  apparently they don't i mean there's still reaching out there with their big
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:55.960]  grasping clause just into the herd trying to harvest a little bit more and
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.240]  they don't get it that we uh... that we just don't have it anymore there was an
[1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:04.480]  interesting uh... little video that was run on the daily show where congress was
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.480]  wasting its time talking about this bill to ban monkeys being sold across the
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:12.160]  border and in the middle of that one of the congressman's way you know all it
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:15.280]  takes is forty five thousand dollars and a phone call to ship a monkey from this
[1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:19.200]  part to this point and that was such a revealing statement because it proved
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:24.040]  that our congress is so elevated in wealth and status that to them forty five
[1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:26.920]  thousand dollars is is a trivial amount
[1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:29.800]  it was the phone call in forty five thousand and you get a monkey answer
[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:33.000]  don't they understand that forty five thousand dollars is more than most
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.680]  american families have to live on for an entire year it is not a trivial issue
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:41.280]  and therefore this is not really a matter of concern that people can pick up a
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:45.400]  phone and buy a monkey so why is our congress worrying so much about that
[1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:49.440]  when everything else is going wrong now obviously congress is busy itself with
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:53.640]  this kind of trivia because they don't know how to fix the big problems and
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:57.440]  this gets back to what i said about barack obama continuing to go out on
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:00.480]  the campaign trail even though he's already run the office people are
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:04.480]  starting to perceive that all of this speech making is a cover for the fact
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.760]  that the government absolutely doesn't know how to fix the economy it's going
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:12.280]  to continue to deteriorate and right now our corporate leadership in our
[1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:15.200]  governmental leadership they're getting this every man for the self-mentality
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:19.040]  they're going to grab as much as they can while we let them get away with us
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:23.200]  right when society when a society like mexico or north career whatever is
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:28.160]  collapsing always the looting accelerates and this is all by design we
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:33.080]  have their documents we know obama's job is to stall the public that he's going
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:38.240]  to fix things just long enough for the looting to be completed and then he's
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:41.880]  going to be basically a sacrificial goat politically you know they're going
[1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:45.880]  to kill him politically not physically by in front of everybody i mean that is
[1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:50.280]  the great betrayal that is the setup here that's being done and so that's why
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:54.120]  he goes out congress is having to you know do things like try to ban people

[1:23:53.920 --> 1:24:09.200]  I keep repeating it over and over again it's simple but the globalist are doing
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:18.560]  is so obviously criminal on the record so evil so classically tyrannical that
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:24.960]  all we have to do is get up and stand up and say no criminals no we are not
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:31.040]  going along with this now going back five years ago I said clearly there are
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:35.360]  talking points to say that protesting is illegal and police are being told this
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:38.920]  that's why police will dress up like anarchists and go out and attack other
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:42.320]  cops all across the United States they've been caught mainstream news the
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:46.000]  latest was Denver Denver post headlines the police admit they did it nobody gets
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.480]  in trouble attacking other cops the other cops didn't even know very dangerous
[1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:55.960]  and because they're told well the people protesting the war are protesting our
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:59.680]  fight against terror so they're helping terrorists so we're gonna you know to
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:03.080]  save America we're gonna violate the First Amendment and it's come out in
[1:25:03.080 --> 1:25:06.800]  these John you memos that they said we're getting around posse commentators
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.920]  claiming it's anti-terror and now they admit it's for the American people
[1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:13.960]  Obama's expanding that home you know brigade homeland all these headlines the
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:20.880]  army times they are you just just the battle plan is in these group of memos
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:24.280]  they're up on info wars dot com prison planet dot com also what really happened
[1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:30.920]  dot com Mike Rivera I have to say though that I'm this is the first good thing
[1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:36.280]  Obama's actually done now he's he's been protecting Bush on torture memos and
[1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:40.600]  secret arrest of memos and got a lot of heat for that he's keeping camps open
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:45.920]  he's backing Bush on no rights for detainees why do you think he's done
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:48.960]  this I know courts were ordering it to be released but Bush had been ignoring it
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:54.040]  I mean this is giving us a bone so I have to give credit words do this is the
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:26:00.560]  first thing I have seen him do that was good well sooner or later you know
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:04.960]  Obama has to realize he's got to start keeping some of his campaign promises in
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:08.960]  in some form or other I've taken to calling him our token president not
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:12.720]  because of his skin color but because so far the majority of everything he's
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:19.000]  done in line with his campaign promises have been token measures only closing
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.400]  Guantanamo yeah that's actually going to happen but the prisoners aren't being
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:25.800]  released they're not being apologized to they're just being sent someplace else
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:28.880]  where we can't see it they're not getting the process he said that yeah
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.640]  on the other camps yes and the same thing with Iraq he was going to end the
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:36.880]  war in Iraq while I'm bringing the troops home except for the fifty thousand
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:41.400]  we're going to leave there permanently and so I think already a high degree of
[1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:44.760]  mistrust is already beginning to build up around Barack Obama and I think at
[1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:48.040]  some point he's going to realize he's got to actually do something that looks
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.080]  positive for the American people or he's going to lose their support
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.840]  completely anything he's going to try and do that's right there are real
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:59.880]  revolts in the mid-level House members that have some subcommittee
[1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:05.160]  chairmanship going look Patriot Act torture lying about WMD's our
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:09.480]  constituents are saying we are going to be thrown out on our butts if we don't
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:14.600]  have hearings on Bush and those hearings could lead you know to to a to a
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:19.000]  real investigation and at least publicly more of the corruption can come out so
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.200]  that it can be exposed for what it was so at least it can be convicted in the
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:25.800]  court of public opinion so so I think that's what's forcing this is a
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.040]  rebellion within the Democrats thanks to the grassroots getting mad about what
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:34.160]  they're doing absolutely it all begins with the people getting angry and
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:38.080]  demanding action because you know it when they look at those windows and they
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:41.440]  see a million Americans who are getting angry and they realize they better do
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:45.440]  something because we're so close to a revolt right now what happened in in
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.600]  Iceland could happen here what's about to happen in Ireland could happen here
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.920]  what already did happen in Romania could happen here we're so close to the edge
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:58.360]  and the government knows it and they know that in a stand-up fight with the
[1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:01.040]  entire American people on one side and the government on the other the
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:04.720]  government's gonna lose and we're going to see a return that there'll be a
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:08.840]  revolution and a revolutionary tribunal and we will not be gentle on the on the
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:13.640]  those who destroyed our country well you're absolutely right you know I've
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:16.320]  been meaning for two weeks to play this I'm gonna play it coming up before you
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:21.320]  leave us a few weeks ago as you know Zbigniew Brzezinski was on MSNBC the
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:25.960]  morning Joe saying I'm concerned about riots I'm concerned about martial law
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.800]  you know I I'm concerned about the people going after the bankers as if he's
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:33.840]  not the guy behind it orchestrating much of it on record and then we also see
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:37.680]  Glenn Beck saying what do we do about the bubbles in their guns and the CIA guys
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:42.120]  on the show said let it come so there's also a danger in that we've seen big
[1:28:42.120 --> 1:28:45.920]  foundations the Ford Foundation and others not just have police provocaturing
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:51.120]  riots but actually staging violent events during demonstrations to demonize
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:56.600]  it and have a pretext to bring in martial law so I don't want riots but if we
[1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:59.720]  do have mass demonstrations which I do want I hope they're like more like
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:05.120]  Iceland where they're somewhat peaceful and where provocateurs are identified I
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:08.960]  would agree with that and like I said I am convinced that the ultimate fate of
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:12.840]  the United States is identical to that of the Soviet Union the people are just
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:15.200]  gonna quit trusting the government they're gonna quit doing as they're
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:18.800]  told they're gonna quit supporting and paying for it all and the government
[1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:22.680]  will simply collapse there'll be a period of confusion and we will create a new
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:26.960]  nation which will take care of our needs and not the needs of just the corporate
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:31.880]  wealthy and where it states rights and liberty in the Constitution Bill of
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:34.560]  Rights you know we're not really revolutionaries Mike we're restorationist

[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:38.640]  the establishment is counting on the public being totally ignorant and
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:43.880]  uninformed they're saying we're gonna set up a new bank of the world that will
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:48.120]  regulate the bad shadow banks this is what Gordon Brown saying her in the US
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.760]  right now and a few days ago ahead of his trip to the US and to set up a new
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:59.080]  world order with quote tighter regulations and I love how every day I
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:03.800]  see Rahm Emanuel on television saw him on Fox Sunday I see Obama and speeches
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:07.240]  saying we're gonna get tough on these banks and brokerage firms we're gonna
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:12.400]  go after the people that did this and then meanwhile it's literally Larry
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:19.680]  Summers and Geithner and the very crew that is in the White House now that made
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.200]  the changes in the 90s that allowed the banks to go from fractional reserve
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:28.080]  banking being able to have $1 and loan out 10 to just unlimited that's what
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:33.360]  that these Ponzi schemes were unlimited to buy up the world and then now they're
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:41.600]  imploding it to consolidate and you know Bush Clinton Obama they're all like
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:46.440]  people running a marathon handing off the batons but this plan were now under
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:51.720]  was initiated was planned in the 70s but initiated in the mid late 90s on record
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:56.920]  and in a micro very you've covered this for years what is it like to see them
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:02.000]  up there posing as the saviors and the arbiters of this to who are gonna be
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.680]  our guardians knowing that they are the very cats that did this well it's a
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:12.440]  common ploy of government to create a crisis and then sell us the solution
[1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:17.480]  and we've seen it repeated over and over and over again but there is no
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:22.080]  question that beginning with the Reagan presidency which is when the United
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:25.560]  States went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:30.880]  largest debtor nation that was the beginning of this process of bringing
[1:35:30.880 --> 1:35:35.160]  the United States to the edge of this collapse now the problem I think for the
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:38.840]  from the point of view of the globalists is that because of the
[1:35:38.840 --> 1:35:42.720]  alternative media your show my show in the websites the people of the world are
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:48.040]  aware that it is globalism that has turned an economic upset inside the
[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:52.480]  united states into a global problem and so this idea of selling more globalism
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:56.280]  is the solution that's going to be a very very tough sell and I don't think
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:00.480]  they can pull it off they're going to push as hard as they can to say yes
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:04.800]  more of the same as the solution to making everything better but already
[1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:08.000]  I'm seeing people just digging their heels in and saying no I want to be left
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.520]  alone I don't want another layer of economic experts living over me piled
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:17.360]  on to my back while I try and stagger through life I want you to just go away
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:21.880]  let me grow my food take care of my family and you know go someplace else go
[1:36:21.880 --> 1:36:25.960]  bother some other people I think we're going to see very much and as much
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:32.480]  stronger anti-globalist backlash begin to take root well we saw a thousand to one
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:36.000]  according to Congress phone calls against the banker takeover bill known as the
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:41.440]  maker bailout we saw more people for the quotey economic stimulus because they
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:44.320]  thought it was for the public but it was still only about being on a poll 10 to
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:48.720]  15 percent that supported that you get upwards of 90 percent in Gallup polls that
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:51.520]  want to control the borders but the establishment won't do that upwards of
[1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:54.640]  80 percent against the wars but the establishment just continues that I mean
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:58.760]  really it's not just the trust that's been broken there is no illusion now
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:02.240]  with anybody I talked to out there no matter what they claim their political
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:05.920]  ideology is that the establishment is representing the people of the bill of
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:10.760]  rights or constitution I mean this is a rogue government in every sense but
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:14.520]  but specifically Mike how do you see this collapsing and how do you see this
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:19.520]  unwinding and unraveling I mean I mean I agree with you that it's going into
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:23.160]  collapse but they want to have a control collapse where they collapse it all down
[1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:27.720]  and scoop it up but I do see it not going well for them I think they've
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:31.720]  overreached here but they've programmed the Christian churches that whenever
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:34.960]  government corruption happens it's the antichrist in the end of the world and
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:38.520]  so lay down to the face scanning cameras the national ID card the thumb
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  prints to buy and sell it's the end of the world when clearly it's not and
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.320]  regardless it's our job to fight evil so the infiltration of the churches I see
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:51.880]  that as one of the biggest problems so a how do you see this unwinding and I mean
[1:37:51.880 --> 1:37:56.480]  break it down in your minds I want your perspective and then be do you get the
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:00.400]  point I'm making about how the biggest block out there of my fellow Christians
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:04.320]  just sit around go and praise God the police states here Jesus is about to
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.520]  come back yeah that is a big big problem the religious mythologies of this
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:13.200]  country have been exploited not only by our own government by the government of
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:17.680]  Israel as well and people have been trained from birth don't do anything
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.400]  don't fight back just stay on your knees clasp your hands together and pray and
[1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:26.080]  God will make it all better in the end obviously that is not happening as far
[1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:29.480]  as the US government I you know we're heading toward a point where somebody's
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:32.840]  going to default on something they're already talking about a US default
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:35.720]  they're talking about losing the triple a credit rating of the United States
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:41.080]  government at some point if the American people simply stop cooperating like
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:46.040]  Gandhi did peaceful non-cooperation we stop paying into the system we send out
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:51.400]  a message no we will not be the guarantor of any future investments in the
[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.800]  United States that's what all these bailouts are that's what the SNL bailout
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:59.000]  in the 1980s was was the US government proving that they could trick the
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.840]  American taxpayer into making up for investments in the US that didn't work
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:06.480]  out the instant we can put out the message saying no we're not going to pay
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:09.840]  for that anymore then all those foreign investors they're going to start pulling
[1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:13.560]  their money out all at once and that is when we're going to have a real run on
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:16.880]  the American economy and it's all going to come down and drag the US government
[1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:21.360]  with it it has to happen the only question is when well it's like Russell
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:24.760]  means that American leaders said here they're letting us down easy though I
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.440]  mean people think this is harsh but they're just incrementally dropping the
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:31.160]  stock market they'll jack it back up probably again and then drop it down
[1:39:31.160 --> 1:39:35.240]  even further I'd probably go back up to 8,000 again and then race down to 5,000
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.960]  and go up to 9,000 race down to 3,000 I mean this is happening it's gone below
[1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:45.520]  7,000 everything Bob Chapman and others have been saying is true and you know
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:50.040]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who was the head of policy at the Treasury under Reagan
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:53.720]  who decried Bush has now come out and said in editorials he's coming on to
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:58.400]  Mara he's now come out and said look I'm sorry it looks like Obama is even
[1:39:58.400 --> 1:40:02.920]  worse than Bush because he's able to con the public and sucker at least one
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:08.080]  portion of the population to go along with this well that is true for the
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:11.840]  moment but again I think public confidence and trust in Obama is
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:15.320]  definitely eroding already and if anything if you look back at the first
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:20.360]  year of Bush's administration I think he actually kept the trust of the American
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.000]  people for a little bit longer I think it's happening faster with Barack Obama
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.120]  and that is because the American people are far more skeptical they're far less
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:32.160]  trusting and I think that's due to you and I and the other GCN hosts and the
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:37.960]  blog the blogosphere in general and I think Barack Obama now that he's got
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:41.320]  the job they're saying you know it's time to prove that you know how to do the
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:46.040]  job you said you did and he's coming up short time and time again and one token
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:52.960]  give to the American people on on one of these court cases is not going to make
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.840]  up for the fact that the economy does continue to deteriorate and everything
[1:40:56.840 --> 1:41:01.640]  Obama is doing is of the same ilk as bush which is we're going to take
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:05.000]  trillions of dollars in the American people and give it to the banks we've
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:09.720]  finally gotten more numbers first the FBI was saying that in the last two
[1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:16.320]  months of last year gun sales total were up by forty four percent over the
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:19.760]  previous record because they have the instant check where they call in to
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:23.360]  register you as a gun owner and basically what type of gun you've got now
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:27.680]  they're saying it's up over a hundred percent guns are sold out many places
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:32.120]  many calibers of ammo were sold out what does Obama do he's got his attorney
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:35.240]  general come out and say yeah we're gonna introduce a soul weapons ban but
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.960]  tag on to it physically banning the guns not just the sale of them anymore but
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:42.880]  physically having them and we're going to make you have psychological testing
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:47.520]  federal registration federal licensing and then gun sales exploded even more I
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:54.080]  mean don't they understand that the people are on to them apparently not
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:57.960]  and one of the big problems I think when you have a too large government or a
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:02.280]  too large corporation is the people at the top are sitting on layer after layer
[1:42:02.280 --> 1:42:07.520]  after layer of these mid managers whose own jobs depend on making sure that bad
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:11.280]  information does not pass either going up or going down they don't want this
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:15.040]  abordinates to give up hope they don't want the superiors to crack down so I
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:19.600]  think the real danger here is that people at Barack Obama's level or CEO
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:24.040]  levels they really are very disconnected with what's going on on the streets of
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:27.920]  America and I think the proof of that is that they really do seem to not
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.320]  understand that we are not being fooled by any of this stuff anymore they're
[1:42:32.320 --> 1:42:36.000]  still out there trying to push this war in Iran with this idea that Iran is on
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.600]  the verge of building nuclear weapons and somebody really thinks we're stupid
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:45.640]  enough to fall for this a second time in a row but the good news is in the lead
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:50.320]  up to the Iraq war in 2001 2002 into March of 2003 we're about to have the
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:55.080]  anniversary of six years of mass murder and occupation and a million three
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:00.240]  hundred thousand according to lands at very credible sorts dead and Ron Paul
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:04.400]  goes to the CPAC conservative function says we killed over a million Iraqis
[1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:07.920]  says it's wrong says the troops gave me more money than any other candidate in
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.640]  both parties and they cheer him so that shows the illusion that conservatives
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:19.120]  are all for war is another fraud so so so fraud after fraud is being exposed
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:25.840]  here but yes they had that that admiral Saturday on CNN say Iran has the material
[1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:29.600]  to make nukes and is making them and then CNN had to retract AFP had to
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:33.920]  retract and say he says they might have it and they retracted again and said
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:38.440]  well they're not sure even if they might have it so so they're being forced to
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:43.800]  retract now whereas before they claim he had rail guns and he had EMP weapons
[1:43:43.800 --> 1:43:48.360]  that would destroy all electronics and put us in the dark age and you know he
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:51.640]  had all these super weapons and they're trying the same thing with Iran they've
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:55.280]  got super weapon drones and they've got super weapon nukes and they've got
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:00.480]  super you know Mars based alien technology on being sarcastic and it's
[1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:06.000]  not working no it isn't but the fact that they keep trying it either they
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.480]  simply have no choice but to continue to perpetuate this war or they really do
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:13.920]  think the American people are that stupid pop possibly it's a combination of
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:17.920]  the two but the reality is that the United States had an economic crash in
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:21.520]  1904 that it didn't get out of until it got into World War one we had the crash
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:24.920]  of 29 which we didn't get out of until we had the World War two we've had the
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:29.040]  crash of 2008 and I think the conventional wisdom in Washington DC is
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:33.400]  that the only way they can survive and perpetuate their power is to start a
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:38.360]  new major global war on the assumption and we know what assume means that the
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:41.480]  American people will forget all about the lies and all about the torture and
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:44.760]  all about the loss of our freedoms and all about the economic troubles and we'll
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:48.400]  line up behind the flag and we'll salute as we march our kids off to yet
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:52.520]  another war in the desert let's go ahead and play this is a big near
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:55.760]  brzezinski clip where he's acting like the good guy and I'm seeing them all do
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:58.920]  this all the bankers are so evil I'm worried what the people are going to do
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:03.720]  meanwhile they've engineered this whole thing here it is
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:08.160]  we've been talking about the disappearance of the middle class
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:12.600]  something you've been concerned about but you also talk about the possibility
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:19.160]  of class conflict let's you know I was not worrying about it because look we're
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:24.320]  gonna have millions and millions of unemployed people really facing dire
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:29.520]  straits and we're going to be having that for some period of time before things
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:35.000]  hopefully improve and at the same time there is this public awareness of this
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:40.400]  extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few individuals at
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:46.920]  levels without historical precedent in America people who made billions of
[1:45:46.920 --> 1:45:51.400]  dollars millions of dollars in a short period of time I sort of collected some
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:55.640]  figures on this I mean they're really kind of staggering and you sort of say
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:59.200]  to yourself what's going to happen in this society when these people are
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.400]  without jobs when their families hurt when they lose their homes and so forth
[1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:09.040]  we have the government trying to repair repair the banking system to build the
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:14.640]  housing out what about the rich class where is it what is it doing it's so
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:20.600]  struck me that in 1907 when we had a massive banking crisis when banks were
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:25.040]  beginning to collapse they're going to be riots on the streets some financiers
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:31.320]  led by JP Morgan got together he locked them in his library at one point
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:37.560]  he wouldn't let them out till 4 45 a.m. until they all kicked in and gave some
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:42.360]  money to stabilize the banks there was no federal reserve system at the time
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:46.560]  where is the money class today why aren't they doing something the people who
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:53.440]  made billions millions after thinking of Paulson of Ruben why don't they get
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:47:01.920]  together and why don't they organize a national solidarity fund in which they
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:06.560]  call upon all those who made these extraordinary amounts of money now let's
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:10.080]  stop there's some back in what's happening here is when you hear the big
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:15.720]  central bankers saying we want to shut down shadow banking it's the same thing
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:19.240]  you see in Mexico where the big drug cartels of the government are waging
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:22.760]  war against the medium-sized and small ones to consolidate that's what's
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:26.720]  happening the mega bankers some of these brokerage heads made one guy made three
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:31.160]  billion dollars in two years and a one president of a brokerage firm and that's
[1:47:31.160 --> 1:47:36.880]  mass theft they know what they're doing and so now they're gonna pose and say
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:39.560]  look we're you know we gave two hundred and something million dollars to the
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.960]  American people fifteen dollars every two weeks of course we stole nine point
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:46.080]  seven trillion so they are doing that so this shows they're scared though that
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:50.320]  they're already positioning themselves that oh we want to help you but we want
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:54.680]  to get these millionaires as if millionaires have anything to do with
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:48:01.680]  this this this is brzezinski actually hyping up class warfare micro vero yeah
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:07.480]  absolutely you know we're hearing all of these attempts to scapegoat different
[1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:10.960]  groups for what's going on like the subprime mortgage borrowers and this
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:16.280]  idea what what brzezinski is attempting to do is shift the burden away from the
[1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:20.000]  government which ultimately manages everything and say well it's up to the
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.200]  rich people to fix it since they benefited from it but that's you know
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:27.200]  obviously not true because government makes far more money off the American
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:31.520]  people than any rich individuals do and yes we may talk about these brokerage
[1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:35.080]  CEOs who became billionaires in the space of a few years because of the
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:38.800]  derivatives games going on but look at how much money the government takes from
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:44.800]  us and what brzezinski is talking about is the private banker equivalent of the
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:48.640]  u.s. government stimulus check they're going to take twenty thousand dollars
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:51.880]  from each of us this year in taxes and they're going to send us back a thousand
[1:48:51.880 --> 1:48:56.000]  bucks and hope that makes everything okay and for most americans it really
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.800]  doesn't we're all taxed way too much we're all losing too much money to this
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:05.440]  financial system which is by design set up to extract real well all of us well
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:10.680]  obviously you never hear them talk about let's arrest all these people let's
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:15.680]  charge them let's nationalize the private federal reserve instead it's the
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:18.840]  private federal reserve they're still saying it's private let's have it
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:22.840]  nationalize everything that's a trick because it's private it's really them
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:28.280]  hijacking everything yeah and they've been doing it since 1913 and the problem
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:32.160]  with the federal reserve system and any debt based monetary system is the
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:37.080]  instant it goes into effect more money is owed than actually exists and that's
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:41.240]  a big reason we're in so much trouble right now because on paper all these
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:46.040]  trillions of dollars are owed it doesn't exist anywhere there's no place from
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:50.120]  which to get it to pay off the debts and that is why the government is
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  scrambling to simply harvest as much cash as it can from the american people
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:59.560]  to make up these bookkeeping entries in these various corporate well really
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:02.440]  doing that they're just shoveling the money offshore to their own private
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:06.560]  islands might we come back i want to specifically get into the fact that we've
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:10.720]  already had the collapse happen as bad as things are you know if we weren't in
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:13.960]  this artificial economy they couldn't just flip the money off like a light
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.120]  switch in the whole country grinds to a halt i mean that you know only third
[1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:22.560]  world one crop economy should behave like that this is a multi-crop economy
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:27.640]  and it's falling apart by design i want to talk to you about how you see this
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:30.880]  i already brought this question up and i want you to specifically speak on it in
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.960]  detail how you see the breakdown happening on the bad side if we don't
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:39.160]  get involved and take action and fill that power vacuum or how it will happen
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:42.720]  on the good side and ideas you've got for solutions we're talking to michael

[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:36.120]  keep spreading the word about the show okay mike how do you see this unfolding
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:39.400]  because the public's now finding out and is going to find out more more of the
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:44.040]  next few months that it was all a fraud that it's only going to get worse and
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:49.400]  that the army standing by for martial law what do you see happening
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:55.840]  so breaking point rapidly approaching there too many people out of work too
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:59.560]  many local and state governments are simply running out of money at the
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:03.160]  federal reserve cannot go on just printing up new money to pour it on to
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:06.280]  the uh... bankers and i know they're treating it like a loan in the
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:11.000]  expectation is will somehow all pay it back but in the immediate future this is
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:14.240]  going to trigger hyperinflation we're already seeing prices start to really
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:18.840]  shoot up uh... interest at the uh... supermarket and the gas station and at
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:22.480]  some point somebody is not going to be able to pay their bills we're already
[1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:26.960]  seeing it in california we're already seeing it in several sections of the
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:31.080]  federal government states are getting by right now by canceling certain programs
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:35.480]  and transferring funds and moving around to cover the shortfall but the big
[1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:40.400]  failing is there's no new money coming in there's no real wealth coming into the
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:44.120]  system we're not exporting products in fact our manufacturing
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:48.080]  it continues to just absolutely plummet right now we've got nothing to sell and
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.520]  nobody wants to buy it from us and uh... hillary clinton is running around
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:55.440]  the world right now trying to convince other countries to go on buying our
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:58.640]  debt and these other countries are starting to wonder will it ever be
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:03.040]  repaid and so at some point the whole financial system has to come crashing
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:09.920]  down and at that point we're going to see a wide diverse group of uh...
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:14.440]  opportunists carpetbaggers if you will each of whom is going to try and create
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:18.880]  in the aftermath of the crash what they see as most advantages to their own
[1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:22.600]  interest as we move forward the people behind the federal reserve they'll be
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:26.360]  floating their frontman to try and say yes we need a new government and it's
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.960]  got to be formed this way and it'll go back and forth and what we the people
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:35.520]  have to do is really think about the kind of country that we want to take the
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:39.960]  place of the collapsed united states of america and certainly be on our guard
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:43.640]  against those opportunists who are going to try and force something new on us in
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:47.800]  the heat and rush of the moment and that is really the biggest danger is that
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:51.400]  the american people who are so used to living with the government that they've
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:54.720]  got to have one no matter what they'll grab the first thing that's offered to
[1:56:54.720 --> 1:56:59.240]  them gratefully and that is the real danger right there
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:01.840]  are you at the nail on the head as they say
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:05.160]  i mean we know what their new plan is they set this up they imploded their new
[1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:09.080]  plan is a world government run by private banks that we pay carbon taxes
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:13.360]  and money transfer taxes to in the tens of trillions every year
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:15.080]  that will further
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:19.120]  strangle industry that isn't controlled by them they will then selectively
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:21.720]  enforce the carbon taxes are openly saying
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:24.880]  that they're going to do that we have to stop them or they're going to take a
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:29.320]  horrible situation to turn into something far worse
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:32.720]  and that's absolutely true because of the one thing when you get people who are
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:35.280]  infected with the sickness of greed
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:39.360]  and they stopped seeing their fellow human beings as fellow human beings and
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:41.800]  they become simply objects on a balance sheet
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:43.720]  to be harvested exploited
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:47.680]  there is no limit to what they will do as long as they're able to get away with
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:48.040]  it
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:52.200]  ultimately this is why we have revolutions because the ruling party of a
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:56.560]  given country will push the people past the point of tolerance and there's
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:00.200]  always going to be a backlash and i think there's going to be one coming i'm
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:02.440]  hoping it will be very small and minimal
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:06.080]  uh... and and again i really do think that ultimately what's going to happen
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:09.880]  is the government of the united states is simply going to collapse in on itself
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:13.920]  the way the ussr did and we've got to be ready at the state level to make sure
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:17.600]  it isn't an international takeover during that revolution
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:20.400]  it said it needs to be the american people taking the country back
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:22.040]  and reconstituting it
[1:58:22.040 --> 1:58:26.320]  uh... yet again very well said mike revero we always enjoy having you on
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:30.040]  once a month here with us and thank you so much for joining us

[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:39.680]  richard c cook is our guest for the next hour he's an economic historian
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:42.800]  he has written for some of the largest publications
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:44.880]  in the country
[2:00:44.880 --> 2:00:47.680]  he has a consultant for nasa
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:52.400]  and we are really honored to have him on with us today also writes for a lot of
[2:00:52.400 --> 2:00:54.280]  big publications like global
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:57.960]  research and uh... i want to get him on because we have him on two three years
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:00:59.760]  ago he predicted a lot of what
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:01.960]  is now unfolding
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:05.600]  he understands from the establishments own documents their own admissions that
[2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:07.080]  they are engineering
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:10.000]  a world economic implosion over a year ago on the show
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.320]  he concurred with my analysis and added to it
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.560]  that they were going to blow the economy that announced a new bank of the world
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:18.640]  with carbon taxes paid to them
[2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:21.240]  so use the crisis they created to bring in even more control
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:24.600]  i want him to flesh out the the basic background of this and then get into
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.520]  what's currently happening
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:30.040]  uh... with his prognosis of how serious things are currently
[2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:33.400]  and how bad they are going to get and people say well we know how bad they are
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.600]  right now know you don't
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:38.500]  i know a lot of us you know it it's hard to gauge
[2:01:38.500 --> 2:01:41.920]  different sectors of the economy in the u s worldwide
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:44.280]  how fast this is going downhill
[2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:46.680]  uh... you know it's uh... it's a recession when your neighbors out of
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:48.560]  work is a depression when you're out of work
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:51.640]  i believe we're really officially in a depression right now in the economist
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:52.640]  magazine
[2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:54.480]  with their economists have come out and said that
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:56.860]  so richard c cook right down here with us
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:01:58.520]  thanks alex good to be here
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:01:59.320]  you bet
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:02.320]  uh... you've got the floor right now what we're
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:06.680]  facing right now what's really happening
[2:02:06.680 --> 2:02:08.080]  it's collapsing
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:11.680]  and uh... the bottom is not uh... in sight
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:16.640]  i was at a conference over the weekend uh... in new york it was uh... the
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:21.040]  annual conference of the eastern economic association
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:22.400]  and one of the uh...
[2:02:22.400 --> 2:02:26.680]  big name economist paul krugman who's the uh... incoming president of uh... the
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:29.800]  eastern and economic association spoke
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:34.200]  he said it's uh... of great depression scale right now
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.400]  there was another uh... speaker there you you may have heard of him his name is
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:40.960]  henry lou he's the publisher of asia times
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:44.080]  and he looks at it from the perspective of china in the asian
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:45.280]  economies
[2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:49.760]  he came up with an interesting statistic uh... two years ago
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  the total valuation
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:54.800]  of all of the assets in the world
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:58.640]  was approximately sixty trillion dollars
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:01.040]  today two years later it's
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.840]  approximately thirty trillion dollars
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:09.520]  so half the value of the entire world economy has disappeared
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:12.800]  in two years and it's still going down
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:16.640]  uh... the bottom has not yet been seen
[2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:21.000]  to me one of the most interesting facts about this is that if you really think
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:22.120]  about it
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:23.600]  the ability
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:26.320]  of the producing economy of the world
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:28.560]  to produce goods and services
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:31.600]  has not changed it has not decreased in fact
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:36.280]  the ability of the world economy to produce constantly increases because of
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:38.360]  technology because of the
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:42.480]  uh... growth of knowledge because of the growth of efficiency and as we've
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:45.560]  seen in the u.s. from the productivity data
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:48.360]  the growth of productivity of
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.400]  the economy uh... even though people's wages are stagnant
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:56.760]  even though people's portfolios are collapsing the stock market is collapsing
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:59.880]  the derivative market is called every market is collapsing
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:03.400]  and yet the producing economy continues to grow so
[2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:07.560]  why is there this contradiction that's what nobody has figured out
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:09.920]  and that's where we really have to focus
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:12.360]  well we know we'll come back and talk about this
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:15.600]  the parasitic banking economy has now become about thirty percent of the real
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:16.520]  economy
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:19.000]  they've created the ponzi schemes
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:23.160]  and many economists say over a thousand trillion or one quadrillion
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:26.840]  they credit the tsunami of fiat currency
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:29.440]  and uh... credit
[2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:33.640]  and so they want to implode the world economy so they can consolidate it all
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:37.800]  this is a financial coup d'etat against the planet
[2:04:37.800 --> 2:04:40.200]  we'll get richard ccooks take on that
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:43.160]  on the other side of this quick break

[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:21.280]  five minutes when you're on with us so briefly recap what you were saying and
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:25.360]  then go into what's really developing what's really happening right now with
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:30.920]  this depression levels the thing that is taking place worldwide well let me let me
[2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:36.960]  plug my website first www.richardsccook.com I've got a couple new
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:42.800]  articles up there just this past week one I call the last picture show which is
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:49.080]  the name I use for the new Obama administration budget but basically what
[2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:55.680]  we have seen is a complete collapse in the value the nominal value the the paper
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:11:01.560]  value if you will of all world assets I mentioned that I was at a conference of
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:05.560]  the Eastern Economic Association over the weekend and the figure was put out
[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:10.880]  there the two years ago the total valuation of all of the assets in the
[2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:16.200]  world this is everything everything of tangible value the price on it at that
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:22.800]  time was sixty trillion dollars approximately today the total is under
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.720]  thirty trillion dollars and falling in the bottom has not been seen yet so what
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:34.840]  we're seeing is not the disappearance of things of value we're not seeing the
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:40.440]  disappearance of the ability of the producing economy to produce goods and
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:44.600]  services what we're seeing is a collapse of the price system we're seeing a
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:50.760]  deflation of a bubble a series of bubbles that has been constructed by the
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:56.440]  World Banking System really over the last well it goes back 30 40 years in its
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:12:00.840]  entire history even further if you want to look at the start of the Federal
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:05.480]  Reserve System but it's been in the last 10 years when the bubbles have really
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:11.960]  just gotten totally out of control and it's been the banking system with the
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:17.080]  Federal Reserve every step of the way enabling this to create this enormous
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:21.080]  bubble that's not collapsed so again it's not the ability of the world
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:27.120]  economy to produce what we need to live it's the financial aspects of it the
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:30.800]  bubble aspects of it that we're seeing collapse and that's still on its way
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:39.520]  down and as you say we've got talk about the world financial organizations the
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:44.960]  big ones particularly the ones in Europe ready to step in now and put
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:50.280]  together a world financial order that is going to take control of all the
[2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:53.960]  economies of the world through the international banking system so all of
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:58.280]  that is going on right now let me just read your bio to folks I forgot to do
[2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:01.520]  that earlier Richard C. Cook is a former U.S. federal government analyst his
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:04.640]  career included service with the U.S. Civil Service Commission the Food and
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:07.920]  Drug Administration the Carter White House and NASA and the U.S. Treasury
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:12.800]  Department his articles on economics politics and space policy have appeared
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:17.200]  on numerous websites his book of the monetary reform entitled we hold these
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:22.360]  truths the promise of monetary reform is in preparation he is the author of
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:26.240]  Challenger revealed an insider account of how the Reagan administration caused
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:30.200]  the greatest tragedy of the space age called by one rather the most important
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:35.800]  space flight book the last 20 years is website Richard C. Cook dot com Richard
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:42.080]  specifically though if you have private banks engineering the collapse so they
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:48.200]  can consolidate things and from passenger views I know you agree with that it we
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:51.720]  need to then expose the fact that they are not just criminals creating Ponzi
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:57.600]  schemes through governments and private means but that they need to be arrested
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:05.440]  not now poses the world's saviors and we've seen them with the banker bailout
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:08.560]  of October 3rd saying we're gonna have a depression if you don't do this then
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:11.920]  with holding the money for the subprime mortgages and saying we won't say where
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:16.200]  it was spent Bloomberg reporting 9.7 trillion taken as you just said that's
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:22.360]  a third of all the world's real assets I mean quantify this because you know they
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:25.960]  keep expecting good news from Obama or for Geithner to say what they're going
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.040]  to do but they never tell anybody what they're going to do they only bad mouth
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:33.720]  and talk about nationalization of the banks to drive them down even further
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:39.280]  that a further destroy confidence is this not premeditated economic terrorism to
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:42.920]  create a global fire sale where they're the only ones with liquidity left to buy
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:50.280]  it up well that's how the banking system traditionally has worked if you go back
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:55.120]  in history and you see the history of the panics that occurred leading up to
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.160]  the Federal Reserve system that's what the banks did they would call in their
[2:14:59.160 --> 2:15:03.560]  loans it would collapse the currency collapse the the economy and then they
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:08.560]  would step in to buy assets for pennies on the dollar exactly the same thing
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:12.680]  happened with the Great Depression the Great Depression was an engineered event
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:18.040]  it was not something that just happened the banks built the bubbles of the 1920s
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:24.160]  and then when the bubbles were fully ripe they stepped in and they pulled
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:30.040]  back on the margin lending requirements and collapsed the economy at that time
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:33.680]  and then they stepped in and made huge fortunes by buying everything they could
[2:15:33.680 --> 2:15:39.200]  in the 1930s we're now seeing the same thing and in fact when I started writing
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:44.840]  about this two years ago the first article in the series I wrote came out
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:51.520]  in June of 2007 and it was the title was it's official the collapse of the US
[2:15:51.520 --> 2:15:55.840]  economy has begun because I saw at that time what they were saying about the
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:16:00.160]  extraordinary debt levels compared to equity in businesses was a disaster
[2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:05.360]  waiting to happen and then you had the Federal Reserve deliberately ratcheting
[2:16:05.360 --> 2:16:09.520]  down the interest rates that it had raised only two years previously to
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:13.440]  create the housing bubble now they stepped in and they destroyed the
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:18.720]  housing bubble by their interest rate policies and I quoted at that time the
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:26.720]  CEO of Carlisle the equity firm that the Bush family was so closely involved
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:31.400]  with and what he was saying was he was sending out a notice to all of his
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:35.520]  branches and he was saying keep your eyes open because what we're going to
[2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:40.560]  have after this thing collapses is the buying opportunity of a generation
[2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:47.240]  because everything is going to be dirt cheap so you know the government says
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:52.280]  well we've got to support the collapse of housing prices for example and yet
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:56.640]  it's these pricing collapses that makes everything ripe for the big banks to
[2:16:56.640 --> 2:17:02.720]  pick up assets and for fire sale prices and so it's just ripe for a tremendous
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:07.200]  consolidation of world wealth well we know that we're seeing we know that
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:13.120]  Frank Carlucci and other people with the car law group back in the 80s into
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:17.960]  1990 they put out bad news about defense they said it was all over a lot of it
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:21.240]  went very close to bankrupting or did bankrupt and they bought it all up for
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:25.280]  pennies on the dollar then started the Iraq war through their client Saddam who
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:28.800]  they set up and then the prices ballooned right after they'd had that
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:34.320]  vertical integration so that was a mini version of what we see now that's
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:39.040]  correct and I'm working on this video that I'm going to make later on this
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:44.600]  month where I go back in American history and if you go back say to Thomas
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:49.880]  Jefferson for example or James Madison early presidents who understood the
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:55.520]  banking system what they warn about is the ability of the banks to produce
[2:17:55.520 --> 2:18:02.040]  inflation followed by deflation because with inflation they make tremendous
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:07.040]  profits because of the interest rates and the compound interest they charge on
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.680]  the inflating economy then when the inflation has gone as far as it can go
[2:18:12.680 --> 2:18:17.600]  they pull back credit they constrict credit and that causes a crash of prices
[2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:22.400]  that causes a deflation when the deflation occurs they're able then to
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:28.040]  step in and buy up assets very cheaply and we are seeing now the biggest
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:33.080]  deflation in world history at least as far as we can detect when we come back
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:36.560]  I'll pull up the famous Thomas Jefferson quote but they're all similar about if
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:40.320]  we ever allow private banks to take control the money power first through
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:44.000]  inflation then through deflation they will completely enslave everybody and
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:47.960]  and we will wake up slaves on the continent our forebears conquered you
[2:18:47.960 --> 2:18:51.200]  know that's basically a paraphrase because they've done this in Europe over
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:55.560]  and over again they were trying to set that up here the word Jefferson uses
[2:18:55.560 --> 2:19:00.400]  is very instructive he says we will wake up homeless on the continent our
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:03.920]  father's conquered homeless he was talking about the housing bubble wasn't
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:09.200]  he because this is how they ruled Europe I mean the Rothschilds in 1815
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:12.600]  went in and panicked them saying Napoleon had won and bought it all up as
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:17.040]  well it's just it's constant the odd they go it was their goal and this was
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:21.240]  even put out in writing by the American Bankers Association somewhere in the
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:28.320]  late 1800s the goal is to reduce the American population to renters they
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:33.880]  recognize the people who own their homes are people who have some pride who
[2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:39.120]  have assets of their own who have independence so take away their homes
[2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:44.040]  their property and leave them so poor they can only rent then you can control

[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:41.240]  live here is a quote by US founding father drafted the Declaration of
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:46.840]  Independence 3rd US president in 1802 in a letter to then secretary of the
[2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:54.040]  Treasury Albert Galatin he said we've got it up on screen right now for
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:24:57.640]  prison planet TV viewers by the way this quote is in the Obama deception to
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:01.080]  give you an idea how to things this film covers if the American people ever
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:04.400]  allow private banks to control the issuance of their money first by
[2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:07.520]  inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up
[2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:12.240]  around them will deprive the people of their property until the children wake
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:16.440]  up until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:23.080]  conquered homeless this has been done over and over again and for maybe 50
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:28.200]  years 60 years maximum the the the founders and then Andrew Jackson the
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:30.840]  fruit of the founders and he fought the Revolutionary War when he was 12 and
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:35.680]  13 they knew the game plan and on his deathbed Andrew Jackson said what's what
[2:25:35.680 --> 2:25:38.760]  are you most proud of he said I killed the bank you should read his a final
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:46.920]  address that half a century of somewhat economic freedom made us what we are
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:51.160]  today that's what allowed us to grow in the foreign banks wrote in the times of
[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:54.440]  London we can't allow what's happening in America the world's figuring out the
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:58.160]  scam we run you know we've got to shut them down and they try to kill Andrew
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:03.040]  Jackson and others going back to Richard C. Cook any comments on what on that
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:06.960]  quote I was just covering and then now that we know they're doing this from
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:10.400]  studying the architecture of the world banking system they're setting up what
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:13.440]  is this thing gonna look like if they succeed with the carbon taxes and all
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  the controls versus how do we defeat them well those are those are great
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:23.160]  quotes I include those in this new video that I'm making and and it goes all the
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:28.640]  way up to the Civil War because the financiers of Europe and it's been well
[2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:32.840]  documented by people who know who were there at the time their objective was to
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:37.240]  break up the United States because the United States a democracy where the
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:41.400]  people control their own currency thanks to people like Andrew Jackson was the
[2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:44.880]  biggest threat on the earth to the monarchies of Europe and to the
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:50.920]  financial rule of the Rothschilds and the other big banking families so when
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:56.080]  the Civil War began and Abraham Lincoln went to the New York banks they wanted
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:02.520]  to charge him interest rates anywhere from 25 to 35 percent and Lincoln said
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:05.960]  forget that and that's why he introduced the greenbacks where the
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:11.000]  government had the ability he knew it to just spend money directly into
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:16.600]  circulation for the items they needed to purchase to prosecute the war without
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:21.680]  going through the banks the Civil War financially was a miracle because we
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:28.400]  fought a war without any debt to the banks whatsoever we had the greenbacks
[2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:33.760]  we sold war bonds directly to the people and we raised excise taxes and
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.240]  introduced a small income tax but the miracle was the Union was preserved
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:42.600]  without debt to the banks and the European banks hated it the London
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:47.520]  Times hated it but I want to I'm looking at a website here that has the stock
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:52.040]  market activity for today mm-hmm there's a really interesting number here Alex
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:56.400]  that illustrates what we're talking about you know city bank from the 11th of
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:01.280]  February to the 20th of February went down 42 percent right stock just
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.640]  plummeted and so everybody says oh that's terrible city banks in such bad
[2:28:05.640 --> 2:28:14.360]  shape well today city bank stock has been sold in the amount of 360 million
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:20.600]  shares at a very low price so what does that mean that means that the people
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:25.560]  with the money have come back into the market now and they're buying city bank
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:31.240]  shares for half of what it sold for three weeks ago they're getting the people
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:35.240]  out of the profiteering going on here they're getting the people out of the
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:40.760]  ownership this is vertical integration that's right they've driven the small
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.000]  stockholders the mutual funds they've driven them out and now the people with
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.800]  the money have come back in to buy that enormous financial institution for
[2:28:49.800 --> 2:28:53.440]  pennies on the dollar there couldn't be a better illustration of what is going on
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:57.760]  so they took the pension funds money the government employee money the private
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:02.080]  pension fund money the mom-and-pop stock market money they weren't about to let
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:04.920]  the baby boomers have this notice right as they're retiring they did this and
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:08.360]  they bragged they're doing it they destroy confidence drive it all down
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:13.080]  engorge themselves with cash while the stock itself down then go in and buy it
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:16.840]  up themselves yeah that's what's happened with with city bank and we're
[2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:21.360]  seeing the similar things happening today with Bank of America and American
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:25.560]  Express they're doing the same thing with those two I want to hear from you
[2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:29.080]  what you think the winner banks the banks are gonna leave standing who those
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:34.000]  will be versus what front corporations like Enron and Toolco and global
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:37.240]  crossing because we know they above these front companies fence the money out
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:41.320]  offshore and then implode them to rip off the shareholders and employees but
[2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:44.600]  now this is on a wider scale where you see that going in solutions to this

[2:33:13.520 --> 2:33:16.800]  coming up in just a few minutes we're gonna be taking your calls for Richard
[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:22.680]  C. Cook economic historian government analyst former government analyst in the
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:34.240]  White House author but I wanted to go back to you sir and again
[2:33:34.240 --> 2:33:42.640]  specifically is around a time the last segment quantify simply the new world
[2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:47.800]  order you know Anglo-American banking establishments plan a b is it going well
[2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:55.320]  for them and then see how do we combat this well the plan is to allow the
[2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:00.120]  bubble to collapse this is what has been called you probably familiar with the
[2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:03.800]  term reader listeners are probably familiar with the term the soft landing
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:09.400]  that's to allow the bubble to collapse without taking down the entire system
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:13.960]  with it it does take down a lot of small financial institutions you know took
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:19.160]  down layman it took down Merrill Lynch which was sold to Bank of America so
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:25.120]  they're letting the small fish collapse well the big ones come in and eat up
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:30.960]  everything in sight and consolidate their control which is why the big four
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:36.440]  city bank Bank of America Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase are all going to come
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:40.400]  through this because they're going to be the ones who are the recipients of the
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:43.640]  additional bailout monies that are going to be coming through the Obama
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:49.640]  budget for 2009 2010 the budget that was just announced the other day then
[2:34:49.640 --> 2:34:53.720]  meanwhile the producing economy the economy where we live and work we're
[2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:57.240]  going to see depression level unemployment we're going to see cuts in
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:35:00.920]  social services we're going to see social security cutback we're going to see
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:06.040]  Medicare cutback all of those benefit programs are going to be sacrificed to
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:11.760]  a significant extent we're already seeing the not just the standard of living in
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:16.400]  the United States collapsing but also the life expectancy all of this stuff is
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:22.160]  going to lead to a depressed economy which is going to be you know at levels
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:28.480]  of maybe a half or less 40% of economic activity that we've seen in the last
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:33.120]  decade and then the banks will just start rebuilding it through more lending
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:38.120]  but at a much lower price level a much lower level of economic activity and
[2:35:38.120 --> 2:35:41.960]  the whole cycle just starts all over again but this time with greater
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:46.840]  control and greater consolidation now of course we do know that they're calling
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.400]  up the police powers of the state the military powers to everybody's warning
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.120]  all of the intelligence people are saying well we're going to have riots we're
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:01.640]  going to have civil unrest so they're preparing for that but one interesting
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:06.640]  thing about that Alex if you read about the history of the late 1800s when we
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:11.320]  had the greenback party the populist part of the people's party all trying to
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:16.960]  fight against the monetary system in the late 1800s the monetary power was
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:20.440]  calling for the same thing they wanted the government to step in they were
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:25.600]  calling for stocking the armories and the big American cities because they were
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:30.000]  doing the same thing then as they were doing now gaining financial control
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:36.400]  through a big big deflation and then calling for the police power of the
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:41.400]  state to come in and protect the bankers protect the financiers from the
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:46.920]  people so it's just a repetition of history except today it's you know the
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:50.480]  economy is so much bigger the population is so much larger that it's a much
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:55.480]  bigger event than it was back then but people and the people and we have the
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:36:58.880]  solutions in a moment are less self-sufficient they're not living on
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:02.840]  the land 90 plus percent or urban can't take care of themselves the 10% that's
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:06.920]  on the farms is you know only half of those are total five percent of the
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:10.880]  population is self-sufficient so they've got us right where they want us in and
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:14.240]  towards the premeditation of all of this just adding to what you were saying
[2:37:14.240 --> 2:37:17.960]  not only do they start imploding the economy in the name of pumping it back
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:21.280]  up which they have no intention of doing while they badmouth it claiming they're
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:25.040]  trying to pump it up they're pumping all the cash into themselves to be cash
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:29.120]  rich and show the premeditation of this they've been gearing up as police state
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:33.800]  for decades for just this time we're now entering they didn't just suddenly build
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:37.560]  FEMA camps and get brigade homeland and homeland security and build this
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:41.760]  apparatus to fight al-qaeda which they now admit is for the American people can
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:45.560]  you speak to that and then get into some brief solutions because I want to go
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:51.640]  calls well that that is correct now the Obama administration is trying to cover
[2:37:51.640 --> 2:37:55.840]  both ends of the spectrum they're pumping up the financial bubble to try
[2:37:55.840 --> 2:38:00.880]  to keep the big banks in business and at the same time they're extending the
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:07.840]  federal deficit by putting in place additions to welfare type programs plus
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:11.680]  they're going to have a big hiring spree to hire a one to two hundred and fifty
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:16.560]  thousand new federal employees which is a Keynesian job creation program so
[2:38:16.560 --> 2:38:19.920]  they're trying to cover the whole spectrum which is why they have the one
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.840]  point seventy five trillion dollar budget deficit projected for this year
[2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:28.480]  which is producing a new bubble there's a new bubble that has just begun I don't
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:33.560]  know if listeners have heard of it it's the Treasury bond bubble that is just
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.760]  off the charts now but the problem is that the Treasury bonds are paying such
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:41.560]  low interest rates that with inflation it's a losing proposition if you buy
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:45.440]  them but that's the place that all of these stockholders who are getting out
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:49.600]  of their 401ks abandoning the stock market are being forced into they're
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:53.840]  being forced into Treasury bonds to float that bubble to pay for the one
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:57.320]  point seventy five trillion dollar budget deficit that's out there now for
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:03.760]  fiscal year oh nine now solutions to this there is a monetary reform solution
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:08.160]  I mean there is a monetary reform movement that has been saying over and
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:15.120]  over again to people in recent years all of this goes back to one factor and one
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:22.320]  factor alone and that is that the only way money comes into existence in the
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:27.720]  economic system that we have today run by the Federal Reserve is through a bank
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:34.280]  loan a debt creation a dead instrument monetary system as long as we continue to
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:39.200]  have a debt-based monetary system the banks will be in control and they will
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:44.200]  inflate it and deflate it to their hearts content that's what has to be
[2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:47.480]  changed and you've written about that extensively and I agree with your plan
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:51.520]  to register cook dot com we gotta go to calls but I just want to put the cherry
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:55.720]  on top of all of this we're hearing about nationalization but what really is
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:59.880]  happening the private Federal Reserve masquerading is public he is taking
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:05.640]  control of some of its subsidiary banks that were already that the the private
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:10.760]  arm of the Federal Reserve so it's a bait and switch it's really a hijacking or a
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:15.640]  piratical takeover by multinational offshore banks of the governmental
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:23.880]  functions of the Treasury so hey I'd like you to briefly comment on that that's
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:27.040]  correct there's no real nationalization what masquerades is
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:31.680]  nationalization is simply pumping more federal dollars onto the asset sheets of
[2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:36.760]  these banks by taking off their balance sheets the toxic debt the bad loans the
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:40.480]  loans that will never be repaid so instead we need not have any kind of
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:43.880]  controlling interest the government does not influence lending policies
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:48.520]  interest rates or anything it's just another bailout so instead we need true
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:52.960]  nationalization of the private Federal Reserve lock up these guys for criminal
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:56.520]  activity and Ponzi schemes they've all openly broken even their own federal
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:00.880]  laws and then do what the founding fathers and Andrew Jackson and President
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:06.520]  Lincoln did and that is have a true nationalized true private Bank of the
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:10.640]  United States and then educate the public about monetary systems and have a
[2:41:10.640 --> 2:41:14.120]  stable money supply that's meant to build up our economy build up small
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:18.040]  businesses build up state sovereignty and we would again be the powerhouse of
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:23.400]  the planet that's correct and we need to issue what I call a dividend directly to
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:27.680]  the people like the Alaska Permanent Fund for example the distributes over
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:33.120]  $3,000 in asset wealth every year to every resident of the state we should do
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:39.240]  that and in addition to that we must write off trillions of dollars in debt
[2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:45.040]  that our population has been unfairly subjected to by the banking system such
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:50.480]  as the enormous amount of credit card debt now that is at very high interest
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:54.840]  rates college that all of us have to be written off yes and I keep it right
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:58.040]  because we're short on time and this is such powerful info we got to have you
[2:41:58.040 --> 2:42:02.400]  back very soon with your seat cook it's just so incredible to know that we have
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:06.640]  this engine of true you know currency control by the government what our
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:10.600]  founders set up what made us the most powerful and wealthy in the world instead
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:14.880]  we have a bunch of criminal bankers that create a black hole of debt mace debt
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:19.200]  based money supply and I mean we have to educate the public about this if we're
[2:42:19.200 --> 2:42:24.480]  going to survive and thrive as a society the alternative the alternative is the
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:28.520]  alternative is a world government run by the bankers literally taxing the carbon
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:33.640]  cycle yes that's right that's the solution the this is what a battle line
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:38.840]  is drawn and and again it's people in this country have known this this is
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:42.080]  long as we've had a country and the fight has gone back and forth in the last
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:45.920]  seventy years the financiers have controlled it all through the federal
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:50.520]  reserve now that it's collapsing we have to take advantage of this and educate
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:54.840]  people about the real solutions that we have available to us and by the way this
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:42:58.400]  the establishment openly says this is their opportunity to finish the new
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:01.920]  world order or they'll be defeated they know they're moving their working
[2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:07.320]  overdrive folks but but we have history common sense the law on our side you
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:10.480]  better get working and that's why the obama deception coming out is so
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:13.520]  important I can't wait to your video comes out we certainly want to have you
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:18.560]  want to promote that notice you know free minds think alike he's you're making a
[2:43:18.560 --> 2:43:22.480]  film about basically the same issues because it's it's the reality and if we
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:26.120]  don't get this message out it's over let's take a call here from jay in
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:30.360]  new york a jay go ahead hello hey richard
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:33.920]  thanks for the work you're doing can you hear me yeah you sound like you're on a
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:38.360]  speakerphone but go ahead with your question okay yeah okay I can prove
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:43.320]  very supposedly alternative they call it the the most enlightened city in
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:48.920]  new york and in america and they're not really there but they do have their own
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:52.880]  money system sir sir let me ask you a question can you pick up a regular phone
[2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:58.200]  because we'd like to hear you yeah I mean we respect you enough to want to
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:00.920]  actually be able to understand what you're saying and speaker phones just
[2:44:00.920 --> 2:44:06.240]  don't cut it I got you okay I come from the city and there's they have their own
[2:44:06.240 --> 2:44:10.760]  money system it's called the if I can say the name it's a good dollar and it's
[2:44:10.760 --> 2:44:14.960]  called the it's a good hour and it's basically a work-based system it's worth
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:20.000]  ten dollars one it's a good hour you know in someone's kitchen and wash their
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:25.600]  dishes I'm a tradesman I have a trade I have a lot of trades I I'm not gonna hurt
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:30.280]  I don't think any any more than probably you know the rest of the country I'm not
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:33.600]  gonna leave the country because I believe in love yet behind a lot of people
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:36.440]  that I care about so we're all gonna go through this together whatever we're
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:40.640]  gonna go through but I'm wondering what you all think about that money system
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:43.560]  because here in it's okay you can get an if the hour I suppose I don't hardly use
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:49.160]  them but you can get an if the hour and and wherever you try to cash it they
[2:44:49.160 --> 2:44:53.080]  they take off about ten percent it's really only worth about nine dollars no
[2:44:53.080 --> 2:44:56.600]  area let me comment on that I'm gonna move forward it's a great question let
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:02.080]  me add my point on this I believe in multiple competing currencies and
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:06.280]  overall national currency but you know in our founding and in many other free
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:10.040]  nations they've had competing currencies because that does several things it
[2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:14.800]  educates the public about alternative systems and and and takes away the the
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:19.440]  mystification of these fiat currencies put out by private banks go ahead sir
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:24.760]  the problem with the ifica money and I love the system it's a great system and
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:30.720]  I do encourage people to put in place if they can local systems there's only a
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:36.120]  little bit over a hundred thousand dollars in ifica hours that are now out
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:39.680]  there that figures from just a few months ago because they went to the
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:43.880]  American Monetary Institute to people who run at the car hours to ask them how
[2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:48.800]  they could expand it and of course the problem is that there are so many
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:53.720]  difficulties in using ifica hours to buy anything it's made outside the
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:59.480]  community like you can't buy a car with it so it's an expedient and in some
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:05.160]  cases it's an emergency measure that people have to use but by itself it's
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:09.480]  not the solution so we've got to look at the national level and be able to find
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:14.920]  ways to educate people about national monetary reform well we should also
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:19.040]  educate the public about silver and gold and other things that I mean that is a
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:23.240]  true you know primitive currency that's always been used so that's a whole other
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:27.200]  level that Josh in New Jersey you're on the air welcome with Richard C. Cook
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:32.960]  Alex I don't know Mr. Cook hello I'm a pretty recent listener to the show and
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:38.120]  you know I agree with a lot of the ideas you have my basic question is these
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:43.000]  banks you know they're they're pretty deep-rooted I mean they seem like they
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:46.680]  have control these governments and they they they use this debt to control
[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:51.160]  everything is there really any way that we can make them lose this power I mean
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:55.640]  aren't we we have beaten them four times we have to educate the public about how
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:59.040]  this works as things get worse and worse the people that would only watch
[2:46:59.040 --> 2:47:02.960]  football before are now starting to listen and we don't have a choice and
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:06.920]  the states created the federal government 30 plus states are moving to
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:11.240]  declare sovereignty reform the union if they have to you have to first believe
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:15.240]  they can be beaten to do it third world countries beat them all the time Mr.
[2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:22.600]  Cook every bank in the United States is chartered by a federal or a state
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:28.920]  government our system acknowledges at its deepest level the credit is a public
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:34.040]  utility and it does derive from the will of the people in the consent of the
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:39.080]  government we have the constitutional right and now we have to get the ability
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:43.960]  to take it back it can be done it belongs to us it's been taken away from us we
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:47.840]  have to take it back yeah I mean we have the moral authority sir we've been Rob
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:51.720]  we've been Shanghai we've been hijacked we've been bushwhacked we've been
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.000]  bamboozled we've been gang raped I mean whatever terms you want to use they're
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:48:01.400]  the bad guys it's this it's this magicians illusion in their fancy suits
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:06.320]  and on TV they're a pack of crux we need to get that popular rage of true
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:13.040]  populism going Mr. Cook now back in October when Paulson went to Congress
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:17.840]  with the first of the big bailout bills and that bailout came about by the way
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:22.680]  because Europe refused to stop buying our toxic debt so Paulson went to
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:26.160]  Congress and you remember what happened the very first time that went before the
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:31.200]  House of Representatives the House voted it down now if they had stood their
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:35.920]  ground and voted it down the next time we might have a completely different
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:40.680]  situation but the bankers engaged in financial terrorism they went on there
[2:48:40.680 --> 2:48:44.240]  we're gonna have a depression and the stock market dropped you know from 10
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:48.120]  thousand down to not you know 8,000 or whatever and look we gave into the
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:53.240]  terrorism to help us mr. Cook oh it ruined us that was the that was the
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:58.720]  defining moment and when John McCain came to Washington he had the intent of
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:03.120]  supporting the congressman who were against that legislation but he too
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:08.200]  caved in we heard this story last weekend up in New York at the Eastern
[2:49:08.200 --> 2:49:11.920]  Economic Association conference but there was a time you know there were a
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.720]  couple days there when the battle lines had been drawn and if our people in
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:20.720]  Congress had stood their ground we would have a far different situation today
[2:49:20.720 --> 2:49:25.640]  and in came the military option as you mentioned earlier telling people they
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:30.200]  were going to be terrorists in the streets and I said all that yeah I mean
[2:49:30.200 --> 2:49:34.000]  if I mean if that isn't terrorism to have the secretary of the Treasury and
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:37.080]  the head of the private fed saying the president's going to declare martial
[2:49:37.080 --> 2:49:40.280]  law and do this anyway they should have gone out and had a press conference and
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:43.880]  said we were just threatened by economic terrorist and the and the and and and
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:47.840]  started a house investigation to arrest those men instead they put their tail
[2:49:47.840 --> 2:49:51.640]  between their legs urinated on themselves all that came from the big
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:57.600]  banks I mean folks writing that whole scenario we have offshore banks
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:03.840]  threatening martial law in America I mean this is outrageous mr. Cook that's
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:09.040]  correct that is correct it's the international banking system and it's
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:14.880]  an interlocking system and the center of it you know is not even in the United
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:20.120]  States London it's spread all over the place but it's an international system
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:23.240]  and they're the ones who direct the Federal Reserve and they're the ones who
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:29.760]  direct the Treasury policy and right now the whole objective of the Obama
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:34.600]  budget with the continued bailouts is to keep that system afloat
[2:50:34.600 --> 2:50:39.320]  Richard C. Cook's our guest we're gonna come back and take more calls from Mike
[2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:42.880]  Zachary and others Kevin who disagreed with them first but he hung up
[2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:47.480]  Richard C. Cook's our guest an amazing researcher he is one of the most accurate
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:51.280]  individuals breaking it down probably the most accurate and he concurs with my
[2:50:51.280 --> 2:50:55.840]  analysis more than anybody else I mean because the banks do this over and over
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:50:59.720]  again throughout history they brag about it of course it's all premeditated
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:04.560]  they're behind it Alex Jones here with a question what does humidity mean to you

[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:21.720]  conference I just went to a New York last weekend there was a economist from
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:25.560]  the University of Massachusetts there's name was Thomas Ferguson who'd been
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:29.360]  working with the banking committee on Capitol Hill when the October crisis
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:35.880]  occurred and he pointed out that the Bush Obama bank bailouts alone will
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:40.960]  cause a permanent addition of interest payments on the national debt of a
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:47.000]  hundred billion dollars a year forever that means every American is going to
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.120]  pay during the course or his or her lifetime on the average twenty thousand
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:57.480]  dollars for this bank rescue this one action of being bailing out the banks
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:56:01.280]  twenty thousand dollars in the lifetime and now they're telling us more and
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:06.720]  more of these yeah yeah these are the decisions that are being made by our
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:13.200]  elected government today unbelievable crime unbelievable just absolutely
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:17.640]  incredible let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Wisconsin Mike you're on the
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:23.520]  air with Richard C. Cook go ahead hey good afternoon Alex and Richard yes I'm
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:28.360]  a prison pilot member and I have the Obama deception pre-ordered I've been
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:33.920]  unemployed since September and I was making like 18 bucks an hour when I was
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:38.240]  let go I'm right now collecting unemployment I don't have a mortgage I
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:42.600]  was foreclosed a couple years ago so I'm renting should I take any kind of
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:47.320]  part-time job full-time job no matter what it pays right now or should I kind
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:51.280]  of hold out for something that pays what I was you know making when I was let go
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:56.000]  or right now my wife works we do have an income but you know what are your
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:02.480]  thoughts on that well I would show this no you go ahead well I can't I can't
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:08.040]  tell any individual what to do if I were in that position I would certainly do my
[2:57:08.040 --> 2:57:11.840]  best to earn the money that I could because you never know down the road
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:16.400]  if it's going to get any better so I think a burden the hand is better than
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:21.280]  nothing yeah look you've already paid all this in in taxes it's all fiat made up
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:24.720]  money to begin with the illegal aliens are all too you know two or three four
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:29.240]  well welfare checks of peace milking it everything's going bankrupt I would take
[2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:32.840]  that unemployment check I mean this is what I would do and I would go out and
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:36.800]  mow the lawns or you know pick up cans whatever on the side because it's only
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:39.520]  going to be the underground economy that's going to let people survive I
[2:57:39.520 --> 2:57:43.440]  would be making as much money as you can I would be I know people that are
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:46.960]  losing their jobs or they get a new job and they're lazy and they drag around
[2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:50.760]  with Americans a lot of them have gotten lazy and entitled a lot of us are
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:54.400]  really hard-working I don't want to over you know simplify things but I don't
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:57.960]  think we'll realize we're going into a long sustained depression I think all
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:01.320]  the evidence shows so you better especially people that have children
[2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:06.920]  are are being lazy out there you better be busting your butts to get in as best
[2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:10.760]  a position as you can because it's only going to get worse I'd say for the next
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:14.200]  five years what you're cooking you agree yeah I agree with that and I think
[2:58:14.200 --> 2:58:18.080]  that's a good suggestion Alec there's a lot of ways to earn money out there now
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:24.960]  that are available that we can you know kind of do out of our wits and sure do

[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:27.400]  be talking to some state reps coming up in the shower and more news and your
[3:00:27.400 --> 3:00:32.840]  phone calls Richard C. Cook former White House analyst NASA consultant
[3:00:32.840 --> 3:00:37.240]  written for major publications out there like the Washington Post he is our
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:43.400]  guest right now we're taking a few final calls for him let's talk to Zachary
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:50.720]  holding patiently from Hawaii Zachary you're on the air welcome hello yes I'm
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:56.840]  nice to talk to you again I had a couple questions and mm-hmm they were about
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:04.760]  gold and silver I bought some gold and silver and I was wondering about the
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:09.720]  amount stolen and hoarded throughout history and then you know like how it
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:15.360]  could be released in order to manipulate the market like oil and enron and
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:19.560]  diamonds and the housing market maybe and then I was wondering like who would buy
[3:01:19.560 --> 3:01:24.960]  it if everyone's being broke if everyone's broke who's who's who could buy
[3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:32.040]  it I was just thinking that the consumption would be better people who
[3:01:32.040 --> 3:01:36.360]  have money to buy things and the way it works is that they drive down the
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:39.680]  markets you know they corner the market on these things and they drive down the
[3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:44.360]  market price and then when it's driven down and all the people who are scared
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:48.280]  out of the market get out and sell their commodities then the people with the
[3:01:48.280 --> 3:01:52.240]  money and or with the credit because they can still create money out of thin
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:56.560]  air which they do and are doing then they step in and they buy it up you just
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:00.080]  have to watch these commodity markets very carefully and try to understand who
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:04.320]  is manipulating these markets but there's always people with money who can
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:08.480]  create money out of nothing who control the banking system still I mean there's
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:12.560]  still a world banking system out there who can create almost an infinite amount
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.040]  of money anytime they want to that's what I agree people can come in and buy
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:19.640]  what they want when they want it most analysts are saying that gold has been
[3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:22.840]  undervalued so is silver because the bankers for decades have been
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:26.720]  depressing it while they hoard it so the so the globalists are obsessed with
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:30.120]  gold and silver and they're the ones hoarding it but they hoard it because
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:36.120]  they know it is one of the most basic true forms of value
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:43.240]  mr. Cook you're from Hawaii you said you know why we never said that we said
[3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:46.680]  you were from Hawaii Zachary okay I thought you said you had a guest from
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:50.800]  Hawaii I was what I want to guess the hour before last from Hawaii Mike Rivera
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  okay and I've misunderstood um yeah Mike Rivera I didn't think it was the same
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:03:02.160]  name I had a question about Hawaii though and I was thinking about the I live in
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:06.840]  Maui and it's I'm thinking that the familiarity of self-sufficiency is
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:10.920]  very high so I thought that would be a kind of a weird thing and I thought of
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:18.360]  a um that is a threat you know to to the elitist because of our growing season
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:23.720]  and the most visited island in the world is Maui and then our isolation to
[3:03:23.720 --> 3:03:27.200]  make an idea that it's dangerous to be isolated you were saying they want to
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:30.640]  bring people into cities I thought if they made another false flag in Hawaii
[3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:35.360]  they would well we don't we don't speculate a lot but I appreciate your
[3:03:35.360 --> 3:03:40.120]  call around the island on a farm for 10 years and while I was working for the
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.320]  government we went home to farm and we never ate better in our lives it was a
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:48.840]  it was a blessing beyond the land of the blessing wherever you are yeah I'm
[3:03:48.840 --> 3:03:52.840]  looking at trying to move to something of an hour away from Austin it's gonna be
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:55.440]  a big hassle commuting and I don't really have the money to do it so I'm
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:03:58.600]  looking around but I want to get out of here I mean it's it's always smart to
[3:03:58.600 --> 3:04:01.920]  do that in these type of times thank you so much caller I'll have to get to
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:05.160]  Charles and others later well Richard see cook love to have you back up again in
[3:04:05.160 --> 3:04:09.520]  the near future I really appreciate all your time Richard see cook calm I think
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:12.280]  we've got a good chance in closing to actually beat these people do you think
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:15.680]  they've overreached or do you I mean what's the chances that we can win 60%
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:21.320]  or I'd say 60 they have overreached incredibly people are waking up and
[3:04:21.320 --> 3:04:26.960]  there were times in American history when working Americans like us knew how
[3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:31.280]  these systems worked and how to fix them and we're coming back there we're
[3:04:31.280 --> 3:04:35.080]  getting back there we got to keep it up all right yeah it's been the big party

[3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:11.600]  quotes of Thomas Jefferson in there they have the best resolution of 31 states
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:16.320]  now that we've seen a lot of other states are adopting similar variants of
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:20.440]  what they've done and Oklahoma's pass it to their house about to pass to their
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:23.800]  Senate this week they believe they have the votes other states are passing are
[3:11:23.800 --> 3:11:27.120]  about to pass it but New Hampshire to live for your die state where a
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:32.080]  revolution really began is so key to all of this so it's really great to have
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:36.200]  you on representative of Paul Ingramson thanks for coming on the pleasure is by
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:40.120]  now thank you very much for having us again you bet last time you didn't get a
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:43.600]  lot of time to talk because I had Dan on now he's not on with us right now so
[3:11:43.600 --> 3:11:47.440]  you've got the floor break down why you're doing this what it's like to see
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:50.640]  since you guys and others started this to see it spread like wildfire get
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:54.560]  national international attention people on the streets are excited in Austin I
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:11:57.880]  got family coming to town and friends asking me about it because they
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:12:02.360]  instinctively know this is the one of the key ways for a redress of grievances
[3:12:02.360 --> 3:12:07.440]  with this rogue federal government Alex the exciting part about this and it is
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:11.600]  actually very exciting and it's very nice to see that you're you're striking a
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:16.280]  chord with the in the hearts of a lot of Americans I mean you get the
[3:12:16.280 --> 3:12:19.880]  frustrated after well as you've been in your own experience I'm sure wondering
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:23.120]  if there's anybody out there who cares we can see this kind of stuff first just
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:26.800]  become too much arcane digging into the past and all that sort of thing so it's
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:33.440]  really been fantastic to have the to have the you know the people start
[3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:37.240]  rising up behind us in fact what it now does for us is it makes us look ahead and
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:40.120]  say what the heck are we gonna do if we ever managed to get the states to get
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:43.360]  together and it's really critical for us to start thinking that way and I
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:47.360]  suggest that your listeners yourself as well begin to think what a conference
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:50.680]  would look like what a conference of the states would look like the last thing I
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:54.360]  want to do actually is is to change our form of government and I would be of
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:58.120]  course very wary of any kind of a convention that would begin to do what
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:02.280]  our previous one did and and especially with the people around today you could
[3:13:02.280 --> 3:13:06.320]  easily have one that would be turned into a very bad situation so what in the
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.200]  world would this look like we have to think that through well that's where your mind goes
[3:13:10.200 --> 3:13:14.120]  next well that's the great danger you know in any opportunities a danger now
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:17.480]  the globalists have already seized DC they've already destroyed our form of
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:22.440]  government the states must reconvene at least an individual level or as a group
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:29.360]  to exercise their lawful constitutional organic common law power that springs
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:32.560]  from basic free humanity not even the documents themselves they just enumerate
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:37.520]  you know some of those so we don't have a choice but to do this but I believe we
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:44.080]  need to have the states vote as they already do to go into a concon or or
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:51.680]  something similar to vote before they go on with a pledge in stone of why
[3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:56.320]  they're going and what they're going to do and what they will vote for and what
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:13:59.400]  their goals are no gun confiscation no more federal government out of control
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:04.320]  abolish the Federal Reserve and I think if we do that then we can defeat them
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:08.880]  your comments well well I have a I have a slightly different view and I come to
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:12.200]  this by the way believe it or not as an artist who you have to solve a problem the
[3:14:12.200 --> 3:14:16.480]  problem of creating an aesthetic solution to some you know someone has paid my
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:19.160]  portrait you can't just knock out a picture of them you have to do a whole
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:21.560]  bunch of other work and it requires a whole bunch of research a bunch of
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:25.320]  thinking everything from color schemes to whatnot but you see the same thing
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:29.520]  all the sciences where you simply have to first of all begin and look at the
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:32.560]  problem I think the first part of any kind of a conference be sit down and
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:35.400]  analyze what in the world we've done what is this monster we've done here
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:38.960]  that's the first thing before you start making decisions about this or that part
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:44.000]  of it I think eventually what you'll see is there's no decision to be made we'll
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:47.760]  continue so give us I mean give us more your plan well what for example for
[3:14:47.760 --> 3:14:52.120]  example we need to find out why we aren't just coining gold and silver as
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:55.720]  request you know just required or whatever just one of many things that
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:14:58.920]  will lead them to a place where who controls the banks who controls the
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:02.880]  you know and all the different things from the income tax itself that you
[3:15:02.880 --> 3:15:06.120]  well you know everybody knows about the fraud associated with that and your show
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:10.600]  I'm sure and you know and all the federal user patients and you know they're
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:13.920]  messing around with education also we have to look at piece by piece by piece
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:17.960]  to all the sort of thing we also have to be fully aware and have on our mind that
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:23.000]  we created a monster and it's our job to actually as responsible parents the
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:29.240]  states to then say well what do we do and I'm not for a wholesale change I'm
[3:15:29.240 --> 3:15:32.320]  for simply a cleaning of house ideally that would be my way of thinking of it
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:35.560]  but I don't know what that looks like precisely we know how well the states
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:39.360]  enforce that I mean what I mean we have to just go ahead and abolish the
[3:15:39.360 --> 3:15:46.160]  federal government it is a rogue criminal operation yes you know you're
[3:15:46.160 --> 3:15:50.320]  talking about uncharted turf except for the fact is we created it and do we have
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:53.440]  all the authority in the world to do something about it the real problem it
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:56.160]  seems to me and you're you probably will have a lot more to say about this than I
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:00.440]  do is at this stage when we get to a serious point here do we actually will
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:04.040]  find ourselves in a civil war with our own government well they're already your
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:06.640]  servers of the first order so you can assume that that would be the case and
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:09.400]  how do we protect ourselves I mean you see bills coming out of different states
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:12.720]  now we're trying to create our own militias our own state militias because
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:17.600]  the feds of usurped or in the process of usurping that you know Texas yeah that's
[3:16:17.600 --> 3:16:20.280]  what I'm saying I mean they're federalizing the National Guard
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:24.240]  everything they're going to stage terror attacks they're going to stage
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:27.840]  riots they're going to come out for the states the states up front that's what
[3:16:27.840 --> 3:16:31.600]  I'm seeing in these resolutions need to know the problem FEMA camps gun
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:35.160]  confiscation you know and then that's what's so exciting about the states
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:38.600]  not just talking about unfunded mandates or something I mean I mean they
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:43.040]  realize the monster this it's not it we wish it was different it's a rogue
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:46.920]  criminal enterprise we have allies in the federal government but I think we
[3:16:46.920 --> 3:16:51.400]  need to address it fully for what this dragon is this isn't some little little
[3:16:51.400 --> 3:16:55.360]  serpent we're dealing with this is a giant black dragon stomping around the
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:59.560]  countryside and we have to go up against it like it's a big fire-breathing black
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:06.120]  dragon we've got 50 nights to beat him I agree that's a very interesting
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:10.520]  phenomenon here in the United States in fact I whatever it's worth I see this
[3:17:10.520 --> 3:17:13.680]  the dragon in their revelations referred to as a lamb and as a dragon
[3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:17.040]  simultaneously and I believe there's a lamb here in the United States it's us
[3:17:17.040 --> 3:17:20.760]  it's the way the people and we we actually are believers in good
[3:17:20.760 --> 3:17:24.080]  government and honesty and justice and liberty and all these things but there
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:27.360]  is a monster there's no question there's a monster that's starting to run
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:30.360]  everything they're starting to get tentacles into just every single part
[3:17:30.360 --> 3:17:35.360]  of our lives and yeah so now it's time can the lamb actually empower itself
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:40.240]  that's a real interesting problem for a lamb I thought I suggest that he gets a
[3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:43.440]  whole bunch of lambs together and you begin to maybe have some possibility of
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:48.840]  doing it well you know the American people of the veneer of civilization is
[3:17:48.840 --> 3:17:53.480]  very thin as my dad likes to say I I don't know that characterizes his lambs
[3:17:53.480 --> 3:18:02.560]  maybe castrated monkeys well we should be called a sheeple before I know you're
[3:18:02.560 --> 3:18:06.320]  right I mean there are a bunch of sheep like little government but there's a
[3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:10.040]  lot of people that aren't and you know people are getting tired of this dragon
[3:18:10.040 --> 3:18:13.840]  stomping around and burning down their villages you know absolutely absolutely
[3:18:13.840 --> 3:18:18.520]  that's a good that's a good metaphor so so what's coming up here in the next few
[3:18:18.520 --> 3:18:21.800]  days and what how good a chance we have getting your resolution passed in New
[3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:25.640]  Hampshire I don't know but I think my part of the support now and I see that
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:30.960]  the Republican Party is the leadership is taking over is is is is backing us
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:35.360]  which goes like this in the past you can't you know you haven't been able to
[3:18:35.360 --> 3:18:39.520]  get them but here they are and so you know I think we have a decent chance I
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:42.000]  think we just simply have to do the fight on the floor with the numbers
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:44.880]  have to show up outside on the street which by the way is 8 o'clock tomorrow
[3:18:44.880 --> 3:18:48.760]  morning and we've had a very very cold day today but tomorrow should be a
[3:18:48.760 --> 3:18:53.080]  better one hopefully people will show up but I'll be discouraged but yeah I
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:57.080]  think a bunch of things to come into play simultaneously and you know with the
[3:18:57.080 --> 3:19:01.160]  help of God you know so much of this stuff is we do what we can and the
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:05.680]  providence that's right so you have to call on Providence you're calling on
[3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:11.000]  Providence right now absolutely I am too we will we rely on it for those that
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:14.560]  don't know there's true power in it the greatest power you know what George
[3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:18.120]  Washington a bunch of guys frozen death and died crossing the you know the
[3:19:18.120 --> 3:19:22.280]  Delaware and going into Trenton we need I mean for so what if it's cold we need
[3:19:22.280 --> 3:19:27.240]  more people there because it's cold that is like if folks aren't there that's
[3:19:27.240 --> 3:19:31.320]  right no let's I say to you until this listeners let's not waste that
[3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:36.560]  incredible suffering and that's what's not wasted for the next generation let's
[3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:39.920]  pass on what was given to us but let's actually improve it
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:44.360]  representative Paul Ingerston is our guest right now we're gonna come back
[3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:47.520]  and continue talking to him about where New Hampshire is going and what's
[3:19:47.520 --> 3:19:50.680]  happening in the rest of the country and I'm reading more and more life and more
[3:19:50.680 --> 3:19:54.120]  more power into what's that developing we're also looking for Dan instead of
[3:19:54.120 --> 3:19:58.880]  pop in with us but he it looks like had some scheduling issues stay with us

[3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:50.080]  get to the wider picture since you've been on with me but on coast to coast a m
[3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:54.640]  fox news other channels other state reps the people have a huge hunger for this
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:26:01.120]  is this exciting uh it's tremendously exciting to me it's exciting that that
[3:26:01.120 --> 3:26:06.400]  spirit of liberty is still out there i you know proffering these bills for paul and
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:11.280]  iron and we've been in the house uh together for four terms now this is our
[3:26:11.280 --> 3:26:17.200]  fifth term and um you know we've we've proffered these kinds of bills before
[3:26:17.920 --> 3:26:24.800]  to no avail this is falling on deaf ears but somehow this one has just uh caught
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:28.560]  the heart of the people and that's what it's all about well it's because the
[3:26:28.560 --> 3:26:33.760]  new owners coming into play um you know that's something i want to bring up
[3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:38.000]  you know what's really coming into the it there's this calling the phrase of the
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:43.120]  new world order but you know what the new world order is the old world order
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:46.720]  it's the old world order the new world order is what was established here in
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:51.040]  the new world of government by the people with the people on top and the
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:55.120]  government at the bottom this gravitation toward an old article or
[3:26:55.120 --> 3:27:01.200]  monarchical uh society a hierarchical top down government that's the old world
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:05.280]  order and we've got this we've got to stop the old world order from being
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:11.360]  established here in america very well said now both of you pop in here but
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:16.000]  but the first uh representative it's a how close are you i mean i've been told
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:20.560]  by state senators and house members in oklahoma it's pretty much done deal
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:23.680]  for them sometime this week or next week to get a powerful resolution past
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:28.080]  similar to yours uh i hear it's looking better in new hampshire but
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:31.920]  uh... who do we need to put pressure on what we do to get this past in new
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:35.680]  hampshire we need to put uh... pressure on the
[3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:39.600]  uh... moderate republicans uh... and
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:44.960]  as many democrats as we can uh... the the republican caucus is now firmly
[3:27:44.960 --> 3:27:49.680]  behind us uh... is it this is the republican position
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:53.280]  so you know we've probably got uh...
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:59.120]  ninety to ninety five percent of the the caucus fairly well-secured
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:02.720]  uh... we've got a few people that you know worries
[3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:07.520]  oh it's just too complicated uh... you know i don't understand it
[3:28:07.520 --> 3:28:12.400]  uh... kind of responses uh... and and they've got to know that this is what
[3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:17.440]  the people want and if and the people are going to take notice they're going
[3:28:17.440 --> 3:28:20.560]  they're going to go back and look at this boat and decide who they're going
[3:28:20.560 --> 3:28:24.560]  to try and remove from office based at least in part on this boat
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:27.360]  how many democrats do you need to get
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:31.200]  um well if it were perfect attendance which it never is
[3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:34.880]  uh we're a body of four hundred the republicans hold a hundred and
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:39.440]  seventy eight seats so if everybody attended we would
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:44.160]  need to get twenty three reps so we need two hundred and one vote
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:48.400]  um we typically rather than having four hundred
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:52.960]  attendance we have three hundred and fifty to three hundred and eighty
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:28:56.560]  uh... parking correct but i think that that's a good general expectation for
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:00.000]  attendance so you're saying you're close to getting this done
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:03.440]  work work close it is definitely an achievable goal
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:06.720]  and i want to be specific here though as the globalist crackdown in the new
[3:29:06.720 --> 3:29:09.680]  world order world banking system old world over banking system is openly

[3:29:13.040 --> 3:29:16.800]  third try that's what they always do to us we have to persevere
[3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:21.920]  we have to continue and and just get you have you have to realize by the rules
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:26.880]  of the new hampshire uh... house uh... if we don't catch it now
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:31.920]  we're done until two years from now so we need to do it now but people need to
[3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:34.240]  call everybody stay there i want to come back to you

[3:35:44.160 --> 3:35:46.960]  uh... that's coming up but we're having a rally tomorrow when are we going to see
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:50.000]  this vote well there's not you asked me uh... you did
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:53.760]  well you start that question was about how important this is i can tell you
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:35:57.280]  very simply how important this is i met this morning with about 20
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:00.800]  conservatives in a uh... in their own little caucus
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:04.720]  uh... where they analyze bills for the next day and all that sort of thing
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:08.080]  and i asked could i get their agreement
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:12.160]  negotiate some of their votes for certain close bills that democrats want
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:16.720]  and return for democrat votes on this bill and the response to me was extremely
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:20.240]  positive so just to give you an idea that's how important this to me i don't
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:23.840]  like making deals democrats bill almost ninety percent ninety nine percent of
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:26.800]  them i consider to be too much government it's more
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:30.240]  government etc but uh... this bill is worth a whole lot
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:33.360]  this is one of those moments when uh... even a republican conservative
[3:36:33.360 --> 3:36:35.600]  constitutionalist is willing to make a deal
[3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:38.560]  and i'd like to be your listeners who are from new hampshire to make contact with
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:40.960]  their democrat representatives and tell them that if they haven't heard from me
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:44.640]  already well absolutely
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:47.600]  uh... i mean i don't think that some people don't realize how politics works
[3:36:47.600 --> 3:36:50.160]  around the country we can get new hampshire under states taxing past
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:53.920]  these strong resolutions this this makes or breaks really the
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:57.200]  future of this movement doesn't it
[3:36:57.200 --> 3:37:00.880]  well it's the beginning of something uh... politically uh... but if i could
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:04.000]  we don't know how much time we have with the way things are progressing here
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:07.120]  uh... the usurpations just can increase an increase in
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:10.720]  dramatic people are reading bills anymore you know the stimulus package
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:13.440]  is outrageous but it's been going on for some time the patriot act how many
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:16.800]  people read that and so on the i-m-f you know the gap that
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:19.280]  they've got this stuff i mean these these things have been crammed down in
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:22.800]  throats and every time you turn around it's it's at the loss of our rights in
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:26.000]  our uh... and our in the states uh... powers
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:29.360]  so uh... this isn't that we haven't yet we don't know what we're doing right
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:32.240]  there but this is definitely an agenda of some kind of these things wouldn't
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:36.400]  keep on going as jefferson said in exactly the same direction
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:39.280]  well you're absolutely right uh... representative it's a your comments on
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:43.360]  what he was just saying well i i agree with all entirely
[3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:47.440]  uh... you asked when the vote is the vote is tomorrow
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:54.560]  so you know that there is no second bite at the apple it tomorrow is the
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:59.680]  is the hill to die on uh... we if if we're going to do it
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:03.440]  uh... this year certainly is tomorrow and probably we're going to do it this
[3:38:03.440 --> 3:38:07.200]  term it's tomorrow and we might be able to contract
[3:38:07.200 --> 3:38:12.960]  craft something uh... sufficiently different to bring in next year but
[3:38:12.960 --> 3:38:15.840]  it would be likely to be blocked by the leadership
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:20.240]  so uh... it's in an hour never guys
[3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:23.520]  then we do have the uh... access to the senate uh... we could do it through the
[3:38:23.520 --> 3:38:26.640]  senate uh... virtually the same bill not exactly the same bill if we actually
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:30.000]  wanted to if you could find enough senators to actually pass it i think
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.880]  we have better chance in the house the first time around
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:36.160]  well in the hard part would be finding a senator to uh... bring it in
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:39.200]  i mean we could bring in the same bill to the senate but you have to have a
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:41.600]  senator that would support it
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:44.800]  but so and that's not going to be so easy
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:47.600]  yeah we just lost the senator that was supporting it we lost it to the house
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:50.960]  he's he's gone
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:55.280]  and so uh... you know it's really important that people
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:38:58.080]  get on their phones get up to the state house
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:05.200]  and uh... make the legislators know that their future is a legislator
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:08.400]  depends on their vote on this bill this uh...
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:14.560]  resolution absolutely man uh... anything else you think it's important
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:18.640]  to add about what we're facing here i mean i i i think restating the fact
[3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:22.720]  does it even amaze you guys to see them openly in hundreds of publications
[3:39:22.720 --> 3:39:26.160]  admitting world government oven by central bankers and that they will rule
[3:39:26.160 --> 3:39:29.280]  the planet that will pay carbon taxes to them
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:32.560]  and then they pose this as if they are the saviors when they openly and
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:35.520]  publicly engineered all of this i mean it's just
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:40.320]  the the bravada the hutzpah the arrogance the
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:45.280]  yeah i guess it's it's arrogant and it's a belief in a
[3:39:45.280 --> 3:39:49.920]  uh... well i'd say a divine right to rule and
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:53.440]  what we what we jettisoned here
[3:39:53.440 --> 3:39:58.720]  in america in seventeen seventy six was the whole idea
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:02.000]  of divine right to rule that somehow
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:07.440]  uh... the the right to rule was imbued to somebody by their genetics
[3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:10.880]  uh... our constitution states in fact that
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:16.320]  blood and and family cannot uh... impute the quality necessary
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:20.640]  to for good governance and yet also on the other hand uh...
[3:40:20.640 --> 3:40:23.360]  actually you know it's very clear that they fear the people
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:27.360]  and uh... the people uh... who in an informed public that begins to rise
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:31.440]  like this has tremendous power just tremendous power
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:34.480]  and uh... you know who knows what these people are on their plans but you know
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:37.200]  they've been a long time very furtively working so
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:39.920]  this is a moment uh... historical moment for us
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:43.680]  this this is i mean if i'm speaking to the people
[3:40:43.680 --> 3:40:47.600]  that are out there that in your audience to support this bill particularly
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:50.560]  those in the hamptons where my concern is
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:55.360]  believe in yourselves we're your servants we're doing this on your behalf
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:40:58.960]  uh... you have but if this requires
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:03.840]  your participation the constitution of the state of new hampshire requires
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:08.320]  uh... really three things from the people of new hampshire first requires
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:11.440]  that they pay taxes in return for protection of their life
[3:41:11.440 --> 3:41:16.240]  liberty and property it all then require that they know their constitution
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:21.120]  and enforce them upon the government and if they are unable to enforce the
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:26.320]  constitution for whatever reason then it is their duty to reform or
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:30.000]  replace the government yes absolutely
[3:41:30.000 --> 3:41:33.680]  you know just in closing did you guys hear about virginia counties
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:36.880]  where in one county they took uh... prince william county they took fifty
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:42.080]  million dollars of taxpayer money and they bought positions in mortgages and
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:45.120]  they're basically giving the houses and half off
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:48.480]  uh... and then paying the city employees and county employees
[3:41:48.480 --> 3:41:52.560]  to move into people's repossessed houses good lord
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:56.800]  i mean it's really becoming insane i mean i'm in a pattern of usurpation out
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:42:00.320]  this the pattern of usurpation is what is it leading to all this stuff
[3:42:00.320 --> 3:42:03.520]  they created a pattern we're not resisting it on all levels executive
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:07.040]  legislative and judicial we're doing it in the states our own state supreme
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:09.760]  court to usurping like in the claremont decision in new hampshire this is pure
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:13.680]  usurpation i just found a wonderful quote from an old new york newspaper
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:17.520]  where it expressly says that they're beginning to think that the state should
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:20.800]  take over public education where claremont said we always had it
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:24.320]  so we're talking about usurpation as a pattern now and they've all followed
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:27.680]  the following model they got they got the fed to the model
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:31.920]  the judiciary uh... in the last ten years twice
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:37.520]  has patently violated the constitution and and we need a legislature
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:43.600]  uh... that will stand up and hold the judiciary accountable and remove them
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:47.600]  when they violate the constitution and they can't be left to interpret the
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:51.520]  constitution because who holds them accountable when they violate it
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:56.480]  absolutely all right well men i want to thank both of you
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:00.560]  for joining us today and uh... god willing this will pass tomorrow
[3:43:00.560 --> 3:43:03.840]  but god helps those that helps themselves so the better one's saying
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:08.320]  trust in god but tie up your camel or as harris thompson said uh... yeah pray to
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:11.920]  god but also row away from the rocks uh... everybody
[3:43:11.920 --> 3:43:16.080]  everybody needs to call the new hampshire legislature
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:19.360]  the house right now especially the democrats
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:24.240]  and the republicans any names you want to list that people really need a hammer
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:27.360]  uh... i couldn't list a name like this there's 400 members of this house you
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:30.400]  know if you are pressed to do that they certainly could call speaking in a
[3:43:30.400 --> 3:43:32.640]  rally about the name that everybody remembers
[3:43:32.640 --> 3:43:36.080]  all right thank you gentlemen we'll talk to you soon godspeed
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:40.480]  okay very much i'll bless you all right great to hear from those gentlemen
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:43.920]  i'm looking at the uh... stock market now in fact i'm refreshing it because it's
[3:43:43.920 --> 3:43:49.520]  coming up to its close here in about fifteen minutes
[3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:53.520]  it is down to six hundred and six thousand seven hundred and sixty three
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:56.640]  the dow is at six thousand seven hundred sixty three
[3:43:56.640 --> 3:44:02.320]  down forty one points after three hundred points down yesterday
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:05.920]  or nine ninety nine if you want to be uh... technical
[3:44:05.920 --> 3:44:10.720]  uh... but it's down uh... right now forty one point zero nine
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:14.160]  and you know the bankers may pump it back up later but they're just going to drop
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:16.480]  it down and if you watch the graph it's going down
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:21.520]  it spikes back up but it's only on its way down like bouncing down a cliff
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:24.640]  and they have engineered this and they are stealing all the real wealth and
[3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:29.520]  real investments they have destroyed confidence by design to do this
[3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:35.280]  just outrageous now i guess it's up to half of people's savings through the
[3:44:35.280 --> 3:44:36.640]  stock market and
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:40.960]  through different 401k's and mutual funds has been taken that that's on average
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:43.200]  half the wealth some people have lost more some have lost less
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:46.000]  some portfolios i've seen have lost upwards of eighty percent
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:48.480]  some people have lost it all the companies that went under
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:51.520]  and all that real wealth was transferred out the back door
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:56.000]  for the bankers implode excuse me
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  these institutions
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:06.400]  so very very serious there um
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:08.720]  here's a watch in times headline go through a few of these
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:14.560]  obama state secrets echo bush last year britain's foreign office arranged
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:17.680]  and angered the british high court by ordering it to censor seven paragraphs
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:21.760]  from a previous ruling in the case of british legal resident
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:25.200]  uh... who had been rendered had been kidnapped and tortured by the cia in
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:29.760]  afghanistan and then it just goes into how obama has now done the same thing
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:34.080]  uh... protecting bush on that front don't have time to play this but it's up on
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:36.240]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:40.480]  for another story on it glenn beck mentions of fema camps on fox and
[3:45:40.480 --> 3:45:42.320]  friends
[3:45:42.320 --> 3:45:45.280]  and uh...
[3:45:45.280 --> 3:45:49.920]  it goes on here where if you watch with back says he he mentions these things
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:53.120]  but then acts like well maybe it's kind of needed oh it's scary but
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:55.920]  the bubbles the bubbles are dangerous what are we going to do so open
[3:45:55.920 --> 3:45:58.000]  announcements of fema camps on the news
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.800]  gerald salento we're going to get back on the next few weeks top trends
[3:46:00.800 --> 3:46:03.520]  forecaster he's also in the obama deception i should add
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:08.000]  on the george humphrey webster tarpoli jesse vintera
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:13.280]  carousel one and others salento u.s. has entered
[3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:18.240]  the greatest depression trends research analyst gerald salento who has
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:20.960]  written a promise on the back of his deadly accurate economic tradition
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:23.200]  says that the collapse of financial markets
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:25.360]  heralds the start of the greatest depression
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:29.280]  and his latest trend alert bulletin salento attacks mainstream pundits who
[3:46:29.280 --> 3:46:32.560]  falsely predicted the market bottom the start of the recovery
[3:46:32.560 --> 3:46:35.680]  noting that conventional analysts have been proven wrong over and over again
[3:46:35.680 --> 3:46:38.320]  yeah they're about eighty percent wrong on average because they're lying
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:40.960]  there will be no turnaround in the second quarter two thousand nine or two
[3:46:40.960 --> 3:46:43.680]  thousand ten or two thousand eleven the global financial system built on
[3:46:43.680 --> 3:46:47.440]  endless supplies of cheap money rampant speculation fraud greed and delusion
[3:46:47.440 --> 3:46:51.680]  is terminally ill and will not be coaxed into remission
[3:46:51.680 --> 3:46:55.440]  by stimulus packages in order restored to help by government buyouts
[3:46:55.440 --> 3:46:59.120]  and bailouts right salento and then he went through that there's going to be
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:03.600]  real panic setting in and the next six months to a year
[3:47:03.600 --> 3:47:08.320]  and it goes on and on the most positive prediction that salento makes is the
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:11.840]  dowel will not reach zero a tongue in cheek
[3:47:11.840 --> 3:47:15.280]  reaction yesterday's record plunge which saw the dowel rolled back
[3:47:15.280 --> 3:47:18.240]  to nineteen ninety seven levels of below seven thousand
[3:47:18.240 --> 3:47:23.040]  salento warns that the first signs of real panic are starting to set in unrest
[3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:26.880]  will cause governments to take draconian measures to prevent total economic
[3:47:26.880 --> 3:47:29.840]  collapse in public panic which is what they want
[3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:34.080]  expect massive bank failures runs on banks bank holidays right salenta even
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:36.800]  deposit refugee die insured quick access to money
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:42.560]  is by no means assured at minimum have reserves on hand for emergency forecast
[3:47:42.560 --> 3:47:45.520]  salento sites gold is one of the few investments that will continue to rise
[3:47:45.520 --> 3:47:47.920]  in value eventually reaching two thousand an ounce
[3:47:47.920 --> 3:47:54.720]  and beyond he predicts folks we saw gold in the last couple months go from
[3:47:54.720 --> 3:47:59.680]  seven hundred and eighty something dollars an ounce to one thousand plus
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:02.560]  then it went back down to nine thirty or so
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:07.120]  that is a massive buying opportunity whether gold goes up or down it's got
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:11.040]  real intrinsic value they're killing the dollar they're devaluing everything
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:14.080]  and i haven't had ted on in about a week i wanted to bring ted anderson up
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:18.560]  right now because ted has been able to buy in when the market dipped i mean it's
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:21.600]  hadn't dipped back to its lows a months ago but it dipped a little bit
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:25.600]  it's still you know right up to record highs and he has some insane deals for

[3:57:31.360 --> 3:57:35.680]  Purdue University school of veterinary medicine conducted several studies
[3:57:35.680 --> 3:57:39.040]  one to determine the vaccines can cause changes in immune system of dogs that

[3:57:42.480 --> 3:57:45.360]  made diseases they conducted this research because
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:49.200]  concert already existed it was sponsored by the haywood foundation which itself
[3:57:49.200 --> 3:57:52.000]  was looking for evidence that such changes in human immune systems might
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:56.400]  also be vaccine related and it just goes on here to talk
[3:57:56.400 --> 3:58:01.120]  about the amount of dogs and cats that get cancers in the area where they were
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:03.120]  injected they've already proven the implantable

[3:58:24.720 --> 3:58:28.080]  people i mean that's been admitted but with animals they have a group where
[3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:30.960]  they can really test it out and watch it because their life spans aren't as long
