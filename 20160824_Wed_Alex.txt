[00:00.000 --> 00:10.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 24th day of August, 2016.
[00:10.040 --> 00:14.280]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be live here for the next four hours, another
[00:14.280 --> 00:19.240]  very important broadcast transmission straight ahead.
[00:19.240 --> 00:24.000]  Trump came to town last night, a lot of news on that front, more leaks, more emails, Chelsea
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.120]  Clinton is in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to break it all down.
[00:28.120 --> 00:32.760]  But first, George Soros is in the Jerusalem Post being called a megalomaniac, so I thought
[00:32.760 --> 00:35.560]  we would air this special report.
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.040]  Yet another American community is descended on by violent ignorance masquerading as a
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.240]  civil rights protest after a black career criminal was taken out by a black police officer
[00:48.240 --> 00:52.480]  after dangerously brandishing a stolen firearm.
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.800]  So where are the leaders of the supposed righteous anger boiling over in Milwaukee?
[00:57.800 --> 01:03.120]  Typically, President Barack Obama fiddled on the golf course while Rome burned.
[01:03.120 --> 01:08.840]  Obama's deputy press secretary, Jen Friedman, provided a statement that read, the president
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.400]  is golfing at Farm Neck Golf Club, one of his favorite courses on Martha's Vineyard.
[01:14.400 --> 01:21.080]  Also today, the administration said the president had been updated on the situation in Milwaukee.
[01:21.080 --> 01:27.720]  Meanwhile, Obama protégé and Soros insulated leader of Black Lives Matter, DeRay McKesson
[01:27.720 --> 01:35.240]  tweeted, I denounce the state violence that led to any protests in the first place.
[01:35.240 --> 01:41.760]  Is this statement a result of McKesson's shallow incomprehension in the face of total anarchy
[01:41.760 --> 01:43.720]  based on the real facts?
[01:43.720 --> 01:50.000]  Or is there another hand at play here directing Obama's incompetence and McKesson's callowness?
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.400]  It should come as no surprise that Black Lives Matter leader DeRay McKesson lives in a home
[01:55.400 --> 02:00.040]  owned by philanthropists James and Robin Wood in Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.040]  The American Mirror reports it's the same address he used when declaring his residency
[02:05.040 --> 02:10.880]  on his campaign committee registration form for his failed mayoral run in the city's Democratic
[02:10.880 --> 02:13.280]  primary earlier this year.
[02:13.280 --> 02:19.640]  The Woods have owned the home since 1996 and are wealthy donors to the Baltimore chapter
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.040]  of George Soros' Open Society Institute.
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.920]  Robin is so active that she was made a board member of the far left nonprofit back in 2008,
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.440]  according to the OSI's website.
[02:31.440 --> 02:38.240]  Anarchy organizer McKesson essentially resides in a clear example of the supposed white suburbs
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.760]  that the deranged mob in Milwaukee is threatening to burn down.
[02:42.760 --> 02:47.840]  And while the pawns of George Soros do their part to subtly fan the flames of division
[02:47.840 --> 02:53.840]  amongst the brainwashed citizenry of the United States led by a wave of the Chicago chapter
[02:53.840 --> 02:59.000]  of the Revolutionary Communist Party now being largely blamed for the escalation in
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.400]  Milwaukee, George Soros and sons continue to build a Trojan horse of jihadist migration
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.880]  embedded refugees aimed squarely at nothing less than unleashing a total disintegration
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.760]  of Western civilization.
[03:12.760 --> 03:18.520]  The Daily Caller reports a leaked memo from left wing financer George Soros' Open Society
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.200]  Foundations argues that Europe's refugee crisis should be accepted as a new normal and that
[03:25.200 --> 03:31.400]  the refugee crisis means new opportunities for Soros' organization to influence immigration
[03:31.400 --> 03:33.400]  policies on a global scale.
[03:33.400 --> 03:39.480]  A section of the review titled Our Work describes how America's least transparent think tank
[03:39.480 --> 03:46.640]  has worked with leaders in the field to shape migration policy making and influence regional
[03:46.640 --> 03:52.320]  and global processes affecting the way migration is governed and enforced.
[03:52.320 --> 03:58.840]  In a section titled Our Ambitions the authors explain our premise for engaging in work related
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.640]  to governance was that in addition to mitigating the negative effects of enforcement we should
[04:03.640 --> 04:10.520]  also be supporting actors in the field proactively seeking to change the policies, rules and
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.800]  regulations that govern migration, anarchy at our doorstep fueled by foreign interests,
[04:16.800 --> 04:22.680]  lingering hubris in the White House and a treasonous power hungry menace is one step
[04:22.680 --> 04:25.680]  away from being the next commander-in-chief.
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.640]  Time to wake up America before you wake up homeless on the continent your father's conquered.
[04:30.640 --> 04:36.880]  You still don't get it do you boys there ain't no countries anymore no more good guys they're
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.120]  running the whole show they own everything the whole damn planet they can do whatever
[04:41.120 --> 04:46.040]  they want what's wrong with having it good for a change and they're gonna let us have
[04:46.040 --> 04:51.280]  a good if we just help them they're gonna leave us alone let's make some money you can
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.480]  have a little taste that good life too.
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.520]  John Beth for everywhere's dot com.
[04:58.520 --> 05:02.280]  They own the whole thing they run it all.
[05:02.280 --> 05:08.400]  Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com and this is an email from family Gino I took down
[05:08.400 --> 05:14.560]  my rebel flag but you can't buy on eBay anymore and pill the NRA sticker off my rear car window

[05:19.520 --> 05:24.080]  two pack of sandy flags and put one at each corner of the front yard then I purchased
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.320]  the black flag of ISIS which you can buy on eBay and ran it up the flagpole now the local
[05:29.320 --> 05:35.560]  police sheriff FBI CIA NSA Homeland Security and other agencies are all watching my house

[06:23.440 --> 06:28.840]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[06:28.840 --> 06:33.400]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all

[08:21.640 --> 08:32.120]  Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance it's Alex Jones every day I open
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.040]  the show up with the unoriginal statement that this is going to be an amazing broadcast
[08:37.040 --> 08:43.200]  there is so much information but we live on an incredible planet we live in a civilization
[08:43.200 --> 08:48.960]  just filled with wonderment magic so many great things so many awesome things also so
[08:48.960 --> 08:57.800]  many horrible things but we are in a universe of wonder and everything the global social
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.320]  engineer architects push is about shuttering perception and then only giving you a tiny
[09:04.320 --> 09:11.720]  pinhole view of the universe that they control thus playing God they're not God so they create
[09:11.720 --> 09:20.320]  a little false universe that they can rule they are the lila pulleys of the lila pulleys
[09:20.320 --> 09:27.960]  or what did they call those in that story about the lila putians that tie down the bigger
[09:27.960 --> 09:34.880]  fellow that visits their island that's where we are today and the moment we realize that
[09:34.880 --> 09:41.880]  is the moment their empire of control begins to collapse I think it was gullivers travels
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.520]  start let me just try to just mention some of the news we have here in front of us I'm
[09:46.520 --> 09:52.680]  obviously really in a great mood in so-called liberal Austin fake liberal Austin brainwashed
[09:52.680 --> 10:05.640]  Austin pseudo-intellectual Austin we witnessed 101 patriots versus Trump haters that were
[10:05.640 --> 10:11.320]  out there putting out their propaganda and disinformation we've got the video of that
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.640]  a lot of my crew had to park their cars miles away and walk into the Travis County Expo
[10:17.640 --> 10:24.640]  Center yesterday where Trump spoke to tens of thousands of people he also spoke to a
[10:24.640 --> 10:30.040]  capacity crowd at the moody theater in between going to several fundraisers even though he
[10:30.040 --> 10:38.840]  already conducted fundraisers in Fort Worth that same day talk about stamina versus Hillary
[10:38.840 --> 10:43.280]  who comes out and gives a 10 minute speech and then like a moore eel goes back into the
[10:43.280 --> 10:49.240]  dark we point that out and they say we're sexist oh how intellectual we're so threatened by
[10:49.240 --> 10:54.440]  a woman being president that's why we don't like her no she gave all the missile secrets
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.680]  to the communist Chinese for their long March ICBM and about a hundred other plus crimes
[10:59.680 --> 11:06.720]  that are on record that's why we don't like her same reason I didn't like George W. Bush
[11:06.720 --> 11:11.200]  same reason we don't like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama but I will tell you with the
[11:11.200 --> 11:15.680]  Clintons because they've been around so long they're about the worst people I've ever seen
[11:15.680 --> 11:22.320]  in history we just talk about the longevity the stamina to commit crime and then even
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.920]  as walking dead zombies still struggling towards more power more billions because believe me
[11:28.920 --> 11:35.240]  if you think they're only worth a couple hundred million I've got a bridge I want to sell you
[11:35.240 --> 11:41.400]  on another planet the Clintons have shut up foundations all over the world everything
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.640]  they do is basically secret and now real liberals like Julian Assange and others start leaking
[11:47.640 --> 11:51.280]  the information of what these master criminals are doing and it's exactly what we knew they
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.000]  were doing foreign leaders dictators corporations in some cases giving them tens of millions
[11:56.000 --> 12:02.800]  of dollars and then they go in the State Department and get the concessions with foreign governments
[12:02.800 --> 12:11.920]  to give those groups monopolies over uranium oil rare earth minerals slave labor the TPP
[12:11.920 --> 12:18.720]  legalizes slavery it actually allows it I mean these people are monstrous criminals
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.800]  and their allied with the Republican criminals at the top who are all waging war against
[12:22.800 --> 12:30.160]  Donald Trump only a crazy person would not gamble on Trump and by gamble he's an unknown
[12:30.160 --> 12:36.640]  country in many respects I think he's a good guy overall but nobody's perfect but it's
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.800]  no gamble at all it's a sure lose with what we currently have and that's what Hillary
[12:40.800 --> 12:48.920]  is the establishment incarnate manifested before our very eyes and if we don't fully
[12:48.920 --> 12:55.400]  reject her and Goldman Sachs and the communist Chinese and her biggest backer Carlos Slim
[12:55.400 --> 13:03.880]  the Mexican kingpin talk about Lord of the Flies this guy is El Hefe he's what all the
[13:03.880 --> 13:10.040]  other kingpins wish they were and we sit here as a captured nation divided up kind of like
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.560]  China was a few hundred years ago by the allied powers that's really what globalism is but
[13:14.560 --> 13:21.720]  it's corporations dividing up countries not countries dividing up countries it is slavery
[13:21.720 --> 13:27.200]  and that perception that that two-party or in Europe three-four-party illusion where
[13:27.200 --> 13:31.160]  they're all basically in cahoots together at the top is being shattered by populist
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.800]  like Nigel Farage in the UK and like Donald Trump here in the United States so regardless
[13:35.800 --> 13:39.840]  of whether Donald Trump's perfect or not or Nigel Farage's perfect or not or if Alex
[13:39.840 --> 13:47.480]  Jones is perfect or not it is a sign of populism growing a tremor before the larger quakes
[13:47.480 --> 13:56.280]  that you can bet are imminent and the seismic shift is humanity awakening a lot of folks
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.320]  asked me why I didn't go to the moody event which I was obviously invited to or to the
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.680]  bigger event in north Austin was open to the public and I said info wars was there we sent
[14:08.680 --> 14:14.280]  a bunch of our great reporters they did an amazing job but info wars was there in the
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.600]  thousands of hillary for prison shirts and info or shirts you are info wars not Alex
[14:19.600 --> 14:26.920]  Jones see if Alex Jones doesn't go to something it doesn't matter because you're there you
[14:26.920 --> 14:33.000]  are info wars people need to figure that out getting Donald Trump on the show which is
[14:33.000 --> 14:42.400]  going to come on soon I haven't really pushed for it isn't what it's all about it's about
[14:42.400 --> 14:47.360]  changing the narrative back towards renaissance common sense and reality and it's about seeing
[14:47.360 --> 14:55.200]  Donald Trump carry the banner of liberty that's the success not going to some dinner and sitting
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.720]  around eating steaks and being patted on the head if Donald Trump gets elected I really
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.600]  don't think I'm going to go to the line house I don't think I'm going to go have coffee
[15:03.600 --> 15:07.120]  at the line house and it's not because it wouldn't be interesting and I wouldn't want
[15:07.120 --> 15:15.720]  to do it it's that emblematically as a symbol that is an important going to the king's court
[15:15.720 --> 15:21.600]  is not what's important overthrowing the globalist and the new world order is what is important
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.840]  celebrating that for generations to come and we'll have more crises to face this is just
[15:26.840 --> 15:34.800]  one contest in the animating contest of liberty what's exciting is breaking news having whistleblowers
[15:34.800 --> 15:40.440]  on changing the world and by the way that's what brings in the ratings that's what brings
[15:40.440 --> 15:52.480]  in the funding not having a big guest on the show that's what this comes down to and so
[15:52.480 --> 15:59.600]  it's very refreshing to be able to sit there last night with my children in the backyard
[15:59.600 --> 16:07.600]  with the stars above us after dinner and to be able to watch on a laptop different feeds
[16:07.600 --> 16:14.720]  of our crew live down there reporting on what was really happening that was the enjoyment
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.080]  that was the satisfaction not I can run down there and I can be in front of some more cameras
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.600]  and be on the news more and maybe maybe be in the Associated Press and my center and
[16:23.600 --> 16:28.640]  I explained that I don't want to be in the mainstream media I don't care about being
[16:28.640 --> 16:33.040]  in the mainstream media it's not because I'm saying I'm arrogant I'm important I'm only
[16:33.040 --> 16:40.680]  a test tube example of what will bring down this corrupt false reality in that I've had
[16:40.680 --> 16:49.160]  the London Guardian Esquire I mean you name it BBC Al Jazeera and dozens of other major
[16:49.160 --> 16:52.800]  outlets in just the last few weeks call up and want to do profiles want to do this and
[16:52.800 --> 16:58.720]  that and I told them no and they would send back numbers about what we have 100 million
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.320]  viewers or whatever and I just said look make up whatever you want I'm not going to be a
[17:04.320 --> 17:11.000]  set piece in your fantasy land I'm not going to act like you really interviewed me and
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.480]  then pretend that you're journalist when you're mercenaries make up whatever you want you don't
[17:16.480 --> 17:25.200]  matter anymore you're over it's that simple and it's important to dust the dirt off our
[17:25.200 --> 17:29.520]  feet we go in our house it's really important to shun these people it's really important
[17:29.520 --> 17:38.600]  to cut them off and realize these are folks that have sold their souls to the most evil
[17:38.600 --> 17:45.560]  people this planet has ever seen and the only way we're going to redeem ourselves is pulling
[17:45.560 --> 17:53.880]  out of their system and that will bring them down but again I only illustrate that to explain
[17:53.880 --> 17:59.800]  it it doesn't bring any success for my name just to be in a few more newspapers and then
[17:59.800 --> 18:07.280]  have them distort it what matters is actually reaching out to real people and helping them
[18:07.280 --> 18:13.520]  pull back the curtain in their own life to see what's going on in the real world not
[18:13.520 --> 18:19.760]  getting what we say not taking what we say as reality but only helping them take the
[18:19.760 --> 18:24.360]  blinders off and from their rose color darkly they may see something different than what
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.720]  we see the point is it's about getting out of the box coming out of Plato's cave that's

[18:42.880 --> 18:50.440]  of how enjoyable it is to be offered a major Hollywood role and to turn it down how enjoyable

[18:58.400 --> 19:04.160]  broken with it and that's why it's coming in with censorship and control the final action

[24:37.520 --> 24:48.800]  in
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.080]  I met him out at Waco covering the trial and things that were happening there with the
[24:53.080 --> 24:54.580]  dividends.
[24:54.580 --> 25:01.360]  And he's had shows on the BBC and shows on, you name it, Channel 4.
[25:01.360 --> 25:06.720]  And he lives here in the United States, rented to him at the DNC, and he's written some thought-provoking
[25:06.720 --> 25:08.220]  articles.
[25:08.220 --> 25:11.040]  So he wanted to interview me, and I said, sure, let's do it.
[25:11.040 --> 25:14.320]  So he's going to be here with us today.
[25:14.320 --> 25:15.320]  That's coming up.
[25:15.320 --> 25:17.560]  Let me see what hour that is.
[25:17.560 --> 25:19.160]  That's going to come up in the third hour.
[25:19.160 --> 25:21.320]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour.
[25:21.320 --> 25:27.320]  Owen Schreuer, Carl the Cuck Slayer, is going to be co-hosting with me a little bit into
[25:27.320 --> 25:28.320]  the next hour.
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.440]  He's now been officially hired as an InfoWars reporter.
[25:32.440 --> 25:35.600]  Folks that don't know about the meme, AIDS, Scree-Lix, and Carl the Cuck, it's been seen
[25:35.600 --> 25:43.040]  by hundreds of millions of people online and has become quite an art piece of two, I don't
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.840]  have to say mine warped cult members, in my opinion, screaming, you're an effing white
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.120]  male, your opinion doesn't matter, and they're effing white males, you know, just no logic,
[25:53.120 --> 25:54.120]  no nothing.
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.960]  And I feel sorry for these guys because they've been turned into internet memes, but they
[25:57.960 --> 25:59.200]  did it to themselves.
[25:59.200 --> 26:00.640]  We didn't create the meme.
[26:00.640 --> 26:07.720]  Now, I've offered them money to come on air here, and I'd actually be nice to them.
[26:07.720 --> 26:11.920]  So it was $5,000 a piece to come here.
[26:11.920 --> 26:16.720]  It's now $10,000 a piece to come here and spend a day or two with us, and I'm serious
[26:16.720 --> 26:20.760]  about that, and that's as big as my budget goes, and I actually want to be nice to you.
[26:20.760 --> 26:28.720]  I want to do like a six-hour live event with you where I try to deprogram you.
[26:28.720 --> 26:29.720]  I'm serious.
[26:29.720 --> 26:35.520]  We could almost do it like the cult deprogrammers doing the hotel room or something, you know.
[26:35.520 --> 26:39.040]  I don't want to make a joke out of it, seriously.
[26:39.040 --> 26:44.960]  It's just like when we got Obama phone lady here, and we took care of her when I got her
[26:44.960 --> 26:45.960]  clothes.
[26:45.960 --> 26:46.960]  I try to not make fun of her.
[26:46.960 --> 26:47.960]  She's super funny.
[26:47.960 --> 26:48.960]  I mean, I'm funny sometimes, too.
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.160]  I mean, she acts like a muppet, but it's funny.
[26:53.160 --> 26:58.800]  I mean, she's a lovely lady, and she's been here a few times, and we really like her.
[26:58.800 --> 27:05.200]  I don't see Carl the Cuck and AIDS Creelix as being as lovable, but I really would try
[27:05.200 --> 27:09.400]  to reach out to you and explain to you how the social engineering works and what's been
[27:09.400 --> 27:10.400]  done to you.
[27:10.400 --> 27:12.960]  That's my final offer.
[27:12.960 --> 27:22.040]  Expenses paid, fly you here, put you in an ice hotel, $10,000 apiece to Carl the Cuck
[27:22.040 --> 27:29.720]  and AIDS Creelix, kings of the social justice warrior comedy gold.
[27:29.720 --> 27:32.800]  I mean, these people, they're better than Ghostbusters, the original.
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.700]  They're better than Caddyshack, they're better than Dr. Strange Love.
[27:36.700 --> 27:37.700]  You are gods.
[27:37.700 --> 27:39.200]  Do you understand this?
[27:39.200 --> 27:42.240]  And I want to launch your career.
[27:42.240 --> 27:45.440]  Once you wake up, you can still play the part of your previous self.
[27:45.440 --> 27:49.480]  Like it'd be like Paul playing Saul of Tarsus.
[27:49.480 --> 27:57.040]  I think he was actually a professional globalist operator and kingpin and executor and torture.
[27:57.040 --> 27:58.040]  That's not a good allegory.
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  Sorry.
[27:59.040 --> 28:02.280]  But something like that, we could transmute you.
[28:02.280 --> 28:10.280]  We could engage in alchemy here on air and free you of your anti-liberal, new world order,
[28:10.280 --> 28:11.280]  weaponized mind control.
[28:11.280 --> 28:12.920]  Now, now I'm going to stop right there.
[28:12.920 --> 28:13.920]  I've got so much news.
[28:13.920 --> 28:15.880]  It seems from the news is the most incredible.
[28:15.880 --> 28:16.880]  I don't get to it.
[28:16.880 --> 28:19.720]  Let me tell you what's coming up.
[28:19.720 --> 28:28.000]  The stories are up on infowars.com right now and they all dovetail and tie in together.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.600]  This is out of the gateway pundit, WikiLeaks, 67 emails between Hillary and Chelsea Clinton
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.720]  under her fake name, Diane Reynolds.
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.320]  Now when you do that, when you're operating, supposedly under government oversight, there
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.320]  are a lot of crimes being committed if you look into that deeper.
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.680]  And of course, we know about that because newly released email show, this is from a few years
[28:49.680 --> 28:57.120]  ago, 2013, EPA director's extensive use of fictional alter ego and that was to abscond
[28:57.120 --> 29:04.360]  from the laws dealing with freedom of information act for years, which the government in mass
[29:04.360 --> 29:07.960]  has been rebelling against the press and the people and more and more not releasing them.
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.720]  So government patriots, most of them not Russians, most of them American patriots and others
[29:13.720 --> 29:18.640]  have been hacking in and leaking the info and now it's just a deluge.
[29:18.640 --> 29:30.960]  A trickle has turned into a torrent, a tempest, a monsoon, typhoon, the likes of which the
[29:30.960 --> 29:37.360]  world's never seen is about to hit, but the leading edge of the storm is now upon us and
[29:37.360 --> 29:40.840]  the criminals are shaking in their boots, openly saying they want to censor the internet
[29:40.840 --> 29:43.880]  and start arresting their detractors.
[29:43.880 --> 29:51.400]  You see, you try it with that diaper on Hillary.
[29:51.400 --> 30:02.320]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:02.320 --> 30:05.640]  Report check government tells citizens to prepare for the worst.
[30:05.640 --> 30:10.360]  Paul Joseph Watson reports on Sunday reports out of Germany said the government is set
[30:10.360 --> 30:15.760]  to enact a new concept for civil defense, which will require the population to stockpile
[30:15.760 --> 30:17.520]  enough food for 10 days.
[30:17.520 --> 30:21.320]  On the other side of the border, check media is reporting that the country's food reserves
[30:21.320 --> 30:26.320]  are struggling and would be incapable of meeting demand in the event of a national crisis.
[30:26.320 --> 30:31.840]  The government is calling on citizens to increase their self-sufficiency and food safety by stockpiling
[30:31.840 --> 30:32.840]  more food.
[30:32.840 --> 30:37.040]  According to a resident of the Czech Republic, news stations reporting on the story out of
[30:37.040 --> 30:41.280]  Germany also reveal how the Czech government is telling its citizens to be prepared for
[30:41.280 --> 30:46.120]  the worst case possible scenario, which is likely to be a large-scale catastrophic terror
[30:46.120 --> 30:48.520]  attack or a nuclear disaster.
[30:48.520 --> 30:52.760]  As we reported earlier this month, the Czech president is also pushing for a change to
[30:52.760 --> 30:57.560]  the law that would make it easier for citizens to own firearms in order to defend themselves
[30:57.560 --> 30:59.080]  against chihadists.

[34:11.260 --> 34:16.980]  channel about. Hey Joe, how you doing? I'm Jack Strickland. The question I don't see being
[34:16.980 --> 34:22.140]  addressed is the abundance of references in our emails about AIDS, Skrillex. You're a
[34:22.140 --> 34:28.260]  white male! You're a white man! Sorry about that. We're going to go ahead and move on.
[34:28.260 --> 34:37.060]  Oh, I can say is the Death Star will be completed on schedule. I am so excited. There is so
[34:37.060 --> 34:40.940]  much news to go over. I love the tens of thousands of emails coming out every week
[34:40.940 --> 34:46.740]  that just show the total organized crime evil of the arrogant Clintons, George Soros, and
[34:46.740 --> 34:53.540]  others. Major European papers, Israeli papers are calling him an egomaniac, trying to bring
[34:53.540 --> 34:58.500]  down the world. I mean, amazing things are happening. The planet is waking up. Venezuela
[34:58.500 --> 35:05.500]  is disintegrating into a communist dystopia, as they always do. We have massive footage
[35:05.500 --> 35:10.260]  clips. We're going to be playing from the big Trump rallies that were capacity crowds
[35:10.260 --> 35:19.300]  here in the ATX, Austin, Texas. Yesterday, we have a ton of news dealing with globalism,
[35:19.300 --> 35:24.420]  all over the world. That's just modern colonialism as all it is, but by corporations. In serious,
[35:24.420 --> 35:29.740]  serious trouble, all of this and more is coming up today. We have some huge Zika news also
[35:29.740 --> 35:37.060]  coming up in the next hour, but I am so excited that Owen Schreuer is here. I've been so busy
[35:37.060 --> 35:41.300]  the last six months since this whole Carl the cock thing kicked off that Rob do caught
[35:41.300 --> 35:48.220]  on a video and has since gone so viral. And so I've been somewhat following Owen's work,
[35:48.220 --> 35:52.460]  but not as much as a lot of other people on the internet. But all I know is we hired him.
[35:52.460 --> 35:57.100]  He's here. He's a great patriot in journalism school working in radio already already on
[35:57.100 --> 36:02.420]  air. And we brought him down here from Missouri. And he already went out last night with the
[36:02.420 --> 36:08.340]  crew and just did. I mean, let's say it was a quarterback first day in the NFL. He threw
[36:08.340 --> 36:14.260]  30 touchdown passes. And so it's just a great spirit with the rest of our great crew here.
[36:14.260 --> 36:18.380]  So it's good to have you on board. Well, thank you, Alex. It's you know, you were my original
[36:18.380 --> 36:23.620]  inspiration to get into current events and politics. And this is just it's just great
[36:23.620 --> 36:30.460]  to be here. I, I'm motivated to have people experience the same awakening process that
[36:30.460 --> 36:35.300]  I experienced that there's things that matter out there more than the Kardashians, more
[36:35.300 --> 36:39.700]  than their local sports teams, more than Drake's latest album drop. There's things that actually
[36:39.700 --> 36:43.820]  affect our future and our lineage. And that's what we need. But Drake's album drops are
[36:43.820 --> 36:47.300]  good. I mean, I don't listen to a lot of hip hop when he drops want to do less. I heard
[36:47.300 --> 36:51.540]  that Carl the cock got the first initial release of the next Drake album. He's got
[36:51.540 --> 36:56.220]  it pre-ordered ready to go. Wow. I want to get into last night. I want to play a bunch
[36:56.220 --> 37:01.780]  of clips that you and the crew shot, but there's so much to cover here. But for listeners,
[37:01.780 --> 37:04.980]  there's weren't a lot of AM and FM stations, Christian stations, a lot of great people
[37:04.980 --> 37:08.900]  picking it up. They don't know about internet memes or Carl the cock or AIDS, Crelix and
[37:08.900 --> 37:13.940]  what superstars these guys are. And the fact that they're in hiding and won't, you know,
[37:13.940 --> 37:16.340]  come out of hiding. I mean, we know their real names. We're not putting them out. We
[37:16.340 --> 37:19.660]  don't want to hurt them. They did this to themselves. I think they really should come
[37:19.660 --> 37:24.020]  in. Well, I don't know why you wouldn't come here. You've got thousands of dollars on
[37:24.020 --> 37:28.540]  the table. At the very least, you would think that they would do it for the very sake of
[37:28.540 --> 37:32.500]  having 10 grand in their bank account. I mean, I don't know an individual who wouldn't take
[37:32.500 --> 37:36.380]  that offer. And here's the thing that I can, everybody knows I pay up. And here's the thing
[37:36.380 --> 37:41.460]  I continue to experience, Alex. Why is it that people feel the need? They're motivated.
[37:41.460 --> 37:45.820]  They're vindicated enough to go out and protest, to go out and put their voice and their face
[37:45.820 --> 37:50.340]  in the streets in these protests. But then when you offer them a platform, when you say,
[37:50.340 --> 37:54.340]  I want to hear your opinion, they cower away. They should all they can do is scream. You're
[37:54.340 --> 37:59.340]  an effing white male. Last night, no one, hardly anyone, you talked to maybe a hundred
[37:59.340 --> 38:03.420]  folks. I've watched hours of videos last night this morning. I couldn't pull away from it.
[38:03.420 --> 38:08.380]  And almost no one could form any legitimate issues. They would just scream and cuss at
[38:08.380 --> 38:14.980]  you. I would say I probably talked to 60 to 70 Trump protesters yesterday. I would say
[38:14.980 --> 38:20.980]  three of them. And I can even kind of remember in my memory who they were. But three of them,
[38:20.980 --> 38:25.980]  I would say, could actually hold a conversation. So I would say we're looking at three in about
[38:25.980 --> 38:31.500]  65 people that protest Donald Trump can actually have a conversation. And there's plenty of
[38:31.500 --> 38:33.300]  points you can make against Donald Trump.
[38:33.300 --> 38:34.300]  And we let them talk.
[38:34.300 --> 38:37.420]  And I'm not sitting here saying Donald Trump is perfect. That's not the point that we ever
[38:37.420 --> 38:41.140]  make, especially when we're out on the streets like this. We're just putting a microphone
[38:41.140 --> 38:45.540]  out there saying, hey, look, you have a cause. You're out here protesting. You're executing
[38:45.540 --> 38:49.500]  your right to free speech. Here's a platform. Let's hear your points. And then what happens
[38:49.500 --> 38:51.780]  when we offer them that platform, they back away.
[38:51.780 --> 38:53.700]  Well, the best part is that they call me a racist.
[38:53.700 --> 38:57.420]  The best part is like the 18 year old girls that are communists, and they don't even know
[38:57.420 --> 39:01.460]  what it is. And then all they want to do is kiss on camera, which we were happy to show.
[39:01.460 --> 39:02.660]  I mean, this is crazy.
[39:02.660 --> 39:08.260]  Well, and then did you notice I asked her about communism and she didn't have a clue?
[39:08.260 --> 39:11.780]  I asked her about who Alex Jones was. She didn't have a clue. So she's like, I'm going
[39:11.780 --> 39:15.060]  to out here. I'm going to out here. I'm going to say I'm for communism. I'm going to say
[39:15.060 --> 39:19.260]  I'm against Alex Jones. But then I say, well, do you know who Alex Jones is? She has no
[39:19.260 --> 39:22.820]  idea what that is. That's just like communism. She doesn't know what communism is, but she
[39:22.820 --> 39:26.440]  thinks she likes it. She doesn't know who Alex Jones is, but she thinks that for some
[39:26.440 --> 39:28.860]  reason you're a bad guy.
[39:28.860 --> 39:35.820]  We've got a lot of these clips. Did you guys just pop them here and say we have that? Yeah,
[39:35.820 --> 39:39.140]  let's play that for viewers. Again, most of the audience is radio listeners. I'm always
[39:39.140 --> 39:43.540]  reminding folks you can tune in and then full wars.com forward slash show and some TV stations
[39:43.540 --> 39:46.460]  around the country and cable systems. And I haven't even really rolled that initiative
[39:46.460 --> 39:50.540]  out yet, but it's already already happening. Strangely enough, it's the nightly news getting
[39:50.540 --> 39:54.700]  put on radio. Like I never thought that would happen. It's kind of like you build it and
[39:54.700 --> 39:57.980]  they come, but not the way you thought they'd come. And I'm kind of conducting an interview
[39:57.980 --> 40:02.580]  to here for the newspaper reporter that's here writing a story. So we're always multitasking
[40:02.580 --> 40:07.620]  and breaking all this down. Let's play some of this clip. This is from outside the Travis
[40:07.620 --> 40:10.820]  County Expo Center in North Austin. Here it is.
[40:10.820 --> 40:16.540]  Hey, free speech. So we're out here protesting. Well, you don't want Alex Jones right to free
[40:16.540 --> 40:20.460]  speech. I don't even know who the f*** Alex Jones is. You are just chanting Alex Jones
[40:20.460 --> 40:24.260]  out of Austin. Yeah, I know what I was saying. I'm not stupid. So you say things you know
[40:24.260 --> 40:29.660]  nothing about? Yeah. So like communism. Well, I'm Russian. I know plenty about that. So
[40:29.660 --> 40:33.980]  you should know why communism is bad. Yeah, I do know why communism. So why are you out
[40:33.980 --> 40:38.420]  here protesting capitalism? Are you out here interrogating me? I'm just trying to figure
[40:38.420 --> 40:45.540]  out why people are why people are protesting. You're interrogating a 15 year old. All right,
[40:45.540 --> 40:50.980]  she's out here protesting. So why can't I ask her questions? Another unintelligent
[40:50.980 --> 40:54.620]  protest. And they were sent down there by their school teacher or professor every time and
[40:54.620 --> 40:58.340]  they just tell them what to go do. And then they go running out there and they get out
[40:58.340 --> 41:02.380]  of their parents Mercedes. We have video of this at other commie demonstrations. They
[41:02.380 --> 41:07.340]  get out of brand new Jaguars. And then they come over and run into people, not these communists,
[41:07.340 --> 41:12.420]  but others try to run into old men in wheelchairs. They always attack like crazed wolves, the
[41:12.420 --> 41:16.340]  weakest person. It's crazy. Well, in that video, too, one of those communists who had
[41:16.340 --> 41:20.500]  a bandana on, he comes over to me and starts trying to elbow me. The same thing he did
[41:20.500 --> 41:24.540]  to you. And then afterwards, I think we weren't on camera. He was talking about how, yeah,
[41:24.540 --> 41:29.380]  we got Jones. We got Alex. We got him good. I was like, actually, I saw the video and
[41:29.380 --> 41:33.540]  he pretty much ran you over like a fly. That's what I saw on video. Even though I can't open
[41:33.540 --> 41:36.900]  a pickle jar. I didn't run them over. Those guys are not hard to run over. Actually, I
[41:36.900 --> 41:41.260]  heard that they super glued that pickle jar as a gag on you and you still got it open.
[41:41.260 --> 41:46.580]  No, that's what I heard. No, no. Pat Riley told me that. So I wouldn't feel bad. No,
[41:46.580 --> 41:50.060]  every 30th, 40th, 50th jar is hard to open. They bought me four of them, some poppin'
[41:50.060 --> 41:53.740]  them, show me. Well, that was like, wow, kind of hard. I'm not that strong. My hands certainly
[41:53.740 --> 41:54.740]  aren't strong.
[41:54.740 --> 42:00.460]  But it is amazing how, again, it illustrates that these protests, I mean, at nauseam, Alex,
[42:00.460 --> 42:05.940]  at nauseam, we illustrate how the Donald Trump protesters are the most ignorant, the most
[42:05.940 --> 42:11.420]  shallow people involved in political commentary. I mean, it's just exposed time and time again.
[42:11.420 --> 42:15.540]  And then we get him to admit it now. This girl just admits, well, I have no idea who
[42:15.540 --> 42:17.980]  Alex Jones is, but I'm going to chant for him to get out of-
[42:17.980 --> 42:24.260]  But I cannot wait until all of our great editors take that video and just string it all together,
[42:24.260 --> 42:26.900]  showing, I think, new stars have been born here.
[42:26.900 --> 42:31.100]  Well, we have plenty of opportunity to create new-age skrillexes. And you know what, hey,
[42:31.100 --> 42:35.580]  look, if you're a capitalist, okay, maybe you want to be the next-age skrillex because
[42:35.580 --> 42:38.540]  he's got a $10,000 offer on the table to come on this show, okay?
[42:38.540 --> 42:40.860]  And by the way, so maybe that's something-
[42:40.860 --> 42:44.940]  We don't sell them, but they're super popular. I've seen age-skrillex shirts on the streets
[42:44.940 --> 42:45.940]  of Austin.
[42:45.940 --> 42:49.340]  Yeah, the Are You Kidding Me shirt looks like Beavis and Butthead.
[42:49.340 --> 42:50.340]  Yeah.
[42:50.340 --> 42:51.340]  Yeah, that's a good one. It's a popular-
[42:51.340 --> 42:54.260]  I had to know my judge actually thinks they could be the new Beavis and Butthead. I don't
[42:54.260 --> 42:58.700]  let him know the big secret. It might not just be an all-expenses-paid trip. You might
[42:58.700 --> 43:00.420]  meet with the creator of Beavis and Butthead.
[43:00.420 --> 43:02.220]  Well, look, don't blame-
[43:02.220 --> 43:04.180]  Oh, yeah, we want you to be real stars, gentlemen.
[43:04.180 --> 43:07.780]  I don't want them because their friends troll me, Alex. They troll me on Twitter.
[43:07.780 --> 43:08.780]  They-
[43:08.780 --> 43:11.220]  Don't they understand they're about to be TV stars? They just come to Austin.
[43:11.220 --> 43:12.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[43:12.220 --> 43:13.220]  Just embrace-
[43:13.220 --> 43:18.380]  I'm not kidding. I go shooting with Mike Judge. It's not a game.
[43:18.380 --> 43:19.780]  Embrace your fame.
[43:19.780 --> 43:21.860]  Mike Judge thinks you're sexy.
[43:21.860 --> 43:25.220]  Embrace what has happened to you. You can't avoid it. It's happened. Millions of people
[43:25.220 --> 43:27.580]  have seen it. You're never going to not be age-skrillex.
[43:27.580 --> 43:32.380]  Fulfill your destiny. Join me, and I will complete your training.
[43:32.380 --> 43:33.380]  $10,000-
[43:33.380 --> 43:36.980]  Only then, cock, will you have the true power.
[43:36.980 --> 43:41.980]  Are You Kidding Me? You won't take $10,000 to come to Austin and then have an opportunity
[43:41.980 --> 43:46.420]  to expand your brand name as Carl the Cuck to a career?
[43:46.420 --> 43:48.420]  You know who else is coming to Austin? Hillary Clinton.
[43:48.420 --> 43:51.580]  I had absolutely no knowledge of those state departments.
[43:51.580 --> 43:52.580]  I believe her.
[43:52.580 --> 43:56.580]  No, she has more. She always says the same thing. We can actually elect this as president.
[43:56.580 --> 44:00.260]  I've never been influenced in a vote by anyone who has paid me money.
[44:00.260 --> 44:03.420]  I would actually vote for that doll before I would vote for Hillary Clinton.
[44:03.420 --> 44:06.420]  You see, if I ever lied to the public-
[44:06.420 --> 44:08.540]  Yeah, go ahead. We've got-
[44:08.540 --> 44:09.540]  He's never lied.
[44:09.540 --> 44:12.220]  Just go ahead and roll this next clip. Here it is. Why don't you describe it? Just go
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.220]  ahead and roll the next one.
[44:13.220 --> 44:18.060]  All right, folks. Owen Schroyer here at infowars.com, and I'm about to be schooled.
[44:18.060 --> 44:23.860]  Anybody who's out in the Texas summer wearing a coat and tie isn't any of it yet.
[44:23.860 --> 44:26.180]  What if I got paid a million dollars to do it?
[44:26.180 --> 44:30.180]  I might do it for a million dollars, but I wouldn't vote for Trump for a million dollars.
[44:30.180 --> 44:34.300]  What do you think would be a more idiotic move? Wearing a suit and tie in the Texas
[44:34.300 --> 44:42.060]  heat or voting Clinton? A stupid move? That's a stupid question. Where are you from?
[44:42.060 --> 44:46.620]  So you didn't answer the question, though. Oh, yes. It's stupider to wear a coat and tie.
[44:46.620 --> 44:50.620]  So it's dumber for me to come out here and get a little hot, but it's not as dumb to
[44:50.620 --> 44:53.420]  vote Clinton who will continue the destruction of this country.
[44:53.420 --> 44:56.940]  Right. You're the stupid one. Thank you for your time.
[44:56.940 --> 45:00.780]  Hey, I'm the stupid one. Hey, who did your face paint?
[45:00.780 --> 45:02.940]  Me. You did your own face paint?
[45:02.940 --> 45:05.260]  Yeah. Are you a professional makeup artist?
[45:05.260 --> 45:09.660]  No, we were supposed to come out here looking like clowns to show what a clown Trump is.
[45:09.660 --> 45:11.420]  And so... Any of it failed?
[45:11.420 --> 45:15.660]  I'm all in. So do you think it's dumber to put on a suit and tie in the Texas heat or
[45:15.660 --> 45:17.260]  paint your face?
[45:17.260 --> 45:20.140]  Suit and tie. I'm not nearly as hot as you are.
[45:20.140 --> 45:22.540]  All right. Thank you, honey. You've been very, you've been very good.
[45:22.540 --> 45:24.700]  Oh, and Shroyer from infowars.com. Uh-oh.
[45:27.260 --> 45:29.260]  We got to believe that we're cussing. All right, now.
[45:29.260 --> 45:33.660]  What's funny is she doesn't get, we dress, you dress like that and put the American flag,
[45:33.660 --> 45:40.380]  lapel, pit on to trigger them. You did that so it would bring the commies in like flies.
[45:40.380 --> 45:41.180]  Do you know what?
[45:41.180 --> 45:46.380]  Well, how funny is this? I asked her if she would, she basically said she wouldn't vote
[45:46.380 --> 45:50.700]  for Trump for a million dollars. A million dollars, she would not vote for Trump.
[45:50.700 --> 45:55.100]  And apparently I'm an idiot because I'm out in the Texas heat wearing a suit and tie
[45:55.100 --> 45:58.220]  like any successful businessman might be, you know, walking around town.
[45:58.220 --> 46:01.660]  Well, that was just a way to attack you and then say you're not from around here or
[46:01.660 --> 46:05.580]  wherever. Now, expanding on this, we've got a bunch of other clips and just to mention
[46:05.580 --> 46:08.060]  some of the other huge news that's coming up, I don't want you to go over some of this
[46:08.060 --> 46:14.380]  with us. We've got the boilerplate folks with the Mexican flag saying this is get out of
[46:14.380 --> 46:17.500]  Oslin. We love Hillary Clinton. You got that boilerplate video.
[46:17.500 --> 46:22.540]  We've got tires slash with knives sticking out of them. We have the folks blocking people
[46:22.540 --> 46:26.860]  trying to get out of the Trump rally and then 30 minutes after that, the police nicely come
[46:26.860 --> 46:30.700]  up with horses and then they start claiming it's racist. So this is all on video.
[46:31.500 --> 46:37.340]  And then I've got stacks of news for the Democratic party just invoking racism everywhere.
[46:38.540 --> 46:42.220]  They're teaching college courses called how to eradicate whiteness.
[46:42.940 --> 46:46.540]  And that's obviously meant to make white people racist and then make all the other groups racist.
[46:46.540 --> 46:50.540]  So we can all be managed again, like they do in a prison. You've got the Hispanics,
[46:50.540 --> 46:53.740]  you've got the black folks, you got the white people, everybody's divided. And that's how
[46:53.740 --> 46:58.540]  the warden controls things. And there's a gang leader over each wing of the prison.
[46:58.540 --> 47:04.780]  I don't want to live in a big giant supermax prison or a medium security prison or anything.
[47:05.420 --> 47:09.900]  This is cultural control. This is just how the Romans had different areas of Rome
[47:09.900 --> 47:14.300]  that they used to control people and put them in their ghettos. This is old social control.
[47:14.300 --> 47:20.700]  We're going into it. Every Democratic run city is a festering cesspit. Other than Austin,
[47:20.700 --> 47:25.100]  it's not Democrat run. They have election fraud here. It's the most corrupt city in the country.
[47:25.100 --> 47:30.460]  I have seen it certified by us, by the state of Texas, fraud in Travis County,
[47:30.460 --> 47:35.500]  but was still certified. And I mean, I have seen the vote rigging. This is not a Democrat city.
[47:35.500 --> 47:39.980]  It may be because they've already brought down California like Locust hitting a corn field
[47:39.980 --> 47:44.940]  or a wheat field. Now they're coming and they set right up to the same, you know,
[47:44.940 --> 47:49.100]  same deal, bankrupt, destroy, waddle around, you know, human feces all over the ground,
[47:49.100 --> 47:53.580]  homeless people everywhere. I mean, they're running their same hop again, pump and dump,
[47:53.580 --> 47:58.460]  skyscrapers being built. You know, it's the same deal. This will be just implosion within 10 years
[47:58.460 --> 48:03.180]  now and they'll move on to the next zone. But we're dealing with a criminal intellect,
[48:03.180 --> 48:07.100]  which as it's doppelganger of the Republican leadership, that is the same group.
[48:07.820 --> 48:11.580]  Well, and think about this. I talk about immigration and they think I'm a racist or they
[48:11.580 --> 48:16.380]  think Trump is a racist. But what they don't understand is what these immigrants or illegal
[48:16.380 --> 48:20.620]  immigrants, whatever you want to call them are being used for is a voter block. So if nothing-
[48:20.620 --> 48:25.180]  And we have George Soros' emails saying this. Right. So we're going to overthrow your country
[48:25.180 --> 48:29.820]  and bring in globalism and merge all our countries and not give the Mexicans power.
[48:29.820 --> 48:34.300]  They're going to play all the groups off against each other and take a culture of us unifying
[48:34.300 --> 48:39.660]  around freedom and private property and free speech. And then just coming together in free
[48:39.660 --> 48:45.260]  association. They're the ones invoking race cold bloodedly to drive us apart. But then they will
[48:45.260 --> 48:49.100]  referee again as the warden. Well, it's just crazy. They'll admit the government's corrupt.
[48:49.660 --> 48:53.900]  And then here I am pointing out how it's corrupt, saying how I want to fix the corruption,
[48:53.900 --> 48:57.420]  but they think I'm racist for it. Again, I'm not racist. I'm not against immigrants.
[48:57.420 --> 49:01.900]  There's a legal process they can get here. But just in general, the illegal immigrants are being
[49:01.900 --> 49:05.820]  used for a voter block. And they admit this. And we shouldn't have to sit here and say,
[49:05.820 --> 49:10.220]  we're not racist, but we can't have open borders. No one has open borders, except Europe and the
[49:10.220 --> 49:14.300]  United States, where they don't let legal people come in. They make it hard in Europe and the US
[49:14.300 --> 49:19.500]  and then they get easy to be illegal because the parties want to manage the illegal flow and use
[49:19.500 --> 49:25.660]  these people as cutouts and a new permanent displaced underclass. So it's true. It's racist
[49:25.660 --> 49:31.420]  and evil. What's being done to third world immigrants, white, doesn't matter coming in,
[49:31.420 --> 49:36.780]  because it is a permanent underclass system meant to undercut the rest of the strata and
[49:36.780 --> 49:41.340]  implode the free market system that the globalist can't compete with. They've always wanted to
[49:41.340 --> 49:45.740]  destroy the American system. And this is an attempt to destroy the Renaissance system that
[49:45.740 --> 49:51.580]  hit its flower in the American system. That is what we're witnessing is the planned demolition,
[49:52.140 --> 50:00.460]  destruction, absolute tenfold decimation, complete and absolute eradication of the
[50:00.460 --> 50:05.180]  engine of prosperity. And most Americans will look at the dots on the map. Issues here,
[50:05.180 --> 50:09.580]  this is a dot. An issue here, this is a dot. But what we're seeing now is the lines connecting
[50:09.580 --> 50:13.580]  the dots are being exposed. We're seeing the voter blocks. We're seeing how they're rigging
[50:13.580 --> 50:19.580]  elections. We have the fricking battle plans from their top general. They have cornwallis and
[50:19.580 --> 50:24.540]  we had George Washington. I mean, they're fricking generals and Nazi collaborator Weirdo that thinks
[50:24.540 --> 50:30.620]  he's the Messiah. No, you're not. You're an old fat degenerate daemon prepared for hell. So you've
[50:30.620 --> 50:35.660]  got an apple in your mouth, pig. You've got logical thinking Americans who are starting to see the
[50:35.660 --> 50:39.420]  lines. They're starting to connect the dots and they're realizing that Donald Trump is their
[50:39.420 --> 50:43.020]  best option. And then you've got people with no intellect, no research. Do you feel the spirit
[50:43.020 --> 50:52.940]  of liberty rising? I can feel it. Oh man, 1776 is on fire and nothing's gonna stop it. Nothing.
[50:52.940 --> 51:00.140]  The brush fires of liberty are raging and 100 mile winds are coming in. The inferno is a trillion

[54:18.780 --> 54:26.860]  All right. Dr. Grubbs can be with us for 20 minutes into the next hour, 20 minutes into the third
[54:26.860 --> 54:33.020]  hour. And then we've got John Ronson, who writes for The Guardian. You name it. He's the best-selling
[54:33.020 --> 54:36.540]  author. I think the number one New York Times best-selling author. Written a bunch of books
[54:36.540 --> 54:41.980]  that I'm in. In one of them, them. He wrote Minutes to Steric Goats about some of the Army
[54:41.980 --> 54:46.860]  secretive operations. I will tell you, General Stubblebine says the movie's not very accurate.
[54:46.860 --> 54:51.180]  And it's great that I get to interview Stubblebine and John Ronson. But we'll talk about all of that
[54:52.140 --> 54:56.700]  coming up. But Owen Schreuer is here. Owen, we should have mentioned a little bit,
[54:57.340 --> 55:00.540]  just a minute before we get back to the Trump rally last night. Some amazing clips. We've got
[55:00.540 --> 55:03.980]  a bunch of news. We're going to be breaking down 20 minutes to the next hour. A little bit about
[55:03.980 --> 55:09.740]  yourself, though, overall. Well, I grew up a big sports fan. My dream was to be in sports media.
[55:09.740 --> 55:15.100]  And I was well on track. I was on that path. I was working in sports media. But what happened
[55:15.100 --> 55:19.420]  was, for the first time in my life, after the Boston Marathon bombing, and I mean this, for the
[55:19.420 --> 55:25.580]  first time in my life, I watched a news report on Fox or CNN. I paid attention to anything to do
[55:25.580 --> 55:29.340]  with news or current events for the first time in my life. So there's multiple bubbles. You were
[55:29.340 --> 55:35.100]  totally on the sports plantation. Then you went out of that cave into a larger cave and were into
[55:35.100 --> 55:40.060]  the kind of mainstream media spectrum. Well, what happened was, I went to that spectrum for the first
[55:40.060 --> 55:46.940]  time. And just immediately, instinctually, felt I was being conned. Felt I was being tricked.
[55:46.940 --> 55:52.220]  Felt like the things I was hearing and seeing weren't real. And it just left me scratching
[55:52.220 --> 55:57.580]  my head and wanting more answers. And I started digging and digging. And you know how the rabbit
[55:57.580 --> 56:03.100]  hole is. You start to turn things up. You start to say, oh, well, Rich DeLaurier clearly lied in
[56:03.100 --> 56:08.860]  the Boston Marathon bombing reports. The judge or tease was the same judge who was on the Aaron
[56:08.860 --> 56:14.060]  and I forget his last name. The student who the point is, we don't know exactly what happened,
[56:14.060 --> 56:19.740]  but the whole thing is a cover up, right? Psyop drills, weird stuff involved. I mean,
[56:19.740 --> 56:24.220]  really, really crazy, just crazy stuff happening. So it just led me down the rabbit hole. I started
[56:24.220 --> 56:28.940]  questioning everything from 9 11 to vaccines to the lines that everybody sees in the sky,
[56:28.940 --> 56:34.540]  but never questions. And it all just led me to the rabbit hole. And I became a big fan of yours.
[56:34.540 --> 56:38.780]  I became a big fan of info wars. I became a big fan of alternative media and I just felt that
[56:39.660 --> 56:42.780]  I mean, honestly, we call it alternative. I mean, when it's not that alternative media is
[56:42.780 --> 56:47.900]  perfect, real media, but it's the real media. The system is more and more just absolutely
[56:47.900 --> 56:52.700]  bankrupt or people in the system are decided to make the right decision. Like the CBS reporter,
[56:52.700 --> 56:56.780]  what Cheryl Atkinson, and then she gets fired. Well, and what it's okay because then she goes out,
[56:56.780 --> 57:02.700]  does her own thing. What it came down to for me was I can't go on air and cover sports anymore.
[57:02.700 --> 57:07.740]  I can't sit here and pretend like I care. Like sports is my passion. Like sports is my future.
[57:07.740 --> 57:13.180]  And and feed continue to feed the sheeple on this planet. And I'm not mad at people that watch sports.
[57:13.180 --> 57:19.420]  I get it. But once you're shifted out of the mind control, it's a joke. Well, exactly. I love sports
[57:19.420 --> 57:22.620]  still. I still love sports. I'm not afraid to admit that I love sports. I love playing sports,
[57:22.620 --> 57:28.220]  watching sports. But the point is, sports don't matter. There's it doesn't matter. It's fun.
[57:28.220 --> 57:32.700]  It's entertainment. It's to, you know, muck it up with your boys. They have over 200 vaccines.
[57:32.700 --> 57:37.980]  They want to make forcibly injected now. California's already passed forcible inoculation laws.
[57:37.980 --> 57:42.060]  It's happened. It's happening in Europe. These vaccines admit on the inserts many of them can
[57:42.060 --> 57:46.860]  kill you or maim you. They all have horrible side effects. And they're saying we're a governments
[57:46.860 --> 57:52.220]  that have done thousands of admitted lethal test on their own populations, military, you name it,
[57:52.220 --> 57:57.340]  we're going to make you take something that mega corporations make that the ingredients are
[57:57.340 --> 58:02.700]  overall secret and we're giving them liability protection that taxpayers pay for. Okay, so you
[58:02.700 --> 58:07.900]  just laid out a bunch of facts and considering that I looked at myself in the mirror and I said,
[58:07.900 --> 58:13.740]  how can I dedicate myself to sports media? How can I sit here every day and talk at nauseam and
[58:13.740 --> 58:18.460]  follow sports when I've got real issues? And it's not just issues, Alex. This is our attacking,
[58:18.460 --> 58:22.540]  our livelihood. This is attacking our future. And then even ABC talk about mainstream media did
[58:22.540 --> 58:27.820]  its job a decade ago. Oh, it was a secret meeting at the CDC back in 2000 with the head of it. This
[58:27.820 --> 58:32.060]  was five years later. And he admitted we've got to cover this up. We've caused mass autism and
[58:32.060 --> 58:36.860]  mass brain damage. They have all the documents. So they put out a hoax discrediting Dr. Wakefield
[58:36.860 --> 58:44.060]  in England, which wasn't even real. We'll be back. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.980]  in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:33.500]  Rising up my friends, thrill of the fight, the challenge, the commitment. And we're here. We
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:39.660]  are facing scientific planetary tyranny, a technocracy in the new world order's own words.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:48.300]  The end of history, the end of life on this planet. They want the exterminism of the human
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.780]  race. That's the top cosmology of the new order. I'm not insane for saying it. They're insane for
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.140]  pushing it. Now, will they ever get to that point? I don't know, but it's a perfect rationale for
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.500]  psychopaths in control to do whatever they want. Owen Schreuer, our newest hire. We got a lot of
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.700]  great new reporters, all the reporters here just all working such great synergy together. I want to
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.780]  now cover a bunch of news because we covered some of the last hour, but let's rock it through
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.700]  a lot of this. First off, something I already mentioned, but it's so big. I want to hit it again
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:21.660]  with you. Newly released emails show EPA director's extensive use of fictional alter ego. She had to
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.980]  step down because of that. It's criminal. Well, guess what? They're using known diplomas at the
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.540]  Clinton Foundation, where Chelsea's paid $6 million a year to sit in her $10 plus million
[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:36.060]  dollar apartment. And again, I'm not trying to be mean, but you know, she's in training to be the
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:42.220]  new Mr. Ed, and she's up there doing all of this. And that was 1984, folks. I am being mean.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:49.900]  This is crazy. And now we know that she's using a fake name to basically hide with the rupture.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.820]  This is incredible. Well, and it's just, you know, you can throw it on the big mountain,
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.900]  the stack that we have of all the corruption, but it just illustrates who the Clintons are.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:05.980]  They're fakes. They are complete fakes. Why else would you go under a pseudonym to email your
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:10.300]  mother unless you're trying to hide something, unless you're a total fraud? I mean, that's the
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.980]  simple question. Well, they're spies. It's a code name. It's, it's, it's to throw the enemy off.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.660]  And we know the enemy as you can look at the mirror, folks. So we get more evidence of how
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.620]  fraudulent the Clintons are. We've got more deleted emails from Huma Abedin that have come out,
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.100]  which Clinton said never existed. She never just as we broke with stone over a month ago. It's
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:33.260]  coming out, Saudi operative. Oh, oh, and oh, oh, and we said that it was going to come out that
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:39.420]  Hillary sent people dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters out to make Bernie look bad and Trump
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.380]  look bad. And then the emails came out. I'm afraid our sources were get accurate again. Oh, oh, my
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:48.540]  gosh, wait a second. You're conspiracy. It's almost like people in the government are feeding
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:53.180]  us intel because they know that there's an occupation grip control the country. I'll say this
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.500]  for all of the people who just want to say you're a conspiracy theorist. Why don't you look and I
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:01.580]  I'm saying this to people last night. Why don't you look into the quote unquote conspiracy theories
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:07.660]  that Alex Jones talks about? They always come true. They always come true. And this is just
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:11.980]  another example. I mean, do you ever get tired of being vindicated? Alex, I got asked. Well,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.540]  really, they were already true. And most of the time, it's not even it'll be an it'll be in a piece
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:22.140]  of legislation. It'll be I don't even I'm not even speculating about this stuff. They said in the 60s
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:26.380]  and 70s and 80s, they wrote textbooks like eco science and others saying we're putting floor
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.820]  on the water to lower their fertility and dumb them down. Well, that's in Pulitzer prize winning
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.740]  books from World War Two. The Nazis did that. They learned it from Stalin during their pact with him
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.140]  that you let them into some of their gulags. This is all facts. They said we will give
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:44.780]  diet injections and injunctions will make an uprising by the proletariat as impossible as
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.900]  an uprising of sheep against the practice of eating mutton. That's the big liberal Bertrand Russell
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:56.540]  who wanted to have a nuclear war to depopulate the planet and save it. That's real liberal. Oh,
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:01.740]  man, we're going to give you injections to make you retarded so we can lord over you. That's real
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.700]  liberal. Well, that's what I'm saying. The ultimate end to modern day liberalism is first you're not
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.980]  allowed to speak, then you're not allowed to hear, then you're not allowed to see, and then you're
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:13.660]  not allowed to live. You're not allowed to breathe. I mean, that's the ultimate end to this. Look at
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.180]  how they attack language. Look how they remove everything and they create false paradigms. People
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:22.700]  say, what are you for the Republicans? No, that's their kissing cousin. It's like a two headed giant.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.660]  That's the little drooling head. There's here's the one over there that making all the shots
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:29.180]  psychopath. And there's a little yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, it thinks the other heads. It's
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:34.300]  mommy. And see, we realize this because we live in reality. But the unfortunate problem we have is
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.380]  so many people recognize how Republicans and Democrats are corrupt. So they just assume
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:43.820]  Trump is a bad guy because he's with the Republican Party. He's making a run at the globalist player
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.460]  and the big criticism. If you read some of his, what people talk to is, he just thinks they're
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.380]  a bunch of big sacks of garbage. Why should they be running it? And that may be why they, hey, maybe
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:57.260]  he's just taking it over from them. Maybe it's an intramural gang battle. That's the only way
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.580]  Trump couldn't be for real. But still, it's a gamble. Hey, we know they're bad.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.660]  A staunch anti federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution fearing it would
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.740]  become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:15.020]  that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty. His warnings ignored have now come to
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:20.300]  pass. He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were to become a
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:25.900]  great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.140]  end of your government. Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were,
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:35.740]  nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them. Today,
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:41.020]  everything the government does at every level is concealed from us. We have trade deals to manage
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.900]  our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see. Later in life, Patrick Henry
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.300]  looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:56.620]  different. Liberty, sir, was the primary object. Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort,
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:02.300]  when we should be demanding liberty. Renforwars.com, I'm David Knight. Hey, everyone.

[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:24.060]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:38.780]  All right, folks. Alex Jones here. We are into the second hour and we have a lot to cover a ton
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.580]  to go over. Owen Schreuer, one of our great new reporters. He's always Carl the Cuck Slayer out
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.380]  there doing battle with social justice warriors. He's riding shotgun with me. And then we've got
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:53.660]  Dr. Grip coming in. There's a lot of clips coming up today. A lot of clips on infowars.com,
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:09:00.060]  prisonplanet.com, amazing social justice warrior stuff. Hours and hours of them stabbing tires,
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:07.340]  waving Mexican flags, blocking people trying to leave the Trump rally, police on horses,
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:13.820]  just kind of coming up 20 feet from folks and people screaming racist. I mean, just unbelievable
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.620]  media brainwashing to divide this country. But meanwhile, we're going to play some clips of
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:24.220]  what really happened inside and what was really being said inside and why the system is so scared.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:29.580]  Breakdown, you were downtown, dealt with communists. We played some of those clips. You were also up at
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.220]  the convention center. You busted your butt with the crew yesterday. You spent a few minutes on the
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.660]  overall flavor of what you witnessed. I think one of these headlines shows the video from
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:47.100]  infowars.com details it. Three mile long lines, three mile lines coming in from major highways,
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.860]  thousands and thousands couldn't get in. I'm told it was like 20,000 got in.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:59.580]  And then meanwhile, maybe a hundred anti-Trump people just running around spewing media talking
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.580]  points. And then you talk to them and they would have no response. They were programmed to say,
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.100]  we hate Alex Jones. We hate Donald Trump. You say, who's Alex Jones? We don't know who he is.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.860]  You know, we're 15 years old. Our high school told us to come here because we're communists.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:15.900]  Oh, the state, big major corporations of hijacked America and they want you to wear a red bandana.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:22.220]  You're an idiot. Go ahead. Well, I think that first on a positive note, there's such positive
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:27.820]  energy coming from Trump supporters. I mean, there's such positive energy. You could feel
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:33.500]  patriotism rising. You can feel that awakening rising. You can feel the energy. I wasn't
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.740]  able to get into the Expo Center yesterday, but I could feel the energy that was coming out from
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:42.460]  there. 12,000 plus probably came out for this. When I've talked to Trump, that's what he brings
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.340]  up. He just goes, the energy. It's unbelievable. If you ever found out, no, it's like 20 times
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:52.140]  a rock concert. I'll tell you what, I have felt that energy before. I felt it at a world series.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:57.820]  I felt it at a Super Bowl. I felt it at a Stanley Cup playoff. Donald Trump is taking that,
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:03.660]  that energy that all humans have. Of optimism. And it's everybody has this energy. It makes
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.580]  sure, it makes the hair stand up. It gives you butterflies. You know, you can feel it. There's
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:11.020]  some sort of... People ask how he can go to 10 events a day. He is freaking high as a kite on
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.940]  energy. That's what I'm saying. That's not even, that's like not even work for me going out there
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:21.340]  yesterday. I want to be out there. I want to be out there. I'm feeling the air. This is how America
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.260]  was formed. And you know what? I'll give the, here's what I'll say. And look at the globalist
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:31.420]  minions. They're poor, pathetic, dumbed down zombies. I feel sorry for them. And that's what
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.580]  it ultimately comes down to is, you know, we're not trying to make these people our enemies.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.860]  These people aren't our enemies. I want to see the lot of liberty in their eyes. We're on the same
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.380]  team as these people. And that's... Trump's inside going. He didn't flip flop. He always said they
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:48.780]  just cut it off. We're going to make it easier to get here legally. They've made it almost impossible
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.980]  so they can control the illegals coming in as a political weapon. We're not going to do that.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.940]  If you're a felon, you're illegal, you're getting deported. And yeah, if we grab you,
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.540]  you're going to go right in. And if you're not a criminal, then boom, you can come back in.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:03.260]  And now he's going further saying, and all of us need to hire folks and work together with
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:07.180]  citizens, everybody, and build this economy. He's saying that when he's in predominantly
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.180]  white cities, saying you need to hire minorities. But that's, it's not some affirmative action.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.540]  He's saying hire these people, come together, not state run, but a spirit, something where we
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:21.420]  want to do it. True liberalism. They're scared of him. Well, there's a weird dynamic happening here
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:28.060]  too, where what we want to do is we want to break down these barriers between us and the Trump
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:34.220]  protesters, where we can start to agree on facts and agree on logic. But we can't even get to that
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:39.180]  point, Alex, because they're so brainwashed. They think we're racist because we support Trump.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:44.540]  They buy into the media spin that you just illustrated. So I can't even engage these
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.820]  people on the level to bring us all on the same team and move forward together.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.740]  And there's hours of this just from last night on infowars.com. And the crew's welcome to roll
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.540]  some of the B roll in the background for TV viewers. But let's go ahead and start getting to
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.460]  what was happening inside that these poor people never get to see on national news,
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:02.940]  because they don't show hardly anything Trump says, except little clips out of order to deceive
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.820]  people. I only saw one media outlet yesterday. You know who that was? infowars.com. I didn't
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.900]  see any other media source there yesterday. No one. It's incredible. They'll have a few
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:17.260]  inside to distort it. And that's it. This is so evident. The entire enemy system is just freaked
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.780]  out. Now this is RW Bray, who I want to get on. I want to get this going for a while.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:25.180]  Black Trump supporter says liberal politics and the Democratic Party. Let's play that clip.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.820]  Coming up to me and cursing at me and calling me racist. Why won't you comment?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.980]  Why are you banging a drum? Is it hot out here?
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:43.260]  All right, this guy won't provide me nothing. You're out here. I don't understand people that
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:48.940]  I'm not in your face. Calm down. Okay. And I'll ask for two clips and confuse them. That's that's
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.100]  we've got hours of people will not respond. They will not talk almost any of them because they've
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.660]  been told don't talk. They've been sent there by the Soros Foundation about the communists. I mean,
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.260]  we've seen this over and over again over the years. Communists will never talk to you or
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.740]  they'll just threaten you. Now let's go ahead and play the clip of RW Bray. There's several
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:13.340]  these clubs. Here it is. There was a time I could mention the names of William Lord Garrison
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.140]  or Frederick Douglass and people would know exactly who I'm talking about.
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:26.700]  But that was 170 years ago. And along with our hats and our coats, we've hung up our values
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:37.740]  and our morals, same morals that are made of miracle great. I can't help but believe that
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:45.260]  maybe there's some return to that. But those names are all but been erased in the chronicles of history.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:53.340]  But make no mistake about it. Slavery has returned.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:01.740]  And she is more vicious than ever before. Because this time she is colorblind.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:09.660]  Well, this time it's scientific. They call it a technocracy. The globals do. Here's another clip
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:17.420]  of RW Bray speaking about the Clintons war on drugs, which is the minimum sentencing
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:24.860]  that they said was to make black people heal like a doll. Now imagine if Trump said something
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:33.980]  like that. It'd be the end of the world. Here's that clip. Jim Crow laws, like the Clintons war
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:50.060]  on drugs has incarcerated millions of black men, has left millions of women without husbands,
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:16:00.380]  millions of children fatherless. And the weaponized media to push it. The reason why 1.5 million
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:07.740]  black men are not in our communities is because of the war on drugs. That's the Democrats
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:13.660]  fool out assault against the black man. And let's be honest, the Republicans are bigoted to Nixon.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:19.820]  It is their emasculation of everything that the culture of blacks stand for.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:27.740]  They have been emasculated in the entire culture. The whole culture is black people.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:32.380]  Look at the metrosexual thing, all of it. Oh, we do about it.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.940]  This is key because Trump is a vote against the bloc. All right, now look at this and understand
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.820]  that yes, it was a Democrat plan, but the Republicans picked it up and ran with it because
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.820]  they can make money out of it, get control. There's plenty of, you know, institutional
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.380]  classism, I would call it, but not from the liberal perspective, from a social engineering
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:01.740]  perspective. And people think of advertising like the ads we have coming up in a few minutes
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.340]  as the ads. But when you get into MTV and all this, it's product placement.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:12.060]  And they rolled out gangster rap to take over rap that was all about empowerment and art
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:19.020]  to shell the entire war on drugs right as the cocaine hit the streets. This is declassified.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:23.100]  Absolutely. This is all come out. This is all come out. This is all come out. It's not our
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:27.340]  opinion. I've interviewed free Ricky Ross, the real Rick Ross, all of it. And notice MTV put
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:33.180]  out a fake Rick Ross to cover up this story. This is a info war people. This is an info war.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:38.220]  And the British East India Company controlled world opium. Then they controlled cocaine.
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.060]  They took down China by getting China to make drugs illegal. And then they brought the drugs
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.540]  into control things. And then that corrupted the government. This is a takedown of society.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.460]  And they targeted the neighborhood folks wouldn't really watch or the neighborhood that was
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:54.700]  segregated. The neighborhood where they could beta test it. But it's been exported everywhere and
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:18:02.220]  it's pure evil. Well, and listening to RW Bray and most logical thinking black people have realized
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.260]  what you're talking about. And they know that that's how kind of their culture has been devalued
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:12.140]  and disintegrated. But just listening to RW Bray there, I mean, I just wanted to stand and cheer.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.580]  You don't, I mean, that guy almost was brought to tears. Imagine if they put that on CNN.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.540]  That imagine, but there's a blockade. And really, who votes for Trump? People that watch
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:26.540]  mainstream media. And look at this. I mean, who's gonna vote for Clinton? People that watch
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.660]  mainstream media because you're not going to get the Trump information there. The people who are
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.860]  brainwashed by the mainstream media are the ones that will vote Clinton because they've seen the
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:38.140]  spin against Trump. But what's amazing to me, RW Bray and the people who speak at Trump events,
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:43.180]  they get up there and they're impassioned. They are real. You can feel the emotion.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:48.300]  You can feel the energy. You can just tell that their presence is a presence of patriotism and
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:52.860]  liberty. Absolutely restore American nationalism. You listen to people at Hillary Clinton's rallies
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:57.580]  or jibbering fools. They have nothing to say. They have like one line or like, oh, that was a great
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:03.020]  song by Demi Lovato. And then they go right into their canned speech. RW Bray just got on the stage
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:07.020]  and laid it all on the line. He put his soul out on the line. He almost was brought to tears.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.580]  That was real. So real. That's what I love. That's what resonates. Well, that's it. And Trump's
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:16.380]  bringing all that in. So whether you think he's good or bad, the horse he's riding on is the
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.980]  real deal. And that's the ultimate point, too. I'm not sitting here saying that Trump is my
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:24.540]  savior. I'm not saying that Trump is perfect. I'm saying that Trump is the only chance at least
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.980]  I believe the entire power structure is throwing everything they've got at him worldwide because
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.540]  they know he's real. And even if they steal it from him and he loses, which I don't think is going
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:40.380]  to happen. This is world changing. What's happened? Oh, and Troyer, it's very excited to have you
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.700]  here on the team. We're going to be talking a lot more. And you say you want to work 15 hours
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.580]  a day. We're ready to do it. You're going to be hearing a lot more from this young man. Tell
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:52.140]  folks how old you are. I'm 27 years old. That's good. A little bit later, start to me. I've been
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.460]  on Earth since I was 21. But imagine what you'll be doing in 20 years. We'll be back with Dr. Edward
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:03.340]  Group, a ton of news, and a bunch of clips. We haven't even gotten to them yet. Today, I became a
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:09.580]  biophoton woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:15.020]  and was still happy and energized at 3pm. Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day,
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:20.300]  but today I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:25.340]  said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon. I told her there was
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:30.700]  a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant. She said,
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:36.220]  I want some. A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:41.980]  that wonderful abundant energy. I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt. The
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:47.500]  combination of one-world-way and five-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life,
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:52.460]  the time that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus. And I'm 64.

[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:10.220]  My good buddy, Jimmy Vaughn, bringing us in. What a patriot. He was over at the house last week.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.340]  Ian Robin, just pointing out how many great anti-New World Order folks are out there.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:23.900]  He's been aware of the New World Order for like 16, 17 years. He's not a late
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:27.180]  comrade of the fight just to point out how many great patriots there are around the world that
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:33.260]  are awake. For the next hour, we are joined in studio by Dr. Edward Group. Now, I already skipped
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:37.820]  the break last hour. I haven't plugged anything. Most talk radio, you would have heard plugs during
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:43.260]  each segment and that's fine. They have to fund themselves with sponsors, with advertisers to
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:47.820]  bring money in. I get so focused on the news and battling for the Republic
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:52.140]  that I don't refill our gas tank and fund their operation. So, I'm going to give you a hard pitch
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:57.500]  and I'm going to give myself a hard pitch for selenium. The more I take the vitamins and minerals
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.580]  and products that enforce life that are always sourced to be the purest, most organic, most
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:06.300]  bioavailable, the better my life gets. Now, the problem is I got like 25 products and they're
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.460]  all really excellent and I just have to make myself through three meals every day to remember
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:16.780]  to carry the caplets and tinctures and things with me. And everybody can see I look a lot
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.780]  better. I have more energy. I'm not saying I'm a beach boy, but I've lost 70-something pounds
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:28.220]  and it's been amazing. And we were for months and months developing with Dr. Group bio true
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:35.340]  selenium. Now, a lot of things at infowarslife.com like DNA force and lung cleanse and super
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:42.940]  mild vitality are super proprietary, game changing, cold pressed, just amazing. That's why they get
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:49.260]  five stars on nutraceutical and what I would call supplement Nazi sites. I don't mean literal,
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:53.420]  but Nazis, but like Seinfeld, folks that are really into it, people that are experts,
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:58.140]  you know, almost an obsessive way. They love what Dr. Group has helped us develop.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:04.460]  A lot of it, again, is complex molecules, acids, you name it. This is just bio available for mustard
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.780]  seed. The best selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very,
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:13.420]  very low price. And when you look at a selenium, it's like, just like iodine. It's, it's, it's,
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:19.260]  it's a key missing link. You're the expert. But what's crazy, this is serendipity, synchronicity.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.660]  This actually happened five minutes ago during the break. And I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:28.780]  People are always like, shut up in that group, talk. But I've got to tell people this just went
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:36.620]  up. Kit Daniels, August 24th, 2016. He's writing about this breaking in major studies today.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.100]  You were set a month ago to come and pitch selenium when it finally got here. And it got here last
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:48.060]  week. This was a month ago. And you were going to talk about this before even this study to show
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:55.340]  how cutting edge you are study selenium may stop Zika birth defects. Low dietary selenium could
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:27:00.060]  be at risk factor for Zika related defects says UNC study prestigious. Now I'm going to stop right
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:05.260]  there. But you talk about just, is it serendipity or synchronicity? I mean, this is insane.
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:11.420]  That it broke in the news today is just crazy. But this is just an example. I've read the studies
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:17.500]  where if you don't have selenium, you get colon cancer. If you do, it's like the numbers are
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:21.180]  insane. Now I'm not pitching this as a cancer cure. What I'm saying is if you don't have water,
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:26.700]  you'll die. If you don't have vitamin C, you'll get diseases where your teeth fall out and everything
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:32.860]  disintegrates scurvy. And selenium is another one of those absolute must haves and the studies show
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:38.860]  all time record low in the Western world. Breast cancer, you name it, it is, my children and I
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:44.220]  are going to be taking, we've been taking another brand until this came out. I'm taking it now every
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:49.020]  day. This is so key. Now for the rest of the hour, Dr. Group, you have the floor, my friend.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:56.460]  Well, it all starts with trying to find the best selenium out there. Iodine is extremely important
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.980]  to the thyroid gland and everybody has their own special trace minerals that they really like and
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:07.500]  that are really important in the body. And we've had the X2 survival shield and we've had so many
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:13.660]  requests over the years for selenium. What took me so long is I wanted to find the best bioactive
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:22.140]  selenium that was out there. And just recently, we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:28.380]  selenium from mustard seed extract. Selenium is an extremely important trace mineral in the body.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:34.380]  We are becoming deficient in selenium all over the world. As a matter of fact, there was an
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:38.460]  article just recently that we come back, we'll have time for you to go through your 50 articles.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.020]  I mean, we've got mainline studies here, but I've been reading the studies. I'm not an expert like
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:47.500]  you, but isn't it that most of it's synthetic that they're selling and it doesn't do anything basically?
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:52.940]  Yeah, most of it's synthetic and the majority of the population actually has selenium deficiency.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:56.380]  There's just not enough in it. You get it from, you can get it from seeds, you can get it from
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:29:02.060]  seafood, you can get it from eggs, a few different sources. But the problem is, especially with all
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:07.420]  the spraying out there, is that, and by the way, we're not making any health claims here,
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:14.380]  the aluminum is so high in the bodies from all of the deodorants and all the cooking and
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:18.380]  all of the chemtrails that are falling down, they're literally reacting with the selenium in
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:23.900]  the soil. It's bonding. And it's bonding and it's creating a deficient source of selenium.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.060]  I'll tell you this article that just came out, which I wonder why the little water keeps hitting
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:33.900]  us with it. You can really link it because Alcoa was involved in selenium research here.
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:37.980]  And then they came out with a fluoride in the water. Yeah, and it was selenium reacts with
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:42.060]  fluoride and bromine as well. And then the White House Science I wrote a book and admitted he's
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:46.540]  doing it to us called EcoScience. Oh, he wrote a book saying it. It's not my opinion. He hit us,
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:30:05.180]  he hit us hard and he gets to laugh at all the brain damaged people. We'll be right back.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:21.180]  On the other side of the border, Czech media is reporting that the country's food reserves
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:26.220]  are struggling and would be incapable of meeting demand in the event of a national crisis. The
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:31.820]  government is calling on citizens to increase their self-sufficiency and food safety by stockpiling
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:36.700]  more food. According to a resident of the Czech Republic, news stations reporting on the story
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.260]  out of Germany also reveal how the Czech government is telling its citizens to be prepared for the
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:46.780]  worst case possible scenario, which is likely to be a large-scale catastrophic terror attack or
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:52.060]  a nuclear disaster. As we reported earlier this month, the Czech president is also pushing for
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:56.860]  a change to the law that would make it easier for citizens to own firearms in order to defend
[01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:03.020]  themselves against chihadas. Read more reports at infowars.com. It's not just our water we need
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:06.940]  to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing,
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:12.700]  especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:17.820]  weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:23.660]  Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:27.900]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family,
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:33.100]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:38.540]  our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:44.060]  themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300,
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:49.740]  $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.900]  I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:59.900]  didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:05.100]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:10.540]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:16.220]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:22.620]  in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:28.380]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:33.100]  around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.620]  about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:42.300]  have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.060]  twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:50.380]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:56.060]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarslife.com.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:59.500]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work,
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:11.100]  sir, on this great product.
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:24.860]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:32.860]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones with Dr. Group.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:39.420]  What we are looking at is good and evil. Right and wrong. A new world order.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:51.340]  That is in 1984. What is? There's no new world order, but the president's calling for a planetary
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:55.420]  government called a new world order. And now the pope's calling for it. And it's unelected mega
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:34:01.820]  corporations that legalize slavery again in the TPP. And we're bad cooks because we told you the
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:07.500]  NSA was secretly spying on you exactly as it's now come out. They were because I had NSA whistleblowers
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:15.580]  on in the 90s. But they wouldn't arrest them. I was eating during the break, shouldn't do that.
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:18.860]  Then they wouldn't arrest them. They would just ignore them. Dr. Group.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:25.500]  So what I was saying, an interesting article that I found was the paleontologist was looking at
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:30.940]  selenium levels. And it says, did a missing trace element selenium trigger mass extinctions?
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:36.860]  Not to be fear mongering or anything, but what he determined was the cause of the three mass
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:41.820]  extinctions on the history of the earth was actually a selenium shortage, which crippled the
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:46.860]  life on earth. So I just want to let people know how important of a trace mineral this is.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:52.380]  You know, Dr. Wallach. I got a short video shot of that. Now go ahead. Dr. Wallach was doing research
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:57.580]  on selenium back on the day for the cystic fibrosis. And he was fired from his laboratory
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:03.420]  working on monkeys because he realized that giving monkeys selenium in the pregnant mother's selenium,
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:09.260]  he could reverse cystic fibrosis. And an interesting story he tells also is with muscular dystrophy.
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:12.460]  Everybody remembers Jerry. If they got it in utero, then they wouldn't get it.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:16.620]  They had it while they were being developed. Also, if they were still young, if they were
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:20.940]  still young, they could reverse muscular dystrophy. And that's, you know, I haven't seen the research
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:26.460]  on that. But I know that Jerry Lewis was actually fired in 2011. And he wasn't able to do any more
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:31.740]  of those. It's just like breast cancer. If you look into the muscular dystrophy association,
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.980]  which I did, I mean, it's pretty crazy how they distribute money and how they take advantage.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:40.380]  Well, let's expand on this and then walk through it all. And again, we have the new product at
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:46.380]  infowarsalive.com. But wherever you get it, get true organic selenium, okay? We have what we
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:52.300]  believe is the very best out there and it supports the info war. So it's a 360 win. Biotru selenium
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:57.820]  is the product exclusively available at infowarsalive.com or by calling toll free triple eight,
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:01.340]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And please, after you go through these studies
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:05.340]  and give folks the sources, obviously, we're showing these on screen for TV viewers,
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.820]  the radio listeners, obviously, you can see this video later today was posted on the side of
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:16.700]  you want to follow along even closer. This synergistically works with true iodine. And so
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:21.180]  this supercharges and goes together. Please continue, Dr. Group. The selenium works directly
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:26.300]  with iodine and selenium. The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:32.540]  actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:40.860]  dependent upon selenium. So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs in
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:46.140]  their body. The strange thing, you know, we talked about the Zika and it's how the Zika was patented
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:54.460]  by the Rockefeller Foundation. The 1954 foundation is funding some of in conjunction with Monsanto,
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:37:01.580]  who sprayed all of the Larva side on the area in Brazil, where the individual
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:07.660]  children had microcephaly, the shrunken brains, basically. When you start looking at Zika and
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:13.020]  then Zika now coming to the United States, what I've uncovered is there's a sinister plan with
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:21.580]  the Zika because the Zika virus can actually cause infertility because it alters the seleno
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:28.380]  protein. So when you take selenium in the body, it's turned into enzymes and it works with the
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:33.500]  glutathione peroxidase as well. So it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:41.340]  body. It stimulates the liver, it helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify. As a matter
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:48.860]  of fact, there's a lot of studies out there how selenium works as an anti-cancer preventative.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:55.420]  And as a matter of fact, the FDA actually allows claims for selenium, believe it or not, they were
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:04.700]  sued a long time ago by a FDA lawyer, Emored, which is Jonathan Emored, which is a great activist.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.380]  He's an amazing guy. We've had him on before. Dietary supplement field. So you're actually
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:15.260]  allowed to say that selenium reduces the risk of certain cancers and selenium has anti-carcinogenic
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:19.980]  effects. A couple of other things that I really like about it is it actually recirculates your
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.940]  vitamin C in your body and it recirculates the glutathione. Again, I've read the studies. I'm not
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.860]  an expert like you, but explain this to me. That's why I was mentioning it earlier. Vitamin C
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:34.460]  with the true iodine, with the selenium, these are all these three key things that all
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:38.860]  cofactor and work together. And then if you don't have them, you die. I mean, these are absolute
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:43.820]  building blocks. And the point is, is that there's massive low levels of selenium. Let's get back
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:47.660]  into your studies and we're going to do a document cam shot for TV viewers. And then let's also go
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:54.460]  over Kit Daniels article that links into the UNC study, because this is amazing. The study,
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:59.020]  which was released in July, but received scant media attention. And again, I just saw it in the news
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:04.780]  today and Kit wrote about it, says that Zika mimics a genetic disease known as PCCA by lowering
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:10.940]  selenium proteins known as, and then it goes through the type of proteins. This is amazing.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:15.900]  Let's talk about all that about the group. So basically what the research suggests in this,
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:21.580]  and I have another form, which is a little more detailed than that is, and we had no idea this
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.460]  was coming out. I mean, this is basically brand new stuff. This is what kind of scares me about
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:31.580]  the Zika thing, because, you know, we know, I know that there's a lot of the Zika research,
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:36.300]  some of it is a hoax when you look at, oh, sure, they're hyping it up. Absolutely. But we know
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:40.380]  that they want to develop a vaccine for it. But I tell you what, what they don't want people
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:47.420]  finding out is that selenium will deactivate and prevent the Zika virus from doing any damage.
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:54.300]  Because what it does is the trace mineral selenium, which has been shown actually to improve the
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:59.260]  clinical outcomes in HIV and AIDS and several other viral diseases. You're reading from the
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:04.060]  prestigious study. From the study could also be useful in reducing the risk of neurological
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:08.460]  disorders. Because if you just look at the Zika virus and you take away the pesticides and all
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:14.700]  the other stuff that's associated with microcephaly, the Zika virus itself, and what's really scary
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:19.100]  too, is the genetically modified mosquitoes that they've made, because they've altered the genes
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:25.580]  in these GM mosquitoes to attack the mosquitoes with the Zika. By the way, I'm sitting here,
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:29.900]  like we're in a science fiction dystopia. I've studied all this. I read this every day. It's
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:35.660]  in mainstream news, and it just sounds crazy. The Rockefellers patented it, weaponized it,
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:39.580]  and then created a genetically engineered mosquito with it, and now it's suddenly out of control,
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:45.740]  and then they're obsessed with selenium and iodine and fluoride, which counters those,
[01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:50.060]  and you see their program. I mean, these people are, and then they write books bragging how
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:55.420]  they were going to do it to us. It is so unbelievable. The bottom line is, folks,
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.700]  I don't care where you get the selenium. Filter your water. Don't drink hydrofluorosalic acid.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:05.820]  Harvard now admits massive IQ reductions. Harvard even admits you can pull these studies up as well.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:10.860]  Harvard, I just use that because there's so many studies on how iodine deficiency lowers
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:15.260]  IQ on average 15 points. Look it up for yourself, and then the FDA keeps lowering it down, down,
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:19.820]  down, down. I guess they'll soon say, we don't even need it. This is crazy town, Dr. Group.
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:24.860]  Selenium, too, causes mental retardation and mental problems. What we're seeing now, fluoride,
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:30.060]  fluoride. Well, no, I was saying selenium deficiency. Selenium deficiency also causes
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:33.660]  mental retardation and severe selenium deficient. What is the molecule like? I mean, what?
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:39.580]  It's actually a trace mineral, and it's listed as a semiconductor. It's it, uh...
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.020]  And we're electrochemical. And we're electrochemical. That's why it's so important,
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.940]  and it's used in multiple phases, especially... By the way, Anthony, he keeps always going,
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.100]  take your selenium, take your selenium, and let's just say it. X2 gives me a lot of energy.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.460]  People almost like, don't take selenium, Alex. I've been bouncing off the walls lately.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:58.620]  This stuff is amazing. Well, because a lot of people with thyroid disorders,
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:04.300]  iodine is great, and iodine will help balance the thyroid, and that's one of the main things
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:09.900]  that we're seeing right today and across the board. I mean, endocrine disrupting chemicals,
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:15.900]  which the thyroid is an endocrine gland, lack of deficiencies in trace minerals. There's 91
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.820]  trace minerals out there. A lot of them you can get with Himalayan crystal salt. You can get
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:25.580]  with organic apple cider vinegar. You can get with folvic acid. That's why we put a tiny...
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:30.140]  That's why we put trace minerals in all the products that you have, Alex, because we put
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:34.940]  the folvic acid in there, so they get these trace minerals. Selenium is only needed in
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:40.700]  microgram amounts. It's needed in 200 micrograms. So we're talking about almost an adjuvant or an
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:47.020]  activator. We're talking about a mineral that's... a trace mineral that's responsible for multiple
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:53.420]  actions in the body. It has been shown to be a fight against carcinogens. It's been...
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:57.500]  Are there... Obviously, Lionel's following one of the Nobel Prize for this, but he said you
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:00.460]  couldn't take too much vitamins. See, I don't know. Can upset your stomach if you take too much.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:05.420]  What is the dose you can take of this, and can you take too much selenium?
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:11.580]  You can, I think, take too much selenium because it is a trace mineral. I recommend anything from
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:18.060]  200 to 400 micrograms a day. I'd rather stay on the safe side. Some doctors out there right now
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:22.220]  are recommending a gram, which is 1,000... So I've already taken two pills a day. Is that too many?
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:28.300]  400 micrograms. That's fine. Nothing's gonna go wrong with that, and that's probably a good...
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:33.100]  That's probably a good dose for you. It does stay in the body for, you know, a few days, so
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:38.940]  it's something that the body can easily process, and most likely you're not gonna be taking too
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:45.020]  much of it. Listen, there is a lot of information out there on selenium and how it works in the
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:49.660]  body. By the way, John Ronson's a really smart guy, best-selling author, and he never even heard
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:56.700]  of selenium. And that's an example. I mean, you know, look, before we started putting all the
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:00.620]  information out there about iodine, no one really knew about iodine. All they knew was that you...
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:05.020]  Now you go to Whole Foods, they got 10 products of it, but I'm gonna be honest. It's potassium iodide
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:09.900]  that you don't absorb that isn't as good. We would sell that... We knew iodine was key. It's
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:14.060]  why we developed this. We would be selling the other stuff. We have it for nuclear attacks and
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:18.140]  things, but that's an emergency potassium iodide. People come up to me and say, is this good? And
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.500]  I've asked you about it. It's not that they're competitors. It's... We would be putting that
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:27.420]  out too. It's not as good as our iodine, our X2. Tell people how X2 goes together with our
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:33.500]  bio true selenium from m4slife.com. It's a great... It's basically iodine and selenium work together
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:38.940]  as a team. So if you have a team that you're going to have repairing and balancing out your
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:44.060]  endocrine system, your thyroid gland, you want to have that team working together. So
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:49.100]  I would have had selenium out a long time ago. We would have even put it in with the X2. The
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.940]  problem is we tried that. In fact, I said I want X3. I want to make it better and we just can't do
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:58.620]  it with selenium. And listen, it's... Many, many people get... There's so many benefits of just
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:04.700]  selenium in itself. It's a fantastic immune modulator. Believe it or not, it has a lot to
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:09.580]  do with fertility and infertility. I've also linked that to the... Oh, I know women that go
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:13.900]  to fertility doctors and they tell them to take selenium. And I want to expand on something.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:19.980]  I'm really proud of what we do. I've been told by industry leaders, some of the biggest retailers
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:24.300]  in the country who asked us to consult for them. I don't have time to do it. That just what you
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:29.660]  said, we have made iodine now, being all the whole foods and all the basic shops. It was not there
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.220]  three years ago. We have changed the market on that. I guarantee it was selenium. We start
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:40.620]  pushing this. It's such a service to the public and they should tell people about selenium as well.
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:45.740]  Wherever you get your selenium, this is key, ladies and gentlemen. Do your own research. And
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:50.060]  we've come up with the very best selenium that we possibly could. Dr. Ritt believes it's probably
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:54.060]  the best out there. We're talking a nutraceutical level, incredibly
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:59.100]  bioabsorbable from a natural form, from an organic form, the mustard seed. But regardless,
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:04.220]  it's funding this broadcast. But tell people they need to filter their water with a system that cuts
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:09.820]  out fluoride and bisphenol A and all the garbage that's in the water. And the roundup, which they
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:13.420]  now admit is growing the breast cancer and the rest of it, they knew that when they approved it.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:19.020]  That's all come out. Whatever you do, this is a war. Warn people about what's going on.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:23.020]  Tell them about what's happening. Look at Hillary. They admit her real health problem is
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:29.100]  hyperthyroidism, what you mentioned. Yeah, I really believe I've had a lot of people ask me,
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:33.980]  you know, speaking of the Hillary health scenario, what's going on, whether or not I've kind of watched
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:41.100]  her. And, you know, there's, it seems like to me, she's definitely has some issues going on with her.
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:45.020]  Did you ever see that movie Concussion with Will Smith? No, I didn't. That was a really good.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:48.940]  Anytime you have a concussion, well, first they say she was dehydrated and she fainted. I don't,
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:52.700]  I personally don't believe that she was dehydrated and fainted and hit her head. But
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:55.500]  your legs just came out with the fact that she was looking for Parkinson's medication.
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:00.860]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the, all of the symptoms, you can clearly see, you know,
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:05.820]  the hypothyroidism is taking a place. I think she might have been exposed to radiation when she
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:11.420]  was visiting Fukushima, as well as many other things. You know, that was crazy. Why did they
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.220]  bring US ships right up to it? Why did Hillary go over there? She went over there with Kennedy,
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:21.980]  actually, Carolyn Kennedy, I think. And, but we know now the devastating effects of, of what's
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:27.100]  happening with Fukushima and all the stuff that's going on. Now, wait a minute, Ann Coulter said
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.260]  the Japanese should be thankful for that. I don't want to bash Ann Coulter. She does some good
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.860]  stuff on guns, but you know, she, she said the Japanese ought to be thankful. Radiation's good
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:40.700]  for you. That's just like a medical profession that says pharmaceuticals are good for you and
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:45.260]  everything else. I mean, the reason you don't see all this stuff in the mainstream, like you said,
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:49.820]  it's a competition with them. They want, they do not want this information out there.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.820]  What about the numbers I've seen in mainline studies about people that take selenium and
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:57.500]  the reductions in cancers? We're not making health plans. We're reading news articles.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:02.300]  Look, there's a great site. It's called seleniumresearch.com. And you can go there and look at all of
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:08.460]  the studies for breast cancer studies. There was a study that they determined if they were to give
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:16.940]  200 micrograms to every 14 year old girl on the planet, it would reduce breast cancer by like 85%.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:22.700]  It would almost wipe out breast cancer just with selenium. I wrote some stuff down here. I mean,
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:28.380]  these are published in the journal, in JAMA show that daily supplementation of 200 micrograms of
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:34.540]  selenium cut the cancer death cancer death rate in half. Now, is that not a threat to the pharmaceutical
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:40.620]  companies in the in chemotherapy? Lung cancer incident was reduced by 46%. Prostate cancer
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:48.780]  incident was reduced by 63%. Colon cancer reduced by 58%. 17% reduction in all causes of mortality.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:57.180]  Selenium is required in 25 of our genes. I'll tell you another thing that I saw. The University of
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:02.540]  North Carolina did a study and because we always talk about vaccines and we always talk about the
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:07.260]  flu season, which is now year round with all the influenza viruses that have been released
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:15.660]  everywhere. When the influenza virus encountered mice deficient in selenium, it mutated and emerged
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:21.820]  more virulent. So you talk about all the superbugs that are out there. So let's say you get influenza
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:28.300]  and you're deficient in selenium and then you cough and you spread that virus, it's even stronger
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:34.860]  and more. Wow, it's mutating inside of you like a embryonic petri dish. And again, as a layperson
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:39.180]  is reading the studies and seeing the headlines, this is a fact. I mean, they admit it. You don't
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.580]  have vitamin C, stuff breeds inside of you. You don't have selenium, it breeds inside of you. So
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:49.500]  whether it's the flu or whether it was Zika, it is giving your body the normal electrochemical power
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:56.060]  your cells and mitochondria and neurons need. And when you don't have it, it's like not having
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:01.660]  a battery charge in your car. It's not cranking. Yeah, that's what I like about the DNA force too,
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:06.620]  is because it protects the DNA. But selenium is another one of those products that protects the
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:14.780]  DNA. Here's a study that selenium may react directly with carcinogens to prevent their binding to
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:21.260]  DNA. I mean, that's huge right there. Reactive selenium metabolites can render carcinogens
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:28.700]  non-carcinogenic. Selenium can raise the levels of xenobiotic enzymes in the liver for detoxification
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:35.260]  of carcinogens. Selenium after iodine is the most important mineral affecting thyroid function.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:43.100]  Thyroid. Selenium is necessary component of the enzymes to remove iodine molecules
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:47.820]  from T4 converting into T3. Explain that. Well, that's how that's how selenium works with iodine.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:53.180]  It helps it helps convert the T4 to the T3 of the thyroid. And it does that by working with...
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:59.020]  And if your body doesn't have it, explain your thyroid will absorb fluoride, bromide,
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:03.900]  bromide, all the bad halogens they're pumping out at us. And then we wonder why hyperthyroidism
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.660]  and these goiters, and you look at women, beautiful women, young ones now,
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:12.780]  have these, even they're skinny, these, these giblets hanging down. And the government just says,
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:16.700]  we're going to put you on thyroid medication, sweetheart. And you know, most pharmaceutical
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:21.420]  medications actually, especially the ones for mental illnesses, anxiety, depression,
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:25.180]  are made of fluoride. There's, it's really hard. Are you saying it was wrong in the Soviet
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.700]  good logs that they gave people fluoride in the water? Because they love, they style and love
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.700]  people, right? I don't know. You tell me. I tell you, not to grieve. It is just so crazy to center
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:41.100]  and know that no matter how crazy all the sounds, it's what's going on. Selenium also helps with
[01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:46.780]  mercury detoxification as well. So if you take selenium away, think of all the people that have
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.940]  mercury amalgamated. People are always asking how the Japanese can eat the most mercury in the world,
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:56.220]  but live the longest, but other people have lower mercury, but getting sick from it in the West.
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:59.500]  And that's what I was reading in another study. In fact, he was just mentioning earlier about how
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.980]  he eats seafood. It has the selenium in there with the mercury to counteract it.
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:08.220]  The fish have that, right? It's amazing. So there's selenium right next to the mercury.
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:13.980]  So God counteracts it. Yes. So that's how you can eat that type of fish and not get sick. It's
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:18.060]  incredible. I'm sorry, you were trying to get there. Yeah, what I'm saying right now is that,
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:23.100]  you know, everything is polluted. And that's, that's the whole purpose of what we're doing here.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:28.700]  And what we're trying to bring to people is that we're doing the research and finding out what you
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.540]  need and what's going to be helpful and what they're, you know, like you said, they, they, this,
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:39.740]  this study with the selenium and Zika, the association between those two is posted on the
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:43.740]  who website. I mean, the World Health Organization. It's not like they're trying to hide it.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:48.620]  Yeah, guys, Google WorldHealthOrganization.org or.gov. I forget what it is. They have both,
[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:53.900]  I think, and then type in Zika selenium, you know, search engine. It'll take you to the subpage.
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:57.660]  So I want to show TV viewers this. We're not playing games. And I want to just tell you something.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.700]  They've had national news stories. I think are so comical the way they write them going.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:08.140]  Alex Jones tells people that you have deficiencies and that it's hurting you. And then he sells you
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:12.300]  things for the problem. Yeah, I thought that's what you do. Like, you know, if I owned a dog
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:17.820]  shop or a pet shop, I would sell things for pet owners. I mean, exactly. I go out and find the
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:22.140]  very best water filters at the lowest price that I personally use. And then I sell it to fund
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:27.340]  their over operation to keep warning people. It's like, they don't get the two plus two equals four.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:32.540]  They don't get a 360 win. They think you've got to screw somebody over. No, I want, I mean,
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:38.060]  I take my products. I want to have the best nutraceuticals at the lowest price. And I'm not
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.660]  a sociopath. I'm somebody that really cares about people. But if I was a sociopath and smart,
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:45.500]  I would still do that. Because then I'll have the best products with the best ratings at the
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:49.900]  highest quality. If the FDA or whatever comes in and test, I'm going to have all the tests,
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:53.980]  all the proof, all the stuff ready with the former FDA lawyers running at all. I mean,
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:59.180]  we're talking about, I mean, loaded for bear, because we know we're a target. It's crazy.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.540]  They don't get it's because other nutritional companies calls up as you know, and they say,
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:07.180]  the average markup is seven times. Why are you only marking it up 100% and I go because I'm
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:10.860]  going to put super high quality products in and still have a decent price. And then I'm going to
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:16.860]  take the market over. And they go, yeah, you are, please stop. I mean, these people just don't,
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:22.700]  it's cold renaissance people. The majority of the people in the nutraceutical industry,
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:27.180]  I'm not trying to bash the nutraceutical industry. It's unbelievable. But you and I are both,
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:33.740]  we have a cause and we're not, Tony Montana said, I have never screwed anybody over before
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:37.740]  didn't have it coming to him. I will go around somebody that's attacked me instead of messing
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:42.300]  with them unless I have to run over them. I'm not looking to prove scores. I'm not looking to do
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:47.980]  this and that. I'm not looking, no, no, no, no. I am absolutely mission oriented, 360 win. I will,
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:53.820]  I treat people how I want to be treated. And it's not even a philosophy. It's my DNA. It's who I am.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:57.180]  And I grew up thinking everybody was like me and I learned they're not. And they wonder why
[01:54:57.180 --> 01:55:02.940]  they're losers. If you're a scumbag on a backstabber, you're a scumbag backstabber. Stop being one.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:10.860]  Sorry, group. No, it's just that, you know, I feel I was born to, you know, my dad was involved
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:15.020]  with the invention of phthalates and plastic. By the way, I looked that up years ago and I first
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:18.780]  was talking to you like 10 years ago. Your dad was a very famous chemist. Yeah. And actually,
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:23.420]  my family was, it comes from the Webster family. Noah Webster was my great, great, great, great,
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:28.380]  great grandfather. And Pelletia Webster was the one that wrote the original Constitution of the
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:33.260]  U.S. You know, but my family... Your dad came in with bisphenol, basically. Yeah. My dad was one
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:38.540]  of the top developers for plastics PVC. It was Exxon, right? With Exxon. Yeah. He was one of
[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:41.740]  the chief chemists with that. He actually did work for the government too. And I think he was,
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:46.780]  he was put away because he ended up getting... That's what they do when you get older. They
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.180]  just spike old cannons. Yeah. Yeah. All these guys in the CIA and stuff and think they're gonna be
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:55.500]  left alone. They just come kill you. Actually, he was about, actually found the report probably
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:00.540]  six months ago. He was about to come out and say that the plastics do have cancer causing...
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:05.980]  We got to publish that. Yeah. I need to, actually. I mean, so I knew at least he knew. He knew.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:11.100]  And then, literally, the men in black showed up. Oh, yeah. There was a group of probably
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:17.580]  15 when he died people that were at my mom's house and just a stack of documents this thick
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:23.020]  that they were forcing her to sign. Yeah. But anyway, back to the whole purpose of what we're
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:27.740]  doing here is I've devoted my life to helping people. I mean, really, I don't... It's not about
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:32.460]  making money. I want to get... I want to... But it's not bad to do that either. We need to make money.
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:36.460]  We need to help more people to expand the operation and be strong in the face of the globalists.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:41.500]  It's a total 360 win. But all I'm saying is whatever you do, get your selenium somewhere. And how
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:45.020]  do people tell? They don't even give it from us. Let's advertise for folks wherever they're at in
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:49.580]  the world. How do you know when you're reading the label that it's bioavailable from an organic
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:53.980]  source? So if you're going to go anywhere and get selenium, the best one that you can get is
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:57:01.340]  selenium methionine. It's basically a bonded selenium. And that's the majority out there. There
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:07.100]  are selenium selenides and other different forms out there. Don't get any of those. There might be
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:13.260]  a couple other sources out there where you can get fully plant-reacted bio selenium, which is the one
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:20.380]  that we have here. Basically, in layman's terms, this is organic, pure rocket fuel from the plant.
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:25.260]  Straight from the mustard seed. It's actually certified organic. Think about in the bible,
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:30.460]  the tiny mustard seed Christ uses as an allegory can grow in this huge tree. And people have always
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:34.540]  marveled that mustard seed, as they say, is the most powerful seed out there for its size, what it
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:40.220]  does. One of the smallest seeds that makes something huge. I think that shows the power of selenium.
[01:57:40.220 --> 01:57:49.340]  It does. The mustard seed is powered by selenium. It is. It is. Selenium is potential. And so
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:55.660]  the more that you can do to stay away and avoid all these things is obviously really, really good.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:59.820]  I mean, like you were saying, you want to stay away. It's really hard, actually, to stay away
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:05.260]  from chlorine and bromine and fluoride. We're just bathing. Everything. It's everywhere. If anyone goes
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:10.460]  out to eat at any restaurant, you are going. I don't care what restaurant it is. You're going to get,
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:15.100]  you know, thousands of parts. We got to go to break. Stay there. Come back and finish up on
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:18.220]  this. And I want to shift into other news and we're going to stop plugging selenium. But it's
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.860]  more than just plugging. It is a public service announcement that you need vitamin C. You need
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:27.980]  water. You need pure water. You need selenium. You need X2. You need pure, true iodine. And we're
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:31.340]  the only folks that have it. I mean, it's the real deal from deep earth crystal sources,
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:36.940]  unbound right in there. So it all fuses together. The two available right now, infowarslifes.com,

[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:57.980]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:02.540]  About a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us. It's been something that I've
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:07.580]  been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:14.060]  process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:19.100]  little cups on the end of our chromosomes. But when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ
[01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:24.860]  because it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:31.180]  world. It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:37.260]  to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star reviews. I take
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:42.540]  this. This is this is the product that I take infowarslifes.com and the profit we make. We fight

[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:12.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:20.220]  Now, I personally have been talking about doing my own lay research in mainstream news, science news,
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:24.860]  the federal government's own admissions, the UN's own admissions. This stuff's out there. There's
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:28.060]  actually a lot of good people in the government. We've had the majority of the scientists at the
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:33.980]  FDA come out and say, in the last two decades, over and over again, and their unions have come out
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:39.900]  and said, take hydrofluorosalic acid, commonly known as fluoride, out of the water. This is crazy.
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:45.660]  But then they just call us cooks. They call us nuts. Fine. Consult your physician on whether I'm
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:49.100]  right because I'm not your physician. This is me personally talking that you need water,
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:56.140]  that you need oxygen, that you need vitamin C, that you need selenium, that you need true bioavailable
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:02.220]  iodine. Consult your physician again, that you need oxygen, but be sure and keep breathing
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:07.500]  while you're making that phone call to the physician. And so we're not making health claims,
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:11.980]  we're not making medical claims here. We're simply talking about the news we're reading,
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.900]  the studies we're looking at that say this and the fact that the government itself,
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.740]  this is one of the few things, even though they're Nazis about this, that they admit, okay,
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:26.220]  you can say that selenium has been associated as anti-cancer. It's that powerful. So wherever you
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:31.660]  get the selenium, do your own research, consult your healthcare practitioner, whatever type that
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:36.060]  may be that you think is most important, talk to your medical doctor. And there are a lot of medical
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:40.540]  doctors I've talked to that rave about selenium. There's a lot of good MDs. We're not against
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:45.500]  Western medicine. We're simply saying it's become a corporate monopoly. Dr. Gray, please continue.
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.700]  Well, that's what I was saying. There's one other thing I wanted to add about the selenium,
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:53.180]  and that's, it's not a strange thing, but it's a very interesting thing is that
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:58.700]  this was an article that came out and said, when selenium is scarce, the brain battles the testes
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:03.740]  for it. And faced with a shortage of the essential nutrient selenium, the brain and the testes duke
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:09.500]  it out. In selenium-depleted male mice, testes hog the trace element, leaving the brain in
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:16.300]  the lurch, scientists report. That's why I'm so tired of neuroscience. And the reason why that's
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:23.340]  very interesting is because never before have they found that the body actually fights or two organs
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:28.220]  fight each other for a trace mineral. So they found that for the first time, selenium. The body
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:35.340]  says procreation is more important than you living. Exactly. Exactly. So by the way, if the Zika virus,
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:39.420]  you know, talking about the population control, just going off on a tangent here, because I did
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:45.740]  link this up, if the Zika virus, which they're, you know, heavily working with somehow or another
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:51.020]  to spread everywhere, and now they're, you know, spraying all kinds of larvasides and stuff in
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:54.940]  Florida. But they're telling us that the pesticide doesn't hurt us. Well, they should just give
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:03:01.020]  everybody selenium, and then, you know, then they'll be protected. But the thing is, the Zika virus
[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:08.380]  will deactivate and cause you to become infertile. Oh, and it's so weird. The Rockefellers and the
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:12.860]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are involved. Exactly. Exactly. They're just obsessed with it,
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:18.380]  and then magically it happens. It's funny. So another news that I wanted to talk about today was
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:25.020]  the diagnosis of 9-11 linked cancers have tripled in less than three years. And the reason I wanted
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:29.820]  to bring this up to everybody, just some health news, is because I have family in New York City,
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:34.700]  and I know a lot of people in New York City, and a lot of them are having problems since 9-11.
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:41.820]  Oh, nosebleeds. More than 5,400 ground zero responders and others who lived,
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:47.820]  worked, or went to school near the fallen Twin Towers have come down with 9-11 linked cancers.
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:53.820]  5,400. I mean, you remember after 9-11 when they were saying, oh yeah, people were asking,
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:57.740]  can we go outside? They said, oh yeah, it's safe to go outside. You can walk around.
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:05.980]  Well, what was in all those explosives? What was in those cloudy gray white plumes of smoke
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:10.620]  everywhere? I don't know. I'm guessing there was a lot of arsenic. There was a lot of other
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:14.220]  contaminants and chemicals in there. We do actually know. I'll talk about it after the break. Go ahead.
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:18.700]  But what I'd like to do is just let people know. Listen, if you live in the New York area,
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:25.900]  do your research. Go online and type this in. Everything that we talk about, you can do to
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:30.860]  cleanse your body. Everybody has a self-healing mechanism. Your kids, if you have kids living
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:38.220]  in New York, make sure that you take the necessary action to cleanse them out, eat clean food, and
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:42.380]  try to prevent any of this from happening to you. And what about steam rooms? I've heard those are
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:47.020]  really good. Steam rooms are great. I put in like a $400 unit in my shower and it's awesome.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:51.180]  Yeah, yeah. That's something really, I'll just sell those. That's a little. You can buy near
[02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.860]  infrared lamps right now on eBay and Amazon and you can just sit in front of them and it
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:59.020]  helps you deep up. Absolutely. And again, we take the market over by selling things that are good
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:05.820]  and help people. Report. Check government tells citizens to prepare for the worst. Paul Joseph
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:11.740]  Watson reports. On Sunday, reports out of Germany said the government is set to enact a new concept
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:17.580]  for civil defense, which will require the population to stockpile enough food for 10 days. On the other
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:22.220]  side of the border, Czech media is reporting that the country's food reserves are struggling and would
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:27.020]  be incapable of meeting demand in the event of a national crisis. The government is calling on
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:32.780]  citizens to increase their self-sufficiency and food safety by stockpiling more food. According
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:37.900]  to a resident of the Czech Republic, news stations reporting on the story out of Germany also reveal
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:43.020]  how the Czech government is telling its citizens to be prepared for the worst case possible scenario,
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:48.940]  which is likely to be a large-scale catastrophic terror attack or a nuclear disaster. As we reported
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:53.500]  earlier this month, the Czech president is also pushing for a change to the law that would make
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:59.020]  it easier for citizens to own firearms in order to defend themselves against jihadists. Read more

[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:10.460]  been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:16.380]  iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out
[02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:21.260]  of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water. They took
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:26.780]  the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:31.420]  still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:37.740]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:43.660]  and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:48.220]  iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:54.540]  that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:08:23.340]  today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:34.140]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:54.300]  You know, I was thinking this morning, when I was on infowars.com, going through the 50 or so
[02:08:54.300 --> 02:09:00.220]  YouTube videos, we put out Yash Vey alone, and I saw one of the perennial complaints, which is true,
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:05.500]  and it was listeners going, Alex, when you've got a guest on and they're saying such important
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:12.220]  things, shut up, stop it. But then I think you can't argue with success. Why are we so affected?
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:17.980]  It's because I am bouncing off the walls. I legitimately am concerned. It's not even hysterical.
[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:21.660]  I'm just jumping up and down saying, hey, look, you know, the house is burning. Let's put it out.
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:27.180]  And I get so excited when you're saying things I know are true and I can connect it to other things
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:32.860]  where the elite have written they're doing this to us. It's like, how do I sit here calmly
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:38.220]  when the Rockefellers did get the Zika? They did weaponize it. Bill O. Melinda Gates are involved
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:43.260]  in releasing the mosquitoes, took supposedly counter it, and now it's exploding. And it does
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:47.980]  target reproduction and it does basically sterilize you. And then there's all these writings where
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:53.660]  they're obsessed with it. And he took over the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory and the IBM head set up
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:59.500]  the Kaiser Velhelm Institute. Then the United States set up the Nazis with the English folks.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:05.020]  And it's not a Nazi conspiracy. It's that I've read 500 books on the Nazis. I've read thousands
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:09.340]  of other history books. I've used to read books every day. Nowadays, I just read news. I'll be
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:13.580]  frank. I never read something that's science fiction to get my head out of this. I am a total
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:19.660]  expert on all this. Okay. I sit here in Paraiso Odo. Go listen to me consult your jackass physician
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:24.300]  that you know bought and paid for by the New World Order. I'm telling you, the elite are obsessed
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:30.540]  with this information. Okay. And I want to share it. I don't want to sit there knowing what the
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:36.780]  globalists are up to and then just hold it back and use it in business and life. I've had so many
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:40.940]  people say to me, well, Alex, you're scared how dumb down the public is and how ignorant. That's
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:46.060]  great. That's why we're dominating and so successful. I've had folks in business tell me this because
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:51.740]  they're so dumb. And I'm like, do you understand that, that, that will be sucked into that will be
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:56.460]  dumbed down, will be hurt by that. What comes around goes around. There is this attitude
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:11:01.580]  that permeates society even in the middle class of loving the fact that the general public are a
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:05.980]  bunch of TV head idiots. I don't take pleasure in that. I don't take pleasure in the decline of
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:12.380]  humanity by every metric from IQ to life expectancy, despite all the technology to infant
[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:18.700]  mortality, to cancers exploding, to obesity, to every single thing you look at, we are going to
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:23.340]  hell in a handbasket. And a lot of it is the modern industrial world makes us lazy. They've dug
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:28.860]  up people, like I said last night, pull up articles from 5,000 years ago, and they were twice as
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:36.220]  strong as we are 20,000 years ago, three times stronger. I mean, the average person from, from,
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:42.060]  from anywhere in the world would beat up Mike Tyson. That's what's so crazy about this is we're
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:48.460]  falling apart. And these guys are greasing the skids like little devils, reveling in the fall of
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:53.660]  humanity, because they're the biggest, you know, piece of crap up on the top of the pile. I don't
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:12:00.700]  want to rule a dung heap, okay? I want to be with humanity genetically with my progeny and your
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:06.460]  progeny together to the stars. That's enlightenment. That's the great, you know, human development.
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:11.020]  There it is. How modern humans have become weaklings compared with our ancient ancestors who could
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:18.620]  outrun and outlive today's top athletes. The average person 7,300 years ago, and they've gone
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.140]  through the bones, they've, they've, they've looked at the DNA, they've looked at all of it.
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:27.580]  We are falling apart. And by the way, I'm not on some high horse here saying this, okay?
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:31.580]  I'm not on some, let's see, my memory's not photographic anymore. I said 5,000 years ago,
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:37.820]  it was 5,000 BC, so 7,000. This is just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. And
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:45.180]  we are, so, so that's why, yes, it's a problem. I'm so obnoxious. I'm aware of it. Sometimes
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:50.380]  I can't stand myself and I'm on YouTube or a podcast skipping past myself. I get it. But we
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:53.660]  bring all these other great guests. I could just be an ego maniac like other hosts. It's them for
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:58.380]  three hours. The point is, is it doesn't matter. I'm doing the best I can. Attacking the globals
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:03.260]  like a kamikaze isn't going to be a pretty sight. So let's just establish that I'm not up here trying
[02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:09.100]  to conduct a perfect, polished broadcast. I'm up here throwing everything I got at these people,
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:14.380]  intellectually, spiritually, emotionally, and that's why we do this. But if you watch other
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:19.020]  shows, I think the method to the madness is this, and it's not conscious. You watch other popular
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:22.860]  talk shows, they're interrupting every 20 seconds on average. It's back and forth. It's this and
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:27.340]  that, but they get people on the panels that are good at it. I do it kind of like the McLaughlin
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:30.940]  group guy that died last week. He's like, hold on, next question. Well, he's even worse than me.
[02:13:30.940 --> 02:13:35.740]  But the point is, I'm aware of it. It is what it is. We're not holding it up as this perfect
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:42.060]  silver platter. We're holding it out as legitimate humans trying to defend against dehumanization.
[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:48.860]  Please continue. Well, you know, thanks for saying that. But no, you were going to say
[02:13:48.860 --> 02:13:54.220]  something about the smoke from the 9-11. Absolutely. Thanks for reminding me. That is
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:58.940]  another problem of the show. I bounce around like a ping pong because it's not scripted.
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:03.100]  You brought up diagnosis of 9-11 link cancers have tripled in less than three years. Now,
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:08.220]  let's go back to what happened. I was hosting six hours of radio a day at that time. This is not
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:13.820]  my opinion. And I say that because so many times people think I'm up here just saying something.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:20.460]  Okay. When I'm not just up here saying something, I lived it, you lived it, but I remember it
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:27.660]  because I was focused on it 10 hours a day, six hours a day on air. They came out, the detectors
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:33.740]  hit and it said it was deadly and it wasn't safe. The EPA said, do not go in the area. Christina Todd
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:38.140]  Whitman, the former governor said, don't. There was a backlash. One day later, she went to the
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:43.820]  pile without a mask, port alone for like five minutes and then got out of there and said,
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:49.740]  it's safe. There's no problem. We're going to play that clip in a moment. It came out in lawsuits.
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:56.300]  And this is in the New York Post of their publications that they knew, not this article,
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:01.260]  the previous ones, they knew that it was deadly. No kidding. They knew a bunch of buildings totally
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:06.140]  collapsing was deadly and they covered it up to light of the public. This is just one more example
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:11.420]  of how evil these globalists are. Let's play that clip of Christina Todd Whitman. As I say,
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.820]  you know asbestos was in there, is in those buildings, lead is in those buildings. There are
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:23.900]  the VOCs. However, the concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard. We're going
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:30.620]  to make sure everybody's safe. Now that was her walk back the day after. She walked it back even
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:36.780]  more in clips I saw and said it's totally safe. But they knew and they didn't even say ship
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:41.420]  breathing apparatus to everybody. Even though they could have got up there in a day because they
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:44.780]  wanted to keep everything open, including schools nearby. Well, that's like Obama and
[02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:49.260]  everybody after Fukushima said it's safe. The radiation is not going to spread anywhere. Now
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:54.700]  you have thousands, hundreds of thousands of people being affected from radiation damage. Did
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:16:00.700]  you hear about the the radiation explosion that just happened in New Mexico? I did. It didn't
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:05.820]  get much press. Yeah, it didn't get hardly any press at all. So when you're out in New Mexico,
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:09.980]  there's like all these 18 wheelers driving around that have these giant containers that you know
[02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:14.940]  say radioactive on them. It's creepy. That is creepy. I mean, that's that's like the silent
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.860]  killer out there, the radiation. But I mean, the thing is, oh, next, you're gonna say radiation
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:24.220]  exists. That's a conspiracy doesn't even exist. We haven't seen the full effects. I mean, just
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:30.620]  like after 9 11. I mean, I was telling people, you know, any disaster that whether it's a flood,
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:37.500]  whether it's a some sort of a false flag attack or bombing, whatever, you're going to have toxic
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:42.060]  elements in the air. And in all of those things are just a sign that you're so healing mechanism
[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:45.820]  might be suppressed and you need to cleanse. They've got studies that I've seen people can pull
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:49.340]  us up. I'm going from memory, but you notice it'll be pretty much dead on that you live. I think
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:54.460]  something like seven years less. If you live in London more than 20 years, I'm going for it was
[02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:58.460]  like on NPR, like over a decade ago, but actually went and covered on my show and looked up the
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:03.100]  study. So I'm going from memory. But but if you live in a major polluted city like London was one
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:08.060]  example, you live close to a decade less. I mean, that's just the particulate in the air.
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:14.060]  Yeah, we have and not to mention the water in the tap water. I mean, but don't filter
[02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:20.620]  your conspiracy. Air in the water are probably, I would say they are the two most toxic things.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:27.660]  I mean, you would think that if we just had the earth and the way that God made everything was
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:33.500]  pure clean air with nothing but oxygen or at least 28% oxygen. Now we have six to eight percent
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:37.500]  oxygen and we have millions of chemicals and toxins in the air and the water that you could
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:43.100]  just go to a stream and drink the pure clean water. That's why we had so many in the Roman
[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:47.900]  ages and in dating back in history, they would just go to different places and drink the mineral
[02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:54.220]  water. The water in the air was their medicine. They could breathe clean air by the oceans and
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:58.300]  breathe that salt in and they could drink clean water. If you heard in Europe, they're going to
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:02.620]  start taxes if you have a view or live by the ocean. So now there's a beauty tax.
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:07.900]  Not in here about that, but I did hear that Italy is going to take your kids away from you
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:13.020]  if you are a vegetarian or a vegan. Did you hear about that? I did see that. Well,
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:19.820]  if you take spaceballs, you know, they've got a tax on air or whatever. China actually has that now,
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:23.820]  cans of air. But no, seriously, I've got it here in the stack. I've got to show it. People won't
[02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:30.460]  believe me. Here it is. Daylight robbery. Tax in Portugal on property with a view. RT.
[02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:34.460]  Portugal going under due to massive government debt. So if you have a house with a view,
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:41.820]  you're going to have a tax on top of the tax. Yeah, I mean, it's not getting any better. That's
[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:47.580]  for sure. You cannot make this stuff up. Bottom line, folks, get bio true selenium available

[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:30.940]  when we come back, I mean, you've got other news you want to get to other other stories. In fact,
[02:19:30.940 --> 02:19:35.500]  give us a preview. Well, this is we've been talking about all the underground research
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:41.340]  that's been happening. And this is genetic transhumanism with the chimeras and the nonhuman
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:47.500]  hybrids that are taking place. And the National Institutes of Health actually just came out and
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:56.300]  publicize a oversee research comments section, but they did it in an area that's hidden. And we'll
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.620]  talk about that when we come back. But we're cooks for being right about it 20 years ago.

[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:05.340]  and privacy. Dr. Lara Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:09.820]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells. He discovered the one prime cause of
[02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:15.260]  cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency. Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and
[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:19.820]  discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency. She found that it was a
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:24.140]  sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would
[02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:28.940]  become emulsified and more readily absorbed. Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:33.900]  oxygen transfer to all cells of the body. Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:38.860]  produces the highest quality zero oxidation undamaged seed oils. The results on these seed

[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:39.500]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you
[02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:43.900]  too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:50.460]  case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs there's never

[02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:14.860]  danpilla.com
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:33.580]  By the way, as we upscale the factories and development systems with Dr. Group, this applies
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:38.620]  more than half of the nutraceuticals that we produce. He also advises us and helps us on the
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:43.820]  others. We use some of the biggest organic labs in the country. We're going to things like glass
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:48.140]  bottles. We're going like more capsules. Of course, they're powder capsules. You have better
[02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:54.780]  absorption. This Biotruce Linium, by the way, is $19.95. They have little cheap plastic bottles
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:00.780]  with just about half of that for the same price at major health food stores. I'm telling you,
[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:07.900]  you get more, you pay less, you get premium. That is my philosophy. That's how we do things.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:12.460]  You were making a point about how I'm always getting excited and cutting in. You were discussing
[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:15.500]  that during the break and you were going to expand on it before you hit one more story.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:20.940]  Yeah. I was just saying just because you get excited and it's not that you're trying to interrupt,
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:27.020]  but it's other factors. If I'm talking about iodine or something like that, and then people,
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:32.380]  a lot of times, don't know the full history of what's going on. The way your brain works is
[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:35.660]  just going a million miles an hour and you're thinking all the way back to the fluoride and the
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:38.780]  water and Germany and everything else. It's totally true. We got to warn them. They just knew
[02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:42.060]  what we knew. It became over. Exactly. It's a history. It's kind of like a history left.
[02:25:42.060 --> 02:25:47.100]  Exactly. I can't stand this. It's impossible, though, with the spoken word to do that. That's
[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.660]  why it's so frustrating. I want to tell them everything and I can't do it.
[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:51.820]  And you're limited on the amount of time that you have.
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:55.020]  So how do you deal with that? Because I know you're smarter than I am and you get excited.
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:58.140]  Sometimes when we're behind the scenes talking, you control yourself on there. You're an old
[02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:02.940]  army guy, combat guy, but I guess you've learned to just control yourself and ease back and be
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:07.340]  calm because you look a lot younger than the hell you actually are, Dr. Gribb. This stress,
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:10.780]  I feel physically good, but I look older than I am. I mean, it really gets to me.
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:15.340]  I'll tell you, one of my secrets is meditation. It really helps me out a lot. I mean, I've had
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:22.940]  the FDA in my office for three days now. We get attacked for what we're doing, but our quality
[02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:29.740]  control is so important because when you look at about a month ago, I was looking online and looking
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:33.740]  at other nutraceutical companies out there and saying, is there anybody out there that's doing
[02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:40.700]  this that cares enough to really spend so much time tracking down raw materials? And it's not
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:47.820]  easy these days. This is not a pitch of all the contaminants. The third-party vitamin supplement
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:53.100]  sites that are the most prestigious, we're like the most popular because we really,
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:57.980]  people can't believe that our experts, how good this stuff is. And it does freak me out that
[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:01.660]  there's some other good people out there. You have these great, a lot of great, but the fact
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:06.940]  that there are so few really top rate companies really giving people good quality for reasonable
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:15.020]  prices. I mean, it is amazing to, again, just know that we're really the best. I mean, InfoWars
[02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:21.260]  is now in the top 100 sites, and they even miscounted us as other websites and companies I have,
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:25.740]  and free speech systems is bigger than InfoWars. Well, no, if you combine us, the only thing
[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:31.500]  bigger than us is Drudge. I mean, it's crazy. The good thing about that is, and I love to do this,
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:37.580]  is just go online and look at all the results, because nothing that we do matters unless it
[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:43.340]  actually affects the individual that's buying the product, that's taking the product, that's
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:47.980]  listening to the show. How are you going to change their life for the better? That's the question
[02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:53.100]  that I ask myself every day, and you ask yourself, what am I going to do? Well, you-
[02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:57.820]  I don't want my kids to be deficient in things and then have a horrible life. I mean, I don't want
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:01.580]  your kids to either, and again, I'm not saying I'm a hero, but it's like when I was already choking
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:07.180]  15 years ago, or 13 years ago, and no one would help her in a full restaurant. They were all
[02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:13.500]  saying 9-1-1 like parrots. I went over and saved her, and it's just so weird to me that it's been
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:18.540]  bred out of us to even care about people. It's like I'm a chump because I care, but I digress
[02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:23.260]  getting off into that. But it is coming back. I mean, we are starting to see more and more people
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:26.860]  now that are actually caring and helping more people, and that's the point- And it's not even
[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:31.500]  a big deal. If I'm choking, better save me. That's empathy. It's not that I'm even a good guy. It's
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:36.540]  like, help me. I'm going to help you. I mean, what the hell? Or, you know, love thy neighbor
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:40.620]  as thyself, right? Look, I don't apologize for getting upset because people are in a trance.
[02:28:40.620 --> 02:28:43.980]  Look at how they admit chimeras. In fact, I cut you off. Let's put a minute on this.
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:49.740]  Human animal hybrids. This is incredible. This has been going on with DARPA and with underground
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:54.460]  Blackwater-type organizations for a long time. We've talked about it on the show. It's transhumanism.
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:29:03.500]  It's merging animal genes with humans basically to create hybrids, hybrid humans for military use,
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:10.220]  for Oregon generation, for many other things. You know, any geneticists, well, I'm not going
[02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:15.980]  to say any geneticists, but if you look at the way that we were created, we are not meant to
[02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:23.660]  be half animal genes spliced into ours. And so for the first time, the National Institute of Health
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:30.220]  says, what do you think about scientists creating non-human hybrid? They posted on their website
[02:29:30.220 --> 02:29:35.180]  a daily public comment period for 30 days. And this is how they do it before they approve some
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:40.620]  ability for companies to do these genetic splicing. You know what? This is so huge. Well,
[02:29:40.620 --> 02:29:44.140]  you take the cyber for the news tonight. She can really spend time on this because
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:49.820]  they're getting ready to, quote, legalize it. It's already been going on. This is so important.
[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:53.740]  Dr. Group, thank you so much. Thanks for having me. John Ronson's coming up. Folks,
[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:57.820]  get bio, true, Selenium and PolarStore.com 1995.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:04.940]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady, of course,
[02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:09.980]  as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then
[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:14.380]  corruption its necessary consequence. Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the one
[02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:18.780]  percent of the one percent consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice
[02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:23.500]  in government. Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice. We now live in a neo feudalistic society
[02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:27.660]  in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:31.900]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process
[02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:36.380]  politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy. Simply put, we the people are
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:40.540]  responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:44.460]  into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world. We falsely believe that everything
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:49.100]  is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:53.500]  will change once more of us realize this truth. As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:57.740]  people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits
[02:30:57.740 --> 02:31:03.500]  at the dawn of day. This is Kit Daniels within FullWars.com. Brain force, it's completely different.
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:09.980]  Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain
[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:14.380]  force did. I'd been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in
[02:31:14.380 --> 02:31:19.180]  here at 8 30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it,
[02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:22.780]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right
[02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:27.500]  there. I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of
[02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:32.540]  clears up. Got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why
[02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:37.580]  third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:42.220]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in
[02:31:42.220 --> 02:31:46.540]  a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6 45 this
[02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:51.820]  morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in. You will find

[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:52.460]  Yes, you're passing the cemetery gates. One day we'll all be there. But what we stand for
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:55.980]  and what we write and our children and their children will live on after us, even if we don't
[02:33:55.980 --> 02:34:01.900]  believe in life after death. Genetically, there is life after death unless the species itself
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:09.820]  is destroyed and our genetics mutated by design to turn humans into abominations.
[02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:14.940]  I was just talking with Dr. Grubs and we'll go shoot a video finale news tonight at 7 o'clock
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:19.740]  central on how they're coming out and they've already legalized it but now they're going to
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:26.780]  comment period. Oh, you get a comment where they're going to openly start putting on the market the
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:33.660]  products of the human animal clones and most of these clones are only 3, 4, 5, 10 percent human
[02:34:34.860 --> 02:34:40.620]  like the cows that are part human that create human milk that China's had for 15 years and
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:46.620]  they sell in stores in China, the Chinese army for whatever reason drinks it. I've got
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:52.940]  BBC TV shows about this, you know, 20 years ago, spider ghosts that are part spider and they had
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:59.020]  those 10 years before that but I've talked to the folks in the research labs where they're not,
[02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:07.740]  you know, 5% goat or 5% spider, 95% goat. John Ronson's here, you know, he talks about
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:11.660]  crazy things that go in our world. He's written a lot of best-selling books like
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:15.260]  Ministeric Goats and Them and of course he writes for The Guardian and a lot of other big
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:21.500]  publications. He's here, I guess, doing a solo piece. He was telling me, I'm not sure exactly what
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:29.260]  but I saw him at the DNC or the RNC and thought it was really interesting so he came to town and
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:34.140]  he's hanging out with us today and this is the guy, if you're a new listener, that snuck into
[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:41.100]  Bohemian Grove with myself and Mike Hansen. Now the way the media works though is one night,
[02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:47.420]  it's about 1230, I'm sorry, getting phone calls. People are saying, hey, you said you snuck into
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:51.900]  Bohemian Grove with Mike Hansen, you've taken the credit from John Ronson. Now John didn't do this
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:58.940]  but what happened was, I mean, he didn't do it on purpose but he then after the book finally came
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:03.020]  out and the TV show had come out, he was able to admit he'd gone in but he didn't want to get
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:07.100]  sued or shut down. He was kind of the mastermind of the whole deal that got us the source inside
[02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:10.460]  that helped us get in when everybody else had failed. So that's his credit. I appreciate him
[02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:14.140]  bringing me along and financing us doing it. I didn't have the money to go, you know,
[02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:17.500]  plane tickets and stuff at that time in 1999. I mean, I guess I did but it would still be,
[02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:21.660]  you know, hard for us to do that trip. So when you wrote that big article that I saw after the
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:25.660]  RNC saying, oh my god, I feel kind of horrible, I've kind of launched the monster Alex Jones.
[02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:31.340]  Well, I think you helped me in a big way. I didn't call you a monster. I said I was your
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:36.060]  Simon Cowell. You were my one direction. I know, but I think you did, I mean, I don't have the
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:40.940]  article in front of me but you said, I now kind of feel bad. Well, no, no, I don't feel,
[02:36:40.940 --> 02:36:44.940]  pull the article up. You said something like now you're having regrets or because it's a horrible
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:49.740]  evil Trump Trump creature. I don't want to have it. I don't know. I'm not mad at you. Yeah. I'm
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:54.380]  not mad at you. I mean, I'm wanting to understand though, because I'm really a good guy. I think
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:37:00.300]  I'm a good guy. So you know, I, I, you know, I think our night at Bohemian Grove is one of the
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:04.780]  great nights of my life. I could never feel anything but warmth towards somebody who I
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:08.460]  said that adventure and I wasn't feeling the credit. You asked me to keep a secret. Yeah.
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:12.060]  And I feel like we just didn't coordinate when you finally came out and said that you'd gone into.
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:16.700]  Yes, exactly. At first, I didn't want to say that I wanted to be in Grove too,
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:20.540]  because I just wanted to be able to use the, you know, the material and
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:27.180]  but eventually I admitted that I went in as well. There's a whole bunch of people who feel that we
[02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:30.300]  were, I don't know if you kind of read all the stuff. I remember after it happened, there was a
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:33.900]  whole bunch of people who say, well, they let them in. They let them in. We were like kind of their,
[02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:41.260]  their sales. Well, let's be clear that there was someone that worked there that gave us some intel
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:45.500]  and we talked to locals and then we talked to a local lawyer. We're going to stop right there.
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:50.380]  But no, clearly they are super pissed we got in. They arrested reporters last time I went there
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:55.980]  with the history channel to try to cover it. And you know, we can never be given any credit for
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:38:00.220]  anything. You didn't write your books. You didn't get them turned into huge movies. You didn't raise
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:03.980]  your kids. You probably didn't wipe your butt this day. The Queen of England was there to do that,
[02:38:03.980 --> 02:38:10.140]  right? Do you remember when we first met? We first met a year earlier at Waco. Waco, you had
[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:14.780]  read. We didn't really meet though. That was fake too. We didn't even walk from our cars up to
[02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:18.940]  there. The government carried us up there. You know, the government has a respirator actually.
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:23.020]  I'm like, Garth Vader, they breathe for me too. No, I mean, what that is is internet trolls who
[02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:27.420]  are what you call a real conspiracy theorist who are basically like fiction writers, but they claim
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:31.260]  they're not fiction writers. And then they discredit people that actually go out and do real research
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:36.940]  like you and myself. Yeah, you actually get on planes and do stuff. Yes. Yeah. Anyway, but getting
[02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:41.740]  back to that, it was great meeting you there. And yes, I would say Bohemian Grove. We were already
[02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:45.660]  on the map reaching a lot of people expanding, but that pushes the next level. So thank you,
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:49.900]  John Ronson. Alex, I'm very pleased. As you said, when I met you at the RNC, we're kind of intertwined
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:56.460]  in history together. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. It was a great night. Impressive.
[02:38:56.460 --> 02:39:02.540]  Most impressive. We met a year earlier. I went to Waco with Randy Weaver. Yes. And Randy Weaver
[02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:07.100]  said, oh, my God, it's Alex Jones. He was like really excited to see you there. He was a fan of
[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:13.740]  yours. He's a great guy. Yeah. So you were already, you know, known in a circle, but
[02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:19.420]  and you had rebuilt you personally. Well, again, that's an example of stuff getting away from me.
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:23.820]  We went out there and there was only like maybe eight or nine Davidians still living there. These
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:27.580]  were not the cult they'd said. I mean, an evil cult. They were abused people kind of used by
[02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:32.860]  their personalities. There'd been this big giant fat guy, I think named Rodin. There's a war
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:37.420]  winning Academy award winning films, obviously about it, but who ran a meth lab and weighed
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:42.140]  like 400 pounds and would run around torturing, you know, the seventh day Adventist break off group
[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:45.660]  that had been out there for 80 years thinking the end of the world was coming. And then David
[02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:50.220]  Koresh, Vernon Howell stood up to them. So even though he was whacked out thinking he was God,
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:54.220]  because, you know, 80 people out of the middle of nowhere thought he was, he was better than the
[02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:57.500]  guy that was there before. The point was they could have arrested him in town at any time.
[02:39:57.500 --> 02:40:01.420]  They decided to have this big, you know, stand up to a cult, start the civil war with Americans
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:05.900]  there. And it blew up in the government's face, but it showed the disconnect of the Clintons and
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:10.060]  how they thought America would respond to Waco. The truth is the government was doing evil stuff
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:16.540]  in line. The Davidians were just really sad cult victims in my view, but didn't deserve to be
[02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:21.820]  surrounded by tanks and murdered. And so I was there saying, no, and then I'm just supposed
[02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:24.700]  to be talking here, but this is what Alex Jones does. No, no, but you're actually here to interview
[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:27.900]  me. So I just brought you up. You're asking the questions. So see their trolls. That's what's
[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:31.020]  happening here on my own show. But, but, but I am going to make you talk in a minute. But getting
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:36.620]  back to this, since we're going down memory lane, they go, we wish we had a place to have our
[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:41.020]  memorial every year for everybody that died. Them, the police, they were very sad for the dead,
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:47.740]  even ATF and FBI people. They were very humble folks, a few survivors and Clive Doyle and others,
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:52.140]  very, very sweet, very pious Christian people who've been abused. And so I'm like, yeah,
[02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:55.740]  we'll put a new roof on this little shack you've got that 10 people can, you know, get in and
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:41:00.380]  I'm going to donate $1,000. And then they told people I donated that or whatever. And then it
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:06.300]  got away and my listeners ran up there and just started building this giant thing to say they
[02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:09.260]  were sorry to the Davidians and it just got out of control. So that's what happened. I don't
[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:12.380]  remember. Kind of like us going to Bohemian Grove did. Because remember, I didn't believe
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:18.060]  there was satanic stuff going on at first, did I? I mean, my memory of Bohemian Grove is that you
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:22.620]  said that there was a, there was a mollock that. No, no, once I got there, I went with a more
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:27.980]  extreme view, which I think was. No, beforehand, I was thinking, oh yeah, big L, right. Remember,
[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:32.300]  you go back to Waco. Let's walk through the story the next 10 minutes. You've got the floor,
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:36.380]  which means I interrupt you every 10 seconds. Okay. So, so I went to Waco with Randy Weaver,
[02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:41.820]  who obviously was, I'm sure all your listeners know about the Ruby Ridge massacre and so on.
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:46.460]  Total setup. Yeah. I was making a documentary about with Randy Weaver's daughter, Rachel,
[02:41:46.460 --> 02:41:48.940]  who was just, you know, such a lovely person. I don't know what's happened to her.
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:55.500]  And so I went with Randy to, to Waco and we were all sitting around a campfire,
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:42:01.100]  member Colonel Bo Grites was there hammering away. And he was the inspiration for Rambo,
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:05.660]  right? I believe he says that. Yeah. Okay. And he probably is. He's referencing for
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:10.060]  her. And then Randy Weaver was like, Oh my God, Alex Jones is here and said, what a funny was
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:14.540]  of yours. And then you told me something I didn't know. I remember my very first conversation.
[02:42:14.540 --> 02:42:20.620]  You said that Long Horayuchi, who was the FBI sniper, who was the guy who killed Randy Weaver's
[02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:25.500]  wife, Vicki Weaver, while she was holding a baby in the doorway of their cabin was the same
[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:31.100]  sniper who was at Waco. It was amazing. And by the way, my memory is good. But when you said
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:34.300]  that about Bo, I didn't want to just say it if I hadn't remembered it. So I had to go back and
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:40.700]  remember it. And indeed, he did go try to find the POWs and MIs and not just he's not just
[02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:44.620]  inspiration for that part of the Rambo story. It's a composite. He's also the inspiration
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:50.620]  just interrupted you to be clear. For what is it? Uncommon Valor? What's the one with one of
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:54.060]  my favorite actors, the guy that plays Lex Luthor and the original Superman? What's his name?
[02:42:54.060 --> 02:42:58.780]  So I'm already getting seen on my Hillary now. Oh, he's the guy and the enemy of the state.
[02:42:58.780 --> 02:43:04.860]  Yeah, favorite actor. You mean I and I tell you what is his name? Gene Hackman. Absolutely. So
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:11.180]  yes, he is he is the inspiration of many films. Okay, so so I remember meeting you at Waco. And
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:15.180]  then about a year later, I decided to show out this book called them, which was enough. There
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:21.260]  really is a secret room from which shadowy cabal secretly rules the world. It's got to be somewhere.
[02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:27.500]  And if it's somewhere, you know, maybe I can get in. So so I tried to infiltrate the builder group
[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:33.580]  in Portugal and got chased away by their private security guards. And so which was terrifying.
[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:36.620]  And I noticed over the years reading your articles in The Guardian and other big papers,
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:41.420]  you've gotten more towards my views in a lot of way about big shadowy corruption. But I've gotten
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:46.220]  more towards your views because when I was 26 years old or whatever it was when I was talking
[02:43:46.220 --> 02:43:50.540]  about Himean Grove, I was there in the crowd of the men getting off on it. That was very real.
[02:43:50.540 --> 02:43:53.660]  And I think you agree to that in your book. That was real. But obviously it's a mock human
[02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:58.220]  sacrifice. And then I got bullied by the internet. And back then I could be bullied not now. I mean,
[02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:02.540]  I love it. But you know, you mature that no, that's a real person. And that's why I said, okay,
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:06.940]  maybe then the press all ran with that. And that's not right to say no, they're not killing a real
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:10.940]  person there. Okay. And most people there aren't devil worshipers. And I don't think they're all
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:15.820]  out to get people. But there is an occult thing behind it. And overall, you go to sculling bones
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:19.900]  and other secret societies, there is human sacrifice going on. It's been proven it's come
[02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:24.220]  out in police reports, little kids being abused. But that's at other facilities around the world.
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:28.300]  And I'm not going to say Bohemian Grove is part of that. But I did say with my crew was Joe Biggs
[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:34.540]  and our investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, that when Scalia died, they all said this looks
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:39.660]  like Bohemian Grove of Texas. All the weird devil stuff turned out it was a Bohemian Grove subgroup
[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:44.780]  meeting. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, well, I mean, see, so who can make that up? But my big memory of
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:49.900]  Bohemian Grove was in fact, about a year later, I mean, I know we're kind of skipping back and
[02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:55.420]  forward. But about a year later, I was giving a talk in Belfast, because sure, you came out with
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:45:00.460]  your documentary, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where where you did kind of say, well,
[02:45:00.460 --> 02:45:07.180]  maybe it was actual human sacrifice. And then I bought up my book, them, where I said it definitely
[02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:13.100]  wasn't true human sacrifice. And I think it's fair, you're going on C-Span like you're with this guy,
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:16.140]  you're saying they're killing people, you didn't really throw me under the bus, you've had to
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:21.020]  kind of say I don't agree with Alex. Yeah, I had to say that. But because your interpretation of the
[02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:26.460]  ritual was quite far out, I was forced into this kind of weird position, where I had to kind of
[02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:33.020]  defend the Bush family's proclivity to mock human sacrifice. I'm not going to, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:37.740]  Which is a kind of weird, I never thought I'd be in that position. Well, I mean, when it's going
[02:45:37.740 --> 02:45:41.660]  bones, it is some really bad stuff. I mean, that is really dark. I tried to get into skull and bones
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:46.380]  also, but failed. I want to say you're a real journalist adventure. Everything you do, all your
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:52.060]  books, everything, I mean, it's really riveting stuff because you actually go and do it. Yeah,
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:55.500]  I actually give it a give it a shot. I'm not going to sit behind my desk and make stuff up. I'm
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:46:00.140]  going to actually, you know, but, but going back since we skipped ahead, we're going to come and
[02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:04.540]  choose your adventure, going way back to Waco. Do you remember us standing around at the side of
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:08.060]  the building building with church? You're like, no, they really do have a big statue. They really
[02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:13.100]  do do this mock thing. But even then, see how I got even more radicalized. I was more almost
[02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:17.820]  mainline, just Patriot, you know, Ron Paul, anti fellow reserve guy. Don't you remember me going
[02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:21.340]  really? You really think they do it? I don't remember that. I mean, I'm so, I'm good. But then
[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:27.900]  once I got there and the old member one, I mean, isn't it you that did say, but Alex is right,
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:32.860]  they were in religious rapture. You know, this is where I think me and you really do
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:39.180]  combine in our in our memories of that night at Bohemian Grove. They were really into it.
[02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:43.020]  They were really into the into the ceremony that they were doing this kind of, you know,
[02:46:43.980 --> 02:46:49.660]  stupid, pageanty robes and hoods. You know, you shall burn me once again this night and all of
[02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:54.300]  this kind of kind of you shall burn me again and all of that stuff. And they were really
[02:46:54.300 --> 02:47:02.460]  big fire. And yeah, I remember one guy came up to us and said, you know, is this your first time
[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:05.980]  here? And I'm like, yeah, yeah, we just came up the drive. I had to go, are you going to love it?
[02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:09.340]  Burn him, burn him. And kind of everyone was like really into it. I thought like, I thought,
[02:47:09.340 --> 02:47:13.020]  okay, so Alex and my, I'm being completely honest. I thought, okay, Alex and Micah kind of
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:18.380]  really into this thinking it's some kind of Mollick type deal. All the Bohemians are really
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:23.580]  into it too. That's like I'm the only person who's who thinks this is kind of nuts. Well,
[02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:28.780]  the men were in religious rapture as I stood there with over a thousand, you know, billionaires and
[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:33.260]  globalists and world leaders. And they were, you know, I've gone to Holy Roller churches. I've been
[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:37.820]  in Baptist churches. I've seen it. It was more religious ecstasy than the lady in the front row
[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:43.740]  at the at the Pentecostal church. And they were seething. And it is a ritual mixed with druidic,
[02:47:43.740 --> 02:47:49.500]  Faustian, Babylonian tire. So there is Mollick in it. There's a bunch of aspects. It's a cosmology.
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:56.140]  It's kind of an integrated system to put all of their cares and their sins on this
[02:47:57.260 --> 02:48:01.420]  effigy of a child. It is small. Yeah. About like a 10 year old kid or eight year old kid.
[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:05.820]  And then they are transmuting an alchemy. And I've talked to people that are in the occult. They
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:11.020]  say, no, that's what that is. Not Christians, cultists. They are putting it on to that dummy.
[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:16.300]  And they are in a ritual of a bunch of powerful men. So the ritual is as a psychic ritual with
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:20.620]  powerful men that believe that they're basically druidic priests. Yeah, they say that what they're
[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:24.300]  doing when they burn this effigy, they're burning all their troubles in the world, all their
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.860]  responsibilities so they can enjoy their summer vacation. So that's their interpretation of it.
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:34.060]  But you're right. So I was in Belfast. I was giving a talk in Belfast. And I was, you know,
[02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:37.500]  talking about our infiltration, about getting into being in grove and everything. Everyone was
[02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:41.980]  laughing. And because it's a funny story. And then in the Q&A, somebody said to me, okay, I know what
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:46.940]  you think of it. And I know what Alex Jones thinks of it. But what are the people who actually
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:52.860]  do the ritual? What do they think of it? And I said, you're right, they seem to be really into it.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:59.580]  And that game of the idea to write The Minister of Goats, because I thought, okay, in them I was
[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:05.580]  looking at, you know, belief systems on the fringes. And I thought, well, you know, these people
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:09.820]  at Bohemian Grove are kind of in positions of power. Are they seem to believe all this
[02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:14.620]  rational stuff? So, well, Stubblebind, he was one of the top Army generals, ran special forces,
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:18.220]  a bunch of different titles. I thought he might seem like a pretty rational guy who's on the show
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:23.500]  here. He says, John Ronson, that's not accurate. But then I know you have a lot of the witnesses
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:26.700]  that were in it that say that did go on. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, I interviewed General
[02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:32.780]  Stubblebind up in, in upstate New York, in a hotel interviewed him a couple of times. And yes,
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:36.380]  he was head of Army Intelligence. I know he's a fan of yours and may be watching this right now.
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:42.380]  So, yeah, he was head of Army Intelligence with 16,000 soldiers under his command. And he got it
[02:49:42.380 --> 02:49:50.380]  into his head that, you know, what is the atom mostly made up of space? What are we mostly made
[02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:58.300]  up of space? Well, what are we mostly made up of atoms? Yes. So if you can like merge the spaces,
[02:49:59.020 --> 02:50:04.940]  then you can pass through up to you. So to me, I mean, like Star Trek being energized,
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:09.740]  beamed. I mean, to me, the problem with all of this is, is mostly, he said, what is the atom
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.980]  mostly made up of his spaces, some other stuff too. Anyway, so he would get up from behind his desk
[02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:21.660]  in Arlington and, you know, try and walk through his wall, but would keep bumping his nose and even
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:27.020]  got bruised and was worried. But they did kill a goat staring at him? Well, you know what, a goat
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:31.500]  fell over while being stared at us apparently. But I think if he was a young goat though,
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:36.620]  well, it died. We don't, I don't know if it died. What I know is if you stare at a goat for long
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:41.580]  enough, it'll eventually fall over, but it could be coincidence. It could be like bored. It could
[02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:47.260]  be just, you know, so apparently we can talk more about the goat staring if you would. Absolutely.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:51.020]  I'm gonna talk about whatever new projects you're working on. I guess you're working on them right
[02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:55.660]  now. And yeah, we'll come back with John Ronson, give it your website, Twitter, any of that type
[02:50:55.660 --> 02:50:59.980]  of stuff as well. I'm Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us. There's a lot more coming up. I'll

[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:28.700]  now the news is coming up tonight seven o'clock central but right now let's get more into donald
[02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:33.020]  trump and your view i mean i know you're like a mainline liberals what i'd call you but you're
[02:54:33.020 --> 02:54:38.060]  a good guy uh actually a liberal that can talk and somebody liberals claim they're super intellectual
[02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:41.900]  but then when you actually try to debate them they didn't say i see myself as a real liberal
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:46.300]  in the thomas jefferson thing like i have lower taxes i do what i want as long as i don't hurt you
[02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:52.780]  i have guns that's liberal uh you know my girls know how to use firearms that's that's real feminism
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:56.700]  and no man or any other woman's going to abuse them without them fighting back the average liberal
[02:54:56.700 --> 02:55:00.700]  woman i know can't even hardly wipe their nose and they're taught to be these gibbering victims
[02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:06.940]  the crisis in fact you said you wanted to interview me about this piece you're doing i don't know if
[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:10.620]  you can talk about your own piece here while you're doing the interview uh which then the trolls
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:15.100]  will transmute into me interrupting you in your interview of me here on air which is what this
[02:55:15.100 --> 02:55:19.500]  really is but i want to hear what you have to say is it's so interesting so it's kind of a double
[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:23.660]  interview i'm interviewing you me you're interviewing you know i'm interviewing me you're
[02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:29.580]  interviewing you no but seriously teleprompter free folks looking at this you made a really
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:35.260]  good point on the phone last week and when we were talking about the crisis in the mainstream media
[02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:40.220]  and why it's imploding why it's not trusted why it's not falling apart separate conservatives
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:44.700]  and libertarians and all their problems and trump nobody's perfect and the horrible republican
[02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:50.140]  establishment sure i get it but the democrats really seem to have reached a new nastiness level
[02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:56.860]  is it arrogance is it fatigue i mean you really seem to crystallize the hypocrisy yeah i mean it's
[02:55:56.860 --> 02:56:00.940]  it's always hard for me to talk about a story while i'm writing it because my thought process is all
[02:56:00.940 --> 02:56:05.020]  muddled and and it's only when i'm sort of sitting there for weeks writing about it that i begin to
[02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:12.460]  make sense of things but i i but when i do stories i never want to go in with my own preconceptions
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:18.220]  intact i want to see the world through the eyes of the people that i'm writing about and i certainly
[02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:22.060]  see double standards as i said to you on the phone well that's what's impressive is you're
[02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:25.980]  actually that's why you're so successful you're actually a real journalist in that i may disagree
[02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:29.980]  with your final outcome a little bit or some but the point is it still you actually do get
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:33.180]  another people's shoes well what i was saying to you on the phone and i'm still trying to figure
[02:56:33.180 --> 02:56:37.500]  i'm still trying to figure this out in my head but so what i'm about to say maybe maybe nonsense
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:41.740]  or it may be valid i don't know but what i said to you on the phone the other day is i was thinking
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:48.860]  about Pat Smith the the woman whose son died in Benghazi and she was on stage at the RNC
[02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:55.260]  and you know very upset and in fact at one point she yelled out Hilary for prison and i thought wow
[02:56:55.260 --> 02:57:00.460]  Alex Jones has made it onto the stage of of the Republican National Convention when she shouted
[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:06.300]  that out anyway after Pat Smith's speech the next day a lot of people on my side of the fence a lot
[02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:10.620]  of people on what you'd call the liberal media or the mainstream media or whatever were like
[02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:15.580]  look at how the Trump people exploited this grieving woman having her on stage
[02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:20.780]  people are crazy with grief and you shouldn't be exploiting people like that by having them
[02:57:20.780 --> 02:57:27.100]  on stage and making political points so the following week the Karns were on at the DNC
[02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:33.980]  and nobody said that about the Karns nobody said the Democrats are exploiting this family
[02:57:33.980 --> 02:57:39.180]  that are crazy with grief now i happen to think that the Karns have every right to be on stage at
[02:57:39.180 --> 02:57:44.300]  the DNC and i also think that Pat Smith sure i mean he used to the Democrats would at least
[02:57:44.300 --> 02:57:49.420]  not be nasty it's funny they've gone to a new level exactly and and looking but no but i find
[02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:55.580]  that those double standards you know when when my people do something wrong i get really interested
[02:57:55.580 --> 02:57:59.980]  i mean this is the purpose of my book uh so you've been publicly shamed about kind of social media
[02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:04.140]  shaming so i'm really interested like i'm not is that why you're in the age relics and carla cook
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:08.540]  well i i i don't really know anything about them well they're trying to shame us and get out of
[02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:12.700]  there you know right but then you're trying to say the same as well they well they the internet
[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:16.700]  grabbed and we didn't make the meme right right i wouldn't actually do that cause money age relics
[02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:21.820]  and all that okay so um but yeah so i thought that's really interesting and i think you in
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:25.260]  left you know you need to look at those double standards you need to look at what both sides
[02:58:25.260 --> 02:58:29.660]  sure but i mean now he is age relics so see i'm saying i wouldn't coin age relics but what do i
[02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:34.940]  do when he's now known as lord age relics king of the memes right well you know what i haven't seen
[02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:39.660]  the clips i i i haven't maybe we should play some of these later as we descend and the carl the
[02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:45.340]  cuck you want a conservative cuckus um you are with me you're cuckolding us or cuckolding that's
[02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:50.300]  like uh when you when you like a man has sex with your wife in front of you right okay we'll be right

[03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:39.500]  points john ronzo once again so we'll get into ministeric goats and your new book about uh trolls
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:43.820]  but since you mentioned the trolls let's get into that now uh you know people can call it trolls
[03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:48.620]  being mean to somebody else i think as long as you're being mean to somebody who's in power who's
[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:53.900]  corrupt who's done something to you or who you disagree with you know you're in public life you
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:59.420]  should have a thick skin uh i know also kids can be mean things that would go on a junior high before
[03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:05.020]  that wouldn't be magnified now are i don't want to have legislation that curtailes hurtful speech
[03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:10.540]  people have libel laws for that because it's going to be used to shut down my speech and the democratic
[03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:16.540]  party and the over in the eu merkel you know arresting people they criticize open borders and
[03:01:16.540 --> 03:01:22.940]  floods of muslim migrants uh so so i really see it being used i've never read your book i've read
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:27.580]  your other books what does your book get into and what's your view on that well okay so my book is
[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:33.740]  basically about the rise of um shaming culture and outrage culture particularly on twitter
[03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:40.620]  and i tell stories about people who were kind of well well i will i tell what are the stories from
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:45.900]  the book very very quickly i said a woman called justine sacker who just before going to cake town
[03:01:45.900 --> 03:01:51.980]  was at Heathrow airport and she tweeted going to africa hope i don't get aids just kidding i'm white
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:55.900]  and then she got on the plane and while she was asleep on the plane twitter took control of her
[03:01:55.900 --> 03:02:00.460]  life and just tore it apart even though a joke was she was trying to make a kind of south park
[03:02:00.460 --> 03:02:06.700]  type joke about you know mocking her own privilege but you know while she was asleep and unable to
[03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:11.820]  defend herself twitter destroyed and i wasn't you know i mean everybody just just in destruction
[03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:17.180]  was a destruction that everybody could get behind so she was destroyed by kind of um
[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:23.740]  misogynistic trolls by hipsters by social justice people she was destroyed by everybody and that's
[03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:28.220]  what really interested me i was about to say i think the real battle for the average liberal
[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:35.100]  fake liberal program zombie is the hipsters joining the troll army against the oppressive
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:40.220]  trolling of political correctness so a tighten against a tighten a troll against a troll
[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:46.380]  so i really see this theme now where a lot of liberals are deprogramming
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:52.620]  because it's so much more fun to actually troll the fake liberals but but i i saw what happened
[03:02:52.620 --> 03:03:00.300]  to her why is south park anointed to be able to do all this but other people aren't and i think that
[03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:07.020]  goes back to political correctness in general hoisted on your own petard yeah well i mean just
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:13.580]  well yes i mean one of the terrible things about justines i i always talk about justing because
[03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:17.500]  it's one of the most kind of startling stories in my book there's many many stories in my book and i
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:22.700]  and i spend time with these people i wanted to kind of rehumanize them um you know the purpose
[03:03:22.700 --> 03:03:30.460]  of a social media shaming is to kind of objectify and ruin somebody define them by a fragment of
[03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:35.020]  their lives and the thing about justine's disruption is that she was asleep on a plane
[03:03:35.020 --> 03:03:39.260]  and complete she didn't even know she was being tried and convicted until after the conviction
[03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:44.460]  had happened and she was fired from a job and you know because everybody's scared when when twitter
[03:03:44.460 --> 03:03:49.820]  rises up on mass not get it she's on an airplane for eight hours when she lands yeah this is a
[03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:56.940]  21st century issue where your 15 minutes of fame is your 15 minute funeral pyre yeah exactly so
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:04:02.380]  she lands turns on her phone and there's a text from somebody that says you need to phone me right
[03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:08.380]  now you are the worldwide number one trending topic on twitter let's see let me give you a Jedi secret
[03:04:08.380 --> 03:04:16.540]  the key to that is you own it you jump and ride that tiger and you love it and you double down
[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:21.740]  if tiger woods would have doubled down he'd be the number one playboy in the world instead he
[03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:29.260]  groveled and apologized and slithered around and everything and choked up and i i agree i i think
[03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:33.820]  you know but justine was like i mean his wife was a bad guy beat him with a with a golf club
[03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:37.820]  but i wanted to i'm sorry to my wife you beat him with a golf club i wanted to write about
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:42.620]  private individuals who were completely unprepared for something like this so you know people like
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:46.780]  justine and lindsay stone and the other people are right about instead of doubling down and you
[03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:51.660]  know dealing with it in some sort of rational way like a public figure would broke i mean these people
[03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:56.380]  became depressed and exactly so let's talk about that how people are being trained to respond to
[03:04:56.380 --> 03:05:05.660]  this as victims instead of lavishing it jobing here with info wars dot com and this is an email
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:12.220]  from family jeno i took down my rebel flag which you can't buy on ebay anymore and pill the nra
[03:05:12.220 --> 03:05:18.460]  sticker off my rear car window i disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy ass neighborhood
[03:05:18.460 --> 03:05:23.900]  watch i bought two pakistani flags and put one at each corner of the front yard then i purchased the
[03:05:23.900 --> 03:05:29.660]  black flag of isis which you can buy on ebay and ran it up the flagpole now the local police

[03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:48.540]  wife and i to wear when we shop or travel everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us

[03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:32.620]  in electing the first conspiracy freak president i mean is this the pivot we've been talking about
[03:09:32.620 --> 03:09:38.460]  he's not pivoting for presidential he's pivoting to alex jones he's pivoting to crazy this is if alex
[03:09:38.460 --> 03:09:43.660]  jones is now the head of the republican party because every conspiracy theory are all coming
[03:09:43.660 --> 03:09:47.020]  together and they've created this narrative right i mean this is astonishing you know i
[03:09:47.020 --> 03:09:52.220]  feel like you kind of have seen alex jones ish ideas filtering into the republican party for
[03:09:52.220 --> 03:09:57.660]  a long time you've kind of seen them you know edging up to him but the idea that yes that he's
[03:09:57.660 --> 03:10:02.060]  the kind of authority figure for a major republican politician talking about what he knows about the
[03:10:02.060 --> 03:10:08.620]  world that that's new it is surreal to talk about issues here on here and then word for word here
[03:10:08.620 --> 03:10:13.100]  in front say it two days later i think he said the other day that it's surreal to hear donald trump
[03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:19.740]  saying his words and it's like yeah you're right alex i agree with you for once completely surreal
[03:10:20.460 --> 03:10:24.620]  and it just shows how dialed in this guy is and that's why this is scared of him the alex jones
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:30.540]  i've been watching a lot recently he's like the sort of the sort of um main conspiracy theorist
[03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:34.700]  this is probably the most popular in american life right now the right-wing smear machine has
[03:10:34.700 --> 03:10:39.580]  gotten alex jonesified this election cycle jones is the conspiracy theorist and creator of the
[03:10:39.580 --> 03:10:44.860]  fringe website info wars they're all in on this on this total conspiracy theory that literally
[03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:51.420]  came from info wars completely bonkers conspiracy theorist you have trump who gets all his information
[03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:58.060]  from forwarded emails from cat ladies i'm serious we get all of his information off the web he doesn't
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:11:03.660]  do any research this is almost internet culture seeping out into the country where channeled through
[03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:08.380]  the canada i mean like that to me is the key part where i jones has embraced donald trump fully
[03:11:08.380 --> 03:11:13.340]  keeping praise on republican almanac and his team for their apparent acknowledgement of his movement
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:16.060]  there's no way that trump people would have reached out to me a year and a half ago if he
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:20.380]  wasn't aware of the work jones told the new republic he's been what you call a closet conspiracy
[03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:24.860]  theorist for 50 years i think he's been a chameleon in the system and how he's now he sees the time
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:29.340]  to strike i've had some short behind-the-scenes conversations with donald trump that if the
[03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:34.300]  media knew about those they'd really be freaking out and running around screaming these conspiracy
[03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:40.300]  theorists had the gup nominees here like they've never had before trump listens to what we say
[03:11:40.300 --> 03:11:44.380]  and then i personally enough talk to him some off air and he literally is either the biggest
[03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:50.860]  manipulator ever or he's for real he's he literally listens to what i and others say it's amazing the
[03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:55.020]  trump campaign is helping make sure that these conspiracy theorists get closer and closer to
[03:11:55.020 --> 03:12:00.140]  the republican mainstream the fact that the trump people gave us passes that i mean literally maybe
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:06.460]  a hundred people had it was in newsweek you name it jones you know the controversy had like you know
[03:12:06.460 --> 03:12:12.620]  the super level passes the ace of spades oh my god this is important how evil trump is absolutely
[03:12:12.620 --> 03:12:18.220]  important how horrible trump is to you and your global agenda and it shows how fast we can take
[03:12:18.220 --> 03:12:22.140]  this country back once people get it and once we have leadership if there used to be six degrees
[03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:26.460]  of separation for someone like alex jones to a to a general like to a party's nominee there's
[03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:31.020]  now one i mean if there's nothing there's no middleman right like it goes right from alex jones
[03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:36.060]  and it shows up in donald trump's mouth donald trump himself told me that he's seen so many of
[03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:41.580]  your supporters and listeners at his rallies he loves the hillary for prison t-shirts and he knows
[03:12:41.580 --> 03:12:46.940]  exactly where they came from so alex i'm certain that he is grateful even for your support
[03:12:46.940 --> 03:12:56.700]  therefore just behind his back and i believe it says it's a hillary for prison 2006 right that's
[03:12:56.700 --> 03:13:03.260]  not the hillary can't no i don't think so but very very good uh we just saw you read it there you go
[03:13:04.460 --> 03:13:09.580]  good job chris too a camera operator not the person who came up with you right yeah
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:14.220]  yeah he's not that clever conspiracy theorist for trump the republican president presumptive
[03:13:14.220 --> 03:13:19.580]  nominees support for an elevation of the lunatic fringe of american life the obsessive sort of
[03:13:19.580 --> 03:13:24.620]  singular focus of all these different apparatuses from alex jones to the trump campaign and the
[03:13:24.620 --> 03:13:29.580]  sort of uh the the the trump folks about spinning that conspiracy theory particularly well alex
[03:13:29.580 --> 03:13:33.740]  jones is just going to declare the entire election a false flag anyway so yeah he's
[03:13:33.740 --> 03:13:37.660]  he's covered no matter who wins and he's he's going to do very well in the in the in the uh
[03:13:37.660 --> 03:13:41.100]  clinton presidency they're all everyone's going to be well if trump if trump gets elected he's
[03:13:41.100 --> 03:13:44.460]  going to be secretary of defense well that that's they're through he's got he's got nothing but
[03:13:44.460 --> 03:13:49.660]  upside i've been told that if trump gets elected i get to be in charge of the chem trail research
[03:13:49.660 --> 03:13:54.540]  i'm really excited about that in finding bigfoot you can't dismiss him as just a crackball because
[03:13:54.540 --> 03:14:00.300]  millions of americans tune into him now on a daily basis and believe what he's saying and that's why
[03:14:00.300 --> 03:14:06.060]  donald trump came on this show was to be radical was to get in the face of the system i'm up here
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:10.780]  defending from everything i've got it's because i know he's for real he's put his life on the line
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:16.300]  and this is a great opportunity for this country to put serious death blows to the new world war
[03:14:16.300 --> 03:14:20.620]  donald trump i hope you can help uncripple america thank you so much sir that you will be
[03:14:20.620 --> 03:14:25.100]  attacked for coming on and we know you know that thank you thank you very much alex jones
[03:14:25.100 --> 03:14:30.620]  he was a nice guy actually you like him oh that's good alex was an alex jones nice guy
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:38.380]  oh they can't stand it imagine the government agencies listening to my phone
[03:14:38.380 --> 03:14:45.900]  the gem on the elliptical and i plugged him ahead my earphones just in time to hit donald trump say
[03:14:45.900 --> 03:14:51.660]  alex jones nice guy and i had such a shock and nearly fell off my elliptical well since you're
[03:14:51.660 --> 03:14:54.860]  here and i'm going to share this to you for your piece you're writing i might as well just share
[03:14:54.860 --> 03:14:58.780]  it with everybody because it's the trump doesn't tell me to say a secret we've talked on the phone
[03:14:58.780 --> 03:15:05.500]  and other things but i just you know what i don't think it's best if i sit there and get into all
[03:15:05.500 --> 03:15:09.660]  that it's very evident he's a patriot it's evident he's talking about real issues it's evident he
[03:15:09.660 --> 03:15:15.820]  listens to smart people he he he he admires people that have independently changed things and set up
[03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:21.180]  new systems and have been game changers and i'm not bragging about myself they say invention
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:26.780]  well they say necessity is the mother of invention i've you've been there since pretty
[03:15:26.780 --> 03:15:31.500]  much i started i was just trying to reach people about the globalist we did innovate some media
[03:15:31.500 --> 03:15:37.260]  systems we did do a lot of things first but we had a lot of help from fellow patriots like drudge
[03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:42.460]  drudgereport.com and others but i remember i don't pay attention to entertainment i don't pay
[03:15:42.460 --> 03:15:47.260]  attention to hotels golf casinos stuff like that i don't pay attention to pop media or or beauty
[03:15:47.260 --> 03:15:53.260]  pageants so i knew donald trump was a successful real estate guy i'm not really flashy but i get
[03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:59.020]  he's advertising so i was kind of put off by flash i didn't dislike trump but he wasn't on my radar
[03:15:59.020 --> 03:16:05.260]  and then over the years people would say famous people i'd run into they go you know about donald
[03:16:05.260 --> 03:16:09.020]  trump right they're like i'd be like what they go well you're the underground he's gonna be
[03:16:10.540 --> 03:16:13.980]  on the top he's gonna be coming out they run for president he's he's with us
[03:16:14.700 --> 03:16:17.980]  and i'd be sitting there talking to a famous person the first one does that and then by the
[03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:22.140]  sixth or seventh over a few years it started like five years ago and the right before he
[03:16:22.140 --> 03:16:25.820]  announced about a year and a half ago i'm sitting there with a famous person who's in media and they
[03:16:25.820 --> 03:16:30.220]  go yeah you know i did a tv show with donald trump yeah you know uh you know he likes your show and
[03:16:30.220 --> 03:16:36.220]  you know he uh he's really concerned about things and you like donald trump i'm like casino guy i don't
[03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:40.140]  know he doesn't he hang out with a cleansing he's like no he just says that for business but let me
[03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:46.140]  tell you trump was already he's so slick this guy must have the energy of 50 people like had
[03:16:46.140 --> 03:16:50.700]  pinnacles out checking to see if i liked him or whatever before he even ran and he wouldn't spend
[03:16:50.700 --> 03:16:54.860]  a month in scotland just thinking about if he wanted to do it and the bottom line i was told
[03:16:54.860 --> 03:16:58.780]  this about people that know him before it was in political political did write an accurate article
[03:16:58.780 --> 03:17:03.900]  uh i think it's like how he did it or why he did it because i've been told that stuff years before
[03:17:03.900 --> 03:17:08.540]  it even happened but a few months before he announced maybe six months before he spent a month
[03:17:08.540 --> 03:17:12.540]  not even really working something he never does just focusing on should i run for president
[03:17:12.540 --> 03:17:16.780]  and he decided not to do it that that's not in political but the rest of it is he just said i
[03:17:16.780 --> 03:17:24.300]  just i just can't and he said you know what i believe people are actually smart and they're
[03:17:24.300 --> 03:17:27.740]  going to get what i'm doing and they're sick of the mainstream and they want to be prosperous and
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:32.860]  they globalism picks the winners and picks the losers i believe people want to go against this
[03:17:33.820 --> 03:17:36.780]  and i'm going to run as a populist and do all this and really try to change it
[03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:41.660]  even though i'm going to put everything i've got on my line it's a huge risk his company his name
[03:17:41.660 --> 03:17:45.660]  he's lost hundreds of millions doing this spent you know 80 million of some money
[03:17:47.420 --> 03:17:52.460]  and he decided to do it and it's all in it's now bound to this you don't talk the ring
[03:17:52.460 --> 03:17:56.380]  soran's bound to the ring makes i'm saying soran but like a good soran he's bound to the ring
[03:17:56.380 --> 03:18:03.260]  he's all in it's all real it's all happening it's all going on and this is epic this is historic
[03:18:03.260 --> 03:18:07.420]  that's happening this guy is fully committed that's why the power structure and foreign leaders
[03:18:07.420 --> 03:18:13.180]  and the chinese president and and the pope and the every and the soddies all these horrible bad
[03:18:13.180 --> 03:18:21.500]  actors who sit on top really evil organizations are against him because they know and he's done it and
[03:18:21.500 --> 03:18:26.140]  and they're creating this lie that he's behind all the polls adding 15 more hillary clinton
[03:18:26.140 --> 03:18:30.860]  you know people to him and stuff i and i think even if he loses the election through fraud or
[03:18:30.860 --> 03:18:37.500]  reality he has won by blowing giant holes in the media facade and that it signifies the
[03:18:37.500 --> 03:18:45.100]  collapse of this current paradigm i mean donald trump killed the new world order if he loses
[03:18:46.460 --> 03:18:50.700]  do you know what he's gonna do like is he for instance gonna start a tv network or something
[03:18:50.700 --> 03:18:55.020]  well yeah see this is what they do they spend truth he said five years ago i might be you know
[03:18:55.020 --> 03:19:00.140]  do a network more libertarian and hardcore than fox it's kind of like fox without the gay bashing
[03:19:00.780 --> 03:19:04.620]  that's why he wants to he hates all the gays because he was an advocate for him 30 years ago
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:08.860]  see everything's upside down it's just none of it's true it's all distortions they're saying
[03:19:08.860 --> 03:19:13.180]  he flip-flopped on immigration he always said they make it too hard to come here legally
[03:19:13.180 --> 03:19:18.220]  we need good people we we are going to kick the felons out anybody else that's doing this
[03:19:18.220 --> 03:19:21.580]  illegally or we're going to set it up where you don't get taken out you go to the office
[03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:26.140]  you get set up you get checked boom you're in just like in the driver's license if if you're
[03:19:26.140 --> 03:19:30.700]  not a criminal if you play by the rules if you if you go on a path of citizenship he gets there
[03:19:30.700 --> 03:19:36.060]  making an illegal on purpose he says all that let's get this network break he says all that in
[03:19:36.060 --> 03:19:41.260]  thank you he says all that in these two hour speeches but they cut it down to we got a lot
[03:19:41.260 --> 03:19:45.740]  of criminals coming in from here they're dumping on us they're getting everything free he's talking
[03:19:45.740 --> 03:19:50.140]  about the freeloaders that come in i got a question i was going to ask you this question
[03:19:50.140 --> 03:19:55.020]  like off you know after we sure but i'll ask it now uh so you said that donald trump doesn't
[03:19:55.020 --> 03:19:59.100]  mind you talking about you know any any kind of you know what relationship you have with him he's
[03:19:59.100 --> 03:20:03.820]  um no donald trump i mean i've said to donald trump before hey well is this an off the record
[03:20:03.820 --> 03:20:08.700]  conversation he's like whatever but i'm just the point is anything i say gets spun and twisted
[03:20:09.340 --> 03:20:13.740]  but i don't think he even cares but but the clear thing is trump was already aware that there's
[03:20:13.740 --> 03:20:19.100]  election fraud he talked about it 2012 he didn't get it from me if i'm warning him about stuff and
[03:20:19.100 --> 03:20:23.260]  saying you want to go public and he does a day later it's because he already believes that i
[03:20:23.260 --> 03:20:27.500]  was just there spurring him and giving support to it and now the un is coming to oversee our
[03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:33.180]  elections the eu is the justice department's putting five times the monitors out the un 10
[03:20:33.180 --> 03:20:40.540]  times that's roiders but he's a kook for saying it first no he's right it's a distortion look
[03:20:40.540 --> 03:20:45.740]  at that's roiders see that john that's roiders yesterday a month after trump went on this crusade
[03:20:45.740 --> 03:20:51.100]  about election fraud agreeing with him okay so so there's obama said he's never heard of election
[03:20:51.100 --> 03:21:02.860]  fraud what's that i mean i mean so so i think it's that trump is a brass knuckles real americana
[03:21:02.860 --> 03:21:08.940]  real liberal and that's why he likes what i talk about and what i say and obviously has for a long
[03:21:08.940 --> 03:21:14.140]  time but i mean it doesn't matter who doesn't listen to info wars it's not a power trip it's
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:20.060]  responsibility i'm just a normal guy fighting these people i just don't care what the establishment
[03:21:20.060 --> 03:21:27.020]  does to me most people live in fear i'm not going to do it john no um so did he i'm sorry i'm just
[03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:31.580]  asking you kind of questions i was going to ask you afterwards anyway but um i talked to somebody
[03:21:31.580 --> 03:21:37.660]  who's in a similar sort of position to you that runs a big independent tv network like like you do
[03:21:37.660 --> 03:21:43.340]  uh and he said that trump kind of reached out to him through testing the waters like and he said to
[03:21:43.340 --> 03:21:48.300]  me just before um he had his tentacles out to see whether what you thought of him and so on so did
[03:21:48.300 --> 03:21:57.500]  he kind of call you before he decided to stand no and again it isn't about even getting trump
[03:21:57.500 --> 03:22:02.220]  interviews which we can get and and we're probably going to do one this week or next week the point
[03:22:02.220 --> 03:22:07.740]  is is that that's just a symbol of trump doing what trump wants to do obviously with other people
[03:22:07.740 --> 03:22:14.220]  whose campaign i'm liking it but getting a trump interview is not the big thing covering news and
[03:22:14.220 --> 03:22:18.300]  everyone hearing me for 20 years talk about human animal hybrids and that are already going on and
[03:22:18.300 --> 03:22:23.020]  now they admit it that's bigger than trump coming on see as the pope comes out and calls for world
[03:22:23.020 --> 03:22:28.700]  government that's bigger than trump coming on this is our movement info wars was that trump rally
[03:22:28.700 --> 03:22:34.860]  we are the populism we're just the mains say there's a NASCAR with a bunch of sponsors on it
[03:22:34.860 --> 03:22:40.300]  we're on the hood we're on the roof we're on the tail we're on the doors there's a few other logos
[03:22:40.300 --> 03:22:47.100]  on there but we are the NASCAR yeah so so i mean i mean you understand that like well this has been
[03:22:47.100 --> 03:22:52.700]  my mission and and it's it's not it's so so it's not about me and and the detonator cap like a
[03:22:52.700 --> 03:22:58.940]  detonator cap on a howitzer shell we're info wars this little officer in austin is a detonator and
[03:22:58.940 --> 03:23:04.940]  then all we do is detonate the larger charge we've already detonated it it just takes time for it
[03:23:04.940 --> 03:23:09.500]  to incrementally go out and then devastate the globalist i think people don't realize i was at
[03:23:09.500 --> 03:23:13.260]  the right i could blow a big crater crater here just get rid of it it wouldn't matter it's already
[03:23:13.260 --> 03:23:18.300]  done yeah like like v climbs up in the thing and is happy to die just lays there and the train rolls
[03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:22.780]  on you understand yeah it's like when you sit there's talking to the police state chief and he goes
[03:23:22.780 --> 03:23:25.740]  yeah but you and i have a lot in common i'm not afraid to die and he goes one thing we have in
[03:23:25.740 --> 03:23:31.420]  common is in five minutes we're both gonna be dead i don't mean physically dead i'm saying
[03:23:31.420 --> 03:23:36.780]  it's already detonated the train already left the station right the weapons system was already
[03:23:36.780 --> 03:23:43.020]  successful sorry go ahead just i was at the rally last night and for people who don't realize i've
[03:23:43.020 --> 03:23:48.620]  been in full wars was was everywhere you weren't only there in terms of a kind of physical presence
[03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:53.660]  filming it and handing out bumper stickers and so on but you were there right embedded in the
[03:23:53.660 --> 03:23:58.860]  whole kind of atmosphere of the of the event where people shouting out hillary for prison and
[03:23:58.860 --> 03:24:06.620]  and so on and and it really i mean it's amazing to me that alex who i knew 18 20 years ago is
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:13.740]  suddenly somebody who's who's inextricably linked with the republican nomination but i'm nothing
[03:24:13.740 --> 03:24:21.900]  i'm only one spark that helps start a larger brush fire my listeners where the actual kindling
[03:24:22.700 --> 03:24:28.300]  they did it and and again it's not about a power trip for info wars it's much bigger than that listen
[03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:36.460]  all the top generals that aren't traders are listeners the foreign world leaders you name it
[03:24:36.460 --> 03:24:42.620]  john trump's trump had got world leaders telling him five years ago do you listen alex jones
[03:24:42.620 --> 03:24:47.900]  that's where all this comes from with trump trump gets impressed by that okay that's where this stuff
[03:24:47.900 --> 03:24:53.740]  comes from it's not it's like trump and all this and america and all its staid weirdness and media
[03:24:53.740 --> 03:25:01.900]  control is like getting it last i didn't do all this i simply clearly saw historically what was
[03:25:01.900 --> 03:25:08.140]  happening read the enemy's own plans set it and because almost no one else did it in a modern
[03:25:08.140 --> 03:25:12.780]  format people wrote books and stuff that were incredibly accurate smarter than me right world
[03:25:12.780 --> 03:25:18.460]  leaders and serious men and women who were on the inside could resonate because they knew what i was
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:23.180]  saying was true because they're in there running and they feel all alone they don't want to go along
[03:25:23.180 --> 03:25:27.660]  with this plan you understand that's the real secret john is that is that info wars is really
[03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:32.780]  nothing and it's everything but how because it's the people right but how can you be sure i mean
[03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:39.020]  you're anti-elitist you've you've for 20 years you've been anti-elitist um they seem pretty
[03:25:39.020 --> 03:25:44.620]  elitist to me too though who trump will manage well i mean trump and all them knew that whether
[03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:49.980]  you sell people go to your hotel and golf course is to is to have you know gold windows uh to them
[03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:55.020]  that was just a marketing thing as trump always says in this system this system i hate it's true
[03:25:55.020 --> 03:25:58.780]  he says i make my ties in mexico because they cost a third of the price and he won't buy him
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:05.260]  when i make him in america i've done that too i go make clothes in america and they i have to i
[03:26:05.260 --> 03:26:12.860]  still do it i go beyond trump a shirt made in america is like ten dollars and then i sell it for
[03:26:12.860 --> 03:26:19.900]  20 or 22 i can do one in mexico for two dollars and sell it for you know 10 and everybody thinks
[03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:24.300]  they're getting a good deal and they buy a bunch so i say here's the made in america here's the
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:31.660]  made in mexico they choose the made in mexico so i get what trump's saying it's like he goes i want
[03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:37.180]  to do away with this system where it's a fair trade deal so that you can have it made in america
[03:26:37.180 --> 03:26:42.460]  and still be successful the guy is just really on it's like real as someone that runs my own company
[03:26:42.460 --> 03:26:46.140]  does my own stuff a father i have more live experience now at least when i like trump is
[03:26:46.140 --> 03:26:50.300]  70 and i admire him because now only now can i see what he's doing and be able to pick up
[03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:54.940]  the sophistication and the stamina the i mean i don't have a stamina 42 with that guy and i've
[03:26:54.940 --> 03:27:02.620]  got legendary stamina that guy is a freaking war machine i mean he's awesome he's god sent
[03:27:02.620 --> 03:27:09.420]  there's no doubt but you you saw he's not like the people at behemian grove oh no no that look at
[03:27:09.420 --> 03:27:14.460]  them no no absolutely not but you and i wouldn't care if he'd gone there i said i mean clenny's
[03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:18.300]  one goes i love clenny's wood clenny's was not part of that it's just some ritual thing and he's
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:21.660]  not as i said earlier i don't think they're all into it i know they're not i thought a lot of
[03:27:21.660 --> 03:27:24.940]  people reach out to me they go to behemian grove and they go you know i thought you were full of it
[03:27:24.940 --> 03:27:29.020]  in 2000 and then i kind of got deeper into some spinoff groups a little bit weird but you know we're
[03:27:29.020 --> 03:27:33.100]  not all bad but i get you know i get what you're saying it's just a cult feeder group help and
[03:27:33.820 --> 03:27:36.620]  it's like going to join a local motorcycle gang and then you learn there's actually a
[03:27:36.620 --> 03:27:40.860]  meth deal going on you know inside of it you know you you were just joining a motorcycle you know
[03:27:40.860 --> 03:27:46.380]  club you didn't know it was a real gang you know so i don't just judge everybody you know it's like
[03:27:46.380 --> 03:27:49.900]  if i'm got family in town and one of them is a buddhist and they go hey go to my buddhist temple
[03:27:49.900 --> 03:27:53.500]  with me and i go and then people see me out in front they're taking pictures they go ellis is
[03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:57.180]  a buddhist ellis is a buddhist you know well no i mean you're not a luciferian just because you
[03:27:57.180 --> 03:28:01.420]  go to behemian grove once yeah i'm not bashing buddhist it's just that you know it's an allegory
[03:28:01.420 --> 03:28:06.860]  speaking of bikers i met the head of bikers for trump at the rnc and we had a strange conversation
[03:28:06.860 --> 03:28:12.940]  can i recount the conversation sure go ahead we've got time yeah we got we go for 10 hours so i said
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:18.940]  to him out we were both queuing for drinks uh he ordered his i ordered my list god uh he ordered
[03:28:18.940 --> 03:28:25.580]  a cruise light i ordered a sweet iced tea with vodka which made me feel like much less american
[03:28:25.580 --> 03:28:30.060]  than he was i was dating yeah it was good though and uh i said can i interview you and he said sure
[03:28:30.060 --> 03:28:35.660]  and i said so have the mainstream um republicans like the old establishment republicans have they
[03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:42.220]  made you feel welcome and he said it's up to me to make them feel welcome i'm more welcome than
[03:28:42.220 --> 03:28:47.340]  they are and then he said to me enjoy your visit i said thank you and then later when i got home and
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:51.660]  i listened to the tape he didn't say enjoy your visit he said enjoy your visit because because of
[03:28:51.660 --> 03:28:57.980]  my uh non-american accent and i thought wow i i i annoyed him and i don't really know what i that's
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:29:02.780]  that's pretty much the entire here's the thing bikers are good people on average their throwbacks
[03:29:02.780 --> 03:29:06.780]  of like primitive men i don't mean primitive is in their week all they get is tribalness there's
[03:29:06.780 --> 03:29:12.940]  they're intellectual but the end of the day they feel like they're under attack and so they can only
[03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:18.540]  identify and trust what looks and acts just like them and it's beyond racism whether it's black people
[03:29:18.540 --> 03:29:24.460]  or bikers or military or whatever it's just that rites of passage they value it so much
[03:29:25.020 --> 03:29:29.420]  that it's taken their life over i'd wondered whether i'd accidentally kind of offended him by
[03:29:29.420 --> 03:29:35.420]  saying have they may have the establishment republicans made you feel welcome maybe maybe he
[03:29:35.420 --> 03:29:38.940]  took that as a slide and then he said i'm making them feel welcome yes up to me to make that i think
[03:29:38.940 --> 03:29:43.580]  it was a sophisticated statement from him i'm guessing saying no we're taking them over baby
[03:29:43.580 --> 03:29:47.580]  that's what i thought too yeah i think that's what he's saying and then he he thinks you're a smart
[03:29:47.580 --> 03:29:51.420]  intellectual he thinks you're smarter than him so i want to just backhand you a little we're on the
[03:29:51.420 --> 03:29:57.580]  march stay with us the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[03:34:56.620 --> 03:35:03.180]  play a few of those but david are you in the other studio do we have david in there or i guess i
[03:35:03.180 --> 03:35:08.220]  just said i'm totally taking over this hour i'm here alex oh he's there yeah uh i don't know if
[03:35:08.220 --> 03:35:11.980]  you've had a chance to listen to john ronston you're busy when i walk by back during your office
[03:35:11.980 --> 03:35:16.620]  you know watching videos and editing things but uh just a crazy world what do you make of the
[03:35:16.620 --> 03:35:20.620]  interview so far you got any questions comments big stories what do you want to throw into the
[03:35:20.620 --> 03:35:25.740]  whole crock pot here well it's very interesting and i'd like to get uh john ronston's uh kind of
[03:35:25.740 --> 03:35:31.180]  thoughts on what we see with the clinton foundation i think that's the number one story right now
[03:35:31.180 --> 03:35:37.020]  and i agree i should have been hammering out there yeah shell see using gnome de plumes fake names
[03:35:37.020 --> 03:35:43.820]  that brought down the former head of the epa well what we're seeing now is the end game of this private
[03:35:43.820 --> 03:35:49.420]  server she had a private server because we knew that she had this corrupt game that she's uh running
[03:35:49.420 --> 03:35:54.380]  in the background and so 33 000 emails are all the little crooked deals for billions exactly you
[03:35:54.380 --> 03:35:58.620]  know the new york post starts out their article they say the democrat party warns us about mixing
[03:35:58.620 --> 03:36:04.140]  big money in politics they say it'll corrupt democracy they nominated hillary clinton to prove
[03:36:04.140 --> 03:36:09.900]  it okay they're always talking about campaign finance reform so i want to ask john ronston
[03:36:09.900 --> 03:36:15.020]  what he thinks about this because this is absolutely right i covered this the first hour
[03:36:15.020 --> 03:36:19.580]  it's so epic history and really is epic that word's overused but it's like saying that's
[03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:23.820]  nazi well sometimes stuff is nazi it's overused but sometimes it really is used properly this is
[03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:28.220]  so over the top incredible that all this corruption is coming out worse than anything we've ever seen
[03:36:28.220 --> 03:36:33.500]  george soros running the muslim brotherhood invading us in his islamic takeover admitting
[03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:38.460]  its Jerusalem post having to admit okay he's basically a megalomaniac demon the conspiracy
[03:36:38.460 --> 03:36:45.100]  theorists are right uh hillary just billions money scams total al capone garbage and it's now
[03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:50.300]  out there and our own media is hardly covering it if it wasn't for drudge and right barton info wars
[03:36:50.940 --> 03:36:56.380]  and world net daily and daily caller and i'm not tooting horns here it's scary if it wasn't for us
[03:36:56.380 --> 03:37:00.300]  you'd hardly even see this stuff forced out but if we hammer something for two three weeks
[03:37:00.860 --> 03:37:05.660]  then it forces the foreign press to pick it up and finally our press so what about the hillary
[03:37:05.660 --> 03:37:10.300]  situation with the foundation pay to play now prove it and then secondarily as a journalist
[03:37:10.300 --> 03:37:15.580]  what about the media's coverage and handling of a john ronson i was hoping that you would forget
[03:37:15.580 --> 03:37:20.380]  that i was here in the two of you would carry on talking because i've actually done no research at
[03:37:20.380 --> 03:37:25.020]  all on the clinton foundation okay i know you have actually but i really haven't i really i
[03:37:25.020 --> 03:37:28.780]  well what was your question before the break then i'll go back to david night okay i can't even
[03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:31.820]  we just do this this is a problem for free oh no we were just we were talking about the
[03:37:31.820 --> 03:37:37.180]  bike is for trump and i was trying to kind of dissect what that hostile conversation was and
[03:37:37.980 --> 03:37:42.860]  and i and i agree with you but i think he was explaining hey baby we're taking this thing over
[03:37:42.860 --> 03:37:49.580]  we're taking this thing over and you come from a world where you think the establishment gets to
[03:37:49.580 --> 03:37:54.860]  decide whether blue collar people get to feel comfortable or not and i'm here to tell you that
[03:37:54.860 --> 03:37:59.820]  the world has changed so i thought that was really interesting yeah he's saying we hey we're making
[03:37:59.820 --> 03:38:05.100]  them comfortable yeah yeah exactly exactly and i thought that was very interesting and it shows this
[03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:08.940]  kind of you know huge i think i was really smart he's saying we don't give a damn about what you
[03:38:08.940 --> 03:38:14.620]  think yeah i agree i think it was really smart it was smart and interesting and layered and nuanced
[03:38:14.620 --> 03:38:18.460]  and is it that people that tune into trump it's not that he's perfect you're saying this is an
[03:38:18.460 --> 03:38:23.740]  i'm sorry to use the french f u card it's like we're done yeah we know you don't want it here it is
[03:38:23.740 --> 03:38:31.420]  yeah i mean he kind of misperceived me as a member of the kind of liberal establishment who was kind
[03:38:31.420 --> 03:38:37.740]  of gently you know for you're an independent liberal yeah i really am i i don't consider myself
[03:38:37.740 --> 03:38:42.620]  an advocate for the left whatsoever and one thing i've become very interested in well you told me
[03:38:42.620 --> 03:38:47.980]  the phone they become very bullying and you see that yeah sure i mean they my public shaming book
[03:38:47.980 --> 03:38:53.740]  is all about how my people bully and well real liberals are supposed to be about against bullying
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:56.860]  and it's impossible and you got a lot of heat for that book i read the name oh yeah i got a lot of
[03:38:56.860 --> 03:39:03.820]  heat for it um we love to talk about abuses of power uh unless we're the ones abusing our power
[03:39:03.820 --> 03:39:08.700]  and then we hate to talk about it so that's really what that book was about and i'm and i'm certain
[03:39:08.700 --> 03:39:13.260]  that it's and other people have said this too but obviously but you know if you want to understand
[03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:18.380]  the rise of trump and if you want to understand brexit one thing you really have to understand
[03:39:18.380 --> 03:39:25.500]  is the way that my media the establishment media is so selective when it comes to writing about
[03:39:25.500 --> 03:39:31.900]  injustice and and we won't write about the injustices that are meted against people who
[03:39:31.900 --> 03:39:37.340]  were turned into trump well let me throw this out about trump he does like one criticism i have
[03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:41.020]  i don't know david has as well is he likes to just be completely honest that's a positive thing
[03:39:41.020 --> 03:39:46.140]  but not the fact that he thinks tortures okay if you're a bad isis guy well how do we know your
[03:39:46.140 --> 03:39:50.620]  isis that really leads to a dangerous road now tortures ongoing at least he's honest so in a
[03:39:50.620 --> 03:39:55.580]  way that's refreshing but it has a bittersweet taste obviously but what if we get in and the
[03:39:55.580 --> 03:40:00.300]  communists are burning stuff and people are attacking then there's this arrogance of hey
[03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:05.740]  we're doing the right let's crush these people we have to keep due process we can't have bullying
[03:40:05.740 --> 03:40:12.220]  we can't have this thing that we're on a crusader a jihad and start going after uh bizarre elements
[03:40:12.220 --> 03:40:18.060]  to left we have to take the real high road and trump if any of his supporters or false flaggers
[03:40:18.060 --> 03:40:23.500]  do bad things he's got to decry it immediately he's got to be really conciliatory if he gets into
[03:40:23.500 --> 03:40:28.780]  office david night what do you think i think so alex you know you're talking about uh the blue
[03:40:28.780 --> 03:40:36.300]  collar uh saying that we've taken over the the party and john was just saying that he sees this
[03:40:36.300 --> 03:40:41.660]  bullying going on from the left i see it also going on from the right alex remember the the
[03:40:41.660 --> 03:40:46.780]  editorial and national review that was talking about blue collar america where all the jobs
[03:40:46.780 --> 03:40:51.580]  had left and they and they said your community isn't worth saving that's the kind of i should
[03:40:51.580 --> 03:40:55.180]  do more on that you're absolutely right you covered that i covered it barely you hammered it for
[03:40:55.180 --> 03:40:58.780]  weeks and your instincts are so on target david that you ought to come every day and tell me just as
[03:40:58.780 --> 03:41:02.780]  my boss for that one piece a day i'm your boss and i'm serious i think i'm gonna get this new thing
[03:41:02.780 --> 03:41:07.900]  where everybody's somebody's boss for one project a day or a week or whatever some quick video i'm
[03:41:07.900 --> 03:41:12.220]  serious you're my boss once a day david you were to come to me with a story that i'm to cover on air
[03:41:12.220 --> 03:41:15.980]  or do a five minute special piece on because i remember watching you talk about that and say i
[03:41:15.980 --> 03:41:20.220]  should be doing this more they actually shed in a bunch of pieces you don't matter it was worse than
[03:41:20.220 --> 03:41:24.860]  obama saying you bitter clinger christians turn in your bibles it was the most it was like george
[03:41:24.860 --> 03:41:29.340]  will i did harp on that because i saw you talk about it because he always george will goes
[03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:34.220]  we are the sovereigns of the party your votes don't matter he actually said that and i did
[03:41:34.220 --> 03:41:39.180]  say to george will look i'm not a violent person but if you think you're so elitist stick a gun
[03:41:39.180 --> 03:41:44.460]  in your head and blow your freaking head off man you are a scumbag saying my vote doesn't matter
[03:41:44.460 --> 03:41:50.460]  and you put it in a newspaper the washington post yes i mean i would not wipe my butt with that
[03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:55.180]  and i'm sorry to talk like that but these people show us how disconnected they are
[03:41:55.180 --> 03:41:58.940]  and see now you got me frown from the mouth of this establishment right wing these are the most
[03:41:59.580 --> 03:42:06.140]  conceited arrogant know-it-all fops if they were smart they wouldn't make statements like that
[03:42:06.140 --> 03:42:11.180]  what the hell i'm sorry you just you just triggered me david you're absolutely right i remember the
[03:42:11.180 --> 03:42:17.020]  reading it in the news in the magazine saying you don't count you're bankrupt you're scum white people
[03:42:17.020 --> 03:42:21.500]  yeah and it's this thing of like invoking race they show how they're really the elite
[03:42:21.500 --> 03:42:25.580]  getting the commoners to fight with each other and how they all just hate us no matter what color
[03:42:25.580 --> 03:42:31.260]  we are and i'm sick of it i am a populist i'm a grassroots blue collar guy at the end of the
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:37.180]  day and i'm sick of all these people telling me i don't matter when i guarantee you george will
[03:42:37.180 --> 03:42:44.620]  is an adult retard i'm sorry you and john were at bohemian groves you saw that it wasn't uh
[03:42:44.620 --> 03:42:50.060]  democrat elitist it was democrat and republican elitist oh yeah but it's the entire establishment
[03:42:50.060 --> 03:42:55.100]  and it's that establishment it's the hedge fund people it's the wall street banks and they get off
[03:42:55.100 --> 03:42:59.180]  with the progressive lesson they're coming after donald charlie hold the conversation yeah they're
[03:42:59.180 --> 03:43:03.820]  all bunch of neurotic ocd jackasses and i'm not saying you're bad if you have ocd we all do to
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:08.620]  a certain extent i'm just i'm sorry go ahead john i'm randy oh yeah no no bohemian grove i'd say it's
[03:43:08.620 --> 03:43:13.900]  actually more republican than democrats build a book it's 70 percent 70 republican yeah yeah
[03:43:13.900 --> 03:43:18.460]  yeah and that's what we see the we see the establishment though across the board whether
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:23.980]  it's the media or the government or its business or it's the progressives all coming after donald
[03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:29.340]  trump that should tell us something there's an article on new america trump versus the establishment
[03:43:29.340 --> 03:43:35.980]  this hasn't been a clear alignment like this we saw very goldwater well look i mean i'm i am no
[03:43:35.980 --> 03:43:41.260]  fun at trump and anyway i can't worship him i'm being sarcastic i'm no fun at trump but at the
[03:43:41.260 --> 03:43:48.380]  same time i am also no fan i'm certainly no fan of trump and um and he does say divisive i mean he
[03:43:48.380 --> 03:43:52.780]  said some incredibly divisive he had to say those to unify nationality because we didn't even have
[03:43:52.780 --> 03:43:57.100]  that anymore right but i'm also no fan of the fact that you know something happens to be at the
[03:43:57.100 --> 03:44:02.220]  iran say i need to be balanced because you know i am i am absolutely no fan of trump and i and i
[03:44:02.220 --> 03:44:09.180]  hope he doesn't win are you jealous of us here however um when i was at the iran sea one day
[03:44:09.180 --> 03:44:12.940]  i'm gonna have a mean man of you and trump her well i'll tell you a very quick story about
[03:44:12.940 --> 03:44:17.100]  something that happened at the iran sea uh so somebody said to me oh my god did you see the
[03:44:17.100 --> 03:44:22.460]  avocado woman and i was like no because she was on really late at night and i've gone back to bed
[03:44:22.460 --> 03:44:26.620]  by then the what woman the avocado woman avocado yeah so i don't know what they were talking about
[03:44:26.620 --> 03:44:30.700]  so then later and she would go oh it was eleven oh i'm not making fun of you i like how you say
[03:44:30.700 --> 03:44:38.220]  avocado i know god i'm sounded like say avocado face wash available now for them at the time
[03:44:38.220 --> 03:44:43.100]  then for what's lives on the calm john ronson's the designer and a bit of his essence is put into
[03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:49.660]  each model of avocado luxury line creamery for the second i became my grotesque can you say cream
[03:44:49.660 --> 03:44:54.540]  what came your grotesque impersonation of me you say cream what i'm not going to try it go ahead

[03:45:02.540 --> 03:45:07.020]  woman people go it was hilarious you must see the avocado woman on youtube it was hilarious what did
[03:45:07.020 --> 03:45:12.780]  she do well i thought god this is going to be hilarious so i went on to youtube she her name's
[03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:17.980]  kimberlyn brown um she's an actor she was in like the young and the beautiful or the old and the
[03:45:17.980 --> 03:45:22.860]  restless or whatever these shows are called the young and the restless um and now she's an avocado
[03:45:22.860 --> 03:45:27.500]  farmer so i was waiting for the hilarity to turn up there was no hilarity there was some
[03:45:29.500 --> 03:45:35.820]  basically she was giving a talk about how um because of trade deals which i know nothing about i
[03:45:35.820 --> 03:45:41.100]  don't understand but because of trade deals a lot of her avocado farming neighbors have had to destroy
[03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:46.380]  their crops and she was almost in tears on the stage and people thought it was funny she was
[03:45:46.380 --> 03:45:51.100]  crying about avocados well this is her life oh i get it exactly no it's it's the cold well let's
[03:45:51.100 --> 03:45:55.980]  find the trade deals yeah okay if chinese electricity is like four times or three times
[03:45:55.980 --> 03:46:00.140]  depending where you're at cheaper than ours because of our regulations where are factories going john
[03:46:00.140 --> 03:46:07.420]  yeah so if our government is even trying to get rid of what coal we have left that's by the way
[03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:12.540]  totally clean now the scrubbers china is totally dirty we're gone you understand no one's going
[03:46:12.540 --> 03:46:17.820]  to have any jobs here in industry and in the average poor person goes i don't own coal i don't
[03:46:17.820 --> 03:46:23.180]  care i don't own any coal stocks quite frankly my family has gas right so we should be against oil
[03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:27.660]  and coal but i don't think like that i don't people in my family nice folks but they've said
[03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:33.100]  well i got 20 gas wells what are you so worried about shutting down coal i'm going to make more
[03:46:33.100 --> 03:46:37.740]  money but it's going to screw all your neighbors have an expensive electricity dumbass and we're
[03:46:37.740 --> 03:46:42.940]  not going to have a damn country people don't think like this we cannot compete with china
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:47.820]  if their power is four times cheaper than david night yeah alexander donald trump understands
[03:46:47.820 --> 03:46:53.180]  it's also a currency manipulation that's involved there they're not trying to reestablish protectionism
[03:46:53.180 --> 03:46:58.620]  what they're trying to do is keep our economy from being managed by a small click of global
[03:46:58.620 --> 03:47:04.220]  elitists who get real rich off the trade so-called trade partnerships in secret and wouldn't even
[03:47:04.220 --> 03:47:09.740]  allow our democratically elected representatives to read it to talk about it that's the issue and
[03:47:09.740 --> 03:47:14.300]  then it's okay because obama goes on jimmy kimmel and goes you're down with tpp and obama goes
[03:47:14.300 --> 03:47:20.140]  you know me well listen anyway my point about telling the avocado lady's story it's horrible
[03:47:20.140 --> 03:47:25.580]  is that we're not gonna you know this world is not going to get any better until we no longer
[03:47:25.580 --> 03:47:31.420]  you know the people on the left no longer find struggling people on the right hilarious or or
[03:47:31.420 --> 03:47:36.780]  just that is sick about about and vice versa too it's it's no no i get it and i've never been somebody
[03:47:36.780 --> 03:47:40.700]  that makes fun of people as much as i have lately but i gotta say the social justice warriors
[03:47:40.700 --> 03:47:45.660]  because they're bullies i catch myself then becoming a bully when i'm fighting a bully
[03:47:45.660 --> 03:47:49.260]  and then i catch myself enjoying a little too much it's one of the few things i have guilt
[03:47:49.260 --> 03:47:55.100]  yeah i've never been a bully but i do catch myself becoming guilty now when i crush someone
[03:47:55.100 --> 03:48:00.220]  i feel like o'brien in 1984 i'm trampling someone getting off on it it's a very dangerous
[03:48:00.220 --> 03:48:05.260]  nerve very dangerous and of course it's you know it's it's tempting but you know but we're going
[03:48:05.260 --> 03:48:12.140]  to hell in a hand bus it is enjoyable but we need but you apps but it's serious but doesn't carl the

[03:48:27.020 --> 03:48:31.980]  you know you get an increasingly polarized divisive world and and i think things aren't going to get
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:38.300]  better until we start talking to each other and i'm going to say this then i am ready to start

[03:49:14.780 --> 03:49:21.020]  at a certain point if there's a big powerful beautiful uh oppressor then it's okay to take

[03:51:19.980 --> 03:51:25.900]  about just how strange it was for me to be in the arena the quick and lone arena at the rnc
[03:51:25.900 --> 03:51:31.820]  and somebody is on stage at the rnc quoting you and i just thought that's extraordinary and because

[03:55:31.340 --> 03:55:37.420]  hey let's bring in david night david other points my friend well you know alex as we're
[03:55:37.420 --> 03:55:41.980]  talking about how the establishment is aligned against trump i think it's interesting that even
[03:55:41.980 --> 03:55:47.260]  the media outlets that have been shamelessly advocating for her just dropped the pretense of
[03:55:47.260 --> 03:55:52.460]  objectivity like the washington post uh they and us a today are calling on her to shut down the
[03:55:52.460 --> 03:55:56.780]  clinton foundation and do it now that's right that's right don't you sense blood in the water
[03:55:56.780 --> 03:56:00.220]  beyond blood in the water i mean i'm not just saying this with glee it's not some personal hatred
[03:56:00.220 --> 03:56:06.780]  for hillary these people i just sense that it's over i mean i i even if she coast into office
[03:56:06.780 --> 03:56:13.180]  have they not delivered a rotting political carcass into vahala well you know what what it shows us
[03:56:13.180 --> 03:56:17.420]  is that as a leftist constantly talked about the need for campaign finance reform
[03:56:17.420 --> 03:56:22.860]  about how money corrupts politics and i understand that that's true the problem is is the power though
[03:56:22.860 --> 03:56:26.780]  once you've got the power in washington it's going to suck the money in like a black hole and once
[03:56:26.780 --> 03:56:31.660]  you've got somebody like hillary clinton she has the kind of true privilege i want to talk about
[03:56:31.660 --> 03:56:38.060]  white privilege she has the ultimate privilege okay a leader above the law diplomatic community
[03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:42.940]  marianne tornette and if she's allowed to stand and get away with this it sets a precedent that
[03:56:42.940 --> 03:56:50.060]  mark my words like a black hole you just said will destroy this country and other nations very soon
[03:56:50.060 --> 03:56:56.220]  hillary clinton must fall and ronston i sense it you're hedging your best you smell it the rotting
[03:56:56.220 --> 03:57:01.660]  flesh of the democrats in the wind join me take my hand i will complete your free but it doesn't make
[03:57:01.660 --> 03:57:10.460]  me a trip supposed to go good good good good good all right night great job go at night sorry uh
[03:57:10.460 --> 03:57:15.660]  well alex it's going to be it's i think it's a she is a poster child for what is we want to talk
[03:57:15.660 --> 03:57:21.820]  about her health i mean she is the cancer on our country our body politic okay and she is an example
[03:57:21.820 --> 03:57:27.340]  of about the fact that you cannot achieve honesty here with some kind of campaign finance reform
[03:57:27.340 --> 03:57:32.220]  laws she's going to break the laws there's no law that is going to tie her down the laws are there
[03:57:32.220 --> 03:57:36.620]  for the little people and the big guys are just going to break these little spiderwebs that they
[03:57:36.620 --> 03:57:42.620]  that they erect in the corners to try to stop the rest of us spiderwebs erect to the corner
[03:57:43.660 --> 03:57:46.860]  let me take can you feel the energy i feel liberty rising
[03:57:46.860 --> 03:57:55.500]  honest honest answer you think it's more like a fart rising uh my honest answer is i don't i i
[03:57:55.500 --> 03:58:00.140]  feel in the middle of july all of that was happening you know brexit had just happened
[03:58:00.700 --> 03:58:06.220]  and trump was really rising and and the the polls were narrowing and at the iron sea and so on
[03:58:06.220 --> 03:58:13.820]  and then i think he's made some big mistakes then i agree but past trump the overall bubbling of
[03:58:13.820 --> 03:58:20.540]  liberty awakening forget liberal conservative it's just yeah i i the zeitgeist yeah i see that i think
[03:58:20.540 --> 03:58:26.380]  i think the fact that info wars for instance is such a big operation now it's just one example
[03:58:26.380 --> 03:58:29.980]  yeah it's just one all right well all i can say is john ronson thank you so much for spending time
