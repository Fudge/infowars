[00:00.000 --> 00:18.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.760 --> 00:24.320]  This is what it looks like when in the rare event the United States votes in a populist
[00:24.320 --> 00:30.640]  president and that president begins the uphill battle of mending the fabric of the U.S. Constitution
[00:30.640 --> 00:36.080]  torn apart by puppets installed by an embedded foreign globalist system.
[00:36.080 --> 00:39.320]  Would you ever have Donald Trump on your show?
[00:39.320 --> 00:41.320]  What if he asked you?
[00:41.320 --> 00:42.320]  No.
[00:42.320 --> 00:43.320]  What about Melania?
[00:43.320 --> 00:44.320]  Would you ever have her on your show?
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.320]  Melania.
[00:45.320 --> 00:46.880]  To talk about what, she can barely speak English.
[00:46.880 --> 00:53.720]  Of course, the brainwashing social engineering media minions have their claws so deeply dug
[00:53.720 --> 00:59.960]  into the psychological soil of the nation that the legalized propaganda quietly enacted
[00:59.960 --> 01:04.680]  in 2013 under President Obama will not stop.
[01:04.680 --> 01:11.640]  No matter how diligently, the Trump administration refutes the lamestream media's alternative
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  facts.
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.320]  You know, I have a running war with the media.
[01:15.320 --> 01:21.600]  They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, and they sort of made it sound like
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.720]  I had a feud with the intelligence community, and I just want to let you know, the reason
[01:27.720 --> 01:33.800]  you're number one stop, it is exactly the opposite, exactly, and they understand that
[01:33.800 --> 01:34.800]  too.
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.800]  Thinking about Donald, they think you are.
[01:36.800 --> 01:41.440]  To show the gates when they open at 8.30, and people just start pouring in, because
[01:41.440 --> 01:44.240]  they don't want to show nobody, because people know that would be a lot, but you see them
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.960]  all pouring in, they don't show you hours later when it's the biggest crowd ever.
[01:47.960 --> 01:51.920]  CNN actually put out this gigapixel photograph of the inauguration.
[01:51.920 --> 01:54.080]  They debunked themselves on that crowd size.
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.200]  You can go to it and see how huge the crowd was.
[01:56.200 --> 02:00.000]  They say, yeah, he took out the Martin Luther King bus, and the whole media runs with it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.320]  And it's just ongoing.
[02:02.320 --> 02:05.280]  We had a tweet go out about Martin Luther King.
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.800]  Think about how racially charged that is, and someone rushes out and says to the entire
[02:10.800 --> 02:17.920]  press corps that the President of the United States has removed the bust from his office.
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.160]  I mean, think about what this signal, hold on, please don't put an apology on it.
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.600]  No, no, he actually applies to quote, my colleagues.
[02:25.600 --> 02:28.800]  That's the exact quote, okay?
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.840]  That quote, that report got tweeted out around.
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.400]  And to report, where was the apology to the President of the United States?
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.480]  Where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive
[02:41.480 --> 02:42.480]  that was?
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.960]  Was it the first time he confronts the public, it's a falsehood?
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.200]  Chuck, I mean, if we're going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms,
[02:52.200 --> 02:55.400]  I think that we're going to have to rethink our relationship here.
[02:55.400 --> 02:57.800]  But look what happened the day before talking about falsehoods.
[02:57.800 --> 03:03.080]  When we allow the press in, and what happens almost immediately, a falsehood is told about
[03:03.080 --> 03:06.400]  removing the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office.
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.560]  That note, that's just flat out false.
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.400]  If it wasn't obvious before, it has to be now.
[03:12.400 --> 03:19.040]  Any rational American can plainly see President Donald J. Trump has hit the ground running
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.640]  into his first hundred days and already has a 57% approval rating according to Rasmussen
[03:25.640 --> 03:32.240]  polls compared to the King of the Snowflakes and the fascist and racist lefts Barack Obama,
[03:32.240 --> 03:38.360]  who after eight years of unyieldingly wounding the republic had an average approval rating
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.360]  of 47.9% according to a Gallup poll.
[03:42.360 --> 03:47.880]  We have to accept that there is prejudice that exists within our own party and we have
[03:47.880 --> 03:51.280]  to be able to have that kind of situation.
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.440]  And my job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt.
[03:55.440 --> 04:02.160]  My job is to shut other white people down when they want to say, oh no, I'm not prejudice.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.160]  I'm a Democrat.
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.440]  I'm accepting.
[04:04.440 --> 04:10.920]  My job is to make sure that they get, that they have privilege and until we shut our
[04:10.920 --> 04:19.560]  mouths and we listen to those people who don't and we lift our people up so that we all have
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.120]  equity in this country.
[04:21.120 --> 04:28.000]  As CNS News reports, that puts him behind Richard Nixon, who resigned, and George W. Bush,
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.080]  who saw his approval rating drop as low as 25% near the end of his term.
[04:34.080 --> 04:40.000]  When the history books are written, the only change former President Barack Obama brought
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  was the growth of the awareness to the bulk of the American people that the system and
[04:46.000 --> 04:52.600]  the talking heads protecting that system are far more corrupt and desperate than we initially
[04:52.600 --> 05:00.080]  realized, John Bowne, FreeForce.com.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.840]  The Associated Press is reporting this week that former President Barack Obama was releasing
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.800]  money right and left hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office on Friday.
[05:09.800 --> 05:14.680]  On Friday morning, he released $221 million in U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority
[05:14.680 --> 05:17.880]  on the morning just hours before he was set to leave office.
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.560]  Now, one State Department official and several congressional aides say that the Obama Administration
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.400]  formally notified Congress it's going to be spending that money on Friday morning just
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.640]  hours before Donald Trump became president.
[05:28.640 --> 05:34.000]  Now, also, more than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at the same time,
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.800]  including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.2 million for UN organizations.
[05:38.800 --> 05:44.880]  Now, GOP lawmakers have placed holds on the Palestinian funds, but not on everything else.
[05:44.880 --> 05:48.360]  Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch, but they're not legally
[05:48.360 --> 05:53.240]  binding, so it looks like Obama's funding spree, all of it is going to be going through,
[05:53.240 --> 05:57.160]  and he did this literally hours before Donald Trump had taken the office.
[05:57.160 --> 05:59.680]  Well, I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:59.680 --> 06:04.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was shown here on the road with a very important announcement.
[06:04.440 --> 06:09.040]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.160]  at preorder at infowarsstore.com.
[06:12.160 --> 06:15.800]  It's the making of a president, and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[06:15.800 --> 06:19.960]  On the inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the future and what Trump
[06:19.960 --> 06:23.160]  and others are really planning to do to restore the Republic of prosperity.
[06:23.160 --> 06:26.960]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[06:26.960 --> 06:30.360]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians, and so much more, and it supports
[06:30.360 --> 06:34.360]  him, and it supports Infowars, our whole operation, so it's essential that this book
[06:34.360 --> 06:38.120]  go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.

[07:57.000 --> 08:23.560]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[08:23.560 --> 08:35.760]  You're going to be doing a lot of work.
[08:35.760 --> 08:43.640]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw
[08:43.640 --> 08:46.640]  a poor, half-frozen snake.
[08:46.640 --> 08:54.600]  His pretty-colored skin had been all frosted with a dew, oh well, she cried, I'll take
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.880]  you in, and I'll take care of you.
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.880]  Take me in, otender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[09:01.880 --> 09:09.080]  Take me in, otender woman, side the vicious snake.
[09:09.080 --> 09:13.960]  Take me in, otender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.
[09:13.960 --> 09:20.360]  Take me in, otender woman, side the vicious snake.
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.000]  Now she clutched him to her bosom, you're so beautiful, she cried.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.360]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.560]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[09:37.560 --> 09:45.360]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[09:45.360 --> 09:51.840]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me, heaven's wide.
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.600]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[09:56.600 --> 10:02.280]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[10:02.280 --> 10:11.160]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[10:11.160 --> 10:18.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[10:18.760 --> 10:22.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're wondering what's happening in this country, it is simply the
[10:22.120 --> 10:24.720]  return of America.
[10:24.720 --> 10:29.480]  The globalists had a bold plan to hijack every sovereign nation on Earth, and then basically
[10:29.480 --> 10:35.560]  steal their resources for a planned world government, a very oppressive planned world
[10:35.560 --> 10:36.560]  government.
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.160]  They were so arrogant, they wrote white papers, they gave speeches, they wrote books about
[10:40.160 --> 10:41.400]  it.
[10:41.400 --> 10:46.200]  And so myself and many others in the last few decades went and compiled those articles,
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.200]  those speeches, and those interviews from television, C-SPAN, you name it, and showed
[10:52.200 --> 10:57.280]  the world and made films and wrote our own books and built our own media.
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.360]  They just sat there arrogantly laughing at us over and over again when we had the facts,
[11:03.360 --> 11:06.200]  we had the culture.
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.200]  And now they're not laughing anymore, are they?
[11:09.200 --> 11:10.200]  No.
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.920]  They're screaming for blood, they're screaming for civil war, they're screaming for death.
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.240]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com that I've got here on screen today, because drugs just always
[11:21.240 --> 11:27.480]  has the perfect way to put it all, put it all down so simply, but also in a complex
[11:27.480 --> 11:28.480]  way.
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.800]  Dow Jones roars past 20,000.
[11:32.800 --> 11:36.760]  That's 1,300 billion ends since he was elected November 8th.
[11:36.760 --> 11:39.680]  Let's look down, though, in the left-hand corner.
[11:39.680 --> 11:46.720]  Peter Thiel, one foot out of the USA, wealthy Americans fear impending civil war, evacuating
[11:46.720 --> 11:47.720]  to New Zealand.
[11:47.720 --> 11:51.280]  I've been telling people that for eight years, now it's all admitted.
[11:51.280 --> 11:59.080]  Let me tell you where else they're going, they're going to Kauai, the most westerly
[11:59.080 --> 12:05.320]  and most northerly Hawaiian island, one of the most remote, so they filmed Jurassic Park
[12:05.320 --> 12:16.600]  and King Kong, and Zuckerberg is suing hundreds of Hawaiians trying to take their land.
[12:16.600 --> 12:23.520]  Isn't that just cute to build his giant mansion?
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.760]  Hawaiians call Mark Zuckerberg the face of neocolonialism over land losses, but notice
[12:27.760 --> 12:32.200]  he's the one screaming Black Lives Matter and funding it and pushing the race war while
[12:32.200 --> 12:38.800]  he himself, just like the UN does, goes in and takes people's property.
[12:38.800 --> 12:46.160]  That's how they operate, and believe me, he's building an armored fortress out in San Francisco
[12:46.160 --> 12:49.400]  around his house, that's admitted.
[12:49.400 --> 12:52.720]  He wants walls, you know, I want to put a meme out, I mean we did this last year and
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.920]  Trump picked up on it and others did, but where we show the Great Wall of China, we
[12:57.920 --> 13:03.880]  say it's okay for them to have one, not racist, and then right next to it we have Mexico's
[13:03.880 --> 13:10.360]  border fence and wall, Mexico, not racist, not a problem, and then we can also show,
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.360]  again, many other walls that other governments and other groups have like the Vatican, some
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.840]  of their walls are 200 feet tall, the average is about 50 feet, I've been there, and then
[13:20.840 --> 13:30.440]  next to it show the little spindly fences we've got in a few spots and say racist, again,
[13:30.440 --> 13:39.700]  it's the total mind control of this, and that's just Zuckerberg building his wall out in
[13:39.700 --> 13:44.520]  Kauai, that's nothing on his 700 acres, well he's trying to grab more, he's got a big wall
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.960]  in San Francisco and is buying up all the surrounding neighborhood to bulldoze it and
[13:48.960 --> 13:52.560]  turn it into his own compound, and we get the fact you want privacy and you want a wall
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.120]  bro, but then you've got arm security, you've got the best there is, but you don't want
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.080]  us to be able to own guns, just like Hillary and Michael Moore, you're hypocrites, you're
[14:02.080 --> 14:07.000]  elitists, you're dirtbags.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.640]  You know, I was thinking this morning about a place where I have dropped the ball, and
[14:13.640 --> 14:20.960]  that is chronicling how much in just five days Trump has delivered, and even with his
[14:20.960 --> 14:25.360]  actions acting as president elect, he did more than Obama ever did, because Obama was
[14:25.360 --> 14:29.880]  a globalist trying to suppress us, Trump is simply removing all the illegal garbage,
[14:29.880 --> 14:34.280]  why can Trump just suddenly say we're not turning off any more cold power plants, why
[14:34.280 --> 14:38.360]  can he just suddenly say we're pulled out of TPP, why can he just suddenly do all these
[14:38.360 --> 14:45.160]  things, because under executive action, all this unconstitutional garbage was done, so
[14:45.160 --> 14:56.280]  he can just remove it, but here's the key, upon removing all of this onerous tyranny.
[14:56.280 --> 15:02.600]  Trump is not then dictating it as a stick over the heads of the elites, he's returning
[15:02.600 --> 15:08.160]  it to the Congress and to the people, look at TPP, he could have taken that whole agreement,
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.400]  it's secret that whatever he wanted, quote, for his interest, no, he just said it's gone,
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.760]  it was secret over 10 years, Hillary basically helped create it with Goldman Sachs, we're
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.440]  throwing the whole thing away, it was illegally brought in, it was being enforced by Obama
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.600]  outside of law, Congress didn't pass it, it's gone, we withdraw from the TPP, because Obama
[15:26.600 --> 15:34.960]  had already put us into it, that was what day two he did that, and he passed the critical
[15:34.960 --> 15:42.640]  test, he devolved the power, which is what's needed, back to the states, and back to the
[15:42.640 --> 15:52.680]  people, and the howls of anger only intensified up into the sky, it's just unprecedented,
[15:52.680 --> 15:56.400]  and then noticed that something they snuck by Reagan, I don't blame Reagan for this
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.200]  because he didn't really have a hand in it, but it happened on Reagan's watch, so I guess
[16:00.200 --> 16:07.240]  he gets to blame some of the Democrats, but in what, 1983, the vaccine damage fund, which
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.040]  I guess Reagan thought, oh, we're gonna pay for the kids that get hurt by bad vaccines,
[16:11.040 --> 16:16.560]  no, the law made it secret what happens to you, makes you go into a secret federal court,
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.280]  very hard to ever even get the vaccine damage money, and it's taxpayer money over a billion
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.880]  a year that's put in the fund to pay for what the vaccine makers do, now if somebody's
[16:26.880 --> 16:32.200]  above the law and can't get in trouble, and there's a secret court, do you think they're
[16:32.200 --> 16:35.960]  gonna make better vaccines or worse vaccines, because I'm not arguing that there isn't
[16:35.960 --> 16:41.920]  a science that you can take some type of pathogen that's been attenuated, that's been neutralized,
[16:41.920 --> 16:45.080]  and that your body then still learns that it's an outside enemy and creates antibodies
[16:45.080 --> 16:50.680]  for it, but that's your body going to war, and you do that too much, it causes problems,
[16:50.680 --> 16:56.320]  it causes shock, it causes blood on the brain, it causes the equivalent of your baby getting
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.560]  stung by a hundred bees, that's all that's happening when your baby goes into convulsions
[17:00.560 --> 17:06.440]  and is drooling a few hours after it gets all those vaccines, is it's having an allergic
[17:06.440 --> 17:11.240]  reaction, and I've had hundreds of medical doctors on hundreds over the years breaking
[17:11.240 --> 17:17.720]  this down, but you can read the insert, it says it can cause these shocks and cause seizures,
[17:17.720 --> 17:24.520]  and then cause permanent epilepsy or narcolepsy, or cause type one diabetes because it burns
[17:24.520 --> 17:30.080]  out your pancreas, pancreatitis, it says it on the inserts, we've shown them to you hundreds
[17:30.080 --> 17:36.440]  of times here, every year when kids are getting ready to go to school, Dell Hospital here
[17:36.440 --> 17:45.040]  in Austin is full of children who suddenly can't process sugar, who suddenly can't produce
[17:45.040 --> 17:51.920]  insulin, who suddenly don't have a pancreas, and every time it's a vaccine, they go, oh
[17:51.920 --> 18:00.200]  type one suddenly the genetic form is way up, well yeah because it's being destroyed,
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.520]  it says on the insert of the MMR shot and the flu shot and all the rest of them that
[18:05.520 --> 18:14.320]  it causes pancreatitis and then right under that it says diabetes, diabetes, diabetes,
[18:14.320 --> 18:21.360]  diabetes, diabetes, it hits your brain, it hits your pancreas, big time, you have big
[18:21.360 --> 18:25.560]  autoimmune responses in them and a lot of times it burns them out and your kid never
[18:25.560 --> 18:34.240]  comes back, now Baron is a very smart young man and he's doing great and a lot of people
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.720]  bounce back from damage from vaccines, but the word is Baron got hurt when he was little
[18:39.720 --> 18:43.000]  with vaccines, see this is a learning experience for Trump as well, and I'm not going to get
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.800]  into their private family business, they said leave their kids alone or I've done that,
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.280]  but the point is is that you notice Trump has got somebody who's had his family, Robert
[18:51.280 --> 18:55.960]  F. Kennedy Jr. up there about to lead a commission and really bring out all the investigations
[18:55.960 --> 19:03.240]  and I know what the investigations are, they're open and shut, we've got the 2003 even ABC
[19:03.240 --> 19:09.120]  News did its job back then from a 2000 meeting at the head of the CDC facility with the head
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.720]  of it and all of them admitting it was causing autoimmune disorders and causing massive shock
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.680]  and massive allergic responses and massive brain damage and that they A had to cover
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.840]  it up or there'd be a civil war, they actually say a civil insurrection, millions have been
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.080]  hurt or killed and B they had to clean the vaccines up, they didn't, the numbers are
[19:29.080 --> 19:37.480]  getting worse, they give the military experimental vaccines, you can't kill anthrax, doesn't matter
[19:37.480 --> 19:44.000]  if you're radiated, burn it, whatever, every spore's got to be chopped in half, they inject
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.600]  the troops with live anthrax, no wonder so many died, this is how crazy it is ladies and
[19:48.600 --> 20:00.920]  gentlemen, that's the whole other area, anthrax is literally living dead zombie plant sports.

[21:13.200 --> 21:17.960]  try other brands, I spent eight months and could not find a replacement, I went through
[21:17.960 --> 21:24.080]  tons of brands, types and flavors and almost all of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant,
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.440]  when it all boiled down I came right back to one world way, I buy the cost effective

[24:52.160 --> 24:56.660]  the Info War.
[24:56.660 --> 25:00.800]  By the way, if you just tuned in at the end of that little breakdown about Trump coming
[25:00.800 --> 25:03.800]  out and saying we're going to investigate the vaccines, we're going to put the facts
[25:03.800 --> 25:04.800]  on the table.
[25:04.800 --> 25:08.600]  They're talking about anthrax and thinking about experimental vaccines they use in the
[25:08.600 --> 25:16.200]  military, so I was talking to a lot of veterans up in D.C. over the inauguration, and they
[25:16.200 --> 25:22.480]  were all talking about how the huge list of vaccines they were given would make them
[25:22.480 --> 25:25.960]  so sick, but they said they would just gut up for America and do it, and I was pointing
[25:25.960 --> 25:31.040]  out that most of those vaccines were experimental, so under federal law, you can't order the
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.160]  military to take vaccines that are experimental, you can't order citizens to take anything,
[25:36.160 --> 25:42.080]  and that BioPort that produced the anthrax vaccine got caught having live anthrax in
[25:42.080 --> 25:48.360]  it, and so I was going from memory, and I said, listen, anthrax is the type of bacteria
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.080]  that when it goes into its dormant phase, it's similar to the plant family, and this
[25:52.080 --> 25:57.960]  is layman terms, that it folds in on itself, shrivels up into a crystalline state, and
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.480]  they've documented hundreds of thousands of years it can live in the dirt.
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.040]  I've said a hundred to the military guys, because that's well known, and they believe
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.080]  maybe millions, and so one of the big theories is, this is the type of family of bacteria
[26:11.080 --> 26:16.920]  that might have seeded the earth if you don't believe in the Christian cosmology, but I
[26:16.920 --> 26:22.040]  went and researched it again when I got home Saturday for like an hour, and of course,
[26:22.040 --> 26:29.280]  it's just so amazing the processes of just this family of bacteria that anthrax happens
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.880]  to be a part of, and that they know you can't radiate it, you can't hardly burn it.
[26:35.880 --> 26:40.960]  There's no way to attenuate it where it doesn't make you sick, and that's why they keep coming
[26:40.960 --> 26:45.600]  back with anthrax vaccines, and it keeps killing people, because you're trying to give someone
[26:45.600 --> 26:51.160]  something that can't be killed because it kills itself.
[26:51.160 --> 26:54.360]  When this family of bacteria that anthrax comes from, and again I'm not a scientist,
[26:54.360 --> 26:57.560]  I'm just giving you the basic breakdowns, go research for yourself, starts freezing
[26:57.560 --> 27:03.360]  or starts dying, it goes through this process where it folds in on itself and the bacteria
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.280]  eats itself, it divides the other side, eats the other side, then it implodes and shrinks
[27:08.280 --> 27:15.560]  in to a solid crystalline form that can last millions of years.
[27:15.560 --> 27:22.080]  It's dead, it's dormant, and you talk about suspended animation, so our scientists go
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.120]  here, put in a big tank, fry it with radiation, heat it up, okay, we think these spores are
[27:27.120 --> 27:31.480]  dead, and this will make it where when you get hit by these spores, your body would have
[27:31.480 --> 27:32.680]  learned how to deal with them.
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.200]  There is no dealing with it, and the truth is, it was all a big giant experiment to see
[27:37.200 --> 27:43.480]  what mutations would be caused by injecting humans with this deadly bacteria, because
[27:43.480 --> 27:48.960]  it's known to manipulate human DNA in survivors, and so all the military that was given this,
[27:48.960 --> 27:52.720]  and I've been told this by high ups, again I'm not a scientist, I'm giving you the gestalt
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.120]  of what I was told, you were guinea pigs because the globalists then later at the VA get your
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.520]  blood and they're testing and watching and looking for certain mutations they want to
[28:01.520 --> 28:09.320]  use in their long term gene therapy programs, and what they call basically the eternal cell
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.320]  line that was first found in a woman here in the United States back in the 40s, cancer
[28:14.320 --> 28:18.440]  killed her in a week, and they found that the cancer never dies, you can put a piece
[28:18.440 --> 28:24.320]  of the tumor in a dish, freeze it, or leave it out in the open and it just sits there
[28:24.320 --> 28:31.680]  and doesn't die, it's a zombie, it doesn't need oxygen, it doesn't need nutrients, it
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.960]  doesn't need anything, so they're obsessed with what I call zombie cell lines, this isn't
[28:36.960 --> 28:44.360]  zombie movies folks, this is the real deal, and anthrax in the bacteria slash plant family,
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.640]  it's in the whole side of the bacteria family that's associated with plants, and again I'm
[28:48.640 --> 28:52.840]  giving you just a layman's breakdown of this, I've read hundreds of papers on it, and then
[28:52.840 --> 28:58.760]  over on the other side, cancers in humans where the cells are so strong and so powerful
[28:58.760 --> 29:06.400]  they won't die, unless you completely burn them into ashes, the problem is with anthrax
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.960]  is heating it up doesn't do it either, until you smash the crystals at a microscopic level,
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.120]  heating it up doesn't kill it, you have to turn it into ashes, you have to burn it into
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.640]  dust, I didn't mean to segue, it's just the media will make a joke and go, Jones claims
[29:22.640 --> 29:29.080]  the government injected troops with zombie, zombie spores, well yes, that's what anthrax
[29:29.080 --> 29:38.720]  is, it is a desiccated zombie bacteria that can live a million years, and that reactivates
[29:38.720 --> 29:43.840]  and we injected the troops with that, okay, you can't make this up, pretty strange in
[29:43.840 --> 29:49.880]  the fiction, moron trumps overthrow the new world order, straight ahead, Trump is on fire,
[29:49.880 --> 30:00.280]  we're on the march, the empires on the run, alex jones and the gcn radio network, well
[30:00.280 --> 30:05.520]  just in case you missed it info wars was on the ground live covering every piece of action
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.920]  imaginable on the washington dc grounds as the inauguration was taking place and we
[30:09.920 --> 30:15.520]  caught not surprisingly a number of protestors behaving badly, one video shows a man frustrated
[30:15.520 --> 30:20.040]  with anti-fascist blocking a street in washington dc and one of these fascist punches the man
[30:20.040 --> 30:24.400]  in the face before being attacked, the incident taking place on friday, during trumps inaugurals
[30:24.400 --> 30:28.640]  speech the video starts with an unnamed man, let's call him Thor asking the anti-fata
[30:28.640 --> 30:32.160]  stooges if they're going to prevent him from going to work because they're crying, you
[30:32.160 --> 30:36.560]  know what, then they seem to have lost it with the word war, yes, pretty much a massed
[30:36.560 --> 30:40.600]  female responds, come on babe, let the ladies through at which point, some of the women
[30:40.600 --> 30:45.400]  pass, now this guy rushes behind the women and turns around and says f you, your roadblocks
[30:45.400 --> 30:50.800]  are expletive, and then she responds by attacking him, yes, she punches him right in the face,
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.600]  looks like these protestors that are part of the women's march after the inauguration,
[30:54.600 --> 30:58.600]  we're just as bad, catch us here for all of the action, i'm margaret helv reporting
[30:58.600 --> 31:03.280]  for infowars.com, it's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food
[31:03.280 --> 31:07.160]  that needs to be cleaned, it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children, the
[31:07.160 --> 31:13.160]  artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems,
[31:13.160 --> 31:18.120]  the same team based right here in america that brought you the elixir pure ground breaking

[33:16.440 --> 33:30.360]  rallying patriots worldwide, you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:30.360 --> 33:34.880]  so trump is going after the corrupt vaccine makers that have been caught poisoning the
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.320]  general public is also looking into not giving experimental vaccines to folks in the military
[33:39.320 --> 33:46.000]  that's part of the whole commission that robert fk jr is going to head up, trump is again
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  helped buoy through trump euphoria the stock market passed 20,000 in fact if you can pull
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.360]  it up on screen let's look where it is right now and so many other just incredibly positive
[34:00.360 --> 34:08.720]  things huge factories coming back being announced every other day and the media is selling it
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.440]  like trump is abandoning america trump is trying to hurt america trump is doing the opposite
[34:14.440 --> 34:23.720]  the dow is now at 20,060.85 trump is doing the opposite he's saying we're going to rebuild
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.000]  our infrastructure we're going to stand up for our interest that doesn't mean the united
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.320]  states won't be involved in the world but we're not going to pay for multinational corporations
[34:34.320 --> 34:40.240]  to go take over third world countries exploit their labor and then ship in their crap to
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.560]  destroy american jobs we're not going to let foreign multinationals controlling federal
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.640]  regulators steal our jobs by openly setting up regulations that make it impossible to
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.000]  do business in this country unless you're an insider they've chosen what areas of the
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.560]  country they want to develop the globalist half and they've decided that the midwest
[35:01.560 --> 35:07.600]  other areas are to be depopulated that's official that's what obama signed into law with his
[35:07.600 --> 35:14.400]  whole rural affairs commission that the pentagon would head up under agenda 21 to force integrate
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.520]  city people into the country and you basically set up black lives matter type scenarios all
[35:20.520 --> 35:26.560]  over the nation i mean this is so incredibly diabolical what's going on and it was so
[35:26.560 --> 35:32.520]  evil that because you expose it and other people exposed it it's now burning up and
[35:32.520 --> 35:40.320]  collapsing in flames so fast now trump has pointed out that the vatican has walls he's
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.120]  pointed out that china has a great wall and a wall on its coastline he's pointed out that
[35:44.120 --> 35:49.080]  we've paid for walls in iraq walls in afghanistan walls in macedonia the united states has paid
[35:49.080 --> 35:55.200]  for hundreds of walls well thousands of smaller walls but hundreds of walls in different nations
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.480]  along borders and now under obama they've been paying to take down those walls and bring
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.480]  all the jihadis into europe and so trump's pointed out to mexico you have a contiguous
[36:06.480 --> 36:14.520]  you have a continual wall on your southern border it never ends it never stops you have
[36:14.520 --> 36:18.680]  areas that are accessible by humans on the glottamala border you have helicopters you
[36:18.680 --> 36:25.800]  have armored vehicles you have military i've been there i've seen it well we're going
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.560]  to do the same thing on our border it's completely out of control in lawless and there are over
[36:30.560 --> 36:38.360]  250 000 aggravated felons in the united states from all over europe all over asia all over
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.720]  russia latin america canada you name it we don't care what color you are or where you
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.480]  came from if you are a felon or aggravated felon and you're in this country and you get
[36:48.480 --> 36:54.880]  picked up you are being put on an airplane and your butt is being flown back to the country
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.640]  that is waiting for you many times criminal charges the united states is not a dumping
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.720]  ground for miscreants also we're not going to have the anchor baby status anymore he's
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.760]  getting ready in the next two days to announce that it's been announced where you don't just
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.480]  come here and have a kid free and then everything's paid for and they become a citizen it's the
[37:15.480 --> 37:22.240]  chinese that have now outpaced mexico in doing that we are a joke and again they try to bully
[37:22.240 --> 37:26.240]  us in the submission as we go bankrupt you will pay for it you will do it it's the right
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.840]  thing to do i didn't get to it yesterday there was a clip on tucker carlson because another
[37:30.840 --> 37:40.000]  one out today where the communist on the program is saying oh well america's racist so that's
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.360]  why you have to let more people in you have to prove that you're not racist and carlson
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.320]  says to him because they all have the same talking point these liberal groups well if
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.320]  we're totally white supremacists why then have we become a non-white population in most
[37:53.320 --> 37:59.320]  areas and it's going to be totally reversed within 20 years see trump and everybody else
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.720]  is just trying to get an american birthright to anybody that comes here who actually wants
[38:03.720 --> 38:09.280]  to be an american instead the globalists want to turn you into a mental patient running around
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.480]  screaming and yelling you're an effing white male and calling for socialism and calling
[38:14.480 --> 38:25.480]  for the american dream to be welfare so you can be completely conditioned and controlled
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.240]  trumps also calling for a major investigation into voter fraud which was organized by the
[38:31.240 --> 38:36.000]  democrat so it became election fraud and i have an entire stack of news i want to cover
[38:36.000 --> 38:47.000]  right now documenting the fact that pure research and ice and so many other organizations have
[38:47.000 --> 38:55.280]  found that what trump is saying is actually not even 10 percent of how bad it is it's
[38:55.280 --> 39:01.680]  worse than what president trump is saying and just like they told us we can never have
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.000]  president trump they never told us we could get out of the tpp they never told us we could
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.400]  get out of obama care they never told us they never told us they told us over and over and
[39:12.400 --> 39:18.240]  over again that it was impossible to ever reverse any of this and five days in it's
[39:18.240 --> 39:27.400]  on fire and more than 10 percent of the globalist agenda is already gone it's happening much
[39:27.400 --> 39:33.480]  quicker than i thought but it's a blitzkrieg approach of just overwhelming the enemy trump
[39:33.480 --> 39:45.640]  hitting him with all of his energy and delegating you notice saturday as soon as madis had been
[39:45.640 --> 39:49.840]  confirmed to secretary of defense that a whole bunch of targets across syria got bombed big
[39:49.840 --> 39:56.200]  command and control bases that obama had been protecting as trump told the cia the gloves
[39:56.200 --> 40:06.680]  are off target all al qaeda target all ices because what obama would do is sick there
[40:06.680 --> 40:12.400]  over every little target and of course protect them because he was only basically intimidated
[40:12.400 --> 40:21.240]  by being exposed into targeting any of the targets so a lot of the top leaders are being
[40:21.240 --> 40:29.240]  killed as we speak those stories are up on screen but remember that we challenge trump
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.360]  months before the election the final election last year we said they will engage in fraud
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.720]  on land security is trying to take over the election they will bus in the illegals project
[40:38.720 --> 40:43.920]  veritas caught him on tape democrats bragged about it newspapers saying if you're an illegal
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.720]  alien or you're a you know criminal you're whatever just go out read the obituary find
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.880]  out if somebody's dead and the democrats will give you a match in a local voter role and
[40:53.880 --> 40:59.440]  give you a list of people to go out and vote in their stead and they arrested people in
[40:59.440 --> 41:07.880]  texas and colorada in new mexico all over the country in florida with list of people
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.440]  who were dead who were on the voter rolls who do you think matched up those dead people
[41:12.440 --> 41:18.480]  recently dead with voters on the voter rolls the democratic party i've got a stack of news
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.080]  here but even fox news goes well trump's right that there are millions of people millions
[41:23.080 --> 41:28.680]  of dead people on the voter rolls of millions of illegals that reportedly vote sometime
[41:28.680 --> 41:36.200]  but there's no proof it's organized and there's no proof it's massive but now all of a sudden
[41:36.200 --> 41:41.240]  they're having to back off and saying well millions of illegals probably did vote in
[41:41.240 --> 41:48.560]  2016 and of all places that's politico that scroll back to the top of that that was that's
[41:48.560 --> 41:54.560]  investors business daily i also saw a similar headline from politico so trump knows what
[41:54.560 --> 42:01.800]  he's doing he is exposing the whole democratic party program that's public in seven different
[42:01.800 --> 42:07.120]  states well 14 states are trying but seven actually got bills out of their legislatures
[42:07.120 --> 42:12.760]  in the last two years to have illegals vote but none of the governors could sign it because
[42:12.760 --> 42:19.600]  it was so bold it would violate federal law but illinois and california and other states
[42:19.600 --> 42:26.240]  they passed laws that illegals could vote they didn't say illegals they said that anyone
[42:26.240 --> 42:32.080]  that's here including migrants or immigrants can vote nowhere else on earth you just show
[42:32.080 --> 42:37.080]  up and vote china that's always criticizing us and calling us fascists doesn't have voted
[42:37.080 --> 42:43.200]  voting they have a polet bureau and a central committee but they have a president so it's
[42:43.200 --> 42:50.080]  okay so trump calls for major investigation into voter fraud and i was watching fox news
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.160]  this morning and they were saying well he's really wrong i mean millions of illegals didn't
[42:55.160 --> 43:02.480]  vote even though i have pew research reports and fox news pieces but it was fox business
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.960]  admitting the numbers were way bigger than the two three or four five million that trump
[43:06.960 --> 43:13.080]  says they think may have voted so of course if the democrats are organizing them to vote
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.160]  caught on tape having them vote people are being arrested they're saying illegals have
[43:17.160 --> 43:22.160]  a right to vote then of course this should be investigated but act like nothing's happening
[43:22.160 --> 43:26.800]  all over the country they're calling it civil rights to not show your id when you vote but
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.360]  they want you to show your id when you do everything else paul watson wrote a key report
[43:32.360 --> 43:37.400]  on it three million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens and he goes
[43:37.400 --> 43:43.240]  over the fact we should retweet that article at trump because so many times when he comes
[43:43.240 --> 43:48.480]  out with his statements he doesn't really go over the evidence i understand it's hard
[43:48.480 --> 43:54.240]  to do that in a tweet spicer by the way who's getting more hardcore has been doing that
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.320]  and speaking of spicer let's go to the communist news network covering one of his press conferences
[44:00.320 --> 44:05.960]  he stated his concerns voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he
[44:05.960 --> 44:09.640]  continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented
[44:09.640 --> 44:14.520]  to him press secretary sean spicer doubling down on the president's claim but repeatedly
[44:14.520 --> 44:18.880]  unable to point to evidence that backs up the charge that has been debunked by republicans
[44:18.880 --> 44:23.560]  and democrats alike the president believes that there was voter fraud i wonder if you
[44:23.560 --> 44:27.040]  believe that you were at the republican national committee at the time and chief of staff
[44:27.040 --> 44:30.640]  rince previous was the chairman of the rnc at the time do you believe there was widespread
[44:30.640 --> 44:35.120]  voter fraud is it my job is not look i this how can he be comfortable with his win if
[44:35.120 --> 44:38.960]  he was very comfortable with his right million votes maybe he didn't win no he's very comfortable
[44:38.960 --> 44:45.400]  with his win it's an electoral based system you got 306 votes 33 but let's let's let's
[44:45.400 --> 44:51.320]  back this up for a second but i just want to make a point here the same republican party
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.560]  that ganged up on trump and said that he was crazy and evil and bad are the ones that said
[44:55.560 --> 45:03.040]  that there was no evidence of any voter fraud so they know when they're up there saying
[45:03.040 --> 45:07.040]  all this that it's garbage and they're also saying oh trump is it comfortable with his
[45:07.040 --> 45:14.440]  win and so that's why he's doing this now he's trying to secure voting rights in this
[45:14.440 --> 45:19.880]  country for citizens and not letting the globalist who are using massive immigrant invasions
[45:19.880 --> 45:26.860]  as a tool to overthrow countries he's trying to defend the integrity and sovereignty and
[45:26.860 --> 45:32.560]  trump knows that top election fraud experts have reported that at least five states were
[45:32.560 --> 45:37.560]  stolen from him and that hillary tried and failed in six other states where homeland
[45:37.560 --> 45:46.600]  security was caught hundreds of times per state trying to break into the computers on
[45:46.600 --> 45:51.520]  election day there's another headline illegal immigrants could elect hillary please print
[45:51.520 --> 46:00.160]  me that as well that's politico again there's this leftist globalist elitist operating system
[46:00.160 --> 46:04.120]  where they admit their plan for illegals to overthrow trump and they admit they're getting
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.200]  them to vote and we have them on all these videos and election officials in new york
[46:08.200 --> 46:14.480]  admitting the massive fraud plan and we have the wiki leaks memos and we have them admitting
[46:14.480 --> 46:22.920]  that they're planning to do it didn't we catch them doing it president trump when he was
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.840]  a candidate comes out and exposes it and has been proven right and then he's the bad guy
[46:27.840 --> 46:34.440]  and a bunch of surly elitist arrogant press corps people who aren't even real press come
[46:34.440 --> 46:40.640]  out and say oh he doesn't feel legitimate he won the electoral college he would have won
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.040]  in a bigger landslide and would have won the popular vote clearly losing about two million
[46:45.040 --> 46:50.160]  votes to hillary that this hadn't been the case of your fraud and by the way all fifty
[46:50.160 --> 46:58.120]  that's fifty ladies and gentlemen fifty all fifty state attorney generals have written
[46:58.120 --> 47:05.840]  letters that includes democrats to trump saying please reverse the executive actions of obama
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.000]  saying that elections are now federal that's scary that's not supposed to work that way
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.040]  remember obama said whenever i brought it up all that crazy guy in texas we don't run
[47:14.040 --> 47:20.360]  the elections don't worry they were sure trying but doing it by stealth didn't work so trumps
[47:20.360 --> 47:28.080]  been proven correct so they're crapping their drawers right now literally and trying to make
[47:28.080 --> 47:32.760]  it look illegitimate that trump knows what really went on let's go back to the tape he
[47:32.760 --> 47:41.800]  is very comfortable with his win it's an electoral based system he got 306 electoral
[47:41.800 --> 47:46.720]  votes 33 or 50 states voted for him i think look jeff i've asked an answer to this question
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.720]  twice he believes what he believes based on the information provided trump has got a
[47:51.720 --> 47:54.560]  good idea to kick most of these people out because these aren't real reporters look at
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.400]  that little surly guy he thinks he's arrived because he's arrogant he'll do what he's told
[47:59.400 --> 48:05.200]  he'll spin did you hear him say maybe he didn't win spice is talking over him but he says
[48:05.200 --> 48:11.880]  maybe why is he why is he not securing his victory maybe he didn't win oh just like they
[48:11.880 --> 48:18.360]  had recounts and he got more votes back than hillary did 10 to one or more oh just like
[48:18.360 --> 48:27.240]  she lost electors she lost five he lost two in that initiative now there it is sand reporter
[48:27.240 --> 48:36.280]  on trump maybe he didn't win but don't worry let's have cnn front row seats right there
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.600]  let's not have a drudge correspondent a bright barred info or is at least even mixed in and
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.320]  look i'm not criticizing it quite frankly i don't even want to be in there we probably
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.120]  do need to set up a bureau just to cover what's happening there and all our sources and go
[48:48.120 --> 48:53.040]  to some of these just for just for optics but we're taking back the country that's why we're
[48:53.040 --> 48:58.160]  here in austin we're taking back the country reaching out to the people and doing the hard
[48:58.160 --> 49:02.160]  work not sitting in there being arrogant so people around the water cooler at failing
[49:02.160 --> 49:10.120]  cnn i'm skipping this break so people at failing cnn joke cnn totally discredited cnn and go
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.680]  oh good job saying maybe he wasn't even elected oh see trump comes in he's elected but says
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.240]  i'm going to secure our voting because the democrats have got all these illegals voting
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.160]  we've caught him doing it and this guy's so arrogant he says maybe trump didn't even
[49:24.160 --> 49:32.360]  win and then that's news because this guy's wearing a three thousand dollar suit and you
[49:32.360 --> 49:38.400]  know wearing the little black rimmed glasses and acting like an intellectual he's so smart
[49:38.400 --> 49:43.520]  because they all say together there's no evidence of fraud no evidence of illegals just seven
[49:43.520 --> 49:48.760]  states passing out of their houses laws for illegals to vote and illegals being caught
[49:48.760 --> 49:52.680]  everywhere and democrats caught commanding the illegals but it's not really illegals
[49:52.680 --> 49:57.080]  over the big issue they're part of it it's mainly democrats with list of dead voters
[49:57.080 --> 50:04.160]  running around my estimate sorry that's three to one that and of course when trump says
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.320]  he wants to investigation he means executive branch to codify don't worry mr. president
[50:09.320 --> 50:13.920]  i've asked paul watson and i'll do it as well the next 48 hours i'm going to shoot a detailed
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.680]  bullet report showing each admission each arrest your documents where they're doing it the laws
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.560]  how they admitted how the un's calling for it the un called last year for america to
[50:24.560 --> 50:30.700]  accept quote migrants voting germany's moving to let quote migrants vote some german cities
[50:30.700 --> 50:36.600]  let people who've got off the plane one day vote oh but there's none of this happening
[50:36.600 --> 50:43.280]  none of this is going on ladies and gentlemen there are no dead people voting even though
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.560]  they're bragging high illegals and dead people are what's going to be trump killer he's got
[50:47.560 --> 50:54.200]  a secret weapon the illegals you don't like trump sorry the legal people that are here
[50:54.200 --> 50:58.880]  the people that happen to be hispanic or russian or african that have become citizens they get
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.760]  what's happening and they want a piece the american pie and they know trump is addressing
[51:02.760 --> 51:07.480]  it and they voted for him in record numbers that's why your giant election fraud failed
[51:07.480 --> 51:15.600]  you stole five states and still you failed you hit roger stone with polonium still you
[51:15.600 --> 51:21.080]  failed you threw everything you had at us but still you failed how'd you like us sending
[51:21.080 --> 51:25.080]  out all the people to scream rape at your events think that helps you a little bit that was
[51:25.080 --> 51:31.040]  nothing we had tactics ten times more hardcore that were legal ready to be used but we knew
[51:31.040 --> 51:35.320]  the internal polls were showing we were going to beat you so if you really want the gloves
[51:35.320 --> 51:40.520]  off if you think your army of a bunch of screaming ugly harpies wearing pink condoms on their
[51:40.520 --> 51:45.560]  heads scares us got nothing coming it scares us you've turned them into such slobs such
[51:45.560 --> 51:54.400]  entitled fools but it doesn't scare us of the outcome we're going to win and get ready
[51:54.400 --> 51:58.840]  we finally have somebody in the executive branch that isn't out to get america and doesn't
[51:58.840 --> 52:06.280]  care what you think or say and knows that you're a pack of colluding sycophantic vampires
[52:06.280 --> 52:11.280]  let's go back to this little vampire turd poligarbage whatever his name is says maybe
[52:11.280 --> 52:15.920]  you did you come on his breath maybe he didn't win maybe he didn't win so see oh trumps crazy
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.680]  to say he won by more but this guy with no proof the same CNN that said that you know
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.280]  the crowd was ten percent total lie or that they got rid of the bust of martin wither
[52:25.280 --> 52:30.560]  king total lie these people are just outrageous enemies of this country let's go back to it
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.760]  democracy though what is that thanks yeah ma'am just believe that what does that mean
[52:34.760 --> 52:38.120]  for democracy it means that yeah i've answered your question have you the allegations of
[52:38.120 --> 52:42.840]  voter fraud which trump has repeatedly made before taking office surfaced again after
[52:42.840 --> 52:47.040]  the president repeated that claim monday night while meeting with congressional leaders at
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.360]  the white house i think we won very very handily he's very comfortable with his win but he doesn't
[52:52.360 --> 52:56.680]  sound like it he won the electoral college but lost the popular vote by nearly three
[52:56.680 --> 53:01.880]  million he charged that three to five million people voted illegally a claim is unsubstantiated
[53:01.880 --> 53:06.840]  as when he first made it after the election but now it carries the weight of the presidency
[53:06.840 --> 53:12.120]  to back up the allegations his advisors have pointed to a 2012 study by the pew center it
[53:12.120 --> 53:16.600]  found nearly three million people have voter registrations in more than one state and nearly
[53:16.600 --> 53:21.440]  two million people are listed as dead but the study made no finding of voter fraud all
[53:21.440 --> 53:25.320]  right let's talk right there see and it's done it again the same ones that showed the
[53:25.320 --> 53:29.960]  crowd coming in at 830 and then cut it and showed the crowd going out later you see the
[53:29.960 --> 53:35.360]  crowd change to a lot of the public just like pbs did just like young turks did all deceiving
[53:35.360 --> 53:41.640]  you we have the pew research report and fox had it on fox business a few months ago and
[53:41.640 --> 53:46.680]  the numbers are way bigger those were only numbers in one part of the study the numbers
[53:46.680 --> 53:52.120]  are in the tens of millions but what the experts believe our voting is two to three million
[53:52.120 --> 53:58.560]  illegals and three to five million quote dead people now you add that together conservatively
[53:58.560 --> 54:02.320]  there's five six seven eight million people that are voting and we know who does this
[54:02.320 --> 54:07.080]  this is democrats so trump can probably say he really won by six seven million he's being
[54:07.080 --> 54:13.960]  conservative so he knows when the research is done it'll be more than what he said undocumented
[54:13.960 --> 54:18.200]  america the truth of illegal immigration let's go ahead and play the report on the pew research
[54:18.200 --> 54:24.560]  according to pew 24 million people one of every eight voter registrations in the u.s.
[54:24.560 --> 54:32.000]  are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate more than 1.8 million dead people are listed
[54:32.000 --> 54:37.800]  as voters so you could use that name go ahead and vote approximately 2.75 million people
[54:37.800 --> 54:44.800]  two and three quarter million people are registered in more than one state so that is outlines
[54:44.800 --> 54:55.680]  i think the possibility of voter fraud all right now let's go ahead and go to the actual
[54:55.680 --> 54:59.640]  facts you go to paul joseph watson's article he links to all the actual facts federal statistics
[54:59.640 --> 55:04.600]  you name it three million votes of presidential election cast by legal aliens trump may have
[55:04.600 --> 55:13.680]  one popular vote november 14 2016 bev harris top expert big liberal she said come on the
[55:13.680 --> 55:19.160]  show clear evidence in five states of impossible numbers for hillary her getting a hundred percent
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.640]  in precincts are having you know massive amounts come in only for her right as they were closing
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.480]  and that there were evidence of the of five states being stolen probably more so see we're
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.840]  not even looking at states they stole or electronically manipulated because there's a lot of evidence
[55:32.840 --> 55:38.040]  of that we're just looking at the illegals voting so there's that article here's another
[55:38.040 --> 55:42.680]  one out of bloomberg some cities want their non-citizen immigrants to vote and they've
[55:42.680 --> 55:49.200]  caught those cities in 14 different states letting them vote because there's no IDs needed
[55:49.200 --> 55:53.880]  in what 20 something states 20 think happens the democrats bus you around with a list of
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.680]  dead people it's all about the dead people on the rolls there needs to be a lot at every
[55:58.680 --> 56:03.560]  state level that somebody dies the email is sent in a program and they were removed from
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.920]  the rolls that that's the way to fix this it's all folks who are dead most of them conservatives
[56:08.920 --> 56:14.240]  and patriots imagine for four or five years still on the voter rolls sometimes longer
[56:14.240 --> 56:20.360]  with people stealing their identity and stealing their right as a citizen to vote so that's
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.680]  bloomberg all they want the illegals to vote but none of them voted third time a charm fox
[56:24.680 --> 56:30.720]  news san francisco to try yet again to give you legal immigrants voting rights san francisco
[56:30.720 --> 56:34.080]  moves to open voting for illegals there's some articles seeing pull them up before states

[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:19.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:00:19.880 --> 1:00:27.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex joe i knew trump had something
[1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:32.280]  two plus years ago with the elites were in conniption feds of hatred against him
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:41.320]  and they really did everything they could to stop him and it blew up in their face they
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:46.680]  have collapsed they are discredited but they do have some cards still up their sleeves and we've
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:53.400]  got to really be watching for him to try to throw sand in our eyes now there's a story up on drudge
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:01:02.680]  report dot com on the left hand side us elites buying new zealand redoubts to escape crack up
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:12.200]  of civilization very very important article now again we've we've harped on this quite a bit
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:22.440]  it but but i'm glad that the press is starting to pick up on this more because the fact that they
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:28.120]  have been exiting the last six seven eight years so quickly they're not just new zealand but the
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:35.800]  cook islands to kawaii hawaii they're not doing this because they don't want to be in the center
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:39.080]  of things the elites want to be in paris they want to be in rome they want to be in london
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:42.920]  they want to be in new york they want to be in la where it's happening they're doing it because
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:50.680]  there's a very very good chance that we could see substantive societal breakdown and again i don't
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:58.680]  say that to be a fearmonger i have three children most historians most military analysts said we
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:04.520]  were getting very close to nuclear war with russia isn't it a sigh of relief now that that that that
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:11.560]  threat has subsided a little bit well the elite aren't slowing down their exodus and and this article
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:18.680]  breaks it down wealthy americans fear in pending civil war in the homeland wealthy americans are
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:24.520]  preparing for possible us collapse or revolt by the poor and buying properties in new zealand the
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:31.000]  new yorker magazine reported according to writer evan osnos oh i love how we learned about it from
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:37.800]  the new yorker now i told you eight years ago that elites from other new zealand to get away from the
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:43.000]  of a collapse now that doesn't mean it's going to happen it means they're being told things in
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:50.280]  their elite circle that make them think this that's why that's important according to the
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:57.000]  report preppers from silicon valley like zuckerberg and new york are getting ready for the crack up
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:03.320]  civilization while they fund black lives matter all the major fortune 100 while they fund the
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:07.240]  communist groups while they fund the groups that went out and beat up trump supporters i was there
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:15.080]  it's so outrageous they are funding civil unrest in ukraine in the middle east in europe
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:24.520]  videos pour in every day of people in sweden women being gang raped by muslims or uh in in in in spain
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:32.520]  a woman was wearing a bracelet that just sits spain on it and a bunch of men beat her half to death
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:39.960]  and then the local socialist member of the local town council went on tv and said this woman is a
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.920]  monster and a pig you can go read the quotes she deserves it but whether you love her or hate her
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:50.040]  since when is it okay for the left to beat up women i mean i witnessed it we're bleeding when
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:54.600]  we're walking by me on the street they kept telling me we're being attacked by black lives matter
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:04:01.720]  and i went down there and it was like 90 white women and little weird white guys and then a few
[1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:08.600]  blacked out black guys beating people up screaming you're an effing white male as they beat up
[1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:13.800]  hispanic and asian women particularly because they flip out they get triggered by somebody that has
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:20.120]  any color on their skin going to a trump rally i mean how how would a black new york times reporter
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:27.400]  get in they were so dumb down that even attacked people like that reporters trying to get in or
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.600]  people going hey i'm going to work see i got a badge no you're not going to work
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:41.160]  this is the craziness to these people so that report breaks it all down that that they are
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:46.440]  really hot-tailed they want to have places where they're safe when they organize the civil war if
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:50.840]  they need to here's the deal we know you're behind it so don't think you're going to get away with this
[1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:56.920]  and that you won't be touched whether it's in kawaii or new zealand understand that zuckerberg
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:04.200]  and the rest of you abc has the first one-on-one interview with president trump and they are
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:09.640]  taking ownership of what should be public information listing unprecedented restrictions
[1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:13.960]  on the publishing of that information they put limits on how long the excerpts can be
[1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:19.240]  they put a time limit on how long material can be used no material may be used after february the
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:24.840]  first they're mandating on-screen credits and on and on understand what's going on for political
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:29.240]  and financial reasons the mainstream media is trying to maintain a monopoly on information
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:33.560]  and reporting about the president they want to exclude friendly media so that they will control
[1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:39.000]  the narrative but it's also about profits and we can see that as abc news lawyers up remember
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.480]  that one of the key aspects of the trans-pacific partnership was the copyright issue as info
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:47.800]  wars has been pointing out for a long time copyright claims would be used to suppress
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:53.480]  freedom of speech and to control the political narrative to quote jim acosta of cnn as he
[1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:59.160]  lectured president elect trump that is not appropriate for info wars dot com i'm david night

[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:43.960]  pulling us out of tpp day one moving to secure the borders uh more and more saying he's not
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:50.120]  going to only talk to mainstream media the stock market exploding a lot of positive things now will
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:56.680]  the new order be perfect there's no way that's going to happen but undoubtedly the liberty-based
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:04.200]  libertarian free market von miss ron paul movement of the last 30 years that was such a tiny voice
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:11.160]  30 something years ago is now huge it's got to feel good for former congressman and of course medical
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:17.800]  doctor ron paul fellow texan to see his son in the senate leading the fight for sovereignty and
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:25.480]  anti-war and to and and audit the fed and to see the anti-globalist movement being so popular not
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:31.480]  just here but around the world i tell you the worm has turned i'm not saying we're in some utopia
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:36.680]  there's still huge fights ahead and i want to talk about what he's most concerned about but i've seen
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:42.120]  ron paul on tv and i thought man that guy looks younger and and he's joining us via hd video
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.520]  and i'm like man you look 10 years younger what's going on he said well look it's great not flying
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:51.560]  back and forth to congress that's what's great so it is wonderful uh former congressman paul to
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:10:01.000]  join us thank you thank you good to be with you well where should we start today well there are
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.680]  so many places uh government keeps growing that bothers me i just heard it out a long time ago
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:11.160]  in the 70s we're in about too much spending too much debt and the government's too big
[1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:16.440]  and supported a lot of people along the way and there've been a lot of promises and generally
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:23.080]  i've been disappointed you know the regular years uh were the time when i was most optimistic and
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:29.080]  yet by the end of eight years i was pretty disappointed the spending continued our presence
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:34.200]  around the world got bigger so uh i keep my fingers crossed on what's going to happen with this
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:39.640]  administration because i i still hear mixed signals you know about what's going to happen i worry a
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:44.200]  little bit about the connection that the new administration has with goldman sacks it used
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:50.280]  to be we were worried about goldman sacks but it looks like now they've uh gotten inside the white
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:55.640]  house and there's something to be concerned about and we don't know we have to uh believe that
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:01.480]  trump will continue to do what he said he wants to do but uh when some of these individuals
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:06.520]  you know get into the treasury and they say hey you know i don't know about this art of the fed
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:13.240]  business that might not be a good idea so we need uh alex to remain vigilant and be careful and uh
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:19.160]  call things as we see him dr paul i absolutely agree with you 100 but if you look at bannon who
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:24.840]  was former goldman sacks he's anti-globalist pro america and they're delivering if you look at
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:31.000]  the other fellow i mean he's been anti-naft and gat i mean can't we say though that trump is really
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.840]  trying to deliver a lot of promises pulling us out of tpp day one uh you know signaling that
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:43.080]  we're going to try to cut our corporate tax so we can be competitive you know i think i think he's
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:48.440]  changing the whole nature of the international order uh but i don't think we're gonna have a
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:56.360]  less presence uh when you hear him talk about uh going anyplace every place and we have to totally
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:03.400]  eradicate uh you know an ideological movement which is radical islam you know that's sort of like
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:10.440]  taking on communism which was an ideological issue that we defeated without a war and without
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:15.880]  bombing anybody a neighborhood vicious and mean and nasty so yes it's it's a mixed bag but i think
[1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:22.840]  what you're talking about is good because uh the conventional international order you know uh he he
[1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:27.160]  doesn't not seem to fit in i think he wants to control it but there was a time you know during
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:32.120]  the campaign you and i talked about nato and and we you know we don't ever get too excited about
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:38.280]  nato and going to war for nato and he said some great things about that but uh let's wait and see
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:45.160]  what happens because some of his appointees sort of like nato and have indicated that we'll go along
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:52.440]  uh with what they do and as long as they follow our policy and that that's good for us to look at it
[1:12:52.440 --> 1:12:59.400]  that way but that also is a red flag for other countries but you know what i am i'm a non-interventionist
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:03.960]  i don't like entangling alliances i don't have anything to do with nato united nations i think
[1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:10.760]  that's uh you know all a danger to us and that's what i've been fighting for so uh i watch carefully
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:16.760]  of the individuals who have been uh living under those conditions the military people certainly
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:23.640]  have been uh mixed in without a lot too so uh and there's no indication that the military industrial
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:30.600]  complex is going to have less influence i'm worried about that because we they won't look at the
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:36.520]  difference between military spending and defense spending they still talk about defense defense
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:42.840]  spending defense i don't want to cut a penny out of defense but i do want to slash military spending
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:47.320]  because it's nothing more than getting us into mischief around the world in incentivizing these
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:53.480]  people to be come and get us and uh as long as we do that we're going to have a problem so i want
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:14:00.520]  a stronger defense by having a change foreign policy and also to uh separate the two between
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:07.240]  military and also uh you know defense and i think trump does say some things about you know
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.680]  cracking down on some of the ways and fraud but i also think it's very important to know what our
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:18.120]  policies are are we truly the policemen of the world and of course i think that's a dangerous
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:23.320]  position well he did just put a federal hiring freeze in he did just announce all these regulations
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:27.800]  that are designed so companies can't operate are gone and i did love one big thing he did
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:32.520]  when he announced we're pulling out a tpp he didn't reserve it and say he's gonna you know
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:37.400]  oversee it with congress and and renegotiate it he said it's unconstitutional they had no authority
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:43.560]  to negotiate it the president didn't it's just dead i mean right there he handed power back to
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:47.560]  congress back to the states back to the people he didn't say oh i'm going to renegotiate it
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:54.360]  that's a big sign i mean ron paul isn't it exciting i mean because i mean i know you're not just a
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:59.480]  cheerleader for for for a trump i'm just super excited because here he is saying americanism
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:04.440]  not globalism it's we the people that have the power we're going to give the power back to you
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:09.400]  you or what is important we have a bunch of elites up here that are arrogant uh you know calling the
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:14.440]  media out for being fake you've exposed that as well i mean they just do outrageous stuff major
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:20.040]  media said that i got arrested at the trump rally and thrown out no they had communists attacking me
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:26.680]  the police protected me i mean the the msm has only seemed to double down in their deception
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:33.720]  well you know i think you're right about the tpp i'm delighted i don't want to get anywhere
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:39.080]  close to that we need to get rid of the wto and the un and all that others but business but you
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:45.240]  know the freeze on employees of the government has been very limited because he did not put that into
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:50.040]  the military that's all going to be expanded uh so they're going to cut social security which was a
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:56.440]  proposal the omb director the new one and uh they're going to spend more money on the on the military
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:03.960]  and uh not on not on national defense so i think i think there's some significance uh there because
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:08.680]  they don't ever talk about you know there are for every hundred people we have in the military we
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:14.120]  have 60 civilians in there they're involved and it's our civilians they go overseas and fight
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.920]  these wars and they're the contractor they're the halberds they're the ones that are in on the
[1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:24.440]  gravy train and they're not even counted uh you know and they're not even counted as employees
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:29.160]  but it still costs a lot of money so if you've been in the military and you're a grunt and then
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:34.200]  you finally go and join halberd and then you get over and send it to these areas where we're still
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:39.320]  fighting we're in seven countries right now and that's what i hope if in a year from now if we're
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:47.240]  in uh a lot less than seven countries then i'm going to say great move on but right now i'm
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.680]  i'm watching carefully because i think it's really really hard to use as an example turning
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:58.680]  around an aircraft carrier it's very very difficult and the momentum of the military industrial complex
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:03.880]  and the influence of goldman sax is so great that it's going to be very very hard sure but he did
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:10.040]  pass hands from tropin sure but he did pass a big test when he de-escalated with russia says we
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:13.880]  shouldn't be massing trips on their border uh because that's totally a legitimate the problem
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:18.280]  is hillary and obama and carry they've been caught in the memos the wiki leaks carry's been
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:23.800]  caught on tape helping create isis out of al-qaeda al-nazara saudi arabia they have a deal with them
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:29.800]  to expand islamic jihad will hobbyism worldwide so i agree with you in your op ed where you said you
[1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:36.200]  know is trump being consistent being anti-war but it's not war if we're cleaning up a mess
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:41.320]  that our own country created with with al-qaeda pouring into europe creating a bigger crisis i
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:46.120]  mean isn't it just to go in there and kick them out of syria or at least let the russians do it
[1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:52.680]  not my not from my viewpoint this is where we can disagree because i say just come home we've
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.240]  created it and being there is just going to escalate and in this whole thing i think and i
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:01.400]  phrase trump when i think he does right and especially with russia why are these people
[1:18:01.400 --> 1:18:06.280]  wanting the neo-consumers to stir up a fight with russia but why do we have to stir up a fight with
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:11.400]  china and say well you built a little island out there and it's a mile long and we're not
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:17.080]  going to let you do this and that's just a threat and i think this protectionism and threatening
[1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:23.800]  china and shifting gears sure uh isn't it you treat them all the same way i i just think that
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.880]  china has been threatened to attack the us sure sure but i mean china's been here's
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:31.480]  thing we have agreements with china and this is the old global order it's falling apart
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:35.160]  but the reason trump's making his point is the old global order the globalist setup was already
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:40.120]  falling apart china had the deal for exclusive rare earth minerals and manufacturing we were
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:45.080]  going to let them dominate that we would dominate military they broke that deal i i disagree as you
[1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:51.000]  do with the whole deal they've had you know since nixon so what do we put in place of that i don't
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.640]  want world order i don't want a world government but how do we not let the normal evil forces
[1:18:55.640 --> 1:19:01.880]  come in then and and take advantage of the chaos let the people that are dealing with that you
[1:19:01.880 --> 1:19:06.680]  know there's a mess over in ukraine and we participated about you know we precipitated it
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.560]  just get out of there and let the local people support this out but this whole idea about china
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:16.920]  and we're in about china attacking and i say they have one they have one aircraft carrier
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:21.880]  you know and we spend so much we spend more money than the next 10 countries together
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:27.560]  and yet we're still you're right in criticizing this preparation for war against russia and
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:32.840]  trump wants to settle that down that's very good but why transfer that's kiss inser's position
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:38.520]  keep the chinese fighting with the the russians and separate the two because we don't want them
[1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:44.600]  to be allies so now our position is is to go after the chinese you know i was in high school
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:50.280]  uh when the chinese uh we're fighting and killing people including one of my teachers
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:56.520]  over to korea and it's so much different now i think we should trade there's never been any
[1:19:56.520 --> 1:20:01.080]  interruption in the south china sea uh with well i agree i don't want war with us sir i don't want
[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:06.200]  war i don't want war with china at all i don't like them i don't like them buying up hollywood
[1:20:06.200 --> 1:20:10.040]  and trying to control what we do here let me bring this up though because it deals with the press
[1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:16.280]  and attacks on freedom there's a big call for uh trump to move to repeal the law that obama signed
[1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:21.960]  federalizing media putting the cia over it uh this truce department at the state department
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:26.120]  there's also all 50 state attorney generals have asked him to not let homeland security
[1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:31.240]  federalize elections you're a constitutionalist you're more of an expert than probably any of us
[1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:36.840]  on this i mean isn't it already super unconstitutional to have the federal government over the media a
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:42.920]  and then be uh what about this whole thing uh where they're calling for the for homeland security
[1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:50.920]  well they've done it to federalize elections yeah and that's why i fear you know that we're
[1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:56.520]  militarizing the department of homeland security i think they and you know darn well what i thought
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:02.360]  of homeland security after 9 11 i voted that adamantly opposed to the department of homeland
[1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:09.480]  security now it's bigger than than ever so uh and the cia uh if you're a strict constitutionalist you
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:15.560]  allow the gathering of intelligence but you don't allow the cloak and dagger stuff where the cia
[1:21:15.560 --> 1:21:20.840]  works works with the special forces and goes around the world and believe me that is going to
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:25.720]  accelerate because we're going to go anywhere every place that there's a suspect not where we've
[1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:31.080]  proven anything but he suspected that he could commit terrorism that we're going to go after him
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:36.840]  i say just get out get out i can tell you you're i mean this is how you create this is how you
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:42.760]  create the hatred toward us is by people have to understand what blowback really is and i'm strong
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:48.360]  believer in blowback there is a reaction and it insights people who are already borderline
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:53.320]  in their thinking so why do that it's like poking at rattlesnakes and jumping into the snake
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:22:00.920]  sure well you and president just just has the un president trump agreed back in 2003 and and i was
[1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:05.080]  anti-war as you know you were coming on at the time uh pointing out why it was wrong to go into
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:10.360]  iraq they'd been our ally previous uh and and they were secular i mean one of the better regimes
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:15.240]  in the area certainly not our business uh so so trump was right about that you were right about
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:21.160]  that his point is we've got to get this saudi arabian expansion under control or it will be an
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:28.200]  ongoing war and cause crisis he wants to actually stamp it out not go in and stir it up he wants to
[1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:33.160]  kick it out of the west and i do think that trump is going to be militaristic and basically no limit
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:39.800]  when it comes to taking out the islamic jihad crush your fingers on that one i'll tell you
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:45.800]  i don't think it has anything to do with national defense i think that has to do with ego and i think
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:51.960]  the sooner we realize that the better off we're we're going to be and we have to understand what
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:59.720]  the what the reason is and saudi arabia i mean there's people even the secretary of state now
[1:22:59.720 --> 1:23:06.440]  is somewhat sympathetic to the saudi's and the saudi's are the ones that we you know deal with
[1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:14.360]  our cai deals with them and they radicalize the muslims to help defeat the soviet system in afghanistan
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:19.720]  and then as time went on they turned on us now i got us to blow back we should stay out of that
[1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:26.440]  yeah there's a we have to to realize that that is very very dangerous there's a lot of problems in
[1:23:26.440 --> 1:23:31.880]  the world and and uh i understand your long-term thinker and i respect that your long-term thinker
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:37.480]  speaking of uh media attacks you have been called basically a russian agent i have been called one
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:42.920]  trump has been called one all these fake revelations have come out none of them are true it's it's
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:49.080]  totally made up and that's how they pass that law to quote try to control us media is because quote
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:54.920]  the russians are so powerful uh they even claim now that drain the swamp and crooked hillary came
[1:23:54.920 --> 1:24:00.600]  from putin with no evidence what do you make of this i mean this is like mccarthy on pcp
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:06.600]  yeah that was the word i was thinking about as you were saying that it's the mccarthyism
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:11.960]  yeah they try to destroy people who come up with a messenger you know uh somebody called in when
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:16.200]  my name was analyst and they were a little bit worried about it my staff said no that's good
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:22.520]  news that's good news we're on the right side you know of them attacking us uh because they
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:26.280]  want to destroy us because they're afraid of the truth you know we're telling the truth
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:31.800]  and they have to close you down by demagoguing and lying about us so uh i think but i think
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:36.040]  there are healthy things right now i think the best thing and trump's done a good job on this is
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:41.320]  is debunking you know so much of the media there's so little trust in the government that's why
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:45.960]  trump won and rightfully so i think seventy eighty percent of the american people don't even believe
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:51.640]  what uh government tells us but they don't believe the major media is anymore so i don't think we
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:56.920]  have to lecture them say oh don't believe what uh you know major media saying they don't believe it
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:02.280]  anyway but we still have a long way to convince people of what the alternatives should be and of
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:08.760]  course uh i try to be as precise as i can and as balanced i can because uh even uh i i know it's
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:14.040]  against the rules if you identify as a republican congressman that if a democrat president does
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:19.960]  something halfway decent uh you compliment on i happen to think it's a great idea that we can
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:25.720]  talk to the cubans and if that is cancelled i think that's a step backwards to the dark ages
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:33.000]  you know uh i was drafted during the cuban missile crisis and uh the longer we sanctioned cubans
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:39.560]  and we pestered them like that the longer castor stayed in power so it's time to get a life well
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:43.800]  no your logic has been your logic going to cuba your logic has been proven right and president
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:47.720]  trump's called you super smart so i hope he'll confer with you and get some of your advice
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:52.200]  get some of your advice on this and the few minutes we've got left i want to speak about
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:58.680]  the nature of the division in this country i went out to the so-called female march against trump
[1:25:58.680 --> 1:26:04.360]  uh on saturday in dc we let them have their march didn't attack them they attacked anybody trying
[1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:08.920]  to go into the trump inauguration the media has been caught lying about the numbers it's it's just
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:15.480]  incredible and i see the division i i was screamed at over 300 times that i was an effing white male
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:22.760]  by mainly white women i i mean the democratic party has been turned so racist and so mind-controlled
[1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:27.960]  i'm really worried about civil insurrection in this country there's a big article out today
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.440]  in new yorker magazine about that that the that the elites are actually leaving the us so i've been
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.960]  positive so far but i just hope that trump can unify the country we can come together as he said
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:42.520]  don't conquer the world you know with military but have america be a shining city on the hill
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:48.600]  that our ideas are what you know basically spreads across the world so do you have concerns
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:55.800]  about soros and others that admit they're trying to fund civil war in america well i think it's
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:00.200]  not so much that people are sitting there and and working on it which i'm sure there are some that
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:06.360]  do that but i think policies that we have designed you know incrementally over the last 100 years
[1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:14.360]  have worked us into this position because it's a failed system just as mesis lectured many many
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:20.840]  years before communism failed he explained why socialism always fails and communism would fail
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:27.240]  and we didn't have to have a fight in a war with him so but the same rules apply to kanesianism
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:35.160]  interventionism federal reserve inflationism militarism it fails all empires end and we're
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:40.440]  the empire and it's going to end it's going to be for economic reasons it's not because the russians
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:44.280]  are coming and it's not going to be because the chinese are coming and the iranians aren't going
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:49.640]  to get us and they're we're going to fail because we're working with a failed system especially in
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:55.480]  this century in the last 17 years it's been a disaster and trump was able to recognize this
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:00.680]  and go to the people who have suffered the most but this is a monetary problem this is a spending
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:06.680]  problem this is a foreign policy problem and that is what's going to bring us down is going to be
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:14.600]  financial and it's going to be associated with horrendous increases in spending and also inflation
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:20.520]  and yet we still have a policy where they deliberately try to do in closing how long
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:25.160]  in closing how long do you think trump has to try to reverse that because we're so far down the
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:29.720]  road i know he's making hundreds of calls a day to get jobs back he does want to cut taxes he also
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:35.480]  wants to cut spending i mean what needs to be done to write the ship well i'll tell you why he has a
[1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:39.800]  short amount of time and i think he's sincerely trying and when he talks about taxes and regulation
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:45.800]  i think he's doing a great job but the whole thing is let's say there are some dire predictions
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:53.320]  that you know in next year say year 18 months we have something arriving worse than 2008 and 2009
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:59.560]  the downturn is is much worse and they'll say ah it's all trumps fault all trumps fault no it
[1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:06.200]  wasn't 08 and 09 wasn't obama's fault it was the fault of the federal reserve it was the fault of
[1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:12.840]  the canesian economic model the spending too much the deficit so unfortunately there's nothing he can
[1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:19.480]  do trump can't do it he can help help you know by by some of these policies but you can't you
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:25.480]  can't avoid the correction the correction is is locked in place because the deficits are there
[1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:30.120]  the mal investment everybody agrees interest rates have been too low too long and that's why he's
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:37.000]  racing the only thing he can do the only thing he can do is allow the recession to come and get
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:42.360]  get it over with liquidate the death politically nobody wants that so you're going to see runaway
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:47.400]  inflation before you see wow country wake up dr ron paul thank you so much we salute you
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:52.920]  ron paul every report dot com thank you sir we're on the march the empire's on the run i'm gonna

[1:29:56.680 --> 1:30:03.320]  paul washington coming up as well thank you dr paul abc has the first one-on-one interview with
[1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:08.520]  president trump and they are taking ownership of what should be public information listing
[1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:13.960]  unprecedented restrictions on the publishing of that information they're mandating on-screen
[1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:19.080]  credits mandating that any excerpts must be introduced by the audio credit they put limits
[1:30:19.080 --> 1:30:24.600]  on how long the excerpts can be they put a time limit on how long material can be used no material
[1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:30.600]  may be used after february the first this is a desperate bid by abc to circumvent freedom of
[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.880]  the press and fair use they're trying to take control of trump's message trying to monopolize
[1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:42.520]  it both to monetize it and to spin it as they wish for political purposes even banning future use
[1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:47.960]  of it extraordinary copyright claims and enforcement were a major problem with the tpp that trump
[1:30:47.960 --> 1:30:52.600]  just shut down and he should shut down this desperate attempt by abc to try to copyright
[1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:59.240]  what the president says in interviews that is not appropriate for info wars dot com i'm david night

[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:51.480]  all watch is about to take over for the balance of the transmission i'm working on some really
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.280]  really big stories and a lot of things we're getting ready to launch uh and so i've got to take care
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:00.280]  of some of that but i will be obviously back tonight on the nightly news and more and back
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:06.280]  tomorrow but it's great to have paul watchen step in he doesn't fill in he steps in and does a great
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:12.680]  job he is a titan now of resistance against the globalist and it's it's so good to see him grow
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:18.120]  and get stronger and stronger i hope to someday soon see a lot of people on the scene that are
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:23.720]  doing a better job than i do because i want to defeat the globalist and i'm here putting out
[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.880]  the information the intelligence the facts that will beat them now this is an addendum to ron paul
[1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:36.520]  that was just on with us he has a very moral view of the world and he does it from a purist
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:44.440]  perspective the problem is there's a globalist program to turn radical islam loose worldwide
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:50.520]  to basically take over the west ally with the left so that we have to adopt speech control or the
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:56.440]  quote muslims will kill us that's the plan go take out the radical islamist's enemies
[1:34:56.440 --> 1:35:03.800]  put them in place let them enter europe enter africa enter asia and take over use them to attack
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:08.280]  russia they have to be dealt with they've been turned loose i've been anti-war because i knew
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:13.000]  it was part of a plan to stir the pot up i could read the white papers written by the project for
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:19.960]  new american century bipartisan neocots i understand their plans so i see paul's perspective and i'm
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:25.320]  not saying he's wrong in his purist position but the globalists are going to go to china and others
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:30.840]  and build them up to go after us and they're going to start provocations unless we're so strong
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:36.760]  there's nothing they can do and they're totally dominated by the sheer will of our economy the
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:42.840]  strength of our defense and the power of our culture and trump's the man to deliver that
[1:35:42.840 --> 1:35:49.240]  and give us the new american millennium not the new american century now that's the plan
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:56.920]  it's moral it's strong it's extremely virile and male and it's total americana
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:06.440]  this is what john wane was an image of john wane wasn't john was a great guy but this this is
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:14.440]  this is the real deal and trump is the real deal you heard paul earlier saying he normally
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:19.640]  doesn't have compliments for people in power he said no he's doing a great job trying to stop
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:24.920]  the country collapsing no he's doing the right thing no he we're in a death spiral we're in
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:32.280]  we're in a meltdown crisis and he doesn't think trump can even save us that's why trump is on the phone
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:41.400]  he doesn't even go on tv and tell you what he's doing like he knows it's something about holding
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:45.560]  back the fact that he's really working so hard and just not even telling you and just letting
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:50.040]  you see the results hundreds of phone calls dozens of meetings a day with business leaders
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:53.800]  saying it's all going to collapse if you don't start hiring people and paying them good and not
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:58.200]  ripping them off globalism is about making people poor and controlling them this is a bunch of bull
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:02.920]  and now it's all going to collapse and then your money's not going to be worth anything even though
[1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:07.640]  you'll have trillions of it because the people are all going to want to kill you and that's why
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:12.680]  all the globalists are running to the hills right now that's in the news today it's up on info wars
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:18.920]  dot com and drudgerport dot com us elites buying new zealand redoubts to escape crack up a civilization
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:23.480]  how long have you heard that now it's in the new yorker magazine now it's in the new york times
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:27.160]  and i'm going to say something right now i have mixed feelings about this and i'm going to ask
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:32.520]  paul watson about this in a moment i hand the baton to him i want to dc bureau so we can have
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:37.800]  whistleblowers on the street stuff cover demonstrations do interviews in our own studios
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:41.800]  i don't so much care about sitting there asking questions of spicer even though that would get
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:46.680]  in fours of the news and get good questions in there i haven't even asked yet for press credentials
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:49.720]  and i know if we ask what we've been told we're going to get them in fact it's even been mentioned
[1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.120]  hey how about paul watson is the white house correspondent little bird said that
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:38:03.080]  little bird anyways so this is a good nickname let me the code name around here for the little bird
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:11.320]  and baby parakeet that's even better a baby parakeet said that so so in this whole twilight
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:15.480]  zone situation we don't need to be in washington to like be big wigs and all this i can't stand it
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.840]  but it's still seeing trump and i know he knows what he's doing he's trying to get the new york
[1:38:20.840 --> 1:38:26.920]  times and abc to stop it but they're owned by globalists that are at war with you sir they're
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:33.720]  not going to quit so he gives the first big exclusive to abc that's out to get him okay maybe
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:39.640]  it's going to be a somewhat fair interview look at cnn spicer keeps going to cnn so they can go
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:45.160]  maybe he didn't even win maybe he's not even president talk about fake news these are the people
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:51.320]  that just a few days ago are still saying that trump had almost no one at israeli
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:58.040]  no one is inauguration total lie or that the bust of martin luther was thrown out the window
[1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:02.920]  i mean i would have said hey you don't get a question you're fake news just like trump did
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:09.480]  follow the bosses lead spicer and i spicer is great okay i know you're a nice guy spicer and i
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:13.080]  think you're doing a good job okay since you've actually been in there i'm impressed i didn't
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:18.920]  like some of the softball stuff earlier but but just stop being so nice to these people you're not
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:24.280]  going to get cnn on your side you're not going to get msnbc on your side do you understand that
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:30.920]  it's crazy so before i go to paul get his take on this and then i eject onto my next mission

[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:13.160]  talk show host and most guys would just have a webmaster some people do regular radio advertising
[1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:17.880]  and i could live in a mansion and have a jet airplane i don't want to live in a mansion or
[1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:23.080]  have a jet airplane okay i'm not saying you're bad if you do the point is that's what the other five
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.640]  or six big rich talk shows there's only a few other peers i've got and my show is bigger than all of
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:31.800]  them now it's just a fact my bragging it's a fact we're the biggest thing there is let me give you
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:38.200]  the newsflash we're getting up there in terrestrial radio 250 plus affiliates and i mean big ones
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:44.840]  and but on the internet total domination but i take the money that we get and that we generate
[1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:48.600]  because we don't get big corporate sponsors we have to direct sell to you and i take it i put it
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:53.000]  back into the fight that mean i don't have a car that runs good made america doesn't mean i don't
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.160]  live in a house you know so i got you know four kids or whatever so they can be comfortable
[1:41:57.160 --> 1:42:03.080]  the point is the three kids the point is it's about myself is that you're investing in the
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:09.960]  absolute annihilation of the globalist and bringing in a new system and you heard paul say i don't
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.120]  think trumps really getting rid of a american influence he's just getting rid of who controls
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:19.480]  it and that's right the truth is this is america america first and trumps really grabbing the whole
[1:42:19.480 --> 1:42:25.080]  power structure we paid for that they hijacked back to america where we really will dominate
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:29.560]  but hopefully through ideas and being good people and then not having to pay for it as he hands it
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:34.200]  back to japan and europe and then they handle their own defense and then they don't start telling us
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.360]  that they're the boss because that's what's happened the globalists are now dictating to us
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:42.840]  they were planning on absorbing us the system we built no no no that's not happening there's
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:47.080]  going to be a new negotiation about this whole thing and that's why they're so upset this is
[1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:53.320]  legendary what's happening it's a counter coup within their coup against us and you heard paul
[1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:56.840]  say he's doing a great job we got to get behind him on this because he's trying to save us on the
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:43:01.000]  economy and that's all that matters is the economy at the end of the day paul said because that's
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.640]  how they control us ron paul is taking a lot of steps towards trump right now that's a big deal
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:14.680]  that shows you how real trump is even though trump drug his sons of the mud but ran started it and i
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:21.720]  love ran last time ran was on he called to be on the show and again people think oh getting one
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:26.360]  of these guys on the show is that big a deal no it's the stories it's the analysis it's it's what
[1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:32.920]  we're doing but going back to paul paul it is irritating though that um i haven't asked for
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:36.120]  another interview with trump last not even just the last time i'm even bringing up last time i'll
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:42.360]  talk to him um but just to see them being nice to cnn nice to abc nice to the new york times
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:47.720]  these guys might write one decent story but then a hundred other lies they just get more worse and
[1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:53.400]  worse so his instinct to call him fake news and ignore him is the way to go not to work with him
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:57.080]  we'll see what happens but drudge is reporting on this abc news thing where they're claiming this
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:02.040]  total copyright well there is no copyright on news if we're analyzing it and covering it so
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:07.720]  they're clearly trying to set up a fight to with new media to claim we can't analyze their propaganda
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:12.600]  well guess what i'm going to call them on that i'll tell them fill their hand we're going to play
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.600]  parts of it and we're going to analyze it and we're going to talk about it so this just gets
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:21.560]  crazier and crazier paul tell me what you think about that and then take over well thanks elix
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.640]  yeah it's the subject that i'm going to hit on today throughout the rest of the uh hour and a
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:31.960]  quarter we've got left which is this phenomenon that keeps happening every single day the fake news
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:39.160]  media lecturing us like where the fake news when they keep coming up with these absolutely insane
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:45.080]  ridiculous things p-gate you know the entire wiki leak scandal where they were exposed as a hillary
[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:52.120]  clinton mouthpiece these uh inauguration crowds the mlk bust they keep getting exposed as being
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:57.640]  fake news over and over again yeah every day lecturing us as if they've got the moral authority
[1:44:57.640 --> 1:45:02.680]  that's right paul take over the moral authority take over paul i'm out of here these um inauguration
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:08.520]  crowds we never really came back to this this kind of disappeared over the last few days in fact
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:14.120]  there's an article which they can put up on screen now it's called the highest quality photograph
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:20.520]  of trumps inauguration yet has been released guess what the crowd looks like and this high quality
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:27.560]  giga pixel image was released by none other than cnn of course after cnn and all these other news
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:33.240]  outlets had banged on for days about how there was virtually nobody at trumps inauguration
[1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:41.480]  showing images from hours before the inauguration even took place deliberately lying to their
[1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:46.520]  viewers yeah every single day we get bashed oh you're fake news you're making this up you made a
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:51.880]  mistake we make mistakes everyone makes mistakes we don't deliberately lie to our audience there
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:57.960]  you see the giggle the giga pixel picture there if you just pause on that one that was the original
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:05.480]  tweet sent out by a reporter got something like 55 000 retweets this was the baitest of the fake
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:12.360]  news story that they all ran with and said look obama's inauguration 2009 on the left and yes
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:18.040]  you would expect obama to get more anyway because most of his voters were in dc to begin with but
[1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:23.880]  then they said oh look on the right this is trumps crowd hardly anyone there and look at that what's
[1:46:23.880 --> 1:46:31.560]  that 55 000 retweets or something that was the foundation for the fake news story and they never
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:38.360]  even corrected themselves i mean shawn spicer had to get up in front of cnn reporters and others
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:45.560]  who were still accusing him of lying when they admittedly lied about this and they were also
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:51.320]  saying oh but surely reagan had more viewers overall if you included everything if you
[1:46:51.320 --> 1:46:56.520]  included television uh people physically in attendance the internet surely reagan had more
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:04.520]  and spicer was like what on earth are you talking about the internet didn't exist in 1981 of course
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:12.680]  donald trump had more viewers of his inauguration than ronald reagan did in 1981 if you include
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:20.520]  television the internet global broadcasts tablets phones everything and yet this fake news reporter
[1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:27.240]  still kept on saying oh but surely ronald reagan ronald reagan got 41 million surely he got more
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:36.440]  it's like no the internet didn't exist in 1981 so again they engage in the most brazen outrageous
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:42.200]  fake news lies over and over again and then they get up every single day and lecture us about being
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:49.640]  fake news and i'll give you another example of that you had a comedian steven spinola who back on
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:57.640]  january 20th sent out a tweet that said quote barron trump looks like a very handsome date
[1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:06.360]  rapist to be that was his joke about a 10 year old kid okay now i'm all for offensive free speech
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  i don't think that's particularly funny but i'm also for taking responsibility for it so of course
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:17.640]  if he sends out a sick joke about a 10 year old kid and i mean let's be honest kid should be completely
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:24.360]  off limits anyway if he sends out a joke about a 10 year old child being a date rapist then he's
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:29.880]  going to get some heat right but not only that he follows it up with this tweet he said i don't want
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:37.160]  my mom to get raped but if she does i hope it's by barron trump small pp would be painless and we'd
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:45.000]  win lots of money in court okay this is a left-wing comedian he followed that up oh he went further by
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:52.520]  basically ridiculing terry shavo who was a brain damaged woman who died she had a feeding tube
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:59.320]  removed about what was it 12 years ago now so not enough to ridicule a 10 year old boy and say he's
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:05.640]  a date rapist to be no let's also ridicule a brain damaged woman that died 12 years ago
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:12.600]  that's how classy the left is but okay it's free speech it's offensive whatever i'm for
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:19.800]  offensive free speech okay but then business insider after i wrote an article on this three days after
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:26.440]  he had tweeted it out and it had already been circulating on the internet this business insider
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:32.520]  individual called oliver darsi came out with this article inaccurate info wars report leads to 100
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:40.280]  thousand to sign petition for comedy central to fire comedian it doesn't employ okay so the bigger
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:48.200]  problem was not a comedian calling a 10 year old child a date rapist to be saying that this child
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:54.280]  raped his mother saying that a brain damaged woman take ridiculing a brain damaged woman who died
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:50:03.320]  12 years ago now that's all okay i'm bad because i used the word comedy central writer rather than
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:12.600]  comedy central contributor in his own bio spinola said he was a comedy central contributor so obviously
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:18.600]  if you contribute something then you're writing it it's comedy so again the biggest scandal is me
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:23.720]  for saying that he was a comedy central writer when i should have said he was a comedy central
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:31.640]  contributor i'm bad but he's the victim the guy who joked about a child raping somebody
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:39.640]  he's the victim he got mean tweets because of it well boo who again this is business insider
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:46.760]  a news outlet that was exposed in the wiki leaks as being a mouthpiece for hillary clinton
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:51.880]  and they're lecturing me about fake news we'll be back after the break to talk more about it
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:51:03.320]  on the alex jones show live don't go away hello again my name is gary clark i'm the actor who's

[1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:29.160]  so a left-wing comedian stevens been all jokes about a 10 year old boy being a future rapist
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:35.080]  jokes about him raping his mother jokes about a brain damaged woman who died 12 years ago
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:41.320]  but i'm the bad guy because i use the word writer rather than contributor that's what they're
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:47.480]  actually saying in this article again it's the fake news media lecturing us about journalistic
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:54.520]  integrity when they come up with the most flagrant damaging lies on a regular basis i read out the
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:55:00.600]  tweets before the break again this is what he got in hot water for and yes i support his right
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:05.400]  to tell these jokes i don't want to see him censored if somebody wants to hire him that's
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:12.360]  completely their decision but newsflash if you say controversial shocking things on the internet
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:20.040]  you get blowback so again this comedian spinola was out within hours whining about violent threats
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:26.120]  towards him on twitter well join the club steven it's called being a public figure he probably
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:31.000]  didn't know about that before because he probably had like a pathetic amount of twitter followers
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:37.080]  but if you say contentious things on the internet you will get idiot extremists on both the left
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:44.200]  and the right sending you violent threats i post them every single day i get them myself every
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:49.400]  single day but again there's always this narrative and it arose out of gamergate originally that the
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:57.880]  only people who get death threats are left wingers well no actually the right denounces its fringe
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:03.720]  violent extremists the left doesn't that's the problem that's why we had all these riots over
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:08.680]  the weekend that's why people are being spat on punched that's why people's hair is being set
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:15.320]  on fire because you don't denounce your left wing violent fringe extremists you legitimize it
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:20.280]  so basically this comedian was out whining within hours that he was getting all these threats
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:27.160]  business insider comes out with this article blaming me for a hundred thousand people signing
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:34.520]  a petition even though i wrote about the tweets three days after he made them after other news
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:40.760]  outlets had already picked up on the story after these tweets had circulated on forums but no i'm
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:47.480]  bad because i used the word writer rather than contributor when i wrote this headline i'm bad
[1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:54.120]  i'm the bad guy the guy who talked about a 10 year old boy being a future rapist he's the victim
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:57:00.600]  okay great and this guy this oliver dorsy actually contacted me on twitter afterwards
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.320]  after i called him out because they think they can just attack you publicly and you're just gonna
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:11.400]  lie back and take it and not saying anything about it well i do and when you actually confront people
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:16.040]  on twitter they just panic and freak out because people are disagreeing with them and they're
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:22.280]  getting some hate yeah join the club it's called being a public figure so he contacts me on twitter
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.800]  and he's like oh i don't want to engage with you on twitter i'm not a leftist blah blah blah and
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:34.040]  it's like if you don't want to engage with me on twitter don't tweet at me don't write stories about
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:43.160]  my headlines where god forbid i get a word wrong this was his tweet the truth matters facts matter
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:49.720]  maybe not to you but these things do matter really they didn't seem to matter too much when your own
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:55.560]  business insider journalists were whoring themselves out for hillary clinton did they
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:58:01.240]  and i posted the articles up there today here's one wiki leaks former business insider writer
[1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:07.800]  collin cambell acted as a clinton propagandist so you've got this business insider editor lecturing
[1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:14.520]  me about journalistic integrity when one of his own writers and others were exposed in the wiki
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:22.840]  leaks emails as being actual mouthpiece prostitutes for hillary clinton yet they have the nerve to
[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:28.920]  lecture me about fake news and when you confront them about it on twitter they completely freak out
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:33.080]  and say oh i don't want to have discussion with you but we're going to have that discussion
[1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:37.640]  and you're gonna be exposed we'll be back on the alex joneshow live don't go away

[1:59:59.160 --> 2:00:09.160]  you
[2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:19.160]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex joneshow
[2:00:19.160 --> 2:00:28.440]  the third and final hour of the alex joneshow actually we've got the fourth hour coming up
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:33.480]  later but for the moment we're going to stick with this issue so basically the left is now
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:39.720]  whining about this outrage culture that they created and they perfected and whenever any
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:47.560]  of them get any heat whatsoever for their stupid tweets they play the victim card oh look people
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:52.440]  are saying mean things about me people are violently threatening me yeah join the club
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:59.960]  how is this still a thing anymore yeah even today we have it in the bbc this is an article
[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:05.400]  where the woman who brought the court case which has delayed brexit jena miller the headline is
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:11.000]  man held over threats and jena miller brexit case bbc news the man has been arrested over alleged
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:15.560]  threats made against jena miller the woman behind the brexit legal challenge so it talks about people
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:21.160]  who have been arrested because they threatened her on twitter others have been told to stop tweeting
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:28.920]  basically because they made violent threats yes anyone who is even vaguely a public figure gets
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:35.480]  violent threats mean after i made a video about the riots in milwaukee literally overnight there
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:41.240]  were 50 death threats from black lives matter activists but cnn says it's peaceful so i guess
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:46.680]  you should believe them everybody gets death threats everybody gets violent threats i just
[2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:52.440]  looked in my inbox and there were another dozen just over the past few hours people wishing death
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:59.160]  upon me yeah big deal put your big boy pants on and grow up and just accept that that's a form
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:04.920]  that's a consequence of saying contentious things on the internet whether they're jokes or whether
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:10.680]  they're political opinions and yes you have the right to make nasty obscene offensive jokes i'm
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:15.960]  not going to call for you to be censored i'm not going to call for you to be fired but it's just
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:21.720]  kind of ironic how now i'm being blamed for outrage culture which the left created and
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:27.640]  perfected in the first place and then they get to pretend like they've got the moral high ground
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:33.880]  because i used the word writer instead of contributor when they're literally defending a guy who's
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:40.360]  making jokes about a 10 year old kid being a rapist but i'm the bad guy he's the victim okay
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:48.440]  let's move on the Daily Mail reports but is it art angry man Shia LaBeouf rents camera as he partake
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:55.000]  partakes in his anti-Donald Trump project in new york city now we could be kind about Shia LaBeouf
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:01.080]  i could say that he's had some interesting art projects in the past which deal with the ludicrousness
[2:03:01.080 --> 2:03:07.480]  of celebrity or we could be not so nice about him and say he's a narcissistic has been a
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:13.720]  tension whore who made one decent movie 10 years ago and now seems to be preoccupied with having
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:20.280]  drunk and meltdowns and being arrested and trying to look like shea guavara trying to look authentic
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:25.080]  by dressing like a homeless person when he's actually a multimillionaire we could be not so
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:31.320]  nice and say those things about him but this latest art project is really interesting because
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:38.360]  it's basically turned into a homing beacon for cult members for anti-trump hysterical cult members
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:45.240]  it's basically a camera and a microphone in new york city with the words he will not divide us
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:51.160]  above it and it's a live stream and people are invited to go there and share their opinions
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:58.360]  meanwhile you have basically cult members chanting over and over again he will not divide us
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:03.960]  he will not divide us it sounds like a re-invention of the older occupy wall street
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:08.760]  mic check thing which even people on the left thought was very creepy and cult-like
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:14.680]  and now it's happening again with this shia labouf project so as you see in the video here
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:21.240]  he's basically being trolled by neo-nazis you hear him shouting screaming in this guy's face
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:29.400]  now yes this guy is a neo-nazis he's a bad guy i don't agree with neo-nazis i don't support their
[2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:37.400]  opinions but look at the behavior of shia labouf this is a guy who wants everybody to be united
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:44.360]  and for division not to be happening and he's the guy angrily shouting in this individual's face
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:49.320]  while of course he's protected by like three massive security guards he's fronting up to a five
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:53.960]  foot weakling we'll be back to talk about it on the Alex Jones show live breaking news info
[2:04:53.960 --> 2:05:04.040]  walls dot com don't go away abc has the first one-on-one interview with president trump
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:09.320]  and they are taking ownership of what should be public information listing unprecedented
[2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:15.080]  restrictions on the publishing of that information they're mandating on-screen credits mandating that
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:20.200]  any excerpts must be introduced with an audio credit they put limits on how long the excerpts
[2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:25.960]  can be they put a time limit on how long material can be used no material may be used after february
[2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:32.520]  the first this is a desperate bid by abc to circumvent freedom of the press and fair use
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:37.480]  they're trying to take control of trump's message trying to monopolize it both to monetize it
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:43.560]  and to spend it as they wish for political purposes even banning future use of it extraordinary
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:48.600]  copyright claims and enforcement were a major problem with the tpp that trump just shut down
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:53.800]  and he should shut down this desperate attempt by abc to try to copyright what the president says
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:06:02.040]  in interviews that is not appropriate for info wars dot com i'm david night this is alex jones i

[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:27.400]  so let's talk about shayla buff and his new art project which um you know he's basically a narcissistic
[2:08:27.400 --> 2:08:32.440]  attention whore at this point so the modern art world will love him he's got a camera up there
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:37.960]  he's got a microphone people chanting he will not divide us he will not divide us like cult members
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:44.760]  he's um being very aggressive to anyone who tries to troll that he's getting in their face screaming
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.720]  at them of course there are five-foot weaklings he's got three security guards behind him he's
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:57.240]  very tough and yes they're neo-nazis and we don't agree with neo-nazis but we also don't agree with
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:02.840]  getting violent towards people with whom we disagree politically and that's the point here
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:08.120]  which is why we're going to talk about richard spencer now richard spence is somebody who you
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:14.440]  know i had mike cernovich on here a few months ago now and we did a whole hour almost talking about
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:21.400]  richard spencer talking about how we disavow info wars how cernovich disavows himself from
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:27.720]  richard spencer from his audience because they got up right after trump won the election they
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:34.040]  invited the mainstream media vipers into the den they had a little conference with neo-nazis and
[2:09:34.040 --> 2:09:40.360]  they all got up and did the c kyle while richard spencer was saying kyle trump now you can call
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:45.400]  this guy whatever you like you can call him a neo-nazi white supremacist a night enteritarian
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:52.520]  yes i don't agree with him i've had arguments and blazing rouse with him this is not somebody
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:10:00.040]  who i support but it's also not somebody who i'm gonna violently attack because newsflash you can't
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:05.880]  violently attack people on the street just because you disagree with them politically and what we've
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:12.120]  seen when you can roll the video of richard spencer being punched at the uh inauguration riots what
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:19.880]  we've seen is the legitimization of anti-trump hysteria by the mainstream media the legitimization
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:25.800]  of violence against people just because you disagree with them politically again it doesn't
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:33.000]  matter if he's a neo-nazi doesn't matter if you think he's a neo-nazi here's another newsflash okay
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:40.840]  the far left thinks everyone and anyone who disagrees with them is a neo-nazi so you're giving them
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:47.640]  carte blanche to go and punch anyone they like on the street of course they don't like it the other
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:54.040]  way around we saw gabin mckinnis getting a fight with an antifa fascists they're the actual fascists
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:59.080]  they attack people they smash up property they intimidate people out of expressing their opinions
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:04.840]  like the nazis did they're the actual fascists but you saw gabin mckinnis getting a fight with one
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:11.000]  of them you saw another guy who tried to run through a roadblock that was set up by these
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:17.720]  antifa little commie fascists here you see the gabin mckinnis fight he gets in a fist fight almost
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:23.320]  with this individual and many people said to be fair that gabin was the aggressor you have another
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:28.360]  video which i think you've got which is a guy at a checkpoint again at the anti-trump hysterical
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:34.760]  frothing temper tantrum there's a group of antifa activists he tries to barrel through them because
[2:11:34.760 --> 2:11:40.680]  they're stopping him from going where he wants to go here you see the clip and this guy you see him
[2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:45.880]  there he starts to attack them just before that and just after it there you see he starts to try
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:50.760]  and punch one of them and in fact does punch one of them so if you're making the argument
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:56.040]  that it's acceptable to violently attack people because you disagree with them politically
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:02.360]  then you can have no complaints about that okay but what we've seen with this richard spencer incident
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:09.720]  over the last few days is not just the far left but the mainstream media getting on board creating
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:17.240]  this narrative that it's okay to meter out violence in advance of a political objective now
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:23.480]  now you look up the word terrorism what's the definition of the word terrorism well it's the
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:28.680]  unlawful use of violence and intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:36.440]  political aims and doesn't that sound familiar we have the mainstream media actually legitimizing
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:43.480]  terrorism with these violent attacks against so-called alt writers and anyone who they disagree
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:49.000]  with again doesn't matter if he's a Nazi okay i've had arguments with him on twitter i don't
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:55.720]  support him doesn't matter do i have the right to go around punching communists in the face on the
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:13:02.360]  street because i'm offended by them no yet they advocate a belief system that was responsible
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:09.320]  for the deaths of tens of millions more people than fascism even if this guy's a fascist he says
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:14.520]  he's not a neo-nazi even if you think he is does that make it okay for me to violently attack
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:20.440]  communists because they have hammer and sickles because they have mail posters up on their walls
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:25.880]  which the culture has made trendy yeah what was it 200 million people dead because of
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:33.160]  communism alone that's trendy that's acceptable but god forbid you support donald trump you're
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:38.520]  a Nazi and we're going to punch you in the face listen to this article this is out of the nation
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:44.280]  okay this is not antifa this is out of the nation neo-nazi richard spencer got punched
[2:13:44.280 --> 2:13:51.560]  you can thank the black bloc and it's by this writer natasha lenard who says that the punch
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:58.120]  lends itself perfectly to a beat and goes on to basically romanticize the fact that he was
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:06.200]  punched in the face again advocating violence in pursuit of a political goal that is terrorism
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:15.240]  it doesn't matter if he's a nazi or if you think he's a nazi okay you're on the same page all of
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:22.120]  you leftists who are out there advocating violence to shut down free speech you are on the same page
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:30.680]  as the charlie hebdo jihadists who went into that cartoone newsroom massacred those people in paris
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:35.960]  because they were offended by their political opinion you're on the same page as them that's
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:44.840]  great company to keep isn't it yet this narrative will not end they think it's legitimate to violently
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:52.520]  attack someone because he's a nazi again the far left thinks everyone's a nazi where is this going
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:15:00.040]  to lead the free speech that you have is dependent on your worst enemies having those free speech
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:06.280]  rights okay if neo nazis don't have their free speech you don't have yours that's how it works
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:14.120]  it's all or nothing that's how it works and so is richard spencer literally adolf hitler
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:20.520]  is he is he leading a panzer division of invasion tanks that are going to mow people down no
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:26.840]  yes if you're in an actual war with nazis then you can kill nazis last time i checked we weren't
[2:15:26.840 --> 2:15:34.760]  in world war two okay you can't attack people because they disagree with you politically
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:42.280]  you set the precedents for absolute carnage and civil war you idiots but i keep hearing this on
[2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:49.240]  twitter every single day and it's mainly from the people who support antifa you know the so-called
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:56.200]  anti fascists who behave like actual fascists you know the mom's basement dwelling thugs most of
[2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:01.880]  whom never worked a day in their life they're what happens when teen brats are never told no
[2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:07.960]  by their parents they're the actual fascists they're the actual brown shirts they're the people who
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:15.800]  plan acid attacks on trump supporters at the deplorable they're the people who plan neck
[2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:23.000]  conscious on people attend attending the deplorable as was exposed by james o keith they're the people
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:29.400]  who like to get in people's faces and assault them we saw them assault the other trump supporter
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:35.880]  the night before trump was inaugurated snatched his hat off him when he tried to retrieve with
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:42.120]  retrieve the hat punched in the face whacked with the flagpole that's the tolerant left for you
[2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:50.360]  and again they say oh violence against fascism is is justified otherwise we're enabling it absolute
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:58.520]  bonkham bs i can't go around punching communists in the face i wouldn't want to because i still
[2:16:58.520 --> 2:17:04.920]  even though everything they stand for is absolutely vile i still support their right to free speech
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:11.960]  the same free speech that protects my free speech is if it doesn't apply to them it doesn't apply
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:17.560]  to anyone so again you've got these antifa scumbags defending it they like to get in people's
[2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:22.840]  faces they like to assault people yet they cower in fear whenever you stick a camera in their
[2:17:22.840 --> 2:17:28.920]  face because they don't like to be identified which is why they wear the black masks now it's
[2:17:28.920 --> 2:17:34.760]  interesting in regard to this spencer incident where richard spencer was punched in the face
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:40.360]  this guy probably doesn't want to be identified because it after it actually emerged in the
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:46.120]  aftermath and if you've got children listening just turn the volume down right now because this
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:51.320]  is disgusting but it has to be said it emerged in the aftermath that this guy who punched richard
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:59.800]  spencer was literally a cuckold sex slave who likes to be led around on a chain and wait for it
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:07.320]  likes to pay women to poop on him yeah they actually uncovered the identity of this tough guy
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:13.960]  who cold-clocked richard spencer in the face from the side that's what he does in his spare time
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:19.960]  that that's your moral high ground right there antifa a guy who's literally a cuckold is led
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:26.600]  around on chain like a dog and pays women to poop on him now i'm sorry to have to say that it's
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:33.720]  absolutely disgusting but that's the truth that's what these antifa guys are into you know this
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:39.720]  is an organization that gets infiltrated by the cops at every single major protest because they're
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:47.240]  incredibly stupid and naive this is the organization whose stupid violent aggressive behavior you know
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:51.880]  they went to war with trash cans again like what what have trash cans done to offend them
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:57.800]  it's their behavior that leads to the cops attacking and pepper spraying innocent people
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:03.640]  you had all these journalists who were arrested during the inauguration because they were merely
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:10.920]  in the same vicinity as these idiots they see them bravely taking on the trash cans so you have
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:16.360]  their behavior responsible for the cops overreacting that's why the cops used to infiltrate them they
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:22.280]  probably still do because they could use them as the excuse to have an overreaction and to shut down
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:29.480]  all the the legitimate protests i mean alex jones exposed that way back in 99 with the wto in
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:36.120]  seattle completely infiltrated by the police because it's a problem reaction solution scenario
[2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:42.040]  if they can infiltrate them they can divert them they can include legitimate protesters
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:47.480]  in this same group of people they can kettle them in pepper spray them arrest them and it's innocent
[2:19:47.480 --> 2:19:54.520]  people who suffer because of the aggressive barbarous actions of antifa they are scum

[2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:22.520]  this assault on richard spencer who again is the guy who i've argued with don't agree with on basically
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:28.360]  anything but i defend his right to free speech because if he doesn't have a right to free speech
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:33.960]  then neither does anyone when are you going to get that through your thick heads so we have the
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:40.600]  antifa anarchists who actually act like brown shirt fascists you know that they're smashing
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:47.640]  starbucks windows one week next week they're in starbucks sipping on a chai latte whining about
[2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:55.720]  capitalism and the system man complete parody of itself completely ludicrous movement that just
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:01.560]  turns up once every year to smash a few starbucks windows never achieves anything whatsoever
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:07.560]  apart from making themselves look incredibly stupid there you see a clip from a video of a
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:13.880]  woman ranting at a starbucks barista about left-wing issues i reckon that's fake i saw that last
[2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:19.240]  night it looks like a really good troll um but maybe we'll play that some other point so you've
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:27.080]  got the um leftist basically advocating violence to shut down free speech which makes them terrorists
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.280]  that's the very definition of the the word of the word terrorists they're on the same page
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:39.640]  as the charlie hebdo g hadis who stormed into a cartoon newsroom and massacred a bunch of people
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.880]  while chanting a la akbar oh that's what the feminists in germany were chanting yesterday
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:49.480]  wasn't it we're going to get to that clip in a minute so we've got this environment being created
[2:25:49.480 --> 2:25:55.640]  that it's acceptable to violently attack people if you disagree with them politically again
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:26:03.560]  the fact that they're a neo-nazi doesn't matter that doesn't matter when are you going to get
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:09.880]  that through your thick skulls if they don't have free speech nobody has free speech this idea that
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:15.320]  you can just attack people if you disagree with them if they offend you this is what it leads to
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:21.400]  and this is on you this is on all you leftists on twitter on social media who were celebrating
[2:26:21.400 --> 2:26:28.040]  romanticizing violence against people at the inauguration this is up on info wars dot com
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:35.320]  and we can roll the video leftist thugs viciously attack woman for wearing spanish flag video footage
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:40.440]  shows leftists in spain viciously attacking a woman in the street because she was wearing a bracelet
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:48.520]  that displayed the country's national flag now they've arrested six of these individuals one of them
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:56.040]  is a leftist politician who is a local elections candidate for the united left party in mercia
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:04.360]  spain this is what happens when you legitimize assaulting people for their political beliefs
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:10.840]  do you get it in fact a comedian in spain or in fact he was an actor came out and said that
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:16.840]  this girl who was brutally assaulted as she lay defenseless on the floor in the middle of the night
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:23.800]  she deserved it because she was quote human garbage again the classy left strikes again
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:32.120]  the tolerant left strikes again all of you people who celebrated richard spencer being punched
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:39.160]  the beating the brutal assault of this young girl in spain by these leftist thugs that is on
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:45.960]  you and you don't have the right to an opinion anymore if somebody comes up and punches you in
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:51.080]  the face because this is the environment that you called for so you're going to get it back
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:58.280]  in spades good luck with that i will continue to voice my opinions and my free speech without
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:05.080]  having to resort to using my fists because that's what we do in an actual tolerant liberal civil
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:11.880]  society okay get it i have to keep saying this every single day now i'm going to move on from that
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:19.400]  though we have got lots more news to cover but on a similar subject this is also up on info wars.com
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:26.920]  german newspaper publisher says or jokes it's just a joke murder trump to get him out of office
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:33.080]  this is the newspaper editor and publisher of i think it's desi it's a weekly german newspaper
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:38.840]  who went on german television and joked about getting donald trump out of office not through
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:47.320]  impeachment but by somebody in the white house murdering him this is not some far left and
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:54.040]  teeth are radical this is a major newspaper publisher there in germany getting up on a
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:29:00.840]  live panel discussion show and joking about trump's assassination now bear in mind that there is a
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:11.000]  comedian in germany jan bowerman who insulted erdogan the turkish dictator and faces what is it five
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:17.960]  years in jail for insulting a foreign head of state because that's the law in germany if you're nasty
[2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:22.760]  if you say something mean to a foreign head of state if you make fun of them you face five years
[2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:31.080]  in jail will joseph joffey the newspaper publisher who said donald trump should be murdered is he
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:38.280]  gonna face five years in jail i very much doubt it because the left's own rules don't apply to them

[2:30:13.160 --> 2:30:19.240]  that the new administration is lying and i think that what has happened is that there's this
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:25.000]  predisposition in the media to especially with this president and i think this idea that we're
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  immediately lying because where are their facts because i got called a liar for something that i

[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:39.400]  now going back to the article we were covering before the break so you have this german newspaper
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:46.280]  editor and publisher josif jofi who is also apparently somebody told me a bilderberg member
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:50.040]  haven't had a chance to check that but he's definitely high up in germany he's an elitist
[2:35:50.040 --> 2:35:56.120]  getting up on this news panel show basically saying that trump should be murdered to get him
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:01.880]  out of office but it was a joke that's acceptable imagine if you know pat bucanon had got up or
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:07.080]  someone like that on fox news and said that obama should be murdered to get him out of office do
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:11.560]  you think the reaction would have been somewhat different you know this guy who had the five
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:17.720]  year prison sentence hanging over his head for insulting erdogan in turkey an actual dictator
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:24.760]  that was thankfully dropped will anything will this guy have any retribution whatsoever or will
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:30.920]  this be allowed to slide it's kind of funny you know because while this is happening in germany
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:36.760]  we have the german government setting up a ministry of truth this is out of gate stone
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:43.080]  institute as reported by der spiegel the federal interior ministry intends to set up a defense
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:50.120]  center against disinformation in the fight against fake news on social networks and it's basically
[2:36:50.680 --> 2:36:56.600]  the same name as the name of nazi the nazi's military intelligence agency it's apparently
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:37:02.040]  meant to demonstrate the government's seriousness regarding the matter quote it sounds like the
[2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:07.960]  ministry of truth from georgia walls dystopian novel 1984 wrote the left leaning daily frank
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:13.720]  furter runshow frank uberall national head of the german association of journalists bluntly
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:20.040]  stated this smells like censorship so what are they going to censor well they're going to censor
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:26.680]  anything that's quote populist the restriction applies to criticism of the government especially
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:33.800]  regarding immigration and energy policies of the e you and of course of islam so if you dare
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:41.240]  criticize the unelected european union if you dare criticize mass immigration or islam
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:47.400]  then you may become a victim of the ministry of truth and you can read the federal agency
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:53.400]  for political education their definition of what they're going to censor is anything quote
[2:37:53.400 --> 2:38:02.120]  anti-elitism anti-intellectualism anti-politics and hostility towards institutions in other words
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:08.040]  criticism of the government so you can in germany you can make a joke about assassinating trump on
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:14.360]  live television but don't you dare criticize the e you or mass immigration because they're
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:20.920]  going to come after you the ministry of truth the x stars the officials working with angela
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:28.760]  merkel working with mark zockerberg and facebook to clamp down on dissent but germany's a liberal
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:34.680]  tolerant country now on the subject of liberal tolerance we're going to go to this video now
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:44.840]  again out of germany which shows feminists and anti-trump march chanting a la akbar and my
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:50.200]  commentary on that let's go to this clip that awkward moment when self-proclaimed feminists in
[2:38:50.200 --> 2:39:06.120]  germany embrace the most patriarchal misogynistic anti-woman belief system on the planet
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:21.080]  which progressive pro-women facet of islam do you think they were championing honor killings
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:26.600]  female rape victims being stoned to death mass sexual assaults forced marriages of children
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:32.760]  a prophet who had female sex slaves and raped a nine-year-old girl female genital mutilation
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  so progressive so liberal how about parents acid attacking their own daughter because
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:46.280]  she looked at a boy a mother and father in adjoining cells accused of dousing their teenage
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:54.120]  daughter annusia in acid her crime looking at a boy and isn't it ironic that they carried
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:59.720]  signs complaining about their pussies being grabbed when that's exactly what muslim migrants
[2:39:59.720 --> 2:40:05.560]  have been doing en masse throughout germany so they hate trump because he said the words grab her
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:11.960]  by the pussy 12 years ago but they want to embrace a culture that justifies literally grabbing women
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:25.000]  by the pussy a culture that gave us something literally called the rape game but should we
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:30.840]  be surprised given that the feminist response to the mass molestation of women in cologne by muslim
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:37.240]  migrants was to visit the local refugee center and give roses to the migrants should we be surprised
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:43.560]  given that they're bombarded with government tv ads telling them enjoy difference start tolerance
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:49.880]  trump helmethelbia granted that's a fair point because trump is executing gay people oh no wait
[2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:54.920]  that's what islamic countries do under sharia law oh yeah and talking of sharia law who was one of
[2:40:54.920 --> 2:41:01.240]  the main organizers behind the women's march in dc lisa sansor a muslim activist who advocates
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:07.160]  for sharia law a doctrine that completely disenfranchises women sharia law versus women's
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:13.080]  rights yeah pick one because you can't have both some of the attendees at the women's march in dc
[2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:18.120]  wore hijabs probably not for the same reason that muslim women in the middle east wear hijabs
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.840]  which is so they don't get beaten and raped but let's just keep on pretending that the hijab
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:28.840]  isn't an international symbol for the oppression of women okay island does not silence me it empowers
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:34.760]  me yeah try and protest for women's rights in saudi arabia and see how empowered you feel
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:39.560]  good luck oh yeah and the only people who marched on the saudi embassy you know in islamic
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:45.720]  theocracy that actually oppressors women were trump supporters well imagine my shock this is
[2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:52.360]  what i've warned about for years the left is now openly making an alliance with islamists and islamism
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:57.880]  and it kind of makes sense because both islamists and the far left broadly share the same goal
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:04.200]  the complete destruction of western civilization oh don't take my word for it read isis's own
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:10.040]  manifesto where they talk about recruiting left-wing activists because they're on the same page look at
[2:42:10.040 --> 2:42:15.640]  how far left rioters try to intimidate trump supporters by showing them isis flags and beheading
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:23.320]  videos listen to the rhetoric at the women's march madonna wanting to blow up the white house yes i
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:30.280]  have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house leftists all over twitter celebrating
[2:42:30.280 --> 2:42:35.240]  and advocating violent attacks on people with whom they disagree politically violent attacks to
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:43.080]  advance a political objective now what word could we possibly use to describe that hmm i wonder
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:48.040]  yeah but he's a nazi why are you defending a nazi yeah that's got nothing to do with it the far
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:54.920]  left literally labels anyone who disagrees with them as a nazi you can't go around punching people
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:43:00.280]  in the street because you claim they're a nazi whether they're actually a nazi or not violently
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:05.400]  attacking people in the street to intimidate them out of expressing their political beliefs now where
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:11.720]  have i seen that before oh that's right in nazi germany yeah let's be like them great idea so the
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:17.640]  left is embracing islamism the most intolerant belief system on earth they're embracing intimidation
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:23.640]  they're embracing violence they're embracing completely deranged frothing hysterical behavior
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:40.280]  while chanting love trumps hate and banging on about how peaceful and tolerant they are
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:46.680]  while the leftist media legitimizes all this violence and hatred by refusing to denounce it
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:52.840]  and labeling it as just another form of protest you're witnessing the submission and capitulation
[2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:59.880]  of the west but it can only take place with the willing complicity of the left who have now brazenly
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:15.800]  decided to make an alliance with the most regressive belief system ever devised
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:26.440]  today it's called left and islam the unholy alliance that is up on the prison planet live
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:32.600]  youtube channel get it share it on that same subject of course we told you about linda sarsour
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:39.240]  one of the main organizers of the george soros funded women's march which had nothing whatsoever
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:46.200]  to do with women it was a another hysterical anti-trump demonstration but they said oh
[2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:50.600]  this is a women's march how could you possibly oppose a women's march you must hate women
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:58.760]  well now it was a far left anti-trump march funded by george soros organized by a woman
[2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:07.800]  who literally supports sharia law which completely disenfranchises women okay this is the doctrine
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:14.120]  this is the legal doctrine under which it takes three female witnesses just to match one male
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:20.520]  witness in court basically women are treated as second-class citizens under sharia law this is
[2:45:20.520 --> 2:45:27.960]  the foundation of the system that leads to women being stoned to death that leads to women having
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:35.240]  their genitals mutilated that leads to honor killings that leads to forced marriages yeah that
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:40.840]  doesn't sound like something that meshes with women's rights to me but this is the individual
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:46.440]  who was one of the organizers behind that linda sarsour somebody who also supports a terrorist
[2:45:46.440 --> 2:45:53.000]  group her mass somebody who also gives the isis one finger salute this is your big women's rights
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:59.720]  champion okay so she was criticized for those beliefs and then the southern poverty law center
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:06.840]  which is another hate group claims to track hate groups actually is one paints targets on people's
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:13.240]  backs so then they can be targeted for hate they came out and said that anyone who basically
[2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:22.040]  criticizes linda sarsour is engaging in islamophobia so now it's islamophobic to criticize sharia law
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:30.920]  they labeled ayan hersey ali and majeed nawaz who are muslim reformers or at least x muslim
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:38.360]  reformers they labeled them as anti islamic extremists they put them on lists with hope
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:43.880]  not hate saying that they were anti islamic extremists bearing in mind this is somebody
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:54.120]  in ayan hersey ali whose colleague was murdered on the streets of amsterdam by an islamic jihadist
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:47:02.440]  who pinned a note on his victim saying that ayan hersey ali would be next so you have the southern
[2:47:02.440 --> 2:47:09.880]  poverty law center these left-wing hope not hate groups actually conspiring with islamic jihadists
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:16.680]  to paint targets on the back of people who simply say that islam is a seventh century religion
[2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:23.560]  and is in need of reform these are the people who support linda sarsour this is out of the daily
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:30.040]  wire the southern law poverty center is a joke and this proves it the southern poverty law center
[2:47:30.040 --> 2:47:36.040]  as daily wires aaron bandler wrote in his article is a leftist hack advocacy group which picks and
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:41.640]  chooses what standards to apply to its labels consistently turning a blind eye to leftist
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:46.760]  and pro-democrat groups and individuals while targeting often unfairly their enemies on the
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:53.640]  right over the past few days splc continued to protect hard left and islamist radicals in the name
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:59.560]  of the progressive cause by joining the chorus of left-wing organizations and leftist commentators
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:08.040]  in rushing to support linda sarsour and this was their tweet splc islamophobes have been intact
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:13.560]  attacking women's march organizer linda sarsour we stand with her against this type of hate and
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:20.200]  bigotry so this is the group that literally paints targets on the back of people who have been
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:26.040]  targeted for assassination by islamic jihadists and they're saying that they stand against hate
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:33.000]  and bigotry okay sticking to its modus operandi splc labels anyone who questions sarsour's islamist
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:38.040]  and regressive tendencies as islamophobes again because they don't have an actual argument they
[2:48:38.040 --> 2:48:43.080]  just slap a word on it while committing themselves to combating hate and bigotry this begs the
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:48.520]  question of when splc will condemn some of sarsour's own commentary and you can see in this article
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:55.800]  they use her own tweets where she supports sharia law a doctrine that treats women little better
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:49:02.600]  than formula animals and treats them as second-class citizens this is the organizer behind the women's
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:09.880]  march what splc does not want to address is that sharia law permits husbands beating their wives
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:16.600]  oh yes that's progressive now executing gay people that's also liberal again you had the
[2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:22.520]  anti-trump hysterical people out there saying that trump would strip away gay people's rights lock
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:28.040]  them up they didn't march on Saudi arabian embassy did they which actually kills gay people no that
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:33.000]  would be racist and other despicable things that would never be tolerated in western civilization
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:39.400]  so you have the organizer of the women's march supporting the doctrine that allows
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:45.320]  wives to be beaten by their husbands she's the big feminist women's rights champion
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:51.240]  now she's being defended by the splc because again they don't care about women's rights
[2:49:51.240 --> 2:49:58.040]  they don't care about minorities rights they care about power and demonizing their political
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:04.280]  adversaries and they do it at every single turn they paint giant targets on the back of muslim
[2:50:04.280 --> 2:50:11.000]  reformers who have been the victims of actual assassination attempts by islamic jihadists
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:15.960]  let that sink in the article goes on instead of teaching the nation about sharia law's
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:22.120]  regressive and liberal tenants splc will dedicate its resources to defending its proponents like
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:29.320]  soso and blacklisting muslim reformers like ayan hercialli and majeed noaz the splc is a hate
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:36.840]  group it targets people who are working peacefully in the world to try and eliminate actual hate
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:44.760]  and violence those are the people it targets while calling them hateful bigots that's how the splc
[2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:50.920]  works that's why it got its funding withdrawn the splc the southern poverty law center is a hate
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:55.080]  group it's proven it time and time again we will be back with a final segment on the arch

[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:20.840]  now if it is going to be a revolt by the poor if it is going to be a french revolution style
[2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:27.480]  apocalypse purge then they've only got themselves to blame they were the ones who spun the narrative
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:33.320]  that donald trump was literally hitler that he was going to blow up the world they were the ones
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:41.400]  who created the environment that gave us trump derangement syndrome these hysterical maniacal
[2:56:41.400 --> 2:56:47.880]  violent aggressive quote protesters going nuts across the nation and they will continue to do so
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:52.760]  so the elite they created the environment for this they only have themselves to blame
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:58.280]  according to writer evan osnos preppers from silicon valley in new yorker getting ready
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:04.440]  for the crack up of civilization one american hedge fund manager who owns two new zealand homes
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:10.760]  told osnos he expected at least a decade of political turmoil in the united states paypal
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:15.720]  co-founder and facebook investor piece of teal also owns property there and has described new
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:24.200]  zealand as a utopia listen to what reid hoffman who is the linkedin co-founder said about what's
[2:57:24.200 --> 2:57:29.400]  happening in new zealand he said quote saying you're buying a house in new zealand is kind of a
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:35.240]  wink wink say no more once you've done the masonic can shake they'll be like oh you know i have a
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:40.360]  broker who sells old icbm silos and they're nuclear hardened and they kind of look like they
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:46.280]  would be an interesting place to live in so you've got the insiders with a nod and a wink they know
[2:57:46.280 --> 2:57:52.280]  what they're talking about as they do the masonic handshakes the elite still panicked about the
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:59.560]  potential crack up of civilization running to their armored redoubt is it going to be a an
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:06.920]  uprising of the poor if it is again it's by their own creation they created the policies which created
[2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:12.680]  this massive massive wealth disparity declining you know wage increases versus interest they're
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:19.160]  the ones who created this hysteria surrounding the presidency of donald trump so yeah they probably
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:25.720]  be in a position to know if there was a french revolution style uprising in the offing for the
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:31.240]  united states over the next 10 years so they're still buying those armored redoubt we'll be back

[3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:15.480]  lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:18.680]  in defense of human liberty alex jones
[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:28.680]  roger stone is coming up with the fourth hour but now we're going to go to this clip i was talking
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:35.880]  about the issue before the break the splc running defense for linda saw saw the big champion of
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:42.040]  women's rights she also supports sharia law which is the opposite of women's rights so the splc the
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:49.320]  left are outrunning defense after she was criticized and liz wheeler filed this report exposing the
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:56.280]  sheer hypocrisy behind the entire women's rights march here it is what exactly does the women's
[3:00:56.280 --> 3:01:00.520]  march want i'm totally serious here this is not a rhetorical trap what was the objective of that
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:05.160]  march these women in their pink genitalia hats screaming in pain at the idea of president
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:09.720]  trump something like two million women worldwide i find it very suspicious that none of them could
[3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:14.040]  articulate exactly what their march was about women's rights i heard that a couple of times but
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:19.480]  what women's rights are in jeopardy here please tell me law by law line by line statute by statute
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:23.800]  what exactly is president trump going to damage or what rights is he going to deprive women tell
[3:01:23.800 --> 3:01:27.080]  me please i'm an independent woman i want to stick up for women's rights especially if they're on
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:31.720]  the chopping block i have a platform i can make a difference but i cannot find women's rights at
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:36.200]  risk under president trump now some of you talked about misogyny but that can't be right either
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:40.440]  because you voted for hillary clinton who willingly accepted 25 million dollars from saudi arabia
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:45.160]  where women are veiled abused oppressed and killed your rude comments about first lady melania trump
[3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:50.600]  were okay some others said because she's enabling a misogynist by staying married to him again you
[3:01:50.600 --> 3:01:54.840]  voted for hillary she's still with bill he was actually impeached for lying about his extramarital
[3:01:54.840 --> 3:01:59.240]  sexual shenanigans some of you said you were protesting homophobia but that can't be it either
[3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:03.640]  because president trump is the first president in us history to take office supporting gay marriage
[3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:09.800]  a few of you had signs that read science which i found particularly odd apparently you're not
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:14.360]  talking about science that says unborn baby is a human being you didn't celebrate motherhood
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:19.400]  the most mystical magical wonderful feminine experience instead you seem to promote vulgarity
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:25.160]  so akam's razor at work here leaves us with two demands from the women's march one you want free
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:29.560]  birth control and you two you want unlimited access to abortion for any reason and you love
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:33.960]  of taxpayers paid the tab that's why you kicked out pro-life feminist that's why you refuse to
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:38.600]  publish a goal for your march it's too disgusting to admit that two million women just march to
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:42.680]  celebrate killing our unborn children and you're too entitled to spend four bucks at cbs and buy
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:48.440]  yourself protection sounds pretty nasty when the truth is exposed huh and to boot these women left
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:53.160]  their trash for others to clean up something symbolic there and certainly nothing to be proud of
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:57.480]  and that's my final point tonight you can reach me on twitter at liz underscore wheeler if you
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.360]  like the show please send me an email at oann.com slash contact don't forget if you miss an episode
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:06.920]  of tipping point you can now go back and watch the archives up two weeks ago on cloud tv dot com
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:12.600]  there we have liz wheeler again exposing the hypocrisy behind the women's rights march isn't
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:18.520]  it ironic that they were there complaining about donald trump objectifying women in fact we had
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:23.960]  another clip yesterday which was in an article about the feminist you know attacking the cameraman
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:30.200]  of the woman who was carrying a sign saying islam is misogynistic that was particularly triggering
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:36.280]  to them even though islam is the most anti-woman belief system on the planet but if you question
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:41.640]  that then the feminist attack you but they were also complaining about donald trump's rhetoric
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:49.720]  objectifying women while literally dressed as vaginas yeah how does that work out for you
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:58.520]  absolutely incredible it wasn't a women's march it was a leftist anti-trump march rebranded that's
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:05.800]  all it was it was an excuse for Madonna again to get up on stage and play along with this narrative
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:12.600]  that it's suddenly okay for the left to engage in flagrant violent threats against trump against
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:19.080]  trump supporters while claiming that they're peaceful and tolerance and that love trumps hate
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:25.800]  while they literally spit on trump supporters set fire to their hair punch them in the face run after
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:32.760]  them attack their cameraman but love trumps hate these are the people that we're dealing with this
[3:04:32.760 --> 3:04:39.000]  is the environment of violence and thuggery that has been legitimized by the mainstream media
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:44.520]  since even before Ferguson you know time magazine in defense of rioting that was the most recent
[3:04:44.520 --> 3:04:52.520]  origin of it now the intensity is increasing as they legitimize actual terrorism in america
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:57.000]  roger stone is coming up with a fourth hour and more breaking news be sure to stay tuned
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:04.040]  that's it for me info wars dot com president trump's press secretary shan spicer continued
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:10.840]  his war against the establishment media yesterday suggesting that there is a default position amongst
[3:05:10.840 --> 3:05:17.880]  biased reporters to assume that the new administration is lying and i think that what has happened
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:24.040]  is that there's this predisposition in the media to especially with this president and i think this
[3:05:24.040 --> 3:05:30.280]  idea that we're immediately lying because where are their facts because i got called a liar for
[3:05:30.280 --> 3:05:35.880]  something that i can add up and say here's how we come up with this number meanwhile over at msnbc
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:42.600]  chris mathews continued to openly compare president donald trump to murderous dictators
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:48.120]  you're misusing your office thoroughly you know it gets to be like kim young on but who's going
[3:05:48.120 --> 3:05:52.440]  to mess with the son-in-law you know he's always going to be there that's the lie that's the lie
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:05:56.920]  proximity although it was a lean he executed his son-in-law and you can learn more right now at
[3:05:56.920 --> 3:06:03.160]  info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen i was shown here on the road with a very important

[3:08:41.160 --> 3:09:07.160]  who reached out to me it means a great deal to me and my family i am feeling better not at full strength the inaugural was taxing but the most fun and the most exciting that i'd ever been to so many thanks for your cards and letters and emails i am most definitely on the mend now i want to talk to one of the most erudite guys around
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:27.160]  film maker conservative activist musician bob dillon expert who often plays with one of the greatest dillon tribute bands in the country joel gilbert joins us from hollywood joel welcome to info wars
[3:09:27.160 --> 3:09:47.160]  great to be a roger you're looking good feeling feeling much better now your film dreams of the father i believe or tracking obama really enlightens us a lot about his background and now of course there's widespread conversation about his legacy
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:59.160]  what is your take having studied this man so carefully what is your take on obama and what is your take on his legacy and what do you think he's planning to do going forward
[3:09:59.160 --> 3:10:23.160]  okay thanks uh well look uh obama was trained as a professional agitator uh his job was officially community organizer but that was the official name for community agitator and as i showed in my film the job was and i'm quoting from their literature the job was to rub salt in the wounds of minorities and then use their discontent to take power
[3:10:23.160 --> 3:10:47.160]  quote so we've seen uh from obama's years in office let's take a look at his uh farewell speech uh he expressed the same kind of nonsense that he did when he was running for office it was almost a camp's pain speech he talked about slavery and jim crow and how that uh you know we've divided the country is
[3:10:47.160 --> 3:11:07.160]  divided with these one percent these evil uh boogeyman who's taking all your money and if you just give us the power we'll uh get that money back from the boogeyman and give it to you uh for marxists like obama america is hell because they compare america to the perfect socialist utopia that's unattainable
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:21.160]  so their conclusion is america is therefore evil and must be torn down and rebuilt to make the perfect world conservatives have a different view of the world we look at other countries and compare them to america and say well america is a society that has
[3:11:21.160 --> 3:11:41.160]  individual rights individual liberty and we can pursue happiness so we're happy in america as opposed to the left or miserable so obama presented what was uh his legacy of lies in his speech he talked about i rebooted the auto industry well no he just transferred the debt to the american taxpayer
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:55.160]  he said i've had the longest stretch of employment growth well no that's a lie it's really about 20% it's just that so many people as you know left the workforce he talked about i opened a new chapter in cuba well no that's a lie you just propped up these
[3:11:55.160 --> 3:12:15.160]  communist dictators that you've worshipped for all these years so you could go to a baseball game with ro castrow he said i uh you know i stopped the iranian nuclear program without firing a shot well no that's a lie because every indication is the 1.7 billion in cash was sent straight to north korea where they are simply
[3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:35.160]  continuing the iranian nuclear program for them and of course finally he said i put 20 million people on health care well most of them were kicked off of health care so obama's candidacy was based on a lie the personal background was my father's a goat herder from kenya i'm going to bring us all together
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:45.160]  and then his agenda was i'm going to cut the deficit in half marriages between a man and the woman it was all intentional deception he never intended to do any of that agenda
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:13:01.160]  and as i showed in my film dreams to my real father his background was that his biological father who became his ideological mentor was not the kenyan obama it was in fact the soviet agent frank marshall davis who radicalized obama in his youth
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:21.160]  now this is joel is an area where you and sydney blooming fall are in agreement because as you probably know the clinton hitman blooming fall tried to get that rumor that assertion going early in the democratic toss up between hillary and obama it is but one of the reasons that
[3:13:21.160 --> 3:13:41.160]  barack obama despises him it is one of the reasons why obama ordered that even while hillary was secretary of state she could not bring sydney blooming fall son of the anti zionist anti jewish radical max blooming fall into the white house
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:57.160]  which is why we found him on the payroll at the clinton foundation now i didn't know tax free foundations could pay for dirty tricks but evidently they can i am really of the view that with hillary now defeated
[3:13:57.160 --> 3:14:13.160]  there being no love lost between obama and the clinton's anyway obama clearly remembering when bill clinton told senator ted crannity a few years ago ted this boy would be fetching our coffee so
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:30.160]  none the last i think the clinton's in the bush is a party the clinton's and the obamas had so much on each other that the perfunctory support he gave hillary was necessary with hillary out of the way joel obama is the titular head of the democratic party
[3:14:30.160 --> 3:14:47.160]  michelle is certainly young enough to run for public office are they secretly planning a comeback a restoration as it were i think we have to be very concerned i think obama remains dangerous
[3:14:47.160 --> 3:15:03.160]  he was a professional agitator trained for ten years he was a trainer for acorn i think he was never interested in being president or the presidency and that's why he went on all these golf vacations never attended his security briefings put his feet up on the desk
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:16.160]  because he wanted to use the presidency to agitate not to be president or governor and that's what he's done all these years in office is agitate and divide the country so i expect obama to go back to being who he is
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:35.160]  and his bonnie and collide partner in crime is michelle obama who herself was a radical activist a lot of people don't know she grew up in jesse jackson's household good friend of stentita jackson and she was also radicalized this is why these two together represent a formidable
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:51.160]  self radical couple that pretend to wave the flag and love america as i show in my film there's no place like utopia but they do have a hidden radical agenda that they learn from you know bill ares and the marxist terrorist gang that
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:16:06.160]  taught them bernadine dorne new michelle obama they all worked in the same law firm sidley austin so that's how really american socialism and communism changed from the late sixties they look people in the eye and say we're going to destroy america we're going to blow up buildings and
[3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:21.160]  murder policemen and we're going to have this wonderful communist revolution it was so evil it failed they all went to jail when they came out of prison or in the underground in the early eighties they taught obama and the other radicals look people in the
[3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:36.160]  eye but don't tell them about your socialism and marxism tell them you want to help families tell them you want to give them higher wages and free healthcare use their discontent to take power and then throw them under the bus and pursue the radical agenda that
[3:16:36.160 --> 3:16:43.160]  no one voted for and that's the story of how american socialism evolved and that's how they got into power
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:17:00.160]  uh joel before we go i want to compliment you your incredible short documentary banished the true story of danie williams the abandoned son of bill clinton banished by hillary now it's clear got almost thirty six million
[3:17:00.160 --> 3:17:19.160]  opens on the internet looks like close to twelve million on several platforms in facebook alone this is an enormous accomplishment i know for a certainty that millions of minority voters african-american voters
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:38.160]  became familiar with the danie williams story and bypassed the main media so they could hear the facts presented for themselves and make up their own mind while meghan kelly and and others like Olivia nuzzy of the daily beast
[3:17:38.160 --> 3:17:52.160]  for trying to tell us oh no this is a hoax this is not true it is neither a hoax nor is it untrue what kind of people abandoned their flesh and blood son what kind of people so

[3:24:13.160 --> 3:24:29.160]  so welcome back to info wars I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones and just happy to be alive again thank you to the many info wars listeners and viewers who extended their best wishes for a speedy recover after my recent
[3:24:29.160 --> 3:24:48.160]  visit to tango with some poison most likely polonium in the ongoing struggle by the deep state to claim that Donald Trump selection was rigged by the Russians that hacked by the Russians the New York Times last week said on page one that
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:25:07.160]  Paul Manafort and Roger Stone were under investigation for their emails and financial transactions with the Russians I had dinner with Manafort last week and he agrees with me it's a lie there is no there there there are no such contacts
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:23.160]  I'm very excited about the man who pardon me our upcoming book the making of the president 2016 how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution now I can tell you right now who the heroes of this book are
[3:25:23.160 --> 3:25:42.160]  Matt Drudge is one of the heroes of this book Alex Jones is one of the heroes of this book Stephen K. Bannon is one of the heroes of this book one of the real heroes of this book is someone I like very much somebody who is a
[3:25:42.160 --> 3:26:02.160]  Donald Trump loyalist someone who is tough and feisty and enormously capable and I think came to the Trump came in at a tea time where she made an indelible and important contribution and that is Kelly and Conway
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:21.160]  Kelly and Conway spent some years in the vineyards as a Republican pollster with an expertise in women's voters but not limited to that I thought that she was a great asset for the campaign when she joined
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:40.160]  because she has an aggressive yet easy manner on television and because today within the confines of the Trump White House she is among those looking out for the Trump Revolution she's among those who knows how Trump got elected she's
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:59.160]  she's among those who understand the fragile but important constituency that Donald Trump has put together now more recently come reports only yesterday unconfirmed that Kelly and may have decked a guy who was a friend of hers when she
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:22.160]  stepped between two of her friends in a fist fight altercation and her only option to break it up was to throw a punch of her own this I hope is true this makes me like Kelly and Conway even more I like tough feisty decisive opinionated women
[3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:31.160]  particularly those who are absolutely dedicated to protecting a Donald Trump and the Trump Revolution
[3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:53.160]  now last night I was at the Broward Center for the performing arts to see the pathetic performance of CNN talking head in a Navarro now as I said here last week Navarro was fired by Governor Jeb Bush because she got caught lying about being an attorney she accepted a position
[3:27:53.160 --> 3:28:06.160]  in his administration by claiming to be a lawyer she is not a lawyer so the question you must ask yourself is why would CNN hire someone like this as an expert
[3:28:06.160 --> 3:28:25.160]  Navarro has never actually run a campaign or had a serious role in a campaign for any Republican candidate for any office where she has had an impact so she has no qualifications and no expertise and she has a shady background
[3:28:25.160 --> 3:28:49.160]  why are they up not upset about this at CNN it's very simple because CNN is fake news fake Republican strategist fake background fake opinions so this truck was driven around the the perimeter of the performing performing arts center local activists
[3:28:49.160 --> 3:29:08.160]  they fired out a flyer illuminating people as to Navarro's true background and then who can forget her epic meltdown on air screaming pussy pussy pussy pussy at the top of her lungs literally losing it forcing CNN to cut to break
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:30.160]  and then forcing CNN to later remove this footage from the air so we couldn't see this mental breakdown by a lunatic by a hater so last night it was fun calling out in a Navarro we'll be right back on him for wars with more on the struggle to make America great again
[3:29:30.160 --> 3:29:49.160]  and the role we need you to play in it
[3:29:49.160 --> 3:30:00.160]  we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:30:19.160 --> 3:30:34.160]  on how long the excerpts can be they put a time limit on how long material can be used no material may be used after February the first this is a desperate bid by ABC to circumvent freedom of the press and fair use they're trying to take control of
[3:30:34.160 --> 3:30:57.160]  this message trying to monopolize it both to monetize it and to spend it as they wish for political purposes even banning future use of it extraordinary copyright claims and enforcement were major problem with the TPP that Trump just shut down and he should shut down this desperate attempt by ABC to try to copyright what the president says in interviews that is not appropriate
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:21.160]  for info wars dot com I'm David Knight it's not just our water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our children the artificial particulates the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems the same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze

[3:33:48.160 --> 3:34:09.160]  I went to the info wars dot com store recently to try to get some more DNA force I think this product did an incredible job of torquing up my immunity and helping me repel the antioxidants and other poisons you're getting naturally never mind those that you may be getting
[3:34:09.160 --> 3:34:26.160]  exogenously and they were out and I will tell you I was disappointed fortunately I had a small supply left and now comes word that they have gotten a small catch of DNA force and it is back in stock
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:47.160]  and you can get it a 10% discount so I really credit this product for helping save my life I don't care if some on the left David Brock and his other panty wearing misfits say that this is quackery it is not quackery herbs and other natural substances have been used by man
[3:34:47.160 --> 3:35:06.160]  for 2000 years quackery is what's practiced by the gymen pharmaceutical companies who want to solve everything with drugs with foreign substances as opposed to a natural approach which has worked for me my entire life
[3:35:06.160 --> 3:35:28.160]  the products at the info wars dot com store are the very best particularly the herbs and other natural products that will keep you in good health so help us fight the revolution help us fund this important beacon of free speech by going to info wars store dot com right now
[3:35:28.160 --> 3:35:50.160]  I am was one thing that did disappoint me about the inaugural where I had a terrific time but anybody who knows me knows that I am a stickler for the etiquette of men's dressing now the men's etiquette books and all rules regarding the presidential swearing
[3:35:50.160 --> 3:35:59.160]  in an inauguration dictate that the president and his immediate party would wear what you call a morning suit
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:20.160]  and that's what I wore a morning suit because that is the correct outfit there I am with a mrs stone and this is a swallowtail coat a gray vest a foreign hand tie a watch chain and obviously as you can see the deregure top hat
[3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:40.160]  Ron this is what Ronald Reagan war this is what John Kennedy war this is what every president up until George Bush war George Bush chose to wear a business suit and a somber tie a tradition that Donald Trump decided to continue
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:37:00.160]  then for the inaugural balls black tie is not correct white tie and tails is what is correct so for the inaugural ball I of course switched into white tie and tails it is literally impossible for any man to look bad in this outfit
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:21.160]  it is literally impossible not to look dashing so I understand Donald Trump and he does it his way and I gotta tell you I love the fact that he wore the New York red power tie he is the progenitor of the power tie
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:40.160]  and it was strong but because I'm sentimental you know I kind of I miss the old days the striped trousers the the frock coat the top hat it's a certain elegance that you saw in the members of Congress and those in the inaugural party but once again
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:59.160]  Donald Trump has changed many things including the etiquette of the inauguration this was an amazing uplifting experience I was fortunate enough to be seated with Alex Jones although he couldn't stay seated for long he was so excited
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:13.160]  and it was not a country club Republican crowd the people sitting in my role were working class people some of them African Americans and they were applauding lustily our new president
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:32.160]  there were people as far as the eye can see so I reject the idea that this was not as well attended or not better attended then Barack Obama's inaugural I'm not sure it's not important other than to say that throughout this campaign
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:57.160]  Donald Trump has set records in terms of crowds this was one of the early warnings that he was on a trajectory for victory that the mainstream media chose to lose chose to ignore chose to undercut and they did so at their own peril
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:39:11.160]  we are now going to turn our attention I believe to the basics so what you've seen in the last two weeks is that Trump is doing the big things and the small things keeping faith on a on TPP withdrawing us
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:29.160]  signing executive orders ushering Obamacare towards the exit keeping faith with the American people and doing precisely the things he said he would do at the same time yes he's getting into these little squabbles with the media when they lie
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:44.160]  this is the nature of Donald Trump he's a fighter he's combative no one will take advantage of him and no one will take advantage of the United States as long as he is president and frankly no one will care about these
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:40:02.160]  these inside the beltway squabbles with the with the fake news media if he's producing jobs if he is producing revitalization of our economy if he is fixing our immigration system if he is renegotiating these trade deals
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:24.160]  then he has the capacity to be among our very very greatest presidents so I am optimistic I'm always cautiously concerned about whether or not the incursion of mainstream Republicans the
[3:40:24.160 --> 3:40:48.160]  incursion of establishment Republicans into the administration makes the president's goal harder he needs men and women who are for his vision for his mission not Republican turncoats who suddenly show up and say oh Mr. President I was for you the whole time
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:41:10.160]  sure they were I have no doubt whatsoever that the same neocon never Trump Republicans who financed and who brought out the so-called NBC Billy Bush tape are the same people behind this fabricated memo pushed by the CIA shown to President Obama shown to
[3:41:10.160 --> 3:41:33.160]  president elect Trump leaked to the media first to buzzfeed and then picked up by CNN just to remind you CNN is not a news organization it's a radical propaganda arm of the Soros operation they have no regard there for facts they have no regard for fair play or
[3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:54.160]  journalistic ethics back during the primaries they allowed Ted Cruz to come on the air in real time in prime time and make accusations about me and Donald Trump without ever affording to me the opportunity to respond to those CBS to their credit when
[3:41:54.160 --> 3:42:11.160]  Cruz went crazy at least sent a camera to me to allow me to record my reaction and then they aired both that's what news organizations do but every attempt to contact the producers at CNN to ask for equal time to ask for
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:34.160]  equal treatment even recently when John Podesta again falsely went on CNN after the election and claim that stone knew everything about the Russian hacking and he tipped off his friend Trump for that nine millionth time that is false that is not true
[3:42:34.160 --> 3:42:54.160]  there is no evidence to support that claim and CNN is irresponsible to not allow me to come on and make my case regarding the facts I've been talking to Alex Jones about a march on CNN when it gets a bit warmer
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:43:12.160]  I think this is a requirement I think it's very important that thousands and thousands of freedom fighters of average citizens show up for a peaceful protest at the time Warner Center where CNN has their international
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:28.160]  headquarters stay tuned for our plans about that it's a little chilly right now but I think a mass demonstration against fake news outside the CNN building who knows maybe we can catch a glimpse of
[3:43:28.160 --> 3:43:45.160]  Anderson Cooper wouldn't that be sweet so I think it is important that people recognize and this is one of the key points of my book the making of the president 2016 is we've reached the tipping point
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:44:01.160]  the mainstream media the ABC's the NBC's the CBS's CNN and Fox they have lost their monopoly on dissemination of political information when they had the monopoly they destroyed Barry Goldwater
[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:16.160]  he's a trigger happy nut he's a lunatic he's an anti-Semite he's a neo-nazi none of those things of course were true they tried the same act on Donald Trump it didn't work
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:32.160]  that's because less than 50% of the voters are now getting their distorted information and more and more voters big for technological reasons are getting their political news on their handheld device
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:48.160]  that means that they have a greater series of choices whether it's info wars.com whether it's Breitbart whether it's the Daily Caller whether it's Town Hall whether it's Lou Rockwell and dozens of other free thinking sites
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:45:08.160]  and in the case of Breitbart or info wars where superior investigative journalism based on facts and truth is being practiced it's not the fake news narrative that is being cooked up by the mainstream media
[3:45:08.160 --> 3:45:28.160]  and their multinational corporate owners that is the single most significant shift in American politics that is what opened the door to the election of President Donald Trump
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:49.160]  now I have said several times that I think the way Trump closed the way he launched a Herculean physical effort just sheer determination and a sprint across the country in the closing days doing four five six speeches a day
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:46:04.160]  he simply outworked Hillary who during most of that time was home in her pajamas watching television. In the end Trump really stole a page from the book of give him hell Harry Truman
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:23.160]  who was counted out like Trump by the media who the polls showed would lose in 1948 by the media who was considered hopeless and Truman decided to jump a train and take it all the way across the country
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:34.160]  and a whistle stop was defined as a town that was so small you had to blow the whistle to before he got there let people know you were coming and that you'd stop if there were passengers
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:47.160]  Truman barnstormed across the country hammering the republicans interestingly enough Hillary Clinton was very much like Tom Dewey complacent
[3:46:47.160 --> 3:47:04.160]  but they had it in the bag arrogant cold and aloof Dewey avoided putting forward any program he had a split republican party between the Taft wing and the Dewey wing the conservative wing and the eastern liberal wing
[3:47:04.160 --> 3:47:13.160]  but everybody told Tom the same thing Tom don't say anything don't rock the boat don't make any enemies you got this in the bag
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:21.160]  the energy was with Truman and not Dewey just as the energy was with Trump and not Hillary
[3:47:21.160 --> 3:47:35.160]  one of my favorite anecdotes from this election is Truman in the engine compartment of the train driving the engineers to break all speed laws to lay on additional stops
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:43.160]  reminds me of Donald Trump calling in his pilots and saying I've decided to go to Milwaukee and Detroit and so on
[3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:54.160]  both of the men possessed an almost demonic drive for votes in the close this can not in any way be underestimated
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:48:08.160]  so if you want to get the inside story of how that went down and how Donald Trump stole the page from one of our fiestearest and I would say most peppery former presidents
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:21.160]  now it's a shame that the anti-communism middle class type of Democrat the Truman John Kennedy Henry Jackson School of Democrat no longer exists
[3:48:21.160 --> 3:48:31.160]  but the truth about this election was that in Wisconsin in Michigan and Pennsylvania and a handful of other states
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:45.160]  Donald Trump ran ahead of Mitt Romney and John McCain and George W. Bush when it came to inroads among those white moderate Catholic Democratic votes
[3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:56.160]  so a shift of 3% among those voters in western Pennsylvania for example is enough to swing this election
[3:48:56.160 --> 3:49:13.160]  the under vote of African Americans as we talked about earlier and the impact of Danny Williams and the amazing video put together by Joe Gilbert depressed black turnout in Detroit
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:24.160]  and in Richmond and in Miami Fort Lauderdale and in Milwaukee and in Philadelphia and in Cleveland
[3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:35.160]  no dirty tricks what happens when blacks learn the civil rights record of the Clintons and they learn about the abandoned son of Bill Clinton Danny Williams
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:49.160]  who they tried to discredit with a phony non-existent blood test or a blood test that didn't require enough DNA or didn't have enough DNA material to make a determination
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:50:06.160]  this is perhaps the Clintons greatest shame 3% among African Americans 3% among white Catholic Democrats in the end Donald Trump only carried Michigan by about 10,000 votes

[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:17.160]  welcome back to info wars we are the tip of the spear this is the resistance
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:25.160]  I still chuckle over the way the mainstream media doesn't understand infowars.com or Alex Jones
[3:54:25.160 --> 3:54:33.160]  and then if you will look at those who are watching online combine those who are watching on Facebook live on YouTube live
[3:54:33.160 --> 3:54:44.160]  who watch it later in podcast who are listening on the radio folks here at info wars here are amassing enormous numbers of viewers and listeners
[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:53.160]  and enlisting them in the war to make America great again if there is an MVP in this the last election it would have to be Alex Jones
[3:54:53.160 --> 3:55:03.160]  and Matt Drudge and Stephen K. Bannon and the barons of the alternative media the real media
[3:55:03.160 --> 3:55:12.160]  my friend Matt Boyle the bureau chief at Bright Bear in Washington has this right we are the mainstream media they are the fringe
[3:55:12.160 --> 3:55:21.160]  you can tell by the small number that are watching them so it's a it's a new day in America
[3:55:21.160 --> 3:55:34.160]  I am very focused on the U.S. Supreme Court I have made no bones about it that in a perfect world my choice for the first opening would be judge Andrew Napolitano
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:46.160]  the legal analyst for Fox News now judge Napolitano has been a friend of mine and a mentor since 1981 when he wandered in off the street
[3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:59.160]  to help Governor Tom Cain in a recount Cain had won the 1981 New Jersey election we claimed by 1200 and 9 votes out of about 2 million cast
[3:55:59.160 --> 3:56:12.160]  and there was a recount and a tussle and it was favorably decided for Governor Tom Cain who went on to become one of New Jersey's greatest governors
[3:56:12.160 --> 3:56:21.160]  and that's how I first met Andrew Napolitano in the trenches he's a first rate legal mind and a first rate temperament
[3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:32.160]  he's a constitutional scholar was a protege and close friend of Anton Scalia perhaps one of our greatest jurists for the last 10 years of his life
[3:56:32.160 --> 3:56:50.160]  so in a perfect world I would prefer a judge Napolitano many people however believe the president feels conscripted to stick to a list of conservative jurists that he released before the election and promised to choose from
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:57:05.160]  now there are many good people on this list as well I myself like a judge Tom Hardiman of Pittsburgh on the appeals court think he would be a solid pick
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:21.160]  he is a young man serves on the third circuit I don't think he's 50 he is a solid conservative and that would be a good appointment judge Don Willett however of Texas
[3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:35.160]  a real anti-government libertarian someone who's deeply skeptical of federal power and the consolidation of power by the federal government would be an excellent choice
[3:57:35.160 --> 3:57:51.160]  so it's a bit of a madman a revolutionary just what this dodgy court needs so I think the president's got some excellent choices they are more in the traditional conservative establishment conservative mold
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:58:09.160]  personally I'm crossing my fingers hoping that judge Napolitano may be Donald Trump's second appointment to the court that's my handicapping today I think Hardiman is the front runner and I think it would be a fine appointment
[3:58:09.160 --> 3:58:22.160]  Trump is going to be a transformative president not a transitional president but a transformative president he's really going to change everything candidly doesn't need a conservative court or a right wing court
[3:58:22.160 --> 3:58:37.160]  he needs a Trump court he needs a liberty based conservative court but with an eye towards civil liberties with an eye towards Trump's libertarian cohort within his constituency
[3:58:37.160 --> 3:58:49.160]  and I hope you will keep this in mind as you wait what could be the first of as many as four decisions let's remember that the supreme court
[3:58:49.160 --> 3:59:09.160]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic we wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health
