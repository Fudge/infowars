[01:38.720 --> 01:43.640]  Trayvon Martin case ABC News is now released photo that his neighbor took
[01:43.640 --> 01:48.400]  minutes after the back of his head bashed in with blood all over the place
[01:48.400 --> 01:55.120]  just as he said and it just as all the witnesses saw including two black
[01:55.120 --> 02:00.840]  witnesses again not saying it was the best thing that even came out of his
[02:00.840 --> 02:04.400]  house to check out what's happening but he went to his car reportedly and then
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.480]  Martin came over and got in his face and started kicking his hind end in not
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.440]  good to bring your fist to a gunfight at the media seized on all of this to try
[02:14.440 --> 02:21.400]  to cause some type of big war between different racial groups as a political
[02:21.400 --> 02:25.400]  distraction and now we've confirmed barely even covered this last week at
[02:25.400 --> 02:31.000]  such big news that the Justice Department is leading the protest and to
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.280]  quote protect them and hyping it and NBC is editing audio tapes of 911 to make
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.480]  it sound like Zimmerman is like yeah he's black he's no good they're like what
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.160]  color does he look is he black Hispanic white no he looks black when we talk
[02:47.160 --> 02:50.960]  about other stuff and well what's he doing well he looks confused he's either
[02:50.960 --> 02:55.200]  on drugs or up to no good something's going on they just combined those two
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.680]  together to say he's black he looks like he's up to no good again why would they
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.400]  do that and the old days NBC could get away with that because there wouldn't be
[03:05.400 --> 03:09.640]  the internet later when private citizens went and got the full tape and
[03:09.640 --> 03:15.200]  released it and I mean it was alternative blogs that first put out the
[03:15.200 --> 03:18.680]  fact that they edited it info wars.com is one of the first to link to that then
[03:18.680 --> 03:24.880]  the drugs report and then it forced NBC to get caught by the way speaking of
[03:24.880 --> 03:29.560]  pushing and dominating the media and starting to be able to more and more on
[03:29.560 --> 03:36.360]  a daily basis set the agenda info wars.com three days ago did an article

[08:39.720 --> 08:44.520]  to be here for the next three hours dr. Paul Craig Roberts who hadn't been on
[08:44.520 --> 08:48.200]  in a few months has written a new article titled getting Americans out of the
[08:48.200 --> 08:53.240]  matrix that is up on info wars.com we're gonna be discussing that with him and
[08:53.240 --> 08:59.080]  we have the director of the film pharma Geddon that just details the
[08:59.080 --> 09:03.280]  incredible persecution of our rural communities the globalists do not want
[09:03.280 --> 09:10.880]  anybody being self-sufficient in this society we have a lot of other big
[09:10.880 --> 09:17.880]  developments in the Middle East on the economy Ted Nugent the first amendment
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.560]  the police state cops take school kids DNA and murder case I mentioned this
[09:23.560 --> 09:30.040]  yesterday but I started reading the quotes by the police and it's amazing
[09:30.040 --> 09:35.640]  wait till I get to these also Rupert Murdoch is back in court that inquest
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.600]  that's being used to basically blackmail news core into getting even more pro
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.480]  New World Order some big Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman developments all of it
[09:45.480 --> 09:51.720]  also Forbes writer scoffs at info wars freak out on mandatory black boxes he
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.360]  first we're not being tracked with black boxes on board all the new
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.200]  electronics now they admit we are and the smart meters are gonna control our
[10:00.200 --> 10:05.680]  temperature and our dialing in to all these tech systems built in that you
[10:05.680 --> 10:12.520]  pay for when you buy a washing machine or a dishwasher or a clock radio so yes
[10:12.520 --> 10:18.080]  we they are watching us and tracking us without warrants but get used to it they
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.480]  been doing it a long time that's their answer so again first none of this
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.320]  existed now they're rolling it out and saying yeah there's no fourth amendment
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.720]  we'll do whatever we want but still you're bad if you don't like it and we've
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.440]  as I mentioned the last segment also had the the Atlantic the same magazine that
[10:37.440 --> 10:44.600]  came out last month and had been Bernanke on the front and said hero under
[10:44.600 --> 10:53.080]  it just hero and Aaron Dyke said a big report yesterday where Bill Gates
[10:53.080 --> 11:00.600]  actually pays hundreds of media outlets to say he's a superhero he pays ABC news
[11:00.600 --> 11:07.000]  and the Daily Show and all of these systems on record to show him in
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.160]  Superman and Green Lantern outfits and they're like well that's just ridiculous
[11:11.160 --> 11:17.400]  well Warren Buffett his partner in crimes favorite thing is to hold an ice
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.240]  cream cone in his hand thousands of photos of him with ice cream cunts just
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.440]  type Warren Buffett ice cream cone in and you'll see it it's all about just a
[11:26.440 --> 11:33.440]  non-threatening gimmick it's a gimmick and now they have in public school
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.800]  comic books that are given to the kids where Bill Gates is a superhero he's
[11:37.800 --> 11:42.640]  paying for this because people are like you're saying he's this evil eugenicist
[11:42.640 --> 11:45.640]  who wants world government and whose dad headed up Planned Parenthood and
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.840]  called for world government and all this and you're saying he works for the
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.120]  government to spy on people and put back doors all of his systems now you're
[11:53.120 --> 12:00.280]  saying Bill Gates is bad but I mean he's a superhero on ABC News London Guardian
[12:00.280 --> 12:05.040]  the list goes on on it even says under the articles on the sites sponsored by
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.240]  Bill and Melinda Gates and that's why every almost every time I turn the news
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.680]  on it's like worshiping Bill Gates this is just a total propaganda assault
[12:15.680 --> 12:19.680]  because they know we're exposing them you know we didn't even play the video
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.840]  clip last week we should have but it was up on info wars.com Melinda Gates got
[12:24.840 --> 12:31.320]  up at the TED TV technology conference in Germany in Berlin and and said many
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.360]  people are trying to stop our efforts to save people worldwide by saying we want
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.320]  to reduce population you're going to cause loss of life you're going to cause
[12:41.320 --> 12:48.320]  it. Well you know it's funny Bill Gates is on record I think I'll do a whole
[12:48.320 --> 12:51.960]  news report on this again and just put it all together where he says on Lair
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.160]  News Hour get rid of the population where he says on Bill Moyers get rid of
[12:56.160 --> 13:01.640]  the population where he says kill grandma to hire ten teachers and you just type
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.480]  in Bill Gates endorses death panels he says yeah I'm for death panels and I
[13:07.480 --> 13:10.720]  can show you all the things they funded the things they've done where he told
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.560]  TED TV we're gonna reduce human population humans are bad they exhale
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.280]  carbon dioxide and we've got to bring that number to zero and the crowd all
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.520]  laughed because they're a bunch of insiders who get off on the idea it's
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.040]  like wow we're we've got a world government jacking the food and water
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.160]  supply and they're like well we're being let in on this the public so dumb
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.200]  Bill Gates just openly said we're gonna kill at most people and they all
[13:34.200 --> 13:39.040]  giggle and have fun because they're part of it they get off on it there's
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.560]  nothing more deadly than a nerd I'm gonna tell you right now because they're
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.160]  always underestimated they end up with all the money all the power well normal
[13:47.160 --> 13:50.880]  men are running around acting tough and chasing women around the nerds are
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.040]  calculating the takeover of society and there's nothing a scientific demon nerd
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.520]  there's a lot of good nerds out there it's the you know the idiots call them
[14:00.520 --> 14:08.440]  nerds but the demon nerds they enjoy walking into a restaurant feeling
[14:08.440 --> 14:12.320]  powerful and looking around and seeing everybody they're soft killing that's a
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.600]  real pleasure for them that's a real enjoyment that oh you got big muscles
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.840]  you're tough I use my brain the world is mine I'm gonna merge with the high-tech
[14:22.840 --> 14:28.080]  life extension systems I'm gonna be in the high-tech reservation system you're
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.760]  not gonna exist in the future and they're just carrying out a systematic
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.960]  operation well let me tell you something pal I'm not gonna try to join your
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.480]  system even though I've been offered to join it and I am going to fight you 110
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.120]  percent because I've got a good enough brain to know history and to know that
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.840]  you are megalomaniacal all of you that are part of this and you're gonna end up
[14:49.840 --> 14:54.320]  destroying the planet and this stuff's all blowing back on you as well you think
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.240]  you're gonna dig a pit for us you're gonna end up falling into it and so my
[14:59.240 --> 15:10.080]  prime objective prime mission 110 percent dedicated gold is preservation of
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.440]  homosapien sapien my total goal is defense of civilization and the innocence
[15:16.440 --> 15:23.320]  my total goal is the empowerment of humanity and you guys say that's your
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.800]  goal all I see is you wrecking things because you you you Genesis always on
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.240]  the surface claim you're trying to build up humanity by killing the infirm the
[15:33.240 --> 15:40.440]  ignorant the ugly whatever and saving the earth and and and building this big
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.280]  future you're with your positive and negative eugenics building up the
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.320]  beautiful the virtuous the intelligent destroying removing the ugly the infirm
[15:48.320 --> 15:56.000]  the deformed but all I see is you actually targeting the general population
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.520]  because in your own documents you're worried about the maverick bad sons the
[16:01.520 --> 16:09.960]  bad son for those that aren't involved in study of plants is little trees coming
[16:09.960 --> 16:13.760]  up in a grove of trees where you want it manicured they're the little the little
[16:13.760 --> 16:18.680]  trees that crepe myrtles and others send up from their roots and you want to
[16:18.680 --> 16:25.840]  cut those bad sons well I see a bunch of diseased ugly twisted globalist telling
[16:25.840 --> 16:30.800]  us how humanity's ugly we're bad we're hurting everything and then I see you
[16:30.800 --> 16:34.480]  guys with a genetic engineering and all the rest of it openly damaging the
[16:34.480 --> 16:40.160]  planet irrevocably changing the DNA in always in a in an ugly destructive way
[16:40.160 --> 16:49.200]  as you play God and then telling us all day how bad we are no you are everything
[16:49.200 --> 17:04.920]  you are everything you say we are
[17:08.560 --> 17:17.720]  you are everything you say we are and by the way just because somebody
[17:17.720 --> 17:23.160]  isn't your image of beauty or just because somebody doesn't have any arms
[17:23.160 --> 17:31.280]  some of the greatest scientists and artists and thinkers that we have had as
[17:31.280 --> 17:38.000]  a species have have had great disabilities and you notice the
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.040]  globalist play both sides of that they they try to create a nanny state to
[17:42.040 --> 17:51.080]  quote protect everybody who has a disability from everyone else but really
[17:51.080 --> 17:56.360]  they just seek to then have government as this divide and conquer system to

[24:26.920 --> 24:31.760]  need parental consent that the children gave consent children can't give
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.280]  consent that's why perverts always try to say the child gave them consent to
[24:36.280 --> 24:41.880]  rape them doesn't work or people say oh the five-year-old wanted to drink
[24:41.880 --> 24:46.680]  liquor or take drugs doesn't matter of the five-year-old says sure they can't
[24:46.680 --> 24:52.960]  give consent because their children I have police quoted here on local TV
[24:52.960 --> 24:59.560]  clips and the news articles quoted where they say we're gonna take DNA samples
[24:59.560 --> 25:07.560]  from children without warrants or arrest because they gave consent that's the
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.840]  state ending parenthood and it's all part of getting children ready to go to
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.760]  adult prison and to be used as slave labor this is just child slavery and
[25:18.760 --> 25:25.120]  it's totally illegal California is the most lawless wicked government in the

[26:19.560 --> 26:24.720]  number Buddha predates the Buddhist religion pre-dates Christianity by
[26:24.720 --> 26:30.640]  over 500 years so we start celebrating new years about this time same with Mark
[26:30.640 --> 26:36.760]  Faber and it's about the death of Buddha is when the calendar starts it's about
[26:36.760 --> 26:42.880]  500 years that you know like 2555 is where we're at so happy new year and I
[26:42.880 --> 26:48.040]  love what you're doing Alex you're number one man well I try my best thanks

[26:52.880 --> 26:58.200]  doing the best I can so thank you what's on your mind today well you know I
[26:58.200 --> 27:03.880]  wanted to point out that I've done my own research and I've come up with a
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.520]  couple interesting things number one the United States of America is a
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.480]  corporation in Delaware and I've done an extensive video and stuff on it and you
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.280]  be surprised to note that the rock child have over a hundred corporations in the
[27:20.280 --> 27:26.120]  state of Delaware and also that the United States Treasury is a corporation
[27:26.120 --> 27:31.560]  Social Security Administration Corporation well I know the government is
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.000]  now a corporation and does say in court that we are under Admiralty law and
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.560]  that's how they're ignoring the Bill of Rights and Constitution that they
[27:39.560 --> 27:43.320]  declare a new emergency every year it was a big court case in England that did
[27:43.320 --> 27:47.640]  fine the Rothschilds do have dummy corporations everywhere in our puppet
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.880]  masters that was just adjudicated on last month they sued people over saying it
[27:52.880 --> 27:55.800]  but it does turn out a lot of the oligarchs in Russia are their front
[27:55.800 --> 28:01.240]  people yeah the Rothschilds are at the very top of the pyramid yes what I
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.880]  like to hear you say that just stay in the focus now talking about what are we
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.240]  going to do about this the people that have woken up what can we actually do
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.080]  and I'm always in favor of a march or something you know it we've the toes
[28:14.080 --> 28:17.920]  already been put in the water by the Occupy Wall Street people you know you
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.480]  don't have to go that particular route but we can see that they got national
[28:22.480 --> 28:28.960]  attention worldwide attention to this matter would you maybe reconsider
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.080]  marshaling your forces so to speak and to have some kind of a nation my wide
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.720]  march against all of this because you know the ACLU is not coming to our aid
[28:39.720 --> 28:45.840]  or any of these that sure I'll say this Ron Paul is speaking to crowds of five
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.560]  10 12,000 people almost every day and it and next time I talk to Ron Paul which
[28:51.560 --> 28:56.320]  I know we're close to getting back on I mean I will advise him look point these
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.800]  youth afterwards say I'm gonna lead you in a march to your state capital where
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.520]  we're gonna demand your state stand up say against the TSA and so I'll say
[29:06.520 --> 29:14.880]  Ron Paul you know really in the twilight of his career here but but but where he's
[29:14.880 --> 29:21.280]  at his most powerful he needs now to marshal people more than I can so I
[29:21.280 --> 29:28.720]  appreciate your call and at the same time they have big marches in DC all the
[29:28.720 --> 29:31.880]  time of even hundreds of thousands of people and the media doesn't cover it
[29:31.880 --> 29:34.920]  you see the media covering Ron Paul having ten thousand people a day at
[29:34.920 --> 29:44.200]  rallies no so Ron Paul needs to point those crowds occupying for liberty for a
[29:44.200 --> 29:51.040]  few days major targets in the area to force media coverage we're on the March
[29:51.040 --> 30:01.400]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network I had tried

[33:48.920 --> 33:54.480]  study links autism with industrial food and environmental toxins April is
[33:54.480 --> 33:59.040]  autism awareness month and boy everybody's going to get aware of it
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.040]  because now adults are getting autism like neurological disorders even in a
[34:03.040 --> 34:08.360]  young age and because there are so many toxins in our food and water and then you
[34:08.360 --> 34:17.440]  go ahead and shoot somebody up with some more vaccines on top of it and you are
[34:17.440 --> 34:26.320]  going to have a big big problem and again I'll get into climate alarmist calls
[34:26.320 --> 34:36.320]  for burning down skeptics homes and that's Forbes Forbes is again also saying
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.200]  that Bill Gates is a hero and those that are worried about autism are zeros
[34:41.200 --> 34:49.120]  that's an actual quote headline Bill Gates a hero people concerned about
[34:49.120 --> 35:06.600]  autism well they are zeros now the stuff gets me so angry all the time that a
[35:06.600 --> 35:12.960]  it exhausts me by early in the day and be I can barely contain myself at just
[35:12.960 --> 35:20.000]  how naked and open the the evil is the system is getting desperate and so
[35:20.000 --> 35:27.320]  they're throwing everything they've got against the population but I just think
[35:27.320 --> 35:32.280]  about the fact that they're saying anybody concerned about autism is a piece
[35:32.280 --> 35:38.040]  of trash Bill Gates a eugenicist is a hero Ben Bernanke is a hero Atlantic
[35:38.040 --> 35:41.880]  monthly they're now attacking us today for being concerned about tracker tech
[35:41.880 --> 35:48.280]  in cars and other appliances which is admitted by the CIA to be listening and
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.720]  watching everybody in live time illegally Google for six years admits
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.600]  they're using onboard microphones and cameras to watch you illegally they've
[35:57.600 --> 36:01.920]  now been sued last week by a big public interest group over the fact they're
[36:01.920 --> 36:07.120]  wiretapping people's homes without warrants it's totally illegal but Forbes
[36:07.120 --> 36:14.160]  says we should have our houses burned down you're not gonna see the Secret
[36:14.160 --> 36:17.480]  Service some of their talking to them because the Secret Service doesn't care
[36:17.480 --> 36:20.680]  if you get your house burned down you know these quote environmentalists not
[36:20.680 --> 36:24.440]  what they are they're terrorists and give us control of the economy let us run
[36:24.440 --> 36:27.400]  everything we're gonna burn down your ski resort we're gonna burn down your
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.280]  house you build in Oregon they've killed people in the last few years where
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.760]  people were in a home and they burned the thing down well in one case I saw
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.920]  where it was a handicapped person they couldn't get out if you go down to
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.960]  Zilker Park where I live in Austin Texas and you pull up in the parking area
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.080]  there's glass littering windshield glass side windshield glass everywhere you
[36:52.080 --> 36:58.000]  know the shatter type not the front windshield but the side windows and it's
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  a little known secret some know it it's somewhat of a public secret the police
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.440]  know it that if you park your SUV down there and take your children to the park
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.840]  or go swim at Barton Springs the environmentalists knock your windows
[37:12.840 --> 37:18.760]  out or bare minimum key your car up one side and down the other doesn't matter
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.200]  if you've got three or four children and your wife doesn't matter if you're a
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.540]  carpenter and you need an SUV it's their little way of punishing you and Al Gore
[37:27.540 --> 37:31.520]  says time to get aggressive time to get outside the law time for an
[37:31.520 --> 37:37.000]  environmental spring let me tell you something I catch anybody trying to burn
[37:37.000 --> 37:45.400]  my house down you're gonna get a lead spring and so Forbes is saying keep track
[37:45.400 --> 37:54.360]  of people and track them down find their homes in Forbes and burn their house
[37:54.360 --> 38:00.360]  down they need to be arrested just like the new Black Panther Party feds just
[38:00.360 --> 38:03.960]  like I said how Turner should be arrested tells you it was a Fed it turned out he
[38:03.960 --> 38:09.800]  was I demand the arrest because this isn't flipping in this election like
[38:09.800 --> 38:14.760]  Braveheart we need to chop their heads off clearly hyperbole and he said in the
[38:14.760 --> 38:18.080]  unedited tape that's what the Secret Service said no issue no investigation
[38:18.080 --> 38:23.580]  they saw the full tape he was saying metaphorically but the George Soros
[38:23.580 --> 38:29.040]  connected group cut the video up the unedited video just like NBC edited a
[38:29.040 --> 38:35.120]  video to make George Zimmerman sound like a racist they edited the tape he said
[38:35.120 --> 38:39.720]  in this election we need to literally kill ourselves to get this done
[38:39.720 --> 38:43.960]  metaphorically we need to politically take no prisoners I mean if I say we
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.040]  need to politically take no prisoners in a zoning fight does that mean kill
[38:49.040 --> 38:56.160]  everybody no it doesn't but when you say find the climate skeptics homes go to
[38:56.160 --> 39:05.080]  their homes I have the quotes right here and kill them burn their houses down in
[39:05.080 --> 39:10.240]  fact guys do me a favor call Paul Watson if he's not out and I'll get him on Skype
[39:10.240 --> 39:12.960]  I want to talk to him on air after I take some calls because I just had a
[39:12.960 --> 39:19.440]  realization we need to get a compendium article together to show that the
[39:19.440 --> 39:23.760]  environment the fake environmentalist power grabbers this this mafia this this
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.960]  eugenics gang is giving orders out everywhere well they say stop it just
[39:28.960 --> 39:35.280]  ignore democracy shut things down arrest people that disagree with us arrest
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.560]  Lord Moncton arrest all these people that we ought to get on the nightly news
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.520]  tonight Mark Moreno I know Rob do's and they're listening to get him to talk
[39:44.520 --> 39:48.560]  about this because this is a new level it was just hitting me again that I
[39:48.560 --> 39:54.520]  become so accustomed to them saying kill us burn us the rest is you know I mean
[39:54.520 --> 39:58.280]  this is like the Nazis saying when we get power we're gonna start arresting
[39:58.280 --> 40:03.800]  and killing people you better listen or the Soviets saying when we get power
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.560]  we're gonna do this I mean you better listen they're authoritarians they
[40:07.560 --> 40:14.680]  mean business they mean business I mean they attack bulldozers they put spikes
[40:14.680 --> 40:20.600]  in trees some poor loggers sawing through it in some renewable resource and it
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.480]  kills them last time I checked it's in the 50s the people that have been killed
[40:25.480 --> 40:32.040]  just by spikes you run a big industrial chainsaw you hit that man it's that
[40:32.040 --> 40:35.560]  chain flies out hits your throat like a razor blade a hundred miles an hour
[40:35.560 --> 40:40.640]  across your neck and they think it's funny meanwhile the honeybees are dying
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.160]  from the GMO you could care less meanwhile all the real environmental
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.440]  degradation at Lord Moncton overfishing toxic waste dumping all that's real
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.920]  there's real environmental problems but pay in carbon taxes to Al Gore and
[40:53.920 --> 41:00.600]  calling for burning down my house you don't burn down my house let me tell
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.800]  you something they've already killed people and now you've got Forbes one of
[41:04.800 --> 41:10.560]  the most respected outfits there is period this is absolutely incredible
[41:10.560 --> 41:13.760]  yeah tell Paul I want to dial him on Skype right now or put him on the phone
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.120]  but his phone is terrible most phones not terrible he's 7,000 miles away from
[41:18.120 --> 41:24.680]  us in England climate alarmist calls for burning down skeptics home writing for
[41:24.680 --> 41:30.000]  Forbes magazine climate change alarmist Steve Zwick well he's not even an
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.520]  alarmist now he's calling for terrorist acts calls for skeptics of man-made
[41:34.520 --> 41:38.000]  global warming to be tracked hunted down and have their homes burned to the
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.280]  ground yet another shocking illustration about eco-fascism is rife
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.520]  with the environmentalist lobby let me tell you these aren't strong enough
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.560]  words Paul when you're and we've got his quotes here saying come after us burn
[41:51.560 --> 42:01.080]  our houses down if I got on air and said I'm not saying this but you know this
[42:01.080 --> 42:06.680]  senator didn't do what we wanted or Obama it says we're under UN control our
[42:06.680 --> 42:11.520]  military ish go burn the White House down folks there would be police here in
[42:11.520 --> 42:17.560]  20 minutes if I said if I organize through a major media outlet which we
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.560]  have millions of listeners and readers it would not be there just their duty it
[42:23.560 --> 42:31.880]  would be an absolute command that I'd be arrested if I stole people to do that
[42:31.880 --> 42:35.040]  instead
[42:42.080 --> 42:49.240]  climate alarmist calls for burning down skeptics homes comparing climate change
[42:49.240 --> 42:55.200]  skeptics to residents in Tennessee were paves to pay a $75 fee resulting in
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.560]  firemen sitting back and watching their houses burn down zwick rants that
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.400]  anyone who actively questions global warming propaganda should face the same
[43:03.400 --> 43:11.080]  treatment we know who the active denialist are not the people who buy the
[43:11.080 --> 43:15.960]  lies mind you but the people who create the lies oh we're all liars because we
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.480]  expose Al Gore is an admitted liar who makes computer graphics of polar bears
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.600]  that can't swim dying one of the greatest land animal swimmer and hunt by
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.840]  swimming on top ice flows or lying about the hockey stick or lying about
[43:29.840 --> 43:35.520]  carbon dioxide increases preceding temperature increases when it's the
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.160]  other way around or lying about ice samples or lying in the emails about
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.400]  hiding the decline in temperature in the last 15 years this is what we're
[43:45.400 --> 43:52.040]  talking about and again it's an even worse call because he's like they're
[43:52.040 --> 43:58.120]  endangering us we've got to get them that's a real call to action we know
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.280]  who the active denialist are not the people who buy the lies mind you but
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.240]  the people who create the lies let's start keeping track of them now keeping
[44:05.240 --> 44:09.920]  track of you pal is it as somebody calling for violence and when the famines
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.320]  come because the globalists are cutting the food supplies off that that's what
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.160]  gen 21 is under the rule is to shut the food off then they say we created the
[44:18.160 --> 44:25.640]  famine see how that works let's make them pay let's let their houses burn let's
[44:25.640 --> 44:31.240]  swap their safe land for submerged islands yeah that's that's the real
[44:31.240 --> 44:34.800]  commie banker dream the Rothschild Rockefeller dream take our property
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.320]  what these again they create the global meltdown then they come and redistribute
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.080]  they tell the big poor hordes of people that didn't get ready oh there it's
[44:43.080 --> 44:49.320]  their fault get them let's force them to bear the cost of rising food prices
[44:49.320 --> 44:55.280]  adding they broke the climate why should the rest of us pay for it see we need
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.280]  to be arrested we'd have our land taken we'd have our houses burned down and
[44:59.280 --> 45:03.760]  there's all these other quotes where these people are saying similar things
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.240]  to this as we have profusely documented as polls show fewer and fewer
[45:09.240 --> 45:12.920]  Americans are convinced by the pseudo science behind main main global warming
[45:12.920 --> 45:18.240]  promulgated as it is by control freaks like zwick who care more about money and
[45:18.240 --> 45:24.000]  power than they do the environment AGW adherents are becoming increasingly
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.320]  authoritarian in their pronouncements and it goes through it all we're getting
[45:29.320 --> 45:36.880]  Watson on Skype we close to that let's go to a call here Rico in Canada
[45:36.880 --> 45:43.960]  Rico what do you make of this where they're now saying burn our houses down
[45:43.960 --> 45:52.760]  very dangerous like where's any very fascistic but that's definitely the
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.760]  climate where it's going that's right fascism labeled as liberalism
[45:57.760 --> 46:06.840]  correct what's on your mind sir I am there's the court to check court a
[46:06.840 --> 46:16.040]  while back does that to to to put on to put it across while back the duty of
[46:16.040 --> 46:23.440]  the state is to what was it again my god I didn't mind the duty of the state is
[46:23.440 --> 46:31.120]  to yeah make war make war that's like the affairs of the state I remember I love
[46:31.120 --> 46:35.760]  that quote so I remembered it it was it's actually as you had quoted it the
[46:35.760 --> 46:42.760]  Germans got it from sons who the art of war and also the book of Lord shang this
[46:42.760 --> 46:46.480]  it's another book that was written around the warring state spirit yeah well
[46:46.480 --> 46:52.160]  I think the quote you're referring to is war is the health of the state that's
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.320]  it that's it you're fair of the state yes yeah that's that's a quote from sons
[46:57.320 --> 47:00.880]  who in a book of Lord shang that's correct and that's why it's a war
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.800]  economy everything is the government and its allied crime corporations waging
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.560]  war on everybody else war on drugs is their war to have a monopoly on the
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.360]  drugs that they ship in the war on illiteracy is to make sure you're
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.920]  totally dumbed down you know the war on nationalism the war on men the war on
[47:18.920 --> 47:24.240]  women the war on the family but yeah any time that there's a so-called war to
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.640]  deep no it gets worse that's just what I've seen no exactly when they say they
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.360]  want to help women yeah they want to put you in a pine box correct yeah and and
[47:34.360 --> 47:40.120]  there was also I was looking forward because you were talking about how you
[47:40.120 --> 47:46.560]  were going to get some historians on talking about of how component ran the
[47:46.560 --> 47:51.480]  booze on the train and it was a government train I was really looking
[47:51.480 --> 47:54.960]  forward I don't know why it's like we can get guests all the time I brought on
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.080]  the names the numbers and about particularly beg for a guest it ain't
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.360]  happening so some I went to hot springs I started doing some of the interviews
[48:04.360 --> 48:07.320]  with people and I said no it's just better to get you on and then it never
[48:07.320 --> 48:13.320]  happened and I will try to get that done because I was there going to different
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.040]  historical societies and they were just it had all the documents with the
[48:17.040 --> 48:21.240]  government actually had the monopoly with insiders Capone worked with them the
[48:21.240 --> 48:24.720]  rock the Rockefellers were big and it was amazing information thank you so
[48:24.720 --> 48:31.520]  much for your call yeah that's something that we did and video I shot and it's
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.480]  it's weird I got a great crew but it's strange if I say I really want this I
[48:36.480 --> 48:42.080]  think there's I don't know what it's weird it's weird and I asked probably 25
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.920]  times you know let's let's get those guests on and I think it's always so
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.880]  immediate whatever guest we're working on at the at that moment that it then
[48:49.880 --> 48:55.080]  doesn't happen but you know so you might hell might freeze over for that
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.680]  happens let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas John you're on the air go
[49:00.680 --> 49:07.080]  ahead hi Alex hey buddy that when I was in high school in the mid 60s I took a
[49:07.080 --> 49:11.600]  government course and they talked about the anti-trust laws and how Andrew
[49:11.600 --> 49:15.920]  Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller back in early 1900s were trying to monopolize
[49:15.920 --> 49:19.720]  business and drive all the independence out and if I remember correctly it was
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.080]  Teddy Roosevelt to help get the anti-trust laws passed and that's where
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.600]  the term come from speak softly and carry a big stick the big stick was a
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.480]  break up these monopolies but what I'm asking is what happened to the anti-trust
[49:30.480 --> 49:33.640]  laws you don't hear about them anymore it was all a giant hoax the the the
[49:33.640 --> 49:37.440]  private banks lobbied against the Federal Reserve Act knowing that they
[49:37.440 --> 49:41.000]  were the enemy and discredited they lobbied against the Federal Reserve Act
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  and said please don't throw me in the briar patch and of course you know the
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.720]  rabbit wants to be thrown in the briar patch okay oh you've captured me please
[49:47.720 --> 49:54.880]  eat me don't throw me in the briar patch okay so you know that's happening and
[49:54.880 --> 49:58.120]  it was the same thing with the Sherman anti-trust act the people knew there
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.560]  were monopolies they knew they'd robbed everybody they had big gangs of goons
[50:02.560 --> 50:06.560]  paramilitary that would come take your land people started fighting back so
[50:06.560 --> 50:10.880]  they said okay we'll break it up so they broke standard oil up into 10 pieces
[50:10.880 --> 50:15.920]  later two more so 12 pieces they broke all these up but they never really got
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.520]  rid of them it was just different flavors and it's like in England they
[50:20.520 --> 50:26.000]  have you know two major retailers for groceries but it's owned by the same
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.760]  group it's just different subsidiaries and so there was no anti-trust act none
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.320]  of that happened none of that was real and to get around it things like IBM
[50:35.320 --> 50:39.080]  created Microsoft and they picked the son of a top eugenicist to do it it's
[50:39.080 --> 50:44.160]  all it's all fake you Steve Jaws people like that they're their fronts as well
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.120]  and actually you can go do research in it and discover all that so it's all
[50:49.120 --> 50:54.840]  just a handful of old families running the entire thing good questions we'll be
[50:54.840 --> 50:57.720]  right back stay with us
[51:00.480 --> 51:05.080]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[51:05.080 --> 51:09.160]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[51:09.160 --> 51:13.560]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.440]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be
[51:18.440 --> 51:22.800]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team.com but

[1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:08.280]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or

[1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:25.200]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:29.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:33.920]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:37.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:06.160]  cheese or or cabbages I mean it's just they're rating whole food companies with
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:12.360]  guns drawn I mean it's bazaar again where's Obama the hippie they're not

[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:23.920]  just a moment but I promise to get to more calls today so I'm gonna finish up
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:31.720]  with TJ in Georgia a WJOC 1490 a.m. listener TJ you're on the air welcome
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:36.600]  well thanks Alex thanks so much for what you do I don't know how you carry
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:41.200]  the cross but even us little soldiers are fighting a pretty good fight for you
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:45.880]  and I collect all your DVDs I got a hundred and five and the one thing I
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:49.760]  wanted to ask you after looking at all these DVDs and handing them out like
[1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:55.000]  Coca-Cola you know you say using their system against them and Jim Tucker says
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:00.920]  good works are done in the sunshine but do we as fighters of this good fight do
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:06.320]  we have people a secret society of iron people you know good nights and
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:10.840]  paladins with a noble heart who you know believe in this fight but are trying
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:15.160]  to do use their system against them as far as let's use a little secrecy too we
[1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:19.320]  don't have to always be in the open do we have anything going like that you
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:23.000]  know I obviously don't mention the name of a secret group but are we fighting
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.920]  behind the scenes as well do you think well of course secrecy is in
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.840]  organizations where you have to have secrecy government corporations there
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.120]  are groups of people that love freedom throughout the system that's the reason
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:37.720]  we still have part of the republic that's the reason people are waking up
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:43.600]  that's the reason you know that a lot of us were able to do what we do but you know
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:48.120]  we have the truth so secrecy is a disadvantage to us when we're out in
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:51.840]  the open but you know if somebody's going to spray paint the front of a
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:55.480]  building you know a government building or something they better keep that
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:59.840]  secret I'm not saying they should do that you know the environmental fakes who
[1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:03.880]  are blocking real environmental issues we have are saying burn down people that
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:08.080]  don't want to pay Al Gore carbon taxes you know Forbes says burn down somebody's
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:12.920]  house mark down our names burn our houses down and I'm like hey you got
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:16.760]  hundreds of cross species crops being planted that are causing mutations in
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:20.680]  every species that eat them you've got serious other environmental issues I
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:25.960]  don't want to have a global tax you know for carbon to oxide and they're like
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:30.040]  we'll burn your house down I mean that's in the news today so you ask the
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:37.280]  question I can barely organize what I'm doing here and in secret organizations
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:42.360]  they can then infiltrate people to create secret criminal plots to then set
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:48.480]  you up in them so my my beacon my North Star is total transparency and openness
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:54.000]  other than my journalistic hat people say now this is in confidence it happens
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.960]  all the time and I'm known for not blowing confidence with people and let me
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:02.520]  tell you that word has gone out in the system in media in government that a in
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:09.040]  business I don't cheat people I always do what I say I'm gonna do be I don't tell
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:16.360]  my sources and so I'm known as somebody who so I guess they're I guess I'm a
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:21.600]  journalist that's a secret system does that answer your question yeah I think
[1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:25.720]  so and one quick point do you believe just like Sodom who's saying jump down a
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:31.040]  spider hole and hit or kill themselves if he cornered these roaches with with
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.200]  the light of the sunshine and fighting the fight like you and all of us are
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:37.480]  doing what do you think these people will do when we finally get them cornered
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:44.520]  just bite into a finite capsule like the cowards they are yes there is a good
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:48.520]  chance that's exactly what'll happen but I mean again it's a corrupt system
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:57.560]  society itself has been corrupt we empower evil when when when when we do
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:01.480]  evil things when we compromise when we do bad things and doesn't mean we're ever
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:07.200]  gonna be perfect but again it's little things that are gonna turn things around
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:12.400]  yeah it's God bless you and thanks for the time we appreciate you more than
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:17.760]  you'll ever know thank you so much sir okay
[1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:23.800]  Kristen Canty is a director and producer and has made Pharma Geddon that is
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:28.160]  just stunningly well done I mean I put it in the DVD player and could not quit
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:34.000]  watching it and I think it dovetails with the agenda 21 book that we have an
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:38.920]  info wars.com behind the green mask you engine 21 Rosa Corey people don't
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:42.280]  understand why they're attacking lemonade stands why they're attacking
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:46.040]  Amish why they're attacking little whole food stores with guns drawn over
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:52.880]  cabbages or or you know dates it's the idea of you know shutting down swap
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:58.160]  meat shutting down small markets shutting down anything that the people
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:02.080]  can use to survive in this imploded economy the globalists are engineering
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:06.280]  depression because they want to break our will and make us dependent they don't
[1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:09.640]  want us in a depression to become self-sufficient again so that's what the
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:15.720]  world councils are that's what all these systems are and it's there to make
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:20.280]  sure big agriculture can take over as the UN has said food is a weapon so going
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:26.160]  to Kristen the director and we also are joined by one of the victims and I'll
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:31.640]  let her introduce Linda and tell you her story Kristen thank you so much for
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:39.440]  coming on with us and great job with Farmer getting great name to we may have
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:44.840]  lost her lost her audio we're gonna try to bring her back up whenever we get a
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:50.560]  chance okay yeah okay good so we're gonna have to have them come up in a
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:53.560]  minute because of that difficulty
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:16:01.240]  okay let's continue with your phone calls then since they're coming up you
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:07.560]  guys hear me like an ounce of them for 10 minutes I tell you what go to rebroadcast
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:33.240]  the classroom
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:42.760]  disabled
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:58.560]  politics are really
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:01.400]  of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:03.800]  Lay down, GI, lay down, GI.
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:05.800]  We saw it all through the 20th century,
[1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:07.240]  and now in the 21st century,
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.200]  it's time to state that we realize
[1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:10.560]  that we should not allow ourselves
[1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:12.360]  to be crammed into this rat maze.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:15.120]  We should not submit to dehumanization.
[1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.200]  I don't know about you,
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:18.760]  but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world.
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.440]  I'm concerned with the structure.
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:22.800]  I'm concerned with the systems of control.
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.160]  Those that control my life
[1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.200]  and those that seek to control it even more.
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.240]  I want freedom.
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.120]  That's what I want, and that's what you should want.
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:32.480]  It's up to each and every one of us
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:34.520]  to turn this into just some of the freedom,
[1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:37.640]  the hatred, the envy, and yes, the insecurities,
[1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:39.480]  because that is the central mode of control.
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:41.560]  Make us feel we're fed, small,
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:44.400]  so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty,
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:46.680]  our liberty, our destiny.
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:49.680]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:51.160]  on a mass scale.
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:54.000]  Start challenging this corporate slave state.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.320]  The 21st century's gonna be a new century,
[1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:59.720]  not the century of slavery, not the century of lies,
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.120]  and it's gonna be the notion of giving us
[1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:05.600]  a classism, a stateism, and all the rest of the modes of control.
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:07.480]  It's gonna be the age of humankind
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:10.600]  standing up for something pure and something right.
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:12.200]  What a bunch of garbage, liberal,
[1:18:12.200 --> 1:18:14.640]  democratic, conservative, Republican.
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:17.800]  It's all there to control you two sides of the same coin.
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:20.440]  Two management teams getting for control,
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:23.520]  the CEO job of slavery incorporated.
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:25.280]  The truth is out there in front of you,
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:27.480]  but they lay out this buffet of lies.
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:30.320]  I'm sick of it, and I'm not gonna take a bite out of it.
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:31.640]  Do you got me?
[1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:33.000]  This is not human.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.080]  This is not human.
[1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:36.560]  Humankind is too good.
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:38.320]  We're not a bunch of underachievers.
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:40.920]  We're gonna stand up, and we're gonna be human beings.
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:43.120]  We're gonna find real things,
[1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:45.520]  the things that matter, creativity,
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:49.480]  and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:50.320]  Well, that's it.
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:51.160]  That's all I got to say.
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:56.160]  Continue your course.
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:07.520]  we are back live here today.
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:11.400]  And we do have our guests coming up to the bottom of the hour.
[1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.920]  I'll go to break and come back with more of your calls.
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:18.640]  I look at the news here,
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:22.400]  and I look at autism going from one in 25,000 plus
[1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:24.120]  to one in 50-something now.
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:27.520]  The media is always reporting a two-year-old number.
[1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.120]  It was one in 80-something, then one in 60-something.
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:33.040]  I see the damaged children everywhere.
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:34.720]  I see the globalists making jokes about it.
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:35.600]  I know their plan.
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:36.680]  I know their program.
[1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:39.440]  I know Bill Gates is paying the media
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:40.800]  to say he's a superhero.
[1:19:40.800 --> 1:19:42.480]  Actually, say he's a superhero.
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:45.720]  I see men acting like children,
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:48.160]  women acting like dumb whores.
[1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:49.600]  I see this whole society
[1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:52.280]  as a Sodom and Gomorrah falling down on itself.
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:55.680]  And all I want to do is defeat these new world order people.
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:57.720]  I mean, they're so out in the open,
[1:19:57.720 --> 1:19:58.880]  and they're coming for us.
[1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:00.080]  We've got to stop them.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:02.480]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:05.840]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team
[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.600]  want to relay to you and your families
[1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.960]  that we are intensifying our efforts
[1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:13.160]  against the globalist on every front.
[1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.640]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[1:20:17.640 --> 1:20:20.360]  But we can't do that without your help
[1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:22.600]  by getting the films, bumper stickers,
[1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:24.960]  and t-shirts at infowars.com.
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.120]  You will wake up people in your area
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:31.640]  and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:35.160]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:38.480]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:41.240]  between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:45.160]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:48.920]  and their program of global eugenics dehumanization,
[1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:51.160]  and ultimate extermination.
[1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:52.600]  The war is here.
[1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:54.560]  It's an info war.
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:59.560]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.680]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems
[1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:06.160]  are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:07.800]  As an authorized Berkey dealer,
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:09.800]  for over six years in serving thousands
[1:21:09.800 --> 1:21:11.120]  of satisfied customers,
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:13.560]  the Berkey guy offers amazing specials
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:15.600]  for Berkey water filtration systems.
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.320]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self sterilizing
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:20.480]  and recleanable black purification elements

[1:23:00.920 --> 1:23:02.480]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead,
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:04.120]  founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:06.040]  I designed our top-selling holster,
[1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:08.720]  the super-tucked deluxe to solve the problems
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.800]  of being poked, pinched, and gouged
[1:23:10.800 --> 1:23:12.160]  while carrying concealed.
[1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:14.640]  The super-tucked deluxe is the most comfortable,

[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:06.600]  All right, we have our guest coming up.
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:09.600]  I was looking at my sheet wrong, and nobody noticed.
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:12.600]  I was announcing the wrong time for the guest to be on.
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  They're coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:16.600]  I'm not even so much having a bad day.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:18.600]  I'm actually having a very focused day,
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  and that's why I am...
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  I'm not even so much having a bad day.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:25.600]  I'm actually having a very focused day,
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:28.600]  and that's why I am...
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  I am trying to learn to not blow up,
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:33.600]  because then it exhausts me.
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  So instead, I blow up even worse
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:39.600]  and just get super irritated and super irritable,
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:43.600]  and I'm normally a very happy person.
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  It's just...
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:48.600]  It's so confirmed that a lot of these processed foods
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  on purpose, it's full of heavy metals,
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:55.600]  it's grainyard reagents, it's killing people,
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  it's horrible, it's a horror movie.
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  And I want it to stop.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:03.600]  And then a guy calls in and talks about a city council
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:06.600]  laughing at him when he goes and talks about taking fluoride out.
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:09.600]  And I know what that means.
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:10.600]  I know.
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:11.600]  I've seen it myself.
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.600]  And I know that under the name fluoride,
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:17.600]  they put several hundred deadly chemicals in your water,
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:18.600]  and it's just...
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:19.600]  I'm mad at myself.
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:21.600]  I'm going to be honest with you,
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:25.600]  because the real response to somebody assaulting your family like that
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:27.600]  is to physically go after them.
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:29.600]  But then I realize how the games played,
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  they're set up for that, and I'll lose,
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.600]  and we'll lose if we don't,
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:38.600]  so I attack them with psychic violence.
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  And that's not even done consciously.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:43.600]  And by psychic, I mean throwing my words, my anger,
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  my disgust at them.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:47.600]  I want to take back the levers of power.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:52.600]  I want to restore sanity and decency.
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:56.600]  I cannot look at a photograph of Bill Gates, okay?
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.600]  I mean, I know who they are.
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:01.600]  It's like serial killers running free,
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.600]  with TV everywhere saying they're superheroes.
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:05.600]  I mean, I want to stop.
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.600]  And I've got to find a balance,
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:11.600]  because my rage and my focus is why we've been so successful,
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  but at the same time, it's not good.
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.600]  This is not an act.
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:19.600]  I feel like right now, I could take on like 10 people.
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:21.600]  I mean, you know that feeling.
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  I mean, I am just viciously angry, viciously disgusted,
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:30.600]  and viciously tired of the pig people that run our society.
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  And I'm angry, too, that I have to put myself in danger fighting them.
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:35.600]  I wish more people just wake up,
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  we could sweep these people aside.
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:39.600]  I'm angry.
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:43.600]  And you've got to get angry, too, and then take action.
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:47.600]  Richard in Kansas, thanks for holding.
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.600]  Glad to hold any time, man.
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:52.600]  What's on your mind, brother?
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:55.600]  It seems to me that calling to burn our houses down
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:58.600]  is another desperate scare tactic by the Illuminati
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:00.600]  to get everybody to give up their rights and go,
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.600]  oh, here's our money, here's our money.
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  Well, it shows what scum they are.
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:09.600]  I mean, do they think they're already doing it?
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:13.600]  Look, I get my hair cut and hear the woman three things down,
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  saying global warming is all a fraud and all the women agreeing.
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.600]  And I get my hair cut at a trendy place just by my house.
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  The point is that people are waking up,
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:25.600]  they're buying five million guns a month.
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:28.600]  I just want to make sure everybody knows who the enemy is.
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:30.600]  So we all just fight with each other.
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.600]  A bunch of whites and blacks killing each other,
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:34.600]  or Hispanics and killing each other.
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:36.600]  It's all bull.
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.600]  You see what I'm saying?
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:40.600]  Exactly.
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  People need to let things like race and religion and social status,
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:46.600]  these kind of walls need to just be dropped.
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:49.600]  These are curves that are about a half inch high
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:51.600]  that only a person dragging their feet
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.600]  cannot step above at this point.
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:58.600]  I think they're miscalculating with all these calls for violence against us,
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:00.600]  or I guess they're trying to get hyped up to do it.
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:02.600]  I mean, look, that's what I'm saying.
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:04.600]  Everybody that wants violence, let's work against it.
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.600]  And then when they start the fights, you know what to do.
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:09.600]  You understand?
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:11.600]  But we must let them attack first
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:13.600]  because we must have the moral authority.
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:16.600]  Do you understand those that are being attacked have the real power?
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:19.600]  I mean, do you understand that universal law?
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:21.600]  Exactly.
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:24.600]  You always have to be prepared to let the enemy throw the first punch.
[1:28:24.600 --> 1:28:28.600]  You just have to prepare yourself to be able to handle the first punch
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.600]  and then defend yourself from there.
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:33.600]  That's right.
[1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:35.600]  That's why I tell the New World Order,
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:37.600]  I love life so much, strike me down.
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:40.600]  Because I don't want to die, but I take that power away from you.
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  I am committed.
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:44.600]  I just wish people knew how real this is.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:46.600]  I mean, I've told the stories of being physically attacked,
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:48.600]  people threatening to kill me,
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:51.600]  and letting me know they were listening to my phone conversations
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:53.600]  to let me know, like that intimidates me.
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:57.600]  All that did was put 10 years of fire in my gas tank.
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:28:59.600]  The point is, the general public listening,
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:01.600]  I want you to understand something, this is real.
[1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:04.600]  I've talked to high level people in Fox News
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  who are convinced and they know Breitbart was killed,
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:08.600]  but they're too cowardly to report it.
[1:29:08.600 --> 1:29:10.600]  Okay? This is real, folks.
[1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:12.600]  This is real. This is real.
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:14.600]  We have stinking criminals in the White House,
[1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:17.600]  stinking criminals over the Justice Department,
[1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:19.600]  stinking criminals in the CIA,
[1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:21.600]  not everybody under them,
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:24.600]  but at the top, our country has been hijacked.
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:26.600]  Anything else?
[1:29:26.600 --> 1:29:30.600]  Basically, to the same people that you're addressing,
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  to everyone that's listening,
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:34.600]  prepare yourself for the big punch.
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:36.600]  The right cross is coming.
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:39.600]  Just be ready to take it and be ready to hit them back
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  as hard as they hit you.
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:44.600]  Or to step out of the way and karate chop them right in the neck.
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:30:13.600]  And for war, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:16.600]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:48.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:52.600]  That's 877-327-0365.
[1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:54.600]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[1:30:54.600 --> 1:30:57.600]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:26.600]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:48.600]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:50.600]  The director of Pharma Geddon,
[1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:52.600]  Kristin Canty is our guest
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:56.600]  and she's also joined us with Linda Follis
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  who has been a victim
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:02.600]  of the establishment persecution
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:05.600]  for her evil farming activities.
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:07.600]  But the point is we're told get sustainable,
[1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  get back to the land.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  But then there's a massive rural council,
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:14.600]  federal state governments harassing people,
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:16.600]  can't have gardens in your yard,
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:17.600]  even on your own property,
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:19.600]  can't have chickens in the country,
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  zoning, total control, animal ID, premises ID.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:27.600]  This film is so professional.
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:29.600]  Pharma Geddon and it goes over all this information
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:32.600]  and is available at infowars.com
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:34.600]  and it's won a lot of awards.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.600]  The LA Times called it an eye-popping wake-up call.
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:41.600]  Kristin, tell us about the film,
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.600]  why you decided to make it,
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:45.600]  break down some of the most important points
[1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:48.600]  and then introduce us to the author you've gone on with us
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.600]  who has been persecuted
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  and is similar to the stories that are in your film.
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:55.600]  Thank you.
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:59.600]  I made the film because I found out about the farm raids.
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:02.600]  I met people from the Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  and they asked me to have a fundraiser for them.
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  I didn't know what they did
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:08.600]  and when I researched it,
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:11.600]  I found out that they were defending all these farmers
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.600]  for free that have been raided
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  and so I researched all the raids
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:18.600]  and just got really angry about it,
[1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:21.600]  that these people were just trying to supply food
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:23.600]  for their neighbors.
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  People were forming co-ops
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  in order to get food from their neighbors
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.600]  in order to get food from neighboring farms.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.600]  Humans were going back to normal human activity
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:33.600]  and the big corporations don't like that.
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  And the government was raiding them for it.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:38.600]  So I decided to make a movie about it.
[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:41.600]  Well, it's an incredible film and it's so well done.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:42.600]  How long did it take you to make it?
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:44.600]  It's been very well received.
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:47.600]  It's a great tool to show the coordinated mafia attacks
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  on farming communities.
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:52.600]  And then why do you think the system is so upset
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:56.600]  about evil people farming?
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:35:58.600]  It took me about two and a half years to make
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:02.600]  and basically the answer that the government will give you,
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:04.600]  the answer that, you know, I was very grateful
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  when government officials did speak on my film
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  because it was very hard to get them to speak
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  and the answer that they'll give you always
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.600]  is it's in the name of food safety to keep us safe.
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  And so Linda will tell you her story
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:20.600]  and she was raided and her sheep were killed
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  and also in the name of food safety.
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:26.600]  And let's go to Linda.
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.600]  Linda, tell us your story that you then put
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  in your book, Mad Sheep, Author of Mad Sheep.
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:34.600]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:37.600]  What happened with us is that we had a family farm.
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:40.600]  It's called Three Shepherds in Honor of Our Three Children
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:44.600]  because each of our children were very involved with the farm
[1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  and we worked closely with the USDA.
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:50.600]  Imported sheep from Belgium and the Netherlands
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.600]  went through all the loops, the hoops that we had to jump through.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  We had two months of quarantine over in Europe,
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:00.600]  a month of quarantine here in the United States
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:03.600]  that all the sheep passed with flying colors.
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  Two years after the animals were here,
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  they were all settled and we had lots of lambs on the ground.
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:10.600]  They were doing well.
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.600]  We had a thriving business.
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  The USDA shows up at our farm and says that they were concerned
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  that because our sheep came from Europe,
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:20.600]  they could be susceptible to mad cow disease.
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:22.600]  Even though there's no sheep in the world
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:24.600]  that's ever had mad cow disease,
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:28.600]  my husband and I and the children lived in England for three years
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:31.600]  and I worked with a professor, Eric Lamming,
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  who set public policy for mad cow disease.
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:36.600]  So it was something I was very familiar with.
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:39.600]  My husband has a PhD in animal science.
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  He approached everything from a very scientific perspective.
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  And we kept telling USDA there's nothing wrong with our sheep.
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  We offered all sorts of options.
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:52.600]  After this had gone on for two years, we said,
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:56.600]  okay, take the originals and test them if they all test negative.
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  Let us keep the offspring.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:00.600]  And to make a very long story short,
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:04.600]  it fell on deaf ears and at 5.30 in the morning,
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:08.600]  17 days before an appeals court hearing that we had,
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:12.600]  the USDA showed up with 42 armed federal agents
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  and USDA officials, took our sheep, all of them.
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  Even the lambs took them out to Iowa
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:21.600]  and killed all of them for a disease that doesn't exist to this day.
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  And let's be clear.
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  They're coming out with cloned cows, pigs, GMO, toxic waste,
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:32.600]  all honey bees dying, pharmacological crops that grow toxins in them.
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:36.600]  All that's great, but they use that as a pretext to harass people.
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:40.600]  Have you heard about the case now where they're killing people's pigs
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  saying that they could be feral instead of dealing with the actual feral hog problem
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  that I'm told is not very bad in Michigan?
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  Have you heard about that in the newest case?
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  Yes, I have.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  And there's been, you know, they're forcing the farmers to kill pigs.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:58.600]  And I've heard that if any of the pigs have black on them,
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:01.600]  where over in China, all the pigs are black,
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:05.600]  and USDA imported Chinese pigs into Nebraska
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  and then some of those pigs were sold to farmers
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  because they're extremely prolific.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:14.600]  And that was actually why my husband and I went to Britain
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  when he was studying these Chinese Maishan pigs
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  and trying to figure out why they were so prolific.
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  So here, a breed of pig that has now been bred with American pigs,
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  if any of the animals have black on them,
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:30.600]  the USDA is now making the animals be killed.
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  But I'm not a farmer, but I've done ranching.
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:35.600]  I've worked for a large animal vet.
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  And I mean, I went to the livestock show with my children a few weeks ago
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:40.600]  because they're small and like to look at animals.
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:44.600]  And they had, sometimes they have 20, 30 different types of pigs.
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:46.600]  This year, they didn't have that many.
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:49.600]  But most of them have red hair, black spots, black hair.
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  I mean, most breeds of pig look like this.
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:54.600]  And now they're just saying a pig has black or red on them.
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:55.600]  They're dead.
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  And people are like, my pigs are pinned up.
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  And of course, it's big agro wants to kill all these other pig herds
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:03.600]  that are out there.
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  Just incredible.
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:05.600]  Right.
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  When we met with the USDA and asked them why they were going after us,
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  they said they were under political pressure from the pharmaceutical and the beef industry.
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.600]  And so they admitted that there was nothing wrong with our sheep.
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  And they actually used our sheep.
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  A USDA whistleblower came forth and has evidence that they used the sheep
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  to get $450 million in funding to upgrade some laboratory facilities
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:32.600]  that they have in Iowa.
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.600]  No, I remember they wanted to piggyback.
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  I mean, your case was in the news at the time.
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:48.600]  They wanted to piggyback the fear of the foot and mouth and then the fear of the mad cow over there as a pretext.
[1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:51.600]  And they did all sorts of stuff like that over here.
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  And it's all part of these publicity stunts.
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  Just amazing.
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  Let's continue going back to the director here.
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  Kristen, give us some of the other stories you break down in the film.
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:08.600]  There is a Mennonite farmer who was just, again, supplying food in a private buying club to his community.
[1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  This was in Pennsylvania.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  And in Pennsylvania, raw milk is actually legal to sell out of stores.
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:20.600]  But in many of these cases, the consumers also want cheese, cream, and yogurt.
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  And you're not allowed to sell those things.
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  And let's be clear, whole foods two miles from me sells raw milk made cheese.
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  And as long as it's from bigger firms and go through the elitist stuff, it's okay.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:37.600]  But how dare these Amish or Mennonites, though, do it?
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  I mean, how dare you have that delicious cheese?
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:43.600]  Raw cheese has to be aged over 60 days.
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:49.600]  But some people want the choice of having the other raw cheeses that aren't aged over 60 days.
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  And the raw yogurt and the cream.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  And that's all not legal in the eyes of, I don't think there's any state government that allows the raw yogurt and the raw cream.
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:05.600]  So they formed a private buying club so that they could purchase directly from this farmer.
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  And at first, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture said that this was okay.
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  And then, as in the other cases, as it became more popular or as someone else took charge, they didn't like it anymore.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:23.600]  And so they raided this farmer, took away $60,000 worth of his milking equipment,
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  took away all of the food and let it rot, and terrorized the farmer and his children.
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  Just outrageous.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:37.600]  But it's so prolific.
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  What do you guys think of the latest case of the gentleman who had chickens for over a decade was popular in the community?
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  The town had expanded and they told him, you can't have chickens. They wanted his land for a green space.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:52.600]  And they blew his house up. Looks like they killed him.
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:56.600]  And they tell our reporters they can't film or even film the city building.
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  And there's no First Amendment in that town in Georgia. They're in Roswell, Georgia.
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:05.600]  Yeah, I think that chicken farmer killed himself.
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  Well, no, the police say he did.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:08.600]  Oh, okay.
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  I mean, I don't just believe Boss Hogg when they tell me something.
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:22.600]  This is happening more and more often where, you know, the USDA just said that they wanted the large chicken processing plants to regulate themselves.
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  And yet I have 11 chickens in my backyard and I have a, you know, I have a 11 page document saying how I need to take care of my animals.
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  And an inspector comes and I pay $50 and they come out once a year to make sure that my animals have enough space.
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:40.600]  Yeah, they're parasites. You've got animals out in the open.
[1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:50.600]  I mean, I see this all the time, but if you've got them chained with their feet growing into the floor, being fed toxic food and antibiotics and GMOs and hormones that we all eat,
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  that's beautiful and wonderful. And folks, I've been inside these big million chicken facility areas.
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:00.600]  It's like hell on earth. You've got to wear a breathing mask. The animals are half dead.
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:06.600]  You're eating all the meat with the toxins in it, but they are harassing people and small farms everywhere.
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  It's time to stop paying the parasite commas are that money. Where do you live?
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:13.600]  Concord, Massachusetts.
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  Unbelievable. So they just show up and the government has to make sure you're allowed to do that.
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  They do. They do. They want, they need to make sure that my chickens are okay and that they have enough space.
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  But I'm only feeding myself with my eggs. So it is funny that the people that are feeding the masses are allowed to crowd their chickens and feed them whatever they want and feed them waste and get away with it,
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:46.600]  where people that are just feeding themselves in their small communities and their neighbors seem to be the ones that are being harassed.
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:51.600]  Yeah, going in one of these big facilities, it's like going to a horror movie.
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:45:00.600]  I mean, the words can't describe it ought to go into one sometime. I hadn't been in one in like 20 years and because I've actually lived and worked in the country for a time.
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:08.600]  It is unbelievable. I mean, if I describe what these giant facilities are like, people wouldn't believe me.
[1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  And again, they use animal cruelty laws to harass someone with their own chickens for their own house and their own family.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:28.600]  But, you know, happy chickens, you know, hopping around in the yard, you know, you know, in the tree, whatever, jumping in your lap, like domesticated chickens do, happy, not ever being eaten, not ever being killed.
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:41.600]  But then, but then on top of it, you've got these giant facilities and it's big agra writing all this and notice that's a pre pre regulation on you, like you've done something wrong.
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:47.600]  So you can't be trusted. And now they're saying they want to inspect our gardens because we might be doing something wrong in those two.
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:53.600]  Again, in America, you're not allowed to do something with your own garden. I mean, this isn't a free country.
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:58.600]  Right. And the odd thing is, is that there's so much transparency with our neighborhood farmer.
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:01.600]  You can just walk onto their land and you can see how they're going their food.
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:05.600]  You can make your own decision about whether you want to eat that food or not.
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:12.600]  But these large processing plants, you know, as I tried to get in them with my cameras, I tried to get in them when I was making my documentary.
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:16.600]  And, of course, you're not allowed in them and you're certainly not allowed to film in them.
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:25.600]  And so now I have a rule that if a farmer won't let me film their property, then I won't eat their food.
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:33.600]  Well, they are so scared, as you know. Talk to me, both of you ladies, about the movement I'm seeing, but give me your expert perspective on it.
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:39.600]  I'm seeing a huge exodus, especially by Nouveau-Riche, middle class, upper middle class, but also working class,
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:48.600]  two rural areas and forming communities and really boosting the level of quality of life, the health of children.
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  And I think this has really got the system scared. And there is a war against small farms and true sustainable living.
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:57.600]  And Farmageddon details this.
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:08.600]  Yeah, and I think that's what the real value of Farmageddon is. As a farmer and a farmer, a scientist, someone who has the animals who works the land,
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:18.600]  when USDA comes after you, they use all of their weight and you think you're totally alone and you're just one person fighting against them.
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:27.600]  And that, you know, you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. And what Farmageddon demonstrates is we're not alone.
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:38.600]  Unfortunately, this is happening all across the country. It's happening even up in Canada. And it's opening people's eyes to showing, you know,
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  that the government is not there to protect our food safety.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:51.600]  If you want to save food, just like Kristin said, you want to be able to go to your neighbor and go to your local farm and that's where you're going to find the good food.
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  And I am seeing a lot of people heading out into the country and taking matters into their own control to keep their family healthy through what they feed them.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  And I think this is the real revolution. Is in health, is in vitamins, minerals, farming, even if you live in a semi-rural area, just begin.
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  And then that'll start making you think about what else you're eating from the store, but it's not just growing it yourself.
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:20.600]  Like you said, it's being in the communities where people are growing.
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:24.600]  Then you'll find out not just what's healthy, but who's got the really good stuff.
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:30.600]  And it's just, it's a real human community and there's nothing like getting your feet in the black soil.
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  There's nothing like integrating and hooking back in and finding your humanity.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.600]  Yes, totally. Yeah, that's scaring them, isn't it?
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  I think it is. And they just keep applying more and more pressure.
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:54.600]  You know, USDA has their own investigative and enforcement services, so it's literally their own police force.
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  And when they came after our sheep and they couldn't find anything wrong with them, they did a criminal investigation to see if anything,
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  that when we imported the sheep was illegal and they couldn't find anything wrong there.
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:15.600]  So then they did a personal criminal investigation of my husband, Larry, and I'm hearing this more and more.
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:21.600]  Gibson Guitars has certified government legal wood with its already fallen.
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:24.600]  They've been investigating them off and on for 10 years.
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  And last time I heard just rated them again because they dare to make things in America.
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  And they've been told, move to China, you'll be totally left alone.
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:39.600]  They don't, there's a war against America.
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:42.600]  It's bizarre.
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  So the reason why I made this film is to give these farmers and these small business people a voice,
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  because it just doesn't seem like they have a voice in the mainstream media.
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:56.600]  The government always gets the last word and it's always the word of safety,
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  where if you watch my movie, my opinion is that they're barking up the wrong tree as far as safety is concerned.
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  And like you said, condoning and allowing GMOs and chemicals in our food and animal cruelty and animal crowding.
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:21.600]  And then on the other side, harassing the small farmer who's trying to do things as fast as they can.
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:28.600]  Well, just the look of the film too and the shots, the talent that you brought to bear making this film.
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:33.600]  It's something everybody's got to see, Farmer Geddin available at infowars.com. Incredible.
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:39.600]  We're going to come back and continue with both you ladies and talk about some more of the stories in the film.
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:43.600]  Folks, I live in a farming community outside Austin.
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:48.600]  I have family that farms and ranches and eats Texas from cows to grapes.
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  And let me tell you, they've got environmental spies everywhere, harassing everybody, saying we're bad for the environment and leaving Big Agra alone.
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  This is serious fascism.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:04.600]  Right now, the average family spends one fourth of their income on food.
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  It's time to cut your food budget in half by using the best, most affordable food on the planet from Eat Foods Direct.

[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:07.600]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:09.600]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:13.600]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with fake TV.
[1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:25.600]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:31.600]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:33.600]  Use it any time you're away from home.
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:41.600]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[1:52:56.600 --> 1:52:59.600]  FakeTV.com, the burglar deterrent.

[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:16.600]  Now, more than ever, civilians and communities must communicate with family, friends, and neighbors in the event of civil unrest, natural disasters, or other emergencies.
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:18.600]  That's why there's civildispatch.com.
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:24.600]  Civildispatch.com is a universal system that can be used for a wide array of urgent notification alerts.

[1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:23.600]  Going back to Linda Follace.
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:35.600]  Linda, you're going to be leaving us here in about five minutes in the director's instables for another 30 to get more into the film here and open the phones up for some of the farming victims out there who want to get involved on air.
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:45.600]  But what else can you share with us now that you've been a victim of this for so long and earlier you were talking about that you've seen it intensifying now?
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:55:03.600]  Yeah, I was hoping that what I had seen in pharma get in and what I was reading that it was going to make USDA and the FDA back off of attacking farmers, but unfortunately it seems to be increasing.
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:21.600]  And the good thing is that people are not staying quiet. People are speaking up. People like Kristen are making a documentary and educating people out there. USDA spent a million dollars, according to their own documents, a million dollars watching us.
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:34.600]  And when we took them to court, we got the diaries of we called them the goons that were watching us and the day was broken down into 15 minute segments and it would say where each of our family members were.
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:43.600]  And you're talking about our daughters were 13 and 14 and our son is 15 years old and they're keeping track of us.
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:57.600]  And to spend taxpayers money doing that for disease sheets that were not disease that were perfectly healthy for disease that doesn't exist is ridiculous in my opinion.
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:03.600]  And we're just one of many people out there that this is happening to.
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:13.600]  Well, it's true. And again, even the news has said why is there a war against people and it's these bureaucrats and they act like it's dirty and bad.
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:20.600]  And what do you think of raw some foods or the lady that was going to go to jail for a garden in her yard and there wasn't even a law against it.
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:24.600]  And the city said, well, we don't like it. I mean, it's just wild.
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:36.600]  The amount of power that the government has is incredible. And the person who ordered these criminal investigations of us was just a mid level bureaucrat.
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:44.600]  And what's really bizarre is that you have all these organizations such as the FDA and the USDA.
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:54.600]  Those are the people making the laws, not the people that were elected, but the people that are not elected, people that get appointed.
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  And I think there's a real imbalance of power there.
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:17.600]  Well, and they also again, just revel and harassing people and this is all agenda 21. That's that's what they're doing. They use environmental rules, other things to shut down the general economy and then the globalists that write up all these world regulations because it's being done universally across the planet.
[1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:23.600]  They are exempt. So it allows certain groups to operate and others not to.
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  Kristen, do you have any comments to add to what you said on this point? No, I'm just it just unfortunately, she's right. It does seem to be really ramping up.
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:49.600]  When I finished my movie, Ross and foods had just had their second raid. And and so that rate is in my movie. And and after I finished and actually the movie released theatrically, that's when they had another raid and James and Sharon Palmer.
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:58:03.600]  I know that you've you've covered this extensively and I appreciate it. You know, got thrown in jail for a number of days and they were treated horribly and they've been harassed and Ross and foods is completely shut down now.
[1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:16.600]  And there's been two other Amish farms that have been shut down and every day I hear of a new farm being shut down. So so I find it very sad that it's increasing.
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:28.600]  Now, it's a rain of terror and it's outrageous. I want to thank Linda for joining us, her book, author of Mad Sheep. We're going to come back and talk to the director on the other side.
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:50.600]  The film is Farmageddon. Get it out to everyone. You know, it's available at info wars.com. We will expose and defeat these tyrants.
[1:58:50.600 --> 1:59:15.600]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[1:59:15.600 --> 1:59:29.600]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:51.600]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months. Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need. Check it out for yourself. It's incredible. Go to infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement. That's infowarsteam.com.
[2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:05.600]  Big Brother
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:25.600]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:39.600]  Christian Canty is our guest for another 30 minutes. I know we got loaded phones that were on before. I went to her. And I want to be able to talk to all those people, but I think it's important that we be able to talk to some of the farmers involved.
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:55.600]  So I'm going to do this. Guys, can we fire up our phone system here? Is that possible? I'm going to fire it up right now. The phone system isn't open yet. It'll open in about two minutes. She'll be ready for the phone calls to come in. We'll open it. You're able to get in for about a minute.
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:09.600]  50 phone calls will come in. I'm going to open my phone system up instead of the Genesis phone system so you can get in. And I'll try to get to the others later. Bill, Peter, Levi, Carol, and others that are holding there patiently.
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:25.600]  But if you're a farmer, rancher, your quick horror story in 60 seconds, or your good story of the loving federal government out of their jurisdiction, that's another issue. Now, we have TSA at checkpoints on highways and with undercover spying on people, on buses and restaurants.
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:47.600]  East Germany had it. Cuba has it. Why not us? All the science fiction dystopic movies do. Well, we got to have that. Well, John Corzine still has billions. The number to join us, if you're a farmer or a rancher out there, is 877-789-ALEX-877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:02:01.600]  I'll give that out one more time when we come back from break. This is a short segment. But let's get back, Kristen, to the film itself and some of the other stories that are in it and why people need to see it.
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:21.600]  Well, there's a woman in Ohio. I don't know if you've covered this one, but it's the man of storehouse. And she found 40 Amish firms around her that had no way to get their product to market. So she had a great idea where one week she would go and get eggs from one farmer and vegetables from another and chicken and beef.
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:35.600]  And she brought it back to her house and she shared these duties with her neighbors. And so the next week another neighbor would go around and collect all this food and bring it back. And so eventually it got bigger and bigger.
[2:02:35.600 --> 2:02:55.600]  And so the Ohio Department of Agriculture caught wind of it and their response to that was to go in with, I think, as many as 11 armed agents. She had eight kids in the house that were homeschooled and they kept the family behind closed doors for six hours while they tore her house apart,
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:15.600]  stole her computers, took her cell phones. Her son was in Iraq at the time and he was calling and they wouldn't let her answer the phone and they took their phones. And they took all of their meat and all of their food that was for their own consumption and for the co-op, all for a third degree misdemeanor.
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  And actually that family was never charged with anything. They ended up never really finding anything to charge them with and yet that was the terror that they endured. So these were the kinds of stories that got me angry and I couldn't let it go and that's when I traveled around.
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  There's got to be class action suits against big pharma and big agra because on record they are the ones funding and lobbying for regulations and for this harassment and then every time they cause some big food crisis, they then sick more bureaucrats on innocent small groups.
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  Right. I mean the problem is that there was a class act, there was a suit in this case, the Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund and the Ohio Civil Rights Union both sued for civil rights violations on the Starr's family and unfortunately the court started with the government and that's been happening again and again too.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:36.600]  So I think the only answer to this is that the people really have to band together and really, we have to really educate ourselves on this issue and band together to, you know, elect officials that understand this issue, that understand that the government's been parking up the wrong tree and elect officials that care about our civil rights.
[2:04:36.600 --> 2:04:47.600]  Well, it's the right tree, though, if they work for foreign corporations that are engaged in a total militarized takeover of the economy and that's what this is. That's what Agenda 21 is.
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:05:10.600]  And I think your film, Pharmageddon, dovetails well with behind the green mask Unigine 21, key weapons of the Info War, both available at infowars.com.
[2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:20.600]  That's what this is all about.

[2:06:00.600 --> 2:06:14.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:24.600]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:35.600]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:06:35.600 --> 2:06:45.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[2:08:47.600 --> 2:09:02.600]  Oh, these are open range, totally healthy. Let us harass you. Again, big pharma, big agrips, same group, openly financing the shutdown of family farms and other sustainable operations, all part of Agenda 21.
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:17.600]  Agenda 21 is about shutting down the economy. Under the guise of environmentalism, nothing to do with the environment. It's a power grab. So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  877-789-2539. I know there's a lot to add here, Kristen, but anything else you'd like to point out before we go to phone calls pertaining to pharma again, the unseen war on America's family farms?
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  Now, I really appreciate you helping to spread this message. This whole journey started with me. I used to be the one that wanted to bleach everything and sterilize everything, and we got sick.
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:51.600]  And so I'm lucky that I found these foods. It was actually raw milk that ended up healing my son of allergies. He was very, very sick with allergies and asthma.
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:10:00.600]  And so I started to eat this way and saw the government trying to shut it down, and I appreciate people like you trying to spread the word about this.
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:15.600]  Well, that's another big point you made. I have a big scientific study out today on autism where they break down a major journal, a long-term study, what other scientists have already told us,
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:28.600]  that what they're doing is going in and growing crops on dead soil that's then full of heavy metals because of the toxic fertilizer they're using.
[2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:38.600]  That's bioaccumulating. Then we don't have regular minerals in us that also take out the impurities, so it's a double whammy and autism's exploding.
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:46.600]  Right. I was really lucky. Unfortunately, I didn't know about this before I had kids, but soon after I had kids because they got sick.
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:53.600]  I found the Western Price Foundation, and that taught me a lot about nutrient-dense foods and seeking out nutrient-dense foods.
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:11:03.600]  And so I did that for 10 years until I found out that the government was really cracking down on farmers that were growing nutrient-dense foods.
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:11.600]  And again, these are not secrets. It's known by handfuls of people. We've got to get the word out to folks.
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  I mean, it's, look, sure, I'm product-placing right here because I believe in it and it funds our operation.
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  But take Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex.
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:38.600]  This has got a giant ORAC score per serving of 5,745. And the minute I started taking this, and I still need to lose more weight, but I lost 40 pounds, Aaron Dykes over 90.
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:41.600]  And when I saw that, that's when I finally started taking it.
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  And of course, now I promote it and sell it at a discount at infowarsteam.com. But my point is that people need to discover growing food or buying food grown on real soil organically.
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  Magic effect. Taking powerful natural mineral vitamin supplements. It levels way over what the government says you need. Amazing effect.
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:14.600]  And Big Pharma knows this. They want us sick so that they can come burn and cut and work on us.
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:19.600]  Spend a little bit more time how you discovered all this and what it did for your family.
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:29.600]  I was so lucky. I discovered it. Basically, my doctor told me that my son was allergic to the world, which was grass, dust, bees, every kind of pollen.
[2:12:29.600 --> 2:12:37.600]  So inside and outside, the entire environment, he was just coughing and sneezing and screaming all night that he couldn't breathe.
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  And he had an inhaler and the doctors kept giving me stronger and stronger medications and they just weren't working.
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  That's how I had to find an alternative.
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:56.600]  And so finally, one of the doctors said that his immune system was so severely depressed that he would be on these strong medications the rest of his life.
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  He probably wouldn't grow. He could never get near animals. It would be hard for him to be outside.
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  And a natural path doctor, luckily, told me to take him off all the drugs and find alternatives.
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  And I kept researching and researching on the internet until finally I found enough compelling stories that raw milk could be a cure for allergies.
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  And at the time I was scared to death. I thought it was disgusting to even think about raw milk, but I ventured out and met my farmer and asked a lot of questions
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:33.600]  and drank a lot of it myself to make sure I didn't die before I gave it to my four-year-old son.
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:40.600]  And I loved it and I gave it to him and he is 16 now. He doesn't have any allergies.
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  He's an athlete. He's six feet tall. He plays hockey, plays sports outside and inside. We have animals.
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:52.600]  And so it works. Real food really can work.
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  Wow. Imagine real foods what we need, not McDonald's food that doesn't decompose.
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:01.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:14:01.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  And again, I've known this for a long time, but just was so set in a quasi-healthy, quasi-unhealthy that I never really started taking the plunge.
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:13.600]  And I've just begun. And it's like this is so powerful, this information.
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:18.600]  And that's what the eugenicists are desperate for us to discover.
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  They're building a false environment to enslave us with sickness. They're scared we're getting off the reservation.
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:28.600]  And they're sending the rural council agenda 21 after us.
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:38.600]  And the answer is to proliferate the swap meets and the farms and the gardens even faster where they cannot stop us.
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:45.600]  You want to defeat the New World Order folks, educate people, speak out, but also just start living better.
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:51.600]  And start educating others and creating communities. This will bring them down.
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:59.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to CJ in Michigan. You're on the air with the director and creator of Farma-Geddon.
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:03.600]  Go ahead, CJ. Good to talk to you. You're on air with us.
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:11.600]  Yeah, thanks. I'm an urban farmer here in Michigan, you know, got the garden in the front yard.
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:21.600]  Haven't had any problems with that last year. Got a goat. And I mean, it was like I had killed somebody.
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:28.600]  So I got the summons, you know, I got the notice to get rid of it.
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:35.600]  Fines coming or jails coming, this and that. So I'm doing all kinds of research trying to find laws.
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:42.600]  Michigan right to farm ag, getting obstacles after obstacles. But bottom line is this is my life.
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:51.600]  This is my family's future. You know, we have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:56.600]  By the way, my grandfather worked in the oil fields. He brought a little goat home that was orphaned.
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:15:59.600]  Its mother had been run over and it grew and they kept it for a long time.
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:03.600]  And then, you know, years later gave it to a farmer, but it would jump up on the mantle and stuff.
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.600]  They love that goat. I mean, goats, a single one, you don't want a bunch of them to eat your yard.
[2:16:08.600 --> 2:16:12.600]  I mean, those are pretty nice little pets and they're saying you can't have this evil goat.
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:16.600]  But I guess they're glad Michigan's collapsing though. I guess that's fun though.
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:23.600]  Yeah, it's real. I mean, it's a fun, there's a different, okay, we can, me and you agree that the right to travel is there,
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:28.600]  but they call it a privilege, but who can say that life, okay?
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  It can be argued that you can be born and not ever step into a car and you'll still live.
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:42.600]  But you need water, you need food and you need shelter. How can they restrict a fundamental right?
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:45.600]  No, I hear you. So what's happening with the goat?
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:48.600]  Well, I had to get rid of the goat because I just don't have the time to fight it.
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:54.600]  But it's coming to the point where I'm just going to, I'm just going to, I got, I got bees coming tomorrow.
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:59.600]  I'm just going to take the fine. I'm going to not pay it. And I'm just,
[2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:03.600]  Oh, no, they don't want bees. The bees all have to die. You can't have those.
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.600]  I appreciate your call. What an evil caller.
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:09.600]  While the honeybees are collapsing, they're begging you to keep them.
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:15.600]  But then when you do, they come after you. This is terrible that he would do such a thing.
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:19.600]  What do you say to that, Preston?
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:24.600]  Well, like I said, I've seen this over and over again. It's happening everywhere.
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:31.600]  But luckily, I mean, the only hope that I have is that it's happening so much and it's just getting so over the top right now.
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  And so many people are seeing it, that people are starting to wake up.
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:39.600]  So that's what I'm hoping that people will see the film, that people will start, you know, waking up,
[2:17:39.600 --> 2:17:44.600]  that people will start banding together. And, you know, I'm really sorry to that farmer that he doesn't have time to fight it.
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:50.600]  It takes so much time to fight this. But if we can find groups of people to fight it together and form groups
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  and go to the legislators and try to fight it together, we'd have a better chance.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:02.600]  Absolutely. I'm taking the next step towards getting the chickens and doing everything else,
[2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:06.600]  just because I need to be prepared, but also because it hurts the New World Order.
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:11.600]  And whatever I cannot buy from their big mega devil stores, whatever I can do to pull myself out,
[2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:16.600]  I'm planting grapevines and doing all sorts of other stuff, blackberries, whatever I can do,
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:21.600]  whatever I can do to not be part of their big sick system, going to farmers market, buying from locals,
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:27.600]  buying local raw milk, had some this morning, buying local farmers eggs.
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:31.600]  I'm pulling out of your system, starting to buy local farmers beef.
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:35.600]  I'm pulling out of your system, I'm pulling out of your system, I'm pulling out of your dirtbag system.
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:40.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in New Jersey or on the air with the director of the film. Go ahead.
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:42.600]  Hey, Alex. Hi, Carson. How are you today?
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:43.600]  Good. Go ahead.
[2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:49.600]  Good. Real quick, the right to farm ordinance is something you need to look at from a community level.
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:55.600]  Here in New Jersey, in my township, we have the right to farm, regardless of the size of the parcel.
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:59.600]  I have poultry in my front yard, chickens going in the back, goats.
[2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:04.600]  This is a sort of that most people need to group up together in the community and pass.
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:07.600]  The right to farm ordinance is something that you need to look at.
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  The state of New Jersey has adopted to the Department of Agriculture here also the right to farm ordinances at the community level.
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:19.600]  So people need to rally together to get this happening at the local level.
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:26.600]  And when local people rally together, trust me, the feds have a very difficult time trying to do anything about it.
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:30.600]  Well, once you've had real milk, you don't go back. Again, I've studied it.
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:42.600]  You go back to the 30s and 40s, big pharma, big agra, same group, convinced everybody that raw milk wasn't as good and you want the new pasteurized stuff,
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:48.600]  just so they could ship it further, have dirty milk with feces and blood, overwork the cows.
[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  Then they started passing ordinances that had to be from certain groups, certain companies.
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:20:05.600]  And over time, they just phased it out to where now the counterfeit that is just like liquid artery sludge is what people think milk is versus real milk.
[2:20:05.600 --> 2:20:13.600]  And so as people segue from the GMO deadly milk that gives you cancer with the growth hormone in it to then, oh, okay, we're organic.
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:17.600]  We're not, you know, we don't have GMO to know now I want the real thing.
[2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:24.600]  Once you get real milk, you're like, how did I ever drink this sludge?
[2:20:24.600 --> 2:20:29.600]  Exactly. Real quick, if you're interested, you can go to Pittsburgh Township.
[2:20:29.600 --> 2:20:33.600]  This is the township I'm calling from. And you could actually put right to farm.
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:36.600]  You could Google it, right to farm Pittsburgh, New Jersey.
[2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:41.600]  And it's a great model ordinance. It was adopted. It is law. It's a law of the land here. Take a look at it.
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:48.600]  I think it's something that you could bring to various councils or township meetings and try to introduce.
[2:20:48.600 --> 2:20:52.600]  Well, God bless you, sir. Great points. Human instinct is powerful.
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:58.600]  And despite all the brainwashing and dumbing down, people are buying 5 million guns a month, total, all time record.
[2:20:58.600 --> 2:21:01.600]  They're buying seeds. They're planting everybody.
[2:21:01.600 --> 2:21:04.600]  It's like after 9-11, there was a baby boom for a year.
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:10.600]  In fact, that was when my wife and I conceived our first child.
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:16.600]  Humans don't have to be told, you know, an archetypal, you just saw a bunch of people killed, have kids.
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:20.600]  The way the system sold that was, we just lost half of America.
[2:21:20.600 --> 2:21:26.600]  It wasn't, but the way they sold it was, we're under attack. Boom, all these kids. It's the same thing.
[2:21:26.600 --> 2:21:32.600]  Now we really are under attack. Suddenly, the media's not telling us, but everybody's buying guns.
[2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:34.600]  Everybody's starting, I mean, everybody.
[2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:40.600]  And so that's because the human instinct is very, very powerful.
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:42.600]  Kristen, your comments on that.
[2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:44.600]  Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:49.600]  And I'm also happy that the farmer brought up the right to farm ordinances.
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:57.600]  And the other thing that's happening around the country too, which is very positive, is that townships are starting the food sovereignty laws.
[2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:04.600]  You know, they're passing laws trying to keep the state and federal governments out of their farming system.
[2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:13.600]  So anything grown in their counties or towns can be sold, traded, swapped, co-opped, you know, within that county without the state.
[2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:16.600]  Exactly. And as the state says that's illegal, that's the line in the sand.
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:24.600]  When you can't live in the country and trade food with your neighbors, that is a total genocidal attack.
[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:30.600]  That's what Stalin did to the Ukrainians. It doesn't get any more brazen than that.
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:38.600]  It's very sad, I think, that we have to pass food sovereignty laws to try to keep the federal government out of our farms because they see them as a danger.
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:40.600]  I wish that didn't have to happen.
[2:22:40.600 --> 2:22:45.600]  Yeah, a danger. Your kids might not get autism if they eat healthy food grown locally.
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:48.600]  We've got to make sure those kids have horrible lives.
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:51.600]  Paul in New York, you're on the air with our guests. Go ahead.
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:59.600]  Hey, Alex. I'm representing a farm that is a 400 acre farm in Finger Lakes region in New York.
[2:22:59.600 --> 2:23:03.600]  And they basically fear for their life at this point and they're in hiding.
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:10.600]  Oh yeah, John Bown was telling me that the feds are in there trying to steal land left and right under a Gen 21 move.
[2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:18.600]  Well, this one actually was started in 2008. This farm was in possession of these people for about 105 years and their family.
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:28.600]  In 2008 Enron got a, they wouldn't sign a lease with Enron and the county went and wrote them a title, a tax title to the farm out of thin air
[2:23:28.600 --> 2:23:37.600]  and told them they were basically tax protestors and lost their farm and they came in and let them live there.
[2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:43.600]  And quotes, you know, that while they build gas wells, compressor stations, three pipelines across the property,
[2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:51.600]  they sold the title to the Watkins Glen International Race Track, a.k.a. International Speedway Corporation by Warranty D.
[2:23:51.600 --> 2:23:59.600]  And it went to court. Basically, New York State Supreme Court judge dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction
[2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:06.600]  finding that the Watkins Glen's attorneys admitted during the trial the farmers never foreclosed or any tax foreclosure proceeding.
[2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:17.600]  And get down to quick here. What happened afterward? It's basically stated that prevented them from ever trying to victor people again.
[2:24:17.600 --> 2:24:33.600]  Well, instead of Watkins Glen getting anything done through, what they did was they went in on October 27, 2010, about eight employees armed with machine guns
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:40.600]  and black driving, you know, Hummer Tank and SUV parade of about 11 vehicles and came to the farm without notice, without a warrant,
[2:24:40.600 --> 2:24:46.600]  without legal process, any kind, without an ID, without stating any legal purpose, drove over them, smashed down the fences,
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:52.600]  the gates broken to the homes, there's two homes, the barns, the pastures, buildings, seized all the worldly belongings and the animals.
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:58.600]  They had Scotch Highland Cattleville and cheap and Jersey milk cows, ducks, geese, guineas, turkey.
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:05.600]  We're going to have to go here. The segment's almost over. Our guest is about to leave us. What's the name of the people in the case, sir?
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:09.600]  That's the problem. The only thing I have here, and this came from an attorney friend of mine.
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:17.600]  I understand. I appreciate your call, sir, if you can't tell us the story, but we'd like to help, but we just can't if you can't give us the info.
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:22.600]  This goes on everywhere now. It's the lawlessness of the government.
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  We're not putting TSA in bars and restaurants and on buses because they want to play, you know, musical chairs with us.
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:36.600]  This is a classical tyranny takeover by foreign banks that have hijacked the federal government.
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:42.600]  And we've just got to get dug in and get ready because these people are criminals and they're coming and they mean business.
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:47.600]  Comments on what the caller was just saying?
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:55.600]  Unfortunately, it's been happening too much and America needs to wake up and we really need to start fighting this. All Americans need to wake up.
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:25:59.600]  Let's talk to Hannah in Hawaii. Hannah, you're on the air with our guest.
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:00.600]  Hello, Alex.
[2:26:00.600 --> 2:26:01.600]  Yes, sir.
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:02.600]  Hello, Alex.
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:04.600]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:05.600]  Hey, how are you doing?
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:08.600]  I'm good. We're almost out of time. Do you have a question?
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:19.600]  I grew up on a dairy and I drank raw milk my whole life and I got a great immune system. So I think basically people just got a band together.
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:24.600]  I live in Hawaii. We live in a farming community. We have farmers markets every weekend.
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:31.600]  We don't really have any impact from the government, you know, as far as them trying to break down our system.
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:41.600]  It's wrong that they're attacking the areas that aren't that strong yet, but when you've got a lot of people involved, that's where the strength is.
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:48.600]  Right, and there is only one instance where they tried to GMO a taro plant, which makes poi.
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:57.600]  If you know Hawaii, it's a plant that makes poi and they couldn't do it because the community got together and got it in the newspapers and they basically shut it down.
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:04.600]  So, you know, strength and numbers, I say, get it in the newspaper, you know, get your community together, work hard.
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:09.600]  Well said. I appreciate your call from the beautiful island of Hawaii, your islands of Hawaii.
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:17.600]  That's a great point that he raises, though, that once you get a community doing this, there's not much the system can do.
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:21.600]  So that's the answer. Everybody needs to start doing this right now.
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:30.600]  Yeah, that's true. That's the only answer is to band together as communities and grow our own food and share our own food and protect your local farmer.
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:36.600]  And like you said, also, try to keep your dollars with your local farmer and in your local food system as much as possible.
[2:27:36.600 --> 2:27:42.600]  Let me ask you this. From your study, what area of the country is the worst? Where do they really harass people the worst?
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:51.600]  Right now, I'm so surprised because when I was traveling around, people said, you know, there's this magical place called Rossam Foods in Venice and California could never be touched.
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:57.600]  And California is the worst, right? It's one of the worst. I think Michigan and Wisconsin are bad, too.
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:05.600]  But California, all the goat herd shares and cow shares were shut down in a place where raw milk is legal.
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  And they're fighting for GMO labeling and there's a lot of GMOs being shut down.
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:16.600]  Well, that's it. I mean, they're going after the head of people in California are fighting for healthy food.
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:19.600]  I mean, that's where Obama is shutting down the medical marijuana.
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:24.600]  They're fighting for their, yeah, they're fighting for water rights there. They're fighting for land rights there.
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:29.600]  So I'm sad to say I think it's California right now, but I'm not positive.
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:36.600]  Well, of course it is because it's Agenda 21. They claim it's for the earth. It's not. It's behind the green mask.
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:42.600]  It's a skull. It's death. The book behind the green mask available at infowars.com along with Pharma Gettin.
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:48.600]  I have to say I am impressed, Kristen, with what you've done. You're an amazing filmmaker.
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:53.600]  And I know you're winning a lot of awards right now. The LA Times calls it an eye-popping wake-up call.
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:58.600]  Even establishment media has to admit you're right because most people in the media aren't even evil.
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  They're compartmentalized and ignorant. Just like you were ignorant or I was ignorant thinking raw milk was bad
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:07.600]  or thinking you'd have your son in a bubble and finding out it made him sick.
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:13.600]  We're all like that. We're all in a process of waking up and just try it out, folks.
[2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:21.600]  You'll be amazed not eating GMO, not eating things like corn syrup full of lead and mercury.
[2:29:21.600 --> 2:29:27.600]  Your children will do good with nutrients, not lead and mercury. Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:30.600]  Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.
[2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:35.600]  Thank you. All right, there she goes. A powerful interview. If you think that was powerful, the film is amazing.

[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.600]  We'll try to jam in. Some of the other calls are holding on other subjects as well.

[2:33:17.600 --> 2:33:31.600]  All right, for the balance of this hour, we are joined by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor at the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy at the Department of the Treasury, bestselling author, syndicated columnist as well.
[2:33:31.600 --> 2:33:37.600]  His latest article is at infowarseteam.com. Unplugging Americans from the Matrix.
[2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:48.600]  It's also on his website, which of course is PaulCraigRoberts.org, excellent website as well.
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:34:00.600]  And he joins us here today to talk about a host of issues, the latest in the police state, what's happening in our world, and what he means by unplugging Americans from the Matrix.
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:10.600]  And then I have a point I want to raise to him as well on another subject. All over the U.S., they're giving kids vaccines without parental consent.
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:19.600]  They are now taking DNA from schoolchildren. I have the Daily Mail here. It's also in the Associated Press.
[2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:24.600]  Regardless of whether the individual is an adult or juvenile, they are capable of giving consent.
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:30.600]  We don't require the consent of a parent if we're doing it with someone of a younger age. These are 10 and 11 and 12-year-olds.
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:37.600]  Said Deputy Jason Ramos of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, because a dead girl was found back in the woods.
[2:34:37.600 --> 2:34:42.600]  How we know it wasn't a cop did it? And statistically nowadays that they are higher crime rates than general public.
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:46.600]  You look at real criminology, you didn't know that? Or a schoolteacher, they're much higher than the cops.
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:51.600]  Or a truancy officer, you know, these pervs in government. Maybe a TSA agent did it.
[2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:56.600]  You know, oh no, we're going to get all the 10, 11, 12, 13-year-olds and we're going to take their DNA
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:35:00.600]  and we're going to give them vaccines and say, is it all right with you little girl, little boy?
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:05.600]  Dr. Roberts, I just sprung that on you out of the gates, but everybody knows if a perv grabs a 10-year-old
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:11.600]  and says, well, the 10-year-old wanted to have sex or wanted to smoke crack cocaine, no, the child can't give consent.
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:18.600]  But now the government, all over the country, I'm saying a little government say, we got your child to say they wanted an abortion at 10.
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:23.600]  We got the child to say they wanted a vaccine. We got the child to give us DNA.
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:27.600]  What do you make of this new mega-level of corruption?
[2:35:27.600 --> 2:35:37.600]  Well, we're not even serfs, are we? I mean, Americans no longer have the rights even of 19th century slaves.
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:47.600]  And we accept it. And what's really so funny is that all these patriot, flag-waving guys who think they're so macho-tuff,
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.600]  they're just sheep. They accept all this.
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:54.600]  What's the difference from what you've just said?
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:02.600]  And by 2015, apparently, they're going to have black boxes in our cars recording everywhere we go.
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:12.600]  Somebody said, well, before you can get in your car and start it up, you first have to get permission,
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:17.600]  tell them where you're going when you'll be back.
[2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:22.600]  You know, we've been going on about this for so long, haven't we? It just keeps getting worse.
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:28.600]  Listen, Forbes attacked me for an article at infowords.com that got all this going.
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:34.600]  And so did the New Atlantic saying, well, they've been tracking some of what you've done for a decade or more.
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:38.600]  Yeah, these will track everything you do. But what's wrong with that?
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:44.600]  Why do you think Petraeus came out a month ago and said, yeah, your clock radio is watching you and listening and smart meters.
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:51.600]  There's no Fourth Amendment anymore. I mean, he actually, why do you think they're in our face like this?
[2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:57.600]  Well, I suppose they're just getting rid of any accountable government.
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:04.600]  You know, supposedly we have an accountable government and we can hold them accountable through elections and through law.
[2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:08.600]  And the government's supposed to hold itself accountable through law.
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:13.600]  But beginning with the Bush Cheney Obama regime, all of that's out.
[2:37:13.600 --> 2:37:20.600]  The executive branch is no longer accountable to law, whether domestic or international.
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:24.600]  In fact, law is whatever the executive branch says.
[2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:29.600]  And then this filters down to the executive branches at state and local levels.
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:36.600]  So I think the legislatures are essentially impotent.
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:42.600]  They still exist, you know, kind of like the Roman Senate under the Caesars, but they don't have any real role.
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:49.600]  The executive branch can do whatever it wants and so can the police in most instances.
[2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:54.600]  You're right. And it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier.
[2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:59.600]  I'm sure you saw the big announcements. We already knew this was happening, but now it's admitted.
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:06.600]  Undercover TSA on the streets and in buses and just, they admit, listening to our conversations.
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:10.600]  It violates the Tenth Amendment. You're not supposed to have feds out doing that.
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:12.600]  They're not even really real officers.
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:16.600]  And then, oh, I meant to have my crew in here today, Darren McBreen and Marcos Morales.
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:19.600]  I guess Monday I'll have them in and tell the story here Sunday.
[2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  They flew out up to Georgia where the guy's house blew up who had the chickens there in Roswell, Georgia.
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:33.600]  And the police told him, you can't take the city hall building period or we'll arrest you.
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:38.600]  That's on video. And we think it's suspicious that he died, but they say his house blew up and that he did it.
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:42.600]  But then flying out, they said we're not going in the scanners.
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:50.600]  So they made him wait about 40 minutes and almost missed their flight and kept walking over laughing at him saying, oh, you're an opt out.
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:55.600]  You're going to miss your flight laughing. And then they said, we're going to grope you and the guy put his glove on.
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:02.600]  And the way Marcos describes it and Darren saw it, popped the glove doc and said, everybody deserves a little pleasure.
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:17.600]  Well, you know, the population accepts it. It all goes back to what we've said so many times. 9-11, population fell for 9-11.
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:30.600]  That's been the excuse for everything else. And there's no real reason for them to be going around listening to conversations on the street because there are no terrorist acts.
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:38.600]  We've made that point too many times, right? There's no terrorism in the United States except what the FBI orchestrates.
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  And of course, other than the terrorism of our own government, state, local, and federal.
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:54.600]  But it's an excuse and they've taken it to grab all sorts of power and to establish all kinds of precedence.
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:40:02.600]  And essentially, the United States is a police state that masquerades as a democracy.
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:11.600]  You know, that was a very interesting set of articles that Ron Nutz has in the American conservative.
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:16.600]  I wrote about them. It's my latest article about unplugging the matrix.
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:26.600]  And Ron Nutz looks at the propagandistic picture of China in the United States and then he looks at the real picture of the two.
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:42.600]  And he finds out that actually the so-called authoritarian government of China is more responsive to Chinese people than the so-called freedom and democracy government of America is to the American people.
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  He finds out also he shows also that the Chinese government is more accountable to law than the American government and also has a far more successful economic policy with the real incomes of Chinese workers
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:11.600]  doubling every decade for the last three decades while the real incomes of Americans have been stagnant or declining.
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:29.600]  So wherever you look, if you take off the blinders and you get out of the matrix and look at the real facts, the United States, the people here, they live in an artificial propagandistic of virtual reality that's not really real.
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:37.600]  And that's what I meant about unplugging them. You know, it's a reference to the film, you know, with Neo.
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  How do you do that? That's what you're asking. It's an excellent piece. I mean, how do you get people who think the world is just there and they're not part of it and they just believe whatever they're told when we see every, you know, people always blame the Germans.
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:42:01.600]  How do they let this happen? Well, their country was destroyed in a war totally in depression and Hitler didn't even get elected to a full position.
[2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:14.600]  He used it to get power later. I mean, he got elected, but you know, not with 50% of the vote. And then and that's how it happened. It happens where criminal sees control and people don't know how bad it's going to be.
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:19.600]  And then they get in control and everybody just starts saying yes, yes, yes.
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:37.600]  That's it. But the United States is a police state. There's no doubt about it. And everything you said at the beginning of our conversation points to that as well as everything that we've said in all of our conversations over the years, Alex.
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:52.600]  You may remember the executive orders or the national security directives or whatever they were called of the Bush regime about how they could take over the government and ignore the Congress.
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:43:14.600]  That's how we used to discuss that. And they get worse and worse. The one Obama issue is even worse, apparently, than the one Bush issue. And, you know, nobody leaks and they cut off six year old girls to jail and handcuffs because they have temper tantrums and charging with felonies.
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:21.600]  And no one says, what is this? What? I mean, I don't even think Hitler Stalin went that far.
[2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:29.600]  All right, doc. And I have another question for them when I get into the economy. And you also sent us an article about Fukushima. I want to get your take on that.
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:38.600]  But taking folks to the Drudge Report right now, we have the top right hand link climate alarmist calls for burning down skeptics homes.
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:55.600]  I'm not always talking like this, but this is a big senior writer at Forbes saying, burn down our houses, find out who we are and then burn down our houses. And I see Al Gore saying they want an environmental spring here so they can get their carbon tax.
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:09.600]  And then separately, they have SISPA and SOPA and they admit they want to start censoring people and shutting down websites without due process. I mean, doc, I think we're getting to the point where they might actually shut us down.
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:16.600]  That's right. I think you're right. I mean, why shouldn't they? What's to stop them?
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:31.600]  Look, we've already reached the point where the Department of Homeland Security a couple of years ago said they were no longer mainly focused on terrorism. They were now focused on domestic extremists.
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:53.600]  And we had the episode where they went into the homes of the war protesters, the activists, and took the computers and they now have they're trying to make a case against them before grand juries that criticizing the war is the same as giving aid and comfort to the terrorists.
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  Amazing.
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:45:09.600]  That's what they're trying to do. You see what they've done to Julian Sange and to Bradley Manning, to all the whistleblowers, who are supposed to be protected by law, but all right, because the government doesn't pay any attention to the law.
[2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:24.600]  So that's a bombshell point you just made hiding in plain view. They are grabbing peaceful anti-war activist. And I saw this under Bush where they tried a case out in California and I saw the Deputy Attorney General. It was under a Democrat.
[2:45:24.600 --> 2:45:40.600]  He was in the newspaper. I'll still remember because I read it on air over and over. It was like in 2004. And it was in the Oakland newspaper. He said protesting the war, age terrorists, because the war is against terror. And so you need to be arrested.
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:51.600]  And now they're actually trying it. I mean, that is so un-American, so anti-freedom that you can't be against war and that they're going to arrest you. That's the total proof right there.
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:46:04.600]  That's right. And there's not even a short step to the point that if you criticize the government, you are against us, not with us. Remember how Bush phrased it, you're with us or you're against us.
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  Well, if you criticize them on any grounds, then you're against them. And so you can be picked up or shut up or whatever they want to do. You know, the most amazing thing to me was when the Obama official announced,
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  proud to Obama himself, that they had a list of American citizens that they were going to assassinate without due process. And nobody said anything.
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  There was no uproar. Congress didn't say what do you mean? They didn't call hearings. The law schools didn't explode in anger. The federal courts didn't.
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  The bar associations didn't. A few isolated individuals said something about it. You know, I said something. Glenn Greenwall said something.
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  Probably Harvey Silverglay, you know, a few others. But most people just, they just wore off the ducks back there. This is what I say. They're all plugged in.
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:13.600]  They're all in the matrix. And at the end of my article, you know, I quote from the film where it's being explained to Neo that the people,
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:25.600]  the people they're actually trying to save, whose minds are trying to save on plugging them, will actually fight them to the death to stay plugged in.
[2:47:25.600 --> 2:47:35.600]  And that's, you know, you have a large following, but the vast majority of the people, they don't want to be unplugged. And so this helps the government.
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:49.600]  This is why the government can continue. It's very easy to steal people's liberties and freedoms and rights when they're in the matrix because they like it.
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:57.600]  Well, that's my next question, but I want to read the quote that you just mentioned. Why does the establishment want to go to this police state?
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:04.600]  What are they getting ready for? But let me read the quote you're talking about. The matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy.
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:11.600]  But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we're trying to save.
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:19.600]  But until we do, these people are still part of that system and that makes them our enemy. Yeah, they're like grounding people. They try to take you under.
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:30.600]  You have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so injured, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:42.600]  Most of the people I know personally are not willing to be unplugged. I assume my readers are, so seize the opportunity to be further unplugged and read Ron Ounez's comparison of America and China.
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:54.600]  Well, look at China now says they're going to use the model of the NDAA to create their own NDAA. The Communist Chinese now get aid and sucker for their police state from America.
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:49:11.600]  We're now the model of evil. I'm afraid that's true. But I think we're more of a police state than China and the government here is less accountable than in China.
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:35.600]  And when Ron Outz compares the case of the Chinese infant formula that was deluded or mixed with something to make it go further that introduced illness and death killed about 300 babies.
[2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:50.600]  But our heads rolled in China and some people were even executed. But when Merck's drug caused a half a million heart attacks and nothing's happened.
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:50:05.600]  By the way, Paul Watson who writes for prisonplanet.com, his wife is Chinese, so he goes there like two or three times a year now. He says it's incredibly free compared to England and he walks right on the plane right off. In many ways, it's, I tell you, that's scary.
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  And I've had people on and explain that to them who don't go to China and they argue with me. But Paul guarantees it.
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:31.600]  Well, I was there in 2006 and there's no sign of a police state. The Chinese officials I met with had sincere concern with Chinese people on making things work and programs.
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:44.600]  And they had draconian punishments for corruption. And the elite that misbehaves, they just wipe them out. They don't tolerate it. And here it's totally the opposite.
[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:54.600]  But anyhow, Ron Outz is a very careful person and he's brave.
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:51:01.600]  Stay there. Tell us about him on the other side a little bit on this Fukushima situation. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.

[2:53:00.600 --> 2:53:08.600]  Are you storing food? Prepared families are storing food for months and years, but only have enough fuel stored for days or weeks.
[2:53:08.600 --> 2:53:19.600]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power of the sun with the sun of it. Food can be baked, boiled, or steamed at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees with the power of the sun.
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:25.600]  You can use the sun for 50 to 80% of your cooking, allowing you to preserve your fuel storage for rainy days.
[2:53:25.600 --> 2:53:35.600]  Sun-baked foods stay moisture and have less shrinkage and do not burn. Sun-baked roasts are tastier and more succulent, and sun-baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:49.600]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification or personal hygiene. For the past 26 years, sun ovens have been proudly made in the US. They're durable, have a long life, and come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

[2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:36.600]  Dr. Roberts, you were getting to the point of this researcher author. You were saying a very careful guy, but also brave in your words. Finish up with that, and then I want to ask you the question,
[2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:50.600]  why is the ruling class getting rid of all the due process? Because from my study of history, it's generally the ruling class that gets destroyed when they upfront get greedy and get rid of any due process.
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:55:09.600]  I don't know the answer. Historically, it's correct. It was the upper class who wanted to bring in law to protect themselves and their property from the power of kings.
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  Because the kings were above the law, the kings were the law, and all that sort of thing. And this was achieved in England, and we inherited it.
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:29.600]  So apparently, the elite think they've got some other power now, and they no longer need the protection of law, and so they're taking it away from us so that they can do to us what they want.
[2:55:29.600 --> 2:55:42.600]  That's what it looks like. But, you know, who knows, it could just be the drive for power. All of these police agencies want power, and they want less constraints.
[2:55:42.600 --> 2:55:53.600]  And so it could simply have been that 9-11, the way that plate has just been used to take away restraints against the use of arbitrary power.
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:56:01.600]  It may be that simple, or they may have some plan. I don't know. I really don't know.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:09.600]  I agree with you. All I know is, historically, it's deadly dangerous, and if people aren't concerned out there, something's wrong with them.
[2:56:09.600 --> 2:56:13.600]  That's right. Well, there is something wrong with them. They're plugged in the matrix.
[2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:22.600]  They live in virtual reality, an artificial world. They have no idea what's true, what's false. They're propagandized by the media.
[2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:28.600]  Not too many of them get any alternative information. It's just the way it is.
[2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:36.600]  Why do you think Forbes would let a writer come out and say, burn people's houses down that are climate skeptics?
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:40.600]  I don't know. That's crazy. That's crazy.
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  Well, see, it looks like neither side of any issue wants any debate. They just want to impose their view.
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:55.600]  They're completely sold on the rightness of their view that everybody else is wrong, and so you come to war.
[2:56:55.600 --> 2:57:02.600]  You come to war against each other. Nobody wants to listen to see what the truth doesn't mean anything anymore.
[2:57:02.600 --> 2:57:10.600]  It's what I believe it is the truth, and I don't want to question it because I don't want to find out if it's wrong, or if there's some other explanation.
[2:57:10.600 --> 2:57:16.600]  So it's very hard to get any kind of discussion. I mean, even in scholarship, it's hard.
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:19.600]  Mines are closed.
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:25.600]  It is. It's bizarre studying history. It's a very strange time. Briefly, we're almost out of time.
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:27.600]  I hope you have a great weekend coming up.
[2:57:27.600 --> 2:57:33.600]  60 seconds on the economy, and it's further deterioration, and now they're saying, oh, maybe austerity is not good in Europe.
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:36.600]  It's making the economy shut down.
[2:57:36.600 --> 2:57:40.600]  Yes, that's true. That's what austerity will do.
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:57:45.600]  Well, for us, there's no recovery. Nothing's changed.
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:51.600]  All the money and debt that's being created may come back and buy us in the higher prices,
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:58:00.600]  and we may be headed for a real problem of a combination of rising prices and falling employment, and there's no solution to that.
[2:58:00.600 --> 2:58:09.600]  So we're creating the possibility of the worst economic crisis in our history, and they're blind. They're blind to it.
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:16.600]  They continue preoccupation with the banks. Save the banks, screw everybody else.
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:19.600]  That's the policy here, that's the policy in Europe.
[2:58:19.600 --> 2:58:23.600]  Amazing job. I look forward to speaking to you soon. Have a great weekend, Doctor.
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:25.600]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:35.600]  There goes Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. You can find out more at his website, and we've got links to it up on infowars.com.
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:50.600]  I'll be back. Well, Mike Adams is back Sunday with The Sunday Radio Show.
