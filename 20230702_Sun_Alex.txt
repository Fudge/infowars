[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.160]  It's Sunday, July 2nd, 2023.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.040]  I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.840]  I'll be back in studio in Austin, Texas, starting tomorrow.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.160]  But today, tonight, I want to lay out for you how important the developments in France
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.600]  and now spreading around Europe are, and how it's part of a larger globalist slash Soros
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.520]  plan to bring down civilization on its ashes, build back better the new system they've got
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.160]  planned that is beyond anything you've ever read in a science fiction book or even a dystopic
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.760]  novel like 1984.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.840]  This is all planned.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.720]  It's all programmed in their own words, and it's completely diabolical.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.600]  But if the population of the world will simply admit this is happening and admit that they
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.960]  put their globalist operatives in all the key positions of power, and that all this
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.040]  is being done by design, then the public can rally and organize together and stop it.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.680]  But they are imploding the third world, moving it into the first world, brainwashing it to
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.360]  be anti-Western, anti-white, anti-Christian, to then bring down what's left of the West.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.640]  So there's one giant third world slave population with city-states controlled by the globalists
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.600]  that are above the law and tax and control the once great nations of the world.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.160]  Separate technological reservations break away civilizations that use economic and cultural
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.640]  warfare to suppress the population that's even allowed to live.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.360]  Out of the globalist program, the cataclysm, the breakdown, the designed implosion of the
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.000]  world economy is designed to eliminate, at least on the conservative estimates, 80% of
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  the world population.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.960]  That's why they're listing carbon, that plants breathe and that humans exhale as bad.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.000]  You are the carbon they want to eliminate.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.780]  But the good news is, all over the country and all over the world, citizens are confronting
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.440]  the puppets of the World Economic Forum and the UN, like the American psycho from California,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.360]  Gavin Newsom, and of course, Mr. Trudeau up in Canada, who said he admires dictators and
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.680]  that he wants to be a dictator.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.600]  What are you doing to our children?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]  How are you doing?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]  I'm doing fantastic.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]  How about you, Governor Newsom?
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]  Do you know what a detransitioner is?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]  Do you know Chloe Cole?
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]  At the age of 15, she got her breasts removed and now regrets it because of gender-affirmative
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]  care.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]  How about the Lodi woman?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]  Oh, at 13, she got her breasts removed.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]  Gender-affirmative care.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]  No one stopped her.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]  She was mentally unwell.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]  Yeah, I mean, I just had a-
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:54.480]  You can't go in a tanning salon, but young girls and young boys who shed their body parts
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480]  removed.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]  Talk to me.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480]  Our duty.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480]  I'm an attorney.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.480]  I send you letters.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480]  Thousands of people I represent.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]  Hundreds of kids who haven't been confirmed don't commit suicide.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]  Just a second.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]  I'm not that excited.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:19.480]  Kids commit suicide 19 times more after having their body parts removed.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.440]  Governor, parents have legitimate concerns about their kids being able to medically
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.520]  transition at such a young age.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.200]  What do you have to say to those parents?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]  What do you have to say?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.320]  Traitor!
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.320]  How dare you to the-
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]  Coward!
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.320]  Why do you support the mutilation of children?
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]  He's sick.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.360]  Wave if you're a pedophile, that's right.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]  Coward!
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]  He's sick.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.360]  Wave if you're a pedophile!
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.360]  Where is the CCP inquiry criminal?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360]  Traitor!
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]  Where is the CCP inquiry criminal?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:08.680]  If more citizens go to city council, go to the state houses, confront globalists peacefully
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.960]  on the street and point out their crimes across the board, like dissolving our border and
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.080]  the human trafficking and allowing the fentanyl in and the destruction of the dollar, if we
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.960]  confront these globalists everywhere, they won't be able to carry out their operations.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]  This is so critical.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.260]  So I salute the patriots everywhere that are exposing the fact that this new world order
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.300]  is a transhumanist death cult that is seeking to literally sterilize, kill, and murder
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300]  as many people as they possibly can.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300]  We're going to go to break.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.300]  I'm going to come back.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.140]  We'll have the latest that's unfolding in France that's spread to other countries, what's
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.540]  behind it, and how it can be stopped, and what's going to happen if we don't stop it
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.780]  and the George Soros crowd gets their way.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.780]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.620]  Speaking of support, we have the biggest sale of the year so far, the July 4th super
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.100]  sale going right now, and Nitric Boost is so good for your heart, your brain, your lungs,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.100]  your cardiovascular.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.700]  It's amazing.

[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.940]  Super Female Vitality is selling out.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.740]  We got a good shipment of it in, the super mill sold out.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.420]  Despite that, it's 60% off.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.340]  Then, of course, we have super high quality, high spectrum, full spectrum CBD oil.

[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.980]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.980]  Discounted.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.500]  Up to 60% off, double patreon points at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.060]  We are selling out of Real Red Bill Plus, but if you want that, you can get that.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.860]  I mean, it's going to sell out in like a week, the current sales rates.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.860]  Again, we need funds to be able to stay on air.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.860]  We're starting to dig out of the hole.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.420]  I want to get way out of the hole and expand.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.940]  We can only do that with your support, so please take action now.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.060]  You can also make a straight donation at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:15.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:26.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.840]  All right.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.920]  Welcome back to InfoWars, this is Christy Lee and we are still trying to connect with
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]  Judge Joe Brown.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.880]  Hopefully he'll be joining us soon.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.880]  I am joined by my husband, John Scott, back by popular demand.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.640]  And if you would like to join in the conversation so far, we've been really talking about the
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.800]  culture war and really how it's mainly, practically all of these problems that we're seeing are
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:59.500]  tied back to the agenda to destroy the home and to not have two parents in the home.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.840]  And we are going to be having someone join us that I'm going to play a video of here
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.920]  in just a minute.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.240]  But I wanted to give the phone number out if you would like to call while we wait to
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.840]  connect with Judge Joe Brown.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.920]  If you would like to call on Wayana in on any of these topics or say hello, the number
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:22.600]  to call is 1-877-789-2539, 1-877-789-2539.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.360]  You can call right now on Wayana on this topic or what Alex was talking about, about what's
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.280]  going on in France, whatever you would like as far as that goes.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.200]  I do want to share the verse of the day because I haven't done that yet.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.000]  This is the verse I chose for the day, Colossians 4, 2.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.360]  And the verse is, continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with Thanksgiving.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.800]  It's like such a short verse, but it packs in so much.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:53.080]  Keep praying, do it earnestly, be vigilant, of course, for such a time as this, and do
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.640]  that all with a grateful heart.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.360]  So it's really what I feel like puts it all together.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.400]  So great verse for the day, Colossians 4, 2.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.000]  Feel free to share your favorite verses as well if you get a chance to call in.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.520]  So like I said, Natalie, I hope I'm saying her name right, Beisner, she's going to be
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.540]  joining us in the next hour.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:17.120]  She has just kind of suddenly gotten attention for her post.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:24.320]  She has a really awesome monologue type style, and she's a former ex-liberal, has always voted
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.560]  Democrat and just really woke up like so many to what was going on with the pandemic.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.480]  And I know that Alex just recently shared one of her little monologue clips, and I happened
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.320]  to see that she shared that, what like, wow, I'm so honored Alex Jones talked about me
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320]  on his show.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.140]  So I was like, hey, would you like to come on the show?
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.040]  And she said, yes, of course.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.720]  So we're going to get to talk to her and hear more about her story.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.480]  But here is just a sample, a video that I know Alex has shared before because it's just
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]  so good.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.200]  Feminism, the trans agenda, clip number two.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.360]  I'm going to say this again for some of you, feminism paved the way for the trans agenda.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.920]  None of this would have been possible without feminism.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.440]  And I know that ticks off the old school feminists who say we're fighting against this.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.960]  I know you are, but that doesn't mean you didn't unknowingly or otherwise support the
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.160]  movement that led us to this, which is where womanhood is all but meaningless.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.800]  And anyone who feels like a woman can be one.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.800]  Feminists, you have repeatedly denied the differences between men and women.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.400]  You have destroyed the differences between us.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.040]  You have eviscerated traditional gender roles on the basis that they were formed in socialization
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.040]  rather than in biology.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.600]  You have made women into second rate men.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.360]  You have encouraged women to see our most powerful asset, our ability to give life as an avenue
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.320]  through which we are oppressed rather than the avenue through which we find liberation
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]  and fulfillment.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.680]  And the worst way in which you have done this, feminists, is via abortion.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.000]  Feminism lies.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.360]  Feminism tells women that ripping apart, limb from limb, our own offspring inside ourselves
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.560]  is a right and that it's healthcare.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.120]  And now you're mad, feminists, that a man can slap on some makeup, maybe shoot up some
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.800]  estrogen, call himself a woman and demand the right to be treated as such?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.360]  And we all call that gender affirming care?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.120]  Feminists, you invented hiding behind euphemisms.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.680]  You invented demanding a right that isn't there.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.240]  You invented slapping the label healthcare on something that is anything but.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.840]  You dove us headlong into the sexual revolution and you thought you could draw the line of
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]  where it ends.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.160]  But it turns out you can't.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.360]  You forced open the door for womanhood and women to be meaningless and for men to be better
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.800]  than you at both.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800]  So good.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.880]  And so we're going to see her in the next hour, but first we're going to go to Judge
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]  Joe Brown.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.600]  But before we do, I do want to just sneak in a phone call as long as we're talking about
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600]  that subject.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600]  Douglas from California.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600]  Douglas, you're on the air.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]  Good day, Christy.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.320]  Good to talk to you again.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.560]  You as well.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.600]  And congratulations are in order.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]  Yes.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:57.080]  For having not only a husband who's here with me today, but one that knocked me up five
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.880]  months ago.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.680]  We're trying to do our part to keep the world populated because of the depopulation agenda.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.760]  Well done.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.400]  Thank you.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.880]  I'm a grandfather, a veteran, a good, outstanding son.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:23.480]  And I've been concerned about Assembly Bill 957 in the state of California, and I want
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.040]  to provide some update on that.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:36.800]  It did pass the Assembly and was amended to not be a criminal offense, but a civil issue
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.560]  for divorce courts.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.520]  But it's going before the Senate, and I've been calling the senators, posting my opposition
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.920]  and trying to rally support.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.920]  Can you break that down for me?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.960]  What does this mean for the rest of us, or what could this mean?
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.920]  This is gender affirmation.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:03.840]  In other words, you better sign on to gender affirmation in divorce court, or you lose
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.080]  two, five points in the custody hearing.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.920]  Well, I mean, we're already seeing that that's happening tragically in so many cases I've
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:20.080]  interviewed already, many that are being kept from their children, particularly fathers,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.400]  for not signing on to the gender affirmation agenda.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.080]  It's just like it's an automatic, they're going to choose the other parent.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]  It's so awful.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.760]  So this is just going to basically, I guess, solidify it.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.120]  But it's like, for me, it's like they're doing this anyway, you know?
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.680]  I found talking with interns and aides in the senators' offices that they want to hear
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:47.680]  from us because the impression I get is they don't like the idea, and they need our opinion,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.240]  which opposes the bill.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:55.840]  Well, I thank you for drawing attention to it, because if that's the case, then, I mean,
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.240]  you can do nothing else stand, right, Douglas?
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.760]  So Douglas, thank you so much for your phone call, calling from California.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.000]  Let's not give up on California.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.160]  If you're still there, bless your heart.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.600]  I mean, I don't know how you're doing it, because I escaped, and we could only last
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.240]  a little over a year there.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.680]  But if you are there, continue to try and make changes, what changes you can, and make
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:24.840]  sure that you call your legislators, and especially encourage them not to continue to move that
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.920]  assembly bill even further.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.160]  We're going to be joined by Judge Joe Brown, but I don't want to end up having to cut
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]  him off.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.160]  So we're going to take a break in a couple minutes, and then bring him in after that.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.120]  But let's start introducing the topic.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.280]  So basically, one of the main things that we're going to be talking about with Judge
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:46.160]  Joe Brown is these major Supreme Court decisions that happened one after the other.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.200]  First of all, the affirmative action in ruling against race-conscious college admissions.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.200]  Essentially, from what I take of this, is they were saying it was like never okay, and
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.360]  this is actually hurting the Asian population and discriminating mostly against them, is
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.680]  my understanding of what was happening there.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.200]  Is that what you took from it?
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]  John?
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.080]  No, I'm not sure to be honest.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.480]  So that's been defeated.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.880]  The colleges are not supposed to be making judgments based on race anymore when it comes
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]  to admissions.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.800]  Now, a defiant Harvard is vowing to continue to use race in their admissions decisions.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.200]  They're using it from one line in the ruling, basically saying that an applicant's discussion
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.800]  of how race affected his or her life can be used in the determination, and they're going
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.680]  to use that one line to basically, if you write an essay and you talk about how race
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.560]  affected your ability to get to this point or could affect your ability to go to college,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.760]  then make sure that you put that in your essay, and we're going to have Harvard continue its
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.840]  tradition of basically racism.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.080]  There are others speaking out against this.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.760]  A Cornell Law School professor, William Jacobson, said the Supreme Court gave universities a
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.440]  narrow opening, and Harvard just announced it's going to drive an affirmative action truck
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.960]  right through it.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.320]  So that was from Cornell Law School Professor William Jacobson in a tweet.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.240]  And we're also going to be talking about how the Supreme Court has killed Biden's student
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.960]  loan relief plan, according to NBC News.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.920]  Again, notice they used the word kills Biden's student loan relief plan instead of maybe
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:31.320]  saying Supreme Court rejects Biden's student loan relief plan because it was unconstitutional.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.800]  They just act like they vilified, they've made the Supreme Court a murderer by using
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.279]  this word kills, right?
[00:42:37.279 --> 00:42:41.160]  Well, look, I followed it because I still have some student, I mean, I would have benefited
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.160]  from it.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.520]  I would have got 20 grand off my student loans.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.160]  But you know, what's wild about it is they dragged the thing on like a Jeffrey Chaucer
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.480]  story or not even Jeffrey Chaucer, I guess I'm more, I mean, like Charles Dickens paying
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.880]  your quarter every week to watch it.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.480]  And then all of a sudden we get to the very last day.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.920]  And let's talk more about that after this break.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.680]  InfoWars is a one of a kind operation.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.160]  And so please go to InfoWars store and just make a donation and you can make it one time
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.160]  or recurring.

[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.560]  months, every six months, up to nine months.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.520]  You can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it, you just

[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160]  So please do that as well.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.080]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees that are making 20, 30, 40% like we do
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.080]  on the products.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.400]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.960]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.440]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated, people are listening more than ever.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.680]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680]  hard.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]  I know times are tough.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]  So thank you for your support.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.720]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos that
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.720]  you can do for free.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.120]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.520]  So however, God leaves you in your heart to support us.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.520]  Please support us now.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.080]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.960]  God bless you.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.120]  We have three original one of a kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist and info
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.800]  restore.com that don't have fillers that are filled with high quality essential oils and
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.800]  more.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.580]  We have a tumor toothpaste.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.760]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with real calcium toothpaste.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.040]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste again with a whole bunch of key
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.920]  essential oils that are so good, not for your teeth and your gums, but your whole mouth,
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.240]  your throat and more.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.880]  These are really game changing toothpaste.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.760]  They're very, very strong.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.720]  Most over the counter toothpaste have fluoride.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]  Ours don't.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.160]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:40.160]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through mother nature.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.680]  So it's now back in stock and became a bestseller.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.800]  The tumeric toothpaste is available again and inforestore.com we're selling out of the tooth
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.800]  whitening toothpaste.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800]  We've got some of that left.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.120]  We also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120]  out as well.

[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.840]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]  Hey, what's better?
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]  Knockout.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840]  What's better?
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840]  Down and out.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]  What's better?
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.200]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.000]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.120]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.279]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:29.279]  They're all very diverse.

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:23.180]  Well, let me just be clear, I got into Harvard only because of Affirmative Action.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.460]  Yep, guys, that's MSNBC's Joanne Reid, who went on national television to brag about the
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.140]  fact that the only reason she got into Harvard was because she was black and due to Affirmative
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.140]  Action.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.700]  Now, Joanne, that isn't the flex that you think it is.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.580]  As a matter of fact, it's actually pretty damn embarrassing.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.140]  And unlike you, I would honestly much rather have not achieved the accomplishment than
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.540]  have people wondering for the rest of my life whether or not I actually earned it or whether
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.299]  or not I actually just got it because I was black.
[00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:50.700]  Because here's the deal, and this may be the difference between me and you, Joy, I don't
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.779]  need my blackness to open doors for me.
[00:47:52.779 --> 00:47:56.980]  No, my work ethic will, my passion will, my drive will, my ambition will.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.180]  That is all that I need.
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.500]  And the idea that black people need Affirmative Action just to be as good as the white man
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.540]  is a racist idea within itself.
[00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:09.180]  Wasn't the entire goal of our society was to live in a time in which the content of
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.299]  one's character would mean more than the color of their skin?
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.100]  Wasn't that someone's dream once upon a time?
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.859]  So why are you against that dream, Joy?
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.420]  Make that make sense.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.220]  That's the topic.
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:24.740]  Make that make sense.
[00:48:24.859 --> 00:48:28.859]  We are being joined by Judge Joe Brown, an American former lawyer and television
[00:48:28.859 --> 00:48:32.940]  personality. He's a former Shelby County, Tennessee, criminal court judge and is now
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.299]  running for the mayor of Memphis.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.940]  So happy to have Judge Joe Brown with us.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.100]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.020]  And we would love your legal opinion and just your personal opinion on these major
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.779]  Supreme Court rulings in just the past week.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.380]  Well, let's say this.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:57.660]  To begin with, I actually had something to do with the implementation of what was known
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.940]  as Affirmative Action.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:05.940]  But it really is not like what the Supreme Court was dealing with recently.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:12.620]  In fact, the opinion written by Justice Roberts more closely approximates the
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.900]  original conceptualization of Affirmative Action.
[00:49:17.819 --> 00:49:23.779]  And the late mid 1960s, when I was at UCLA, we had a situation where we had a hundred
[00:49:23.819 --> 00:49:29.020]  and forty five full time black students, seventy three undergrad, seventy three grad
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.859]  students, seventy two undergrads.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:35.420]  And that was fewer than they had at UCLA in the 1930s.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.259]  That was out of some 60,000 plus full time students.
[00:49:39.859 --> 00:49:45.460]  So what we looked at was general admissions, which were stated in the catalog as a
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:51.700]  competitive assessment of grade point average aptitude test and or other factors that
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.060]  indicated an ability to succeed.
[00:49:54.819 --> 00:49:59.620]  That's what they were using at major universities around the country to get athletes
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:06.420]  in. We say it in conjunction with other minorities, Hispanics, Asians, Native
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.900]  Americans, et cetera.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:14.779]  We said, look, why don't we use the same standard for everybody and not just limited
[00:50:14.779 --> 00:50:15.940]  to athletes?
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:22.620]  So if you've got somebody who has a demonstrated situation, which may be predicated
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:28.819]  on race, but produced a result that was race neutral, let them in.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.220]  You want to see what they have done.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.420]  Did they have to work?
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:38.020]  Was the situation they grew up in one that imposed a hardship that they overcame?
[00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:43.980]  If you let them in, will they maximize the fallout to their respective communities?
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:52.140]  Now, at that time, California's constitution adopted in 1851 had a specific mandate for
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:59.299]  the University of California to deliver leadership training in all ethnic groups, all
[00:50:59.299 --> 00:51:02.580]  fields, science, industry, you name it.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:11.460]  So what happened is we put this in place now somewhere around 1971, we had some black
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:21.580]  students. Up in UC, well, trying to get in UC Berkeley Medical School, they party too
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:28.299]  much. They came from affluent black families and they did not have anything that came out
[00:51:28.299 --> 00:51:34.060]  of their black experience that gave them a hardship and they should have done just as
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:39.500]  well as a mainstream student when it came to grade point average and aptitude test.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:48.819]  So they did not want this application of other factors to indicate an ability to succeed,
[00:51:48.819 --> 00:51:53.940]  that it worked so well in terms of producing academic success.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:04.540]  What they wanted was just to have one factor, meaning they're black without anything else
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.259]  that's race neutral coming out of it.
[00:52:06.299 --> 00:52:11.180]  And what they sought was to get away from what they were calling a political test, which
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:16.580]  was what does everybody else get out of you going to school?
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:24.740]  In other words, the university itself, society in general, your own people, what do they
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.660]  get out of this when you go to school?
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:32.060]  In other words, have you demonstrated by the things you have involved yourself with, by
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:37.180]  the hardships you've overcome, that you will keep pushing for other people and not just
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.299]  be selfish? Well, they didn't want that.
[00:52:39.299 --> 00:52:42.020]  So they collaborated with UC Berkeley.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:51.060]  And some of the white students and what they wanted was just to be let in on essentially
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:57.620]  a quota, which would say because you are black, you have the highest scores amongst the
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:04.779]  black applicants. But without anything else being demonstrated, you do not match regular
[00:53:04.779 --> 00:53:12.580]  admissions. See, before that, the affirmative action admittees actually matched the
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.620]  ordinary admission standards.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:19.660]  That's why they used to have this thing about what are your extracurricular activities when
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.700]  you turned in an application to a college or university.
[00:53:23.259 --> 00:53:30.220]  That said, they completely disregarded the California Constitution, they phrased things in
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:37.940]  a language that set up Bakke, that said reverse discrimination is a no-no, which it's
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:41.220]  not. I mean, it is and should be.
[00:53:41.779 --> 00:53:47.220]  And that we and other parts of the state were trying to keep them from doing.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.620]  We said, this is bogus.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.660]  Don't go there.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.700]  You're going to set up a negative precedent.
[00:53:53.299 --> 00:53:59.940]  So since then, the language and the way the whole issue has been cast is not the way it
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:05.220]  started, which is these students match regular admission criteria.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:11.700]  Just take one aspect of that admission process that is ordinarily reserved for athletes and
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.220]  applied across the board.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:18.020]  Now it's simply somebody gets in because they were black.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:24.299]  Interestingly enough, Clarence Thomas was admitted to Yale Law School under an
[00:54:24.299 --> 00:54:26.020]  affirmative action program.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:32.020]  Now, I did, I got in through the front door and same thing with law school.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:37.259]  And I had such high scores all across that they were trying to recruit me in various
[00:54:37.259 --> 00:54:44.299]  places so they could bring me in to set up the parameters for the new kind of affirmative
[00:54:44.299 --> 00:54:45.340]  action program.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:51.980]  Interestingly enough, Clarence Thomas got in a little academic difficulty at Yale and he
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:58.779]  seems to have spent his first summer between being a first year law student and a second
[00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:03.980]  going around the country speaking against the affirmative action programs he got in
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:10.140]  under. So what we have seen over the years is a complete misstatement of the concept.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:17.580]  And in actuality, what Justice Roberts says in his majority opinion is exactly what
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:26.100]  black students, brown students, red students, yellow students were saying back in the
[00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.540]  60s was what we wanted as affirmative action.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.899]  So the clock has been turned back and a lot of nonsense has been stripped out of the way
[00:55:34.899 --> 00:55:40.380]  because I don't think it's right to select somebody in because of what their color is
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.340]  without showing that their color has some negative impact on their circumstances and then
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.420]  they have overcome it.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:53.180]  You can see that a lot these days where everybody is whining and complaining about, oh,
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:56:00.259]  everybody's dumping on me and when are you going to come up with an equivalent for such
[00:56:00.299 --> 00:56:03.380]  and such ethnic group is like, save the tigers.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.380]  The tiger used to be king of the jungle.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.740]  Now he's endangered.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:14.060]  So $10, $19 a month to World Wildlife Fund so you can save the tigers in that way.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.259]  You know, it's crazy.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.420]  And the other point is this.
[00:56:18.859 --> 00:56:26.500]  If you want an affirmative action program, mothers, particularly in single parent female
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:32.980]  head of household homes, sit on the other side of the kitchen table with your child
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.340]  because there's nobody racist to anybody sitting on the other side and make them do their
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.500]  homework. This is not about being nice.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.660]  It's not about being entitled.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:49.060]  It's not about the world owes you anything because the world is a very dangerous place.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:56.060]  You could get hit by a bolt of lightning, a meteorite, a piece falling off of an aircraft.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:04.259]  You could get swept away with a tsunami, a flood, a hurricane, typhoon, tornado.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.899]  You name is dangerous being here.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.140]  So it is unfair to the to get them.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.620]  Going off into everybody owes you something and you live in a safe world and you're entitled
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.020]  to be safe. No, you're not.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:24.740]  And then the other problem is a fallout on our status as citizens in this country.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:30.100]  Being in the land of the free and the home of the let's hold that topic until we do have
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.779]  to take another quick break, but please stay on and then when we return, we can finish
[00:57:33.779 --> 00:57:38.940]  that thought. We can also maybe see if John has a question that he wants to get in there
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.140]  as well. So stick with us during the break.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:46.700]  Make sure you're checking out all the amazing products from InfoWarsStore.com and
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.020]  stay with us for Judge Joe Brown.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.500]  Two of our best selling new tropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.100]  InfoWarsStore.com and for a limited time, they're 50 percent off when you get them
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.340]  together or 40 percent off when you get them individually.
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.740]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[00:58:03.899 --> 00:58:06.380]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:12.380]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.060]  And the other is a very special for people like me.
[00:58:15.899 --> 00:58:20.220]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.340]  hits really, really quick.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.220]  And I love it. It wears off in two to three hours.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.500]  So if I've got to work at night, I don't want to stay up all night.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.500]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:32.060]  I stay up till midnight working, doing radio interview or something and boom, writing
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.140]  an article or writing a book.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.660]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.
[00:58:36.819 --> 00:58:41.060]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50 percent off by themselves or 40 percent
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.620]  off individually. A lot of people love these products.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.660]  They've got five star reviews.
[00:58:44.779 --> 00:58:46.380]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.259]  Fifty percent off. Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:54.460]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.060]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.140]  So let me get this straight.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:02.740]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.660]  Obama administration, Biden accepted a ten million dollar bribe through his son Hunter
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:10.819]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an
[00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:14.299]  event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment and forcing the
[00:59:14.299 --> 00:59:18.220]  arming of Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:23.180]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:27.100]  that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.859]  during the 2020 campaign.
[00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:33.340]  All while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.500]  admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016 when they were
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.580]  simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.299]  evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.020]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:59:51.259 --> 00:59:57.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:10.740]  All right, we are talking to Judge Joe Brown, yes, the television personality, an American
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.819]  former lawyer, he's actually running for Memphis mayor right now.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:19.700]  He has some strong thoughts on these, what the liberal media would call dangerous,
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:27.740]  non-relevant SCOTUS decisions, you know, or Biden.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:33.940]  What did he say? Biden said it's not an ordinary court because it's following the
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:39.819]  Constitution. So you were starting to get into to to something.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.700]  Sorry, go ahead, you just take it away.
[01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:46.340]  You see it in California.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.020]  You just got through talking about it.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.740]  And you see it in Michigan where they want to make it.
[01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:58.980]  Well, the House part of their legislative body in Michigan just went through trying to
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:04.580]  make it a felony and a ten thousand dollar fine to not call somebody for their favorite
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.779]  pronoun. Decide what that does to the English language.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.540]  Like I said, he's here or he is here.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.299]  She is here.
[01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:15.299]  It is here.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.899]  I guess you're supposed to say they is here.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.740]  I mean, that's not how you English language.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.340]  And this is just rank selfish.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:30.460]  But this kind of assault on the First Amendment is spreading.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.500]  And we've got this thing where the land of the home of the brave.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.580]  That whoa, what happened here?
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.779]  Yes, there is your back.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.180]  You're just that assault on free speech right there.
[01:01:46.899 --> 01:01:48.340]  You're back. OK.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.299]  Yeah. By the way.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.779]  YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.
[01:01:55.859 --> 01:02:00.340]  They impact interstate commerce and interstate communication.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:06.100]  You saw one of the Supreme Court cases holding that the woman is a matter of religious
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:13.460]  preferences, is not going to be required to open up websites for gay couples getting
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.299]  married. Right.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:22.259]  The Supreme Court had jurisdiction over her one person because what she did impacted
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.740]  interstate commerce or communications.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:32.180]  It is obvious that Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and all of the rest
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:35.060]  impact interstate communications.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:41.899]  They have FCC licenses and all of us need to set up busting them so we can haul them
[01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:47.259]  through the court when they start trying to say we are restricting conservative speech
[01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:52.620]  because we don't want some of our leftist folk to feel hurt feelings.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.180]  See, that's not embraced in the Constitution.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:03:01.220]  You can stomp on somebody's feelings as long as you are speaking what you believe to be
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:05.740]  the truth or there is argument or you're taking issue with some position.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.100]  So we need to bust them the same way this has happened.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:15.779]  Now, that other one you brought up, what happened with the loan situation?
[01:03:15.819 --> 01:03:23.500]  Well. Basically, what the Supreme Court said is the statute under which Biden is trying
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:28.420]  to act did not allow him to do what he was trying to do.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.540]  If the legislature wants to do it, we'll revisit that.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.540]  They're saying, let's move on.
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:42.100]  But the president doesn't have that authority to sign off by fiat what he wants.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:48.540]  He can't legislate by executive order unless there is money already allocated for his
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.420]  discretion, which there is not.
[01:03:50.859 --> 01:03:57.299]  And hell, I feel a little worked up because I had to pay my loans back such as they
[01:03:57.299 --> 01:04:03.460]  were. But there's one other thing, too, that is really not being addressed.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.660]  See, the cutoff to get maximum benefits is one hundred and twenty five thousand a year
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:13.220]  for one person. That's also to cut off.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:21.500]  From being below to be in middle class now anywhere else in the world, if you have a
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.500]  four year college degree, you're automatically in the middle class and above that
[01:04:25.939 --> 01:04:30.140]  deadline. But in the United States, there are a whole lot of people that have a four year
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.899]  college degree that are not.
[01:04:31.899 --> 01:04:35.340]  And something needs to be done with that.
[01:04:35.819 --> 01:04:36.939]  Because that's a good point.
[01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:41.819]  I mean, I just had a dollar store cashier that was saying, yeah, I went to school for
[01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:46.260]  engineering, but I'm making more here right now than with my my engineering chemistry
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.460]  degree. It's insane.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.859]  Judge Joe Brown, please stay on through this break because that was such a short segment.
[01:04:51.859 --> 01:04:55.140]  We'll finish up with you on the other side if you don't mind sticking around.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.100]  And just get your final thoughts.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:57.899]  Thank you so much.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:03.859]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:04.859]  word of mouth and prayer.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.819]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists, the fact that we're
[01:05:08.819 --> 01:05:12.979]  not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.700]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.180]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWars.com like books and films
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.979]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.220]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:30.380]  almost 100 percent of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to

[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.140]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.939]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action
[01:05:47.939 --> 01:05:52.180]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.779]  Great Reset by going to InfoWarsStore.com and clicking on the donate button and

[01:05:58.939 --> 01:05:59.700]  Please take action.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.260]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.660]  Welcome back.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.260]  It is a date night with my husband here on InfoWars desk.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:30.180]  We're hanging out with Judge Joe Brown, such a smart man, so much charisma.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.979]  And I love how you just lay down the facts, lay down the truth.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:37.340]  Speaking of, I did want to give my husband permission to speak and ask a question.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:43.300]  Yeah, now that I've been granted permission, Judge, I'm telling you, he keeps me in a box
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.060]  at home and pulls me out the co-host.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.460]  Come on now, you've got to do better than giving him permission to speak.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.300]  I know. Well, because he's the smarter one of us.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:01.420]  So I can't allow that to be exposed as much as it is happening.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.580]  But go ahead. Go ahead, John.
[01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:08.660]  Well, you know, one of the things that's brought me to be a big fan of you these days,
[01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:14.939]  Judge, is in many ways your continuous talk about, you know, masculinity and just the
[01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:16.540]  father's not being in the home.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.260]  And and that that's something that just strikes deep in my own situation.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.899]  I mean, I come from a situation where I'm a I was one of four kids with a single mom
[01:07:24.899 --> 01:07:29.460]  until she met my stepfather, who was an educator and really brought structure and taught us
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.779]  how to be men. And then here I'm now in a situation, I'm a stepfather to three kids for
[01:07:33.779 --> 01:07:36.819]  my wife. Same thing, trying to teach these boys to be men.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:43.740]  And, you know, it's inspiring to see the older generations that are that are that are
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.979]  being vocal about that.
[01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:47.500]  And I've always appreciate your thoughts on that yourself.
[01:07:47.979 --> 01:07:49.460]  Originally from Baltimore City.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.420]  So it's I'm coming from a city that I feel a lot of broken homes to begin with.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.620]  And I've heard you talk in depth about kind of family structure and urban environments.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.700]  And you was a you was a judge in the court.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:09.500]  So I'm curious on on your thoughts on that kind of stuff in here in society today, as
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.899]  well as how that kind of ties into that the first dysfunctional family of Joe Biden and
[01:08:14.899 --> 01:08:22.380]  Hunter Biden. Well, you know, for fifty five years, I've had this slogan protecting
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.980]  womanhood and childhood while promoting manhood.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:33.020]  Yeah. An example, when I was on the bench for a 10 year period, they did this study.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.620]  The statewide recidivism rate for felons was about 80 percent.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:41.580]  In my courtroom, it dropped down to 18 percent.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:47.660]  And the secret was simply putting manhood, masculinity and some guy's head.
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:54.460]  So he had a purpose and a cause that kept him from wanting to give up, die or drug out,
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.180]  bang out or whatever it may be, because he saw adversity.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:03.580]  He was willing to challenge it because now he had a cause and a purpose.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.340]  Right now, I'm attempting to broker.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:15.740]  Public peace with some of the street gangs through their old G's, and they're tired of the
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.139]  killing and the violence.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.780]  And one of the things they've noticed is that they are trying to figure out how to get
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.980]  manhood back in the hood.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:30.780]  And one of the problems they're having right now is 13 through 16 year olds, males who
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.460]  are completely out of control.
[01:09:33.059 --> 01:09:40.700]  And it does no good when our policy is attempting to destroy masculinity and try to get
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.700]  people to perceive of it as toxic.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.700]  It's like if you can imagine the human race is a bicycle.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.660]  There are two wheels on that bike.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.020]  Once you learn to ride that bike, you never forget.
[01:09:53.059 --> 01:09:58.940]  But some people, because they hate what wheel they happen to be, they want to convert
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:04.940]  humanity to a unicycle, which does not work too well, because with a bike, you can add an
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.740]  engine to it and you got a motorcycle.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.540]  You can go 200 miles an hour.
[01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:11.260]  You can't do that on a unicycle.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.900]  It wobbles all over the place.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.420]  You can't carry a load on it.
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.740]  You can't go down a rough trail.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:23.980]  So why in the world is our government attempting to oppose a quasi religious.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:30.940]  Cult on the rest, and you mentioned this earlier, you're talking about California, but
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.020]  let's look at it this way.
[01:10:33.219 --> 01:10:39.139]  You have Buddhism, let's talk about that is recognized religion, but there's no God for
[01:10:39.139 --> 01:10:43.260]  Buddhism. It's a secular type of philosophy.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:50.219]  Well, the same thing with LGBTQ and the rainbow, not all gay folk, by the way, support
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:59.380]  LGBTQ because of that association with transsexualism and this desire with pedophilia to
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.380]  be spread. So you groom children for sex.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.700]  Now, back to this, is it being a cult?
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:12.500]  Well, as one person I used to work with in Hollywood said, you know, just because you're a
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:17.100]  Christian doesn't mean you supported Reverend Jim Jones and drinking Kool-Aid at large
[01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.980]  church in Guyana.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.380]  Or if you're Islamic, doesn't mean you support Al-Qaeda or ISIS, you see.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:29.540]  So we have to understand that we're getting something run on us because we have just
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.940]  thrown away leadership.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.780]  We've thrown away cause and purpose nationally.
[01:11:34.059 --> 01:11:36.740]  And some people are trying to seek a substitute.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:43.900]  So what they do is this idea that inclusion includes not just.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:52.020]  Being fair and giving everybody an equal opportunity, but giving people, especially those
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.820]  with certain circumstances, an entitlement.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.940]  In other words, you don't have to do anything but exist.
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.059]  You don't have to earn.
[01:11:59.059 --> 01:12:05.059]  It's supposed to fall in your lap and you're supposed to get a Super Walt Disney world or
[01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:08.700]  something in the country where you wish upon a star.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.460]  It makes no difference who you are.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.700]  Your dreams come true.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.100]  The world doesn't work that way.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:19.940]  So we have to start imposing these kind of things again and we have to start taking back
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:25.940]  their cities, which is one of the reasons why I lapsed out of a comfortable retirement
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:30.219]  to save Memphis before it slides too far down the rabbit hole.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.700]  I do service, which is what this is.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.940]  I also do sauce.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500]  My friend Mr.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.460]  Jones was selling some of the sauce that I had.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.820]  Judge Joe Brown bought a few products.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.620]  I was just telling my wife about that.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.059]  So selling those products.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.700]  Get it. And let me put this bird in.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.660]  If you want to pick up on me, check out what's on that little thing you showed.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.820]  JJB2023.com.
[01:13:00.219 --> 01:13:03.380]  JJB2023.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:03.900]  I like it.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.580]  Now, also, there is JJBBQ.com.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.340]  Judge Joe Brown barbecue sauce and something I want to commend to both of you that you
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.300]  should tell everybody listening to you to check out.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.860]  There is a website doesn't have anything to do with me.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.219]  It's called FollowTheMoney.org.
[01:13:24.059 --> 01:13:25.219]  Don't Google it.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.980]  Put it directly in your browser and you can go there.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.740]  Put your official's name in their state.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:33.820]  They are city.
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.740]  They are what office they have.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:42.420]  And you can see who's been contributing to them and who has helped them or who owns
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.700]  them. It's quite enlightening when you see the extent of the subsidies, the
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:55.180]  downright purchase of certain elected officials that is reflected in that.
[01:13:55.219 --> 01:13:58.380]  Now, they're merging into another site, but you can still get it.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:03.100]  FollowTheMoney.org and see who owns your local political.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.340]  That is got to do with what you said, sir.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:12.980]  And what Brother Jones is saying, we have to fight the corruption, which is what I'm
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:17.020]  going to do in Memphis, because even though it ought to be one of the biggest, most
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.260]  prosperous cities in the United States of America, it is currently one of the most
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.940]  corrupt. And one of the problems we get, whether you're talking about Chicago, New
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.540]  York, or you're going to D.C.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:36.340]  or Los Angeles, is the city administrations are inept, incompetent.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:41.540]  And problem is, there's no effective strong man or strong woman leadership where
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.900]  anybody can get somebody to follow me.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:51.260]  And you see that so lacking, I guess if they had an outbreak and a whole lot of
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:56.780]  people were suffering from dysentery or diarrhea, they wouldn't even follow
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:01.740]  most of the leadership we have in our cities to a port-a-potty to get toilet
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.500]  paper. It seems like most people have just tuned out, to be honest.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.940]  I feel like a lot of people in a lot of cities don't even think they're relevant.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.420]  They aren't. Yeah.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.340]  No, I agree. I laugh when I when I watch it, when I watch the mayor of the city of
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.780]  Baltimore get up and give a press conference, I can't help but laugh.
[01:15:20.219 --> 01:15:21.500]  I don't know who handles that, man.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:30.340]  But. Speaking of some things, I want to throw this at you, Bray, the idiot D.A.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.180]  up in New York is going after Trump, right?
[01:15:34.059 --> 01:15:41.900]  Essentially, what he did was indicted Trump for supposedly bribing Stormy
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.420]  Daniels to be quiet and not bribe.
[01:15:45.059 --> 01:15:46.139]  Right. OK.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:52.219]  And he went after the corporate entity because they didn't fully disclose what the
[01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:53.540]  settlement was about.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:58.100]  All right. That's going to have to be a tease because because we have to hit the
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:04.700]  break. Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth, and they've
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.820]  got our children drinking that.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.300]  This is a psychotic death cult, period.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.700]  Case closed. Out to get you and your family.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:17.580]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.860]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:16:21.139 --> 01:16:24.980]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.780]  system out there that sells for twice the price.
[01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:30.420]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.660]  It reduces things to non detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.260]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.820]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:42.460]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:48.059]  of leading competitor. And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you
[01:16:48.059 --> 01:16:50.580]  should filter your water. You should also filter your shower water.
[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.980]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.620]  But but I'm done talking about that.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.340]  The point is you get the filters at M4store.com.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.300]  They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.900]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.180]  entire food supply.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.420]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.540]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:17.059]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:20.500]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.860]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.980]  naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.940]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.500]  from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:45.420]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:52.420]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.660]  thyroid and a healthy metabolism.

[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:18.080]  All right, welcome back to InfoWars.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.080]  We're going to get to your phone calls.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.760]  I know you've been waiting for a while.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.760]  Thank you for your patience.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.560]  We're going to get to your phone calls right away, but we're just going to let Judge Joe
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.940]  Brown finish his very intelligent thought that he was starting with about what they're
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.660]  doing to Trump in New York.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.720]  So thank you, Judge Joe Brown, wanted to allow you to finish your thought before we
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.120]  have to say goodbye.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.720]  Very briefly, gotcha.
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:47.720]  What is going on if you have to bribe somebody to keep from being embarrassed in Tennessee,
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:53.520]  depending upon how much is involved is eight to 30 years in the penitentiary.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.440]  It's a felony or 15 to 60 if it's a lot of money and it's called blackmail.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.600]  So what Bragg did is indicted the victim of blackmail, a felony.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:12.480]  Now as to the corporation that did not disclose these things on its financial report, well,
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:19.240]  that's public record and American law encourages settlement rather than trial.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.160]  When you have a settlement, there is a gag provision that usually attaches to it, which
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.600]  says while we will be, you can't talk about what the details are.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:36.360]  So if the corporation would have detailed report in it, they're violating the Greg gag
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]  provision.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:44.120]  So following the law results in an indictment, he's really see, this is this thing that you
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]  get.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:54.760]  I wonder if it's affirmative action where they don't get the point because there's another
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.760]  thing.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.760]  They may not be that bright.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:01.640]  It may be politically connected, but they aren't so smart because that's first year
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.400]  law students flip the stuff, flip the script.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:10.640]  If you pay somebody not to talk about you, you just got blackmail.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.560]  Oh, do you go after the blackmailer or do you go after the victim?
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.680]  So I mean, anyway, I'll rest on it.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.480]  But it's the kind of thing that I had to deal with being fair, objective, neutral, and attached.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.320]  And somebody needs to get back.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.080]  Yeah, it's such a great way to wrap this up is that reminder.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.080]  I mean, it's so maddening to see all of the injustice that's going on.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.720]  But to be a judge and have to see it happening, I can't imagine.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.920]  It's probably even worse.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.640]  Well, good luck to you on your run for mayor there in Memphis.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.040]  We hope that you can win and turn things around.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.520]  And thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.600]  We're going to pick up some of that barbecue sauce judge.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:50.040]  Yeah, we're going to we're going to pick up some barbecue sauce.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.840]  It's good stuff and we have powder, too.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.160]  All right. All right.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.680]  We got it. Oh, it's summertime.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.600]  July. Get it together so you can impress with your feedback.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.920]  All right. Well, thank you, Judge.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.640]  All right, folks, it is time to get to your phone calls.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.840]  Thank you so much for staying on the line.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.960]  We got Carol in Texas.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.840]  Go ahead, girl. John, how are you doing?
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.360]  Christy, how are you?
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.480]  Good. Love your don't you just love her peppiness?
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.520]  You're so peppy, Carol.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.360]  I love it. Well, you spread it around, but you let it go.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.320]  But I've got to say congratulations to you and John.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.760]  Thank you. Thank you.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.480]  You're so excited for being here.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.320]  Oh, she's Chris. He's glowing.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.520]  I try to tell her days just to have her listen.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.720]  Oh, you guys, I tell you, I put myself here.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.920]  But you know what? I'm you really hit on a lot of things like you always do.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.920]  It's like I was thinking about this,
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.680]  like with the pretty much the last key generation began with.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.280]  I want to say as late as both since Lyndon B.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.920]  Johnson took that, took daddy out of the home.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.520]  Right. So I guess generating Generation X kicked off, you know.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.440]  But I mean, the government perpetrated this.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.520]  They despise the nuclear family.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.760]  And when the government replaces daddy in the home, the family's going to crumble.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.480]  You know? Yeah, 100 percent.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.800]  Well, what happens, you know, that's the thing.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.240]  I see half of the things I see these days.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.920]  And I wonder, like, what do people think the result was going to be
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.000]  when when it's it's now just OK?
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.600]  I mean, the broken family now is just OK.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.160]  It's looked at as OK. There's nothing wrong.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.080]  It's not only looked at as OK, but as I was talking about earlier
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.640]  and admitting humbly when I was a single mom, there's a lot of like
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.920]  whether it was your fault of the broken marriage or it wasn't your fault
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.760]  or if I was both, but whatever it is, you're going to have this thing
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.000]  called mom guilt like and you feel so sad for your kids
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.080]  that that they're having to grow up in a broken home.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.000]  And so when you have society being like, look at her, she can do it all.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.160]  She's handling it all.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.120]  You know, like it's very easy to be like, yeah, I got this.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.400]  I got I'm doing great.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.920]  Like, look at me. I'm working and I'm I'm raising these kids up by myself.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.040]  You know, you fall into that.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.000]  And I admit it like in looking back and now that I have a helper in the home,
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.760]  I wasn't doing a good job.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.280]  I can I can freely admit that I needed my helper.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.720]  I needed a man in the home to lay down the law, if you will.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.720]  You know, it's just it it's just something about a man's voice
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.400]  telling you to do something compared to a woman's voice.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.560]  It's just different, you know?
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  Well, yeah. Well, and even it's even to get I feel that it's my job
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.800]  is to get productive members of society out there into society.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.880]  And the the death of a family and or the
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.760]  the breakup of a family might as well be like a death in many ways.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.400]  I know I went me and all my siblings handled handled our parents divorced
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.520]  differently. I feel like in the situation I am with my three stepkids,
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.120]  you could tell each one of them is handling their situation differently.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.880]  And I see this in lots of people coming out of the same type situations.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.480]  But what happens if you put people like that out in the society
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.400]  that haven't come to terms with their issues?
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.080]  You know what I mean?
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.320]  And then I truly feel that's what we see daily
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.480]  when we see all the wildness that we see on the news.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  You know, we just see a byproduct of of failed families
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.400]  and in many ways could be a failed commitment in many ways for people
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:36.280]  that have just. Left for for selfish reasons, I feel like.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.360]  Well, yeah, it's encouraged.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.120]  And thank you, Carol, for bringing us up about, you know, we first have to admit
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.960]  that there's a problem before we tackle it instead of instead of celebrating it.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.800]  Let's see if we can sneak in Max from New York.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.960]  I'm sorry, Carol. I took that moment.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.920]  Max from New York.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.480]  Basically, same topic. Go ahead.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.400]  Well, I the part of it, it has to do with getting the word out to the public,
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:06.680]  if I may, and it would be a good idea to make out CDs
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.600]  or thumb drives on subjects like January 6, Biden and the Chinese,
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.560]  the Clintons, LGBT agenda, and have them translated into various languages
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.000]  like Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and Hebrew.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.640]  Tell them about the three bucks a piece.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.800]  I'll buy 100 of them right now.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.520]  And with this, whoever has them buys up a large quantity.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.040]  You can always pass them out, go to church, put them in the pews,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.880]  go to the synagogue, put them in the pews in order to get the word out.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.000]  It's like guerrilla marketing.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.240]  It would be you could have half of Latin America is dying
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.920]  for this information that Alex has. They're dying for it.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.160]  They're hungry for it.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.920]  If you put it out there, you'll have half of Latin America listening to Alex Jones.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.760]  I love the idea of doing the thumb drives or even just like going back to paper.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.280]  And I've talked about this before.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.600]  As long as we face the threat of censorship,
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.440]  which they are not going to stop trying to censor.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.600]  And I mean, they may even try and shut down the Internet.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.440]  It's a great idea to start backing up some information on thumb drives
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.000]  or even on paper and and handing out to people the old fashioned way, right?
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.840]  I mean, if they cut off the Internet, this is all we got would be the CDs
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.520]  and the thumb drives. Mm hmm.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.840]  No, it's the truth.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.080]  Absolutely. Thank you, Max, for that idea.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.800]  And I encourage those of you that, you know, if you do have the time,
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.320]  I know many of this Infowars audience does.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.880]  They already have their their folders and, you know, their catalogs.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.600]  But keep doing it because we never know when they're going to think about
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.320]  how successful to like just things such as the I did that stickers with Biden.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.240]  Yeah, it's it's so subtle.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.480]  But you see them everywhere all over the country now.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.640]  Yeah, I just feel it's it's you can do it.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.000]  This is how we fight back.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.680]  Yeah. All right. We got to hear from our break again.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.240]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get the amazing products.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.800]  Stay healthy and spread the word like Max said.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.880]  We'll be back with our next guest.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.320]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.800]  I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.360]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it?
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.000]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.840]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.440]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.880]  Krill oils is the best.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.280]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.160]  And I'm just sorry you want something like this.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.120]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.320]  In my view, I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.280]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.040]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.480]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.200]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.840]  But you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is, we've got.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.120]  I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.440]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:59.680]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.920]  dealings? I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.040]  So let me get this straight.
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.440]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.200]  the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.920]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.720]  An event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment and forcing
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.920]  the arming of Ukraine.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.280]  In turn, setting the stage for the current war against Russia, evidence of the
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.840]  bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.960]  swore was a Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.160]  the 2020 campaign.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:38.160]  All while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.680]  FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016 when they
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.280]  were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.400]  falsified evidence for a corruption charge.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.720]  The FBI is also investigating the Trump administration's investigation into
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:57.000]  Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.800]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.280]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800]  We want to have all the best brands.

[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.400]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.120]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.480]  They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label a national

[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.600]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.680]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.120]  Different compounds are better for different people.

[01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:17.990]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.990]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:26.990]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Christy Lee in today guest hosting with my husband
[01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.990]  John Scott.
[01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.990]  Hello.
[01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.990]  I like your little hello.
[01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:33.990]  Anyways, let me tell you how God works.
[01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:38.469]  So I had found out I was going to be guest hosting today, which is always an honor.
[01:33:38.469 --> 01:33:42.389]  I love being able to sit here at this desk.
[01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:50.030]  And I had just pulled up in Instagram and the very first post I see is Alex Jones, which
[01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:51.030]  is funny.
[01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:54.230]  I was like, oh, I'm going to be guest hosting this Sunday.
[01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:55.910]  And the first post I see is Alex Jones.
[01:33:55.910 --> 01:34:02.110]  But it was actually a post from my guest today, Natalie Beisner, who was saying like, check
[01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:03.110]  me out.
[01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:04.110]  It's exciting.
[01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:07.870]  Essentially, Alex Jones played my monologue.
[01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:08.870]  This is really cool.
[01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:13.509]  And so I was able to message her and be like, well, how about you just come on now?
[01:34:13.509 --> 01:34:15.110]  He's introduced you to the world.
[01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:16.309]  Now you can come on as my guest.
[01:34:16.309 --> 01:34:20.110]  So I just thought that was so funny that I had just found out and I pulled up Instagram
[01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:21.269]  and there she was.
[01:34:21.269 --> 01:34:22.910]  So this was meant to be.
[01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:27.230]  Natalie Beisner is a content creator with a focus on politics and social issues.
[01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:31.070]  She's a former liberal, atheist, feminist, Democrat.
[01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:34.269]  All of those things turned Christian conservative.
[01:34:34.269 --> 01:34:36.509]  So thank you, Natalie Beisner, for coming on with us.
[01:34:36.509 --> 01:34:37.509]  Hi, Christy.
[01:34:37.509 --> 01:34:40.030]  Thank you guys for having me.
[01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.030]  You're welcome.
[01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:42.030]  So I love your style.
[01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:46.990]  You have you just kind of look at the camera and you have these amazing monologues that
[01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:53.790]  you spit out, kind of like almost like a female Tucker Carlson or if you will.
[01:34:53.790 --> 01:35:00.190]  But I'd love to know, you know, obviously your thoughts are organized and logical.
[01:35:00.309 --> 01:35:03.790]  How did you get to a point where you could have organized, logical thoughts after being
[01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:07.509]  a liberal, atheist, feminist, Democrat?
[01:35:07.509 --> 01:35:14.190]  Well, I like to say that I was always a critical thinker and I like to think of myself as an
[01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:18.030]  intelligent person, but I was really blinded for a very long time.
[01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:22.670]  I think it's really easy nowadays, even though we're living in such critical times, to be
[01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.990]  blind, especially in Southern California, where I live.
[01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:30.590]  I was an actress for a long time and just did not think too hard about politics.
[01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:35.030]  And then summer 2020 changed my entire life.
[01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:40.910]  Just the response to not only COVID, but especially compared to the response to the BLM riots and
[01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:47.790]  protests in Los Angeles, especially, but all over the nation, I could not, I couldn't fathom
[01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:53.870]  the hypocrisy of the largely Democrat, but also Republican at the time response.
[01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:56.790]  And that opened my eyes to a lot of what's going on.
[01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.750]  And from there, it was a big rabbit hole.
[01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:05.190]  Now, you do say Christian conservative, so just because you were a former Democrat, you've
[01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:08.030]  always voted Democrat.
[01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:13.550]  You're not sold on the Republican side either, which, I mean, my husband and I are more ascribed
[01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:16.830]  to independent and faith-based.
[01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:17.830]  Is that where you are at too?
[01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:20.150]  Are you kind of disgusted with both parties?
[01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:26.269]  Yeah, I like to say that I'm a Christian and a conservative before I'm ever Republican.
[01:36:26.269 --> 01:36:32.150]  I would never vote just down party lines again, which is what I did as a Democrat.
[01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:34.030]  And I want to be clear that it wasn't overnight.
[01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:37.990]  I didn't just feel burned by my city and county's response to COVID.
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:40.469]  So I decided, well, now I'm a Christian conservative.
[01:36:40.469 --> 01:36:45.550]  It just, it opened my eyes for the first time to the fact that the lie had been sold, that
[01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:50.349]  the Democrat Party, the, I hesitate to call people liberal now because they're not liberal,
[01:36:50.349 --> 01:36:53.870]  but the liberals, so to speak, the radical left, that they're the compassionate ones.
[01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:57.550]  And if you're a compassionate person, that's how you vote and that's how you think.
[01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:02.670]  And I felt that so deeply, oh, this is not compassion in summer 2020.
[01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:07.490]  And then it turns out, well, there's a lot of stuff going on that's not compassion.
[01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:10.990]  And very often the people that they claim to want to be helping and their policies
[01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:12.910]  claim to help, they end up hurting.
[01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:17.790]  Yeah, I would say I like to think of myself as an independent thinker.
[01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:21.309]  I'm sure a lot of people would identify me as a Republican,
[01:37:21.309 --> 01:37:23.950]  but I'm a Christian conservative before I'm anything else.
[01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:27.790]  I'm sure they wouldn't identify you as a Republican before they would
[01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:30.429]  identify you as a right-wing extremist.
[01:37:35.230 --> 01:37:38.030]  I mean, it's just like, if you are not following along with the narrative,
[01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:44.670]  you're automatically put into this team of ultra-mega right-wing extreme.
[01:37:45.630 --> 01:37:47.549]  And that's what I saw during 2020.
[01:37:47.549 --> 01:37:51.309]  If you had any questions about COVID, about BLM, anything, it was like,
[01:37:51.309 --> 01:37:53.950]  you're immediately persona non grata.
[01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:56.830]  And that blew my mind because I was in line with everything else.
[01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.750]  I just had some questions about why I couldn't go to work.
[01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:03.469]  Well, I know that even Elon Musk had a post recently on Twitter
[01:38:03.469 --> 01:38:08.590]  talking about how it's just thrown around so much,
[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:11.150]  ultra-right, that it doesn't even mean anything.
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:17.950]  Well, look what they did at that one student or school board meeting in Dearborn, Michigan,
[01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:21.150]  where the population's fully Arab and Muslim.
[01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:24.830]  And they labeled them a bunch of white supremacists.
[01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:30.429]  It's like, wait a minute, this is a primarily Arab community.
[01:38:30.429 --> 01:38:32.750]  And they're showing up because they found out the books that you're allowing their
[01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:34.030]  kids to have access to.
[01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:37.790]  And then sure enough, again, it's you're a bunch of white supremacists and everything else.
[01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:39.469]  So it doesn't make any sense.
[01:38:39.469 --> 01:38:40.750]  It doesn't mean anything anymore.
[01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:46.110]  The media has told us that you can be a white supremacist if you're Latina, Mexican.
[01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:51.230]  I mean, let's not forget, Larry Elder was running for governor in California
[01:38:51.230 --> 01:38:54.510]  and they called him the black face of white supremacy.
[01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.750]  Right.
[01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:56.349]  I mean, this is where we've gotten to.
[01:38:56.349 --> 01:38:58.910]  I mean, I got to believe that when it gets this ridiculous,
[01:38:58.910 --> 01:39:00.830]  this is the kind of thing that wakes people up.
[01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:05.150]  But there's still people that are just so hard nosed that they just follow along.
[01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:06.030]  So what's the secret?
[01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:09.150]  What do you think it took to wake you up?
[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:12.830]  How can we reach people that were like you, liberal, atheist, Democrat,
[01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:15.070]  and then suddenly your eyes have been opened?
[01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:17.469]  How do we reach people like where you were at?
[01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:21.630]  Repeat 2020 and have them live in L.A.
[01:39:21.630 --> 01:39:23.230]  I mean, you know, I'm just kidding.
[01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:27.309]  But, you know, I unfortunately, I do think people kind of have to suffer.
[01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:30.269]  Not that I had not suffered prior to 2020,
[01:39:30.269 --> 01:39:36.750]  but I could not turn my eyes away anymore to the fact that I was being harmed by Democrat policies.
[01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:41.549]  And every day since then, you know, L.A. had one of the longest indoor mask mandates.
[01:39:41.549 --> 01:39:42.750]  We had vaccine passports.
[01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:44.590]  So it wasn't just a blip on the radar.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:46.830]  And they held on to it for much longer than,
[01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.710]  you know, people on the other side of the aisle let it go.
[01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:52.670]  I do think humans are kind of built to where,
[01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:56.030]  unfortunately, you have to suffer before you pay attention
[01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:57.230]  because it's easy to close your eyes.
[01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:00.670]  It's easy to not know what's real news, what's fake news to just follow along.
[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:02.110]  People have families, jobs.
[01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:02.670]  I get it.
[01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:06.670]  But, you know, I do make my videos.
[01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:09.630]  And I do, I think it's important to still speak the truth.
[01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.030]  I don't know if I'm changing anyone's mind online,
[01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.190]  because I think that people who are so shut off,
[01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:17.309]  they're just going to keep scrolling, if not leave a hateful comment.
[01:40:18.269 --> 01:40:22.429]  But I think that the truth is not going to be preserved if we don't preserve it.
[01:40:22.429 --> 01:40:23.710]  It will always be the truth.
[01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:24.750]  But kids won't know it.
[01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:27.469]  Future generations won't know it if we don't keep speaking it.
[01:40:27.469 --> 01:40:29.230]  And now we have lost common sense.
[01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:32.030]  We've lost objective truth, objective reality.
[01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:36.830]  So I keep speaking it just in the hopes that people know they're not alone
[01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:40.750]  and people remain with their eyes focused on the truth.
[01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:43.870]  And I think there's always hope because really, I was pretty,
[01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:45.549]  I didn't know what was going on.
[01:40:45.549 --> 01:40:47.389]  I was not politically informed.
[01:40:47.389 --> 01:40:49.469]  I was not, you know, a zealot activist,
[01:40:49.469 --> 01:40:54.030]  but I was pretty far sold on the left and pretty far sold on a lot of these ideas,
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:56.670]  feminism, et cetera, pro-choice.
[01:40:56.670 --> 01:41:00.590]  And now I am a very big advocate in the opposite direction.
[01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:02.590]  So I think that there's always hope.
[01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:05.790]  Don't give up on your friends and family and neighbors.
[01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:08.030]  That's pretty remarkable that you not only changed,
[01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:11.230]  totally flipped politically,
[01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:14.750]  but that you flipped with your faith too,
[01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:18.510]  to go from not believing God at all to believing God.
[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:19.309]  That's pretty huge.
[01:41:19.309 --> 01:41:22.910]  Did that happen together or did one come first or how did that work?
[01:41:24.349 --> 01:41:28.349]  I think it was just the political change came first.
[01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:30.830]  And I, for the first time,
[01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:33.710]  once I walked away from the Democrat party,
[01:41:33.710 --> 01:41:37.950]  I was open to other voices that I didn't even know had existed before.
[01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:41.790]  People like Dennis Prager and Ben Shapiro come to mind,
[01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:45.150]  which may be as ironic because they're not Christians,
[01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:47.469]  but they speak of this, you know,
[01:41:47.469 --> 01:41:52.750]  they speak of God and they speak of the fallen modern day Western culture.
[01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:59.309]  And I was deeply unhappy and unfulfilled and unsatisfied,
[01:41:59.309 --> 01:42:03.389]  leaving everything with COVID aside and everything that was going on in 2020.
[01:42:03.389 --> 01:42:06.670]  The choices that I had made were very often in line with
[01:42:07.389 --> 01:42:12.670]  what the modern day Western society tells especially young women to make.
[01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.429]  And they had left me unhappy.
[01:42:14.429 --> 01:42:16.349]  And so I think the door was open to,
[01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:20.190]  well, I'm being burned by everything I thought was true,
[01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:21.790]  everything I thought was compassion.
[01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:25.870]  So now maybe there's other stuff I'm also wrong about.
[01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:28.349]  So kind of open your heart and mind.
[01:42:28.349 --> 01:42:30.750]  Yeah, open your heart and mind to everything it sounds like.
[01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:32.110]  Natalie, we got to hit a break,
[01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:35.309]  but I do want to keep you on to get some final thoughts from you.
[01:42:35.309 --> 01:42:37.710]  We also are going to want to get to Donna in Texas,
[01:42:37.710 --> 01:42:40.190]  who's been waiting a long time to share a prayer with us.
[01:42:40.190 --> 01:42:41.469]  So that seems appropriate.
[01:42:41.469 --> 01:42:42.830]  So stick around for that.
[01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:46.670]  And if you want to weigh in on any of the thoughts that we brought up today,
[01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:49.950]  the number is 1-877-789-2539.
[01:42:49.950 --> 01:42:52.110]  We're heading into our final segment.
[01:42:52.110 --> 01:42:54.269]  We'll be back with Natalie after this.
[01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:22.910]  Despite that, it's 60% off.
[01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:27.070]  Then, of course, we have super high-quality, high-spectrum, full-spectrum CBD oil.

[01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:42.110]  But if you want that, you can get that.
[01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:44.510]  It's going to sell out in like a week at current sales rates.

[01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:52.269]  I want to get way out of the hole and expand.
[01:43:52.269 --> 01:43:53.549]  But we only do that with your support.

[01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:10.830]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover,
[01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:12.030]  is because of you.
[01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:14.910]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:17.950]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfowarStore.com,

[01:44:56.349 --> 01:44:57.630]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:44:57.630 --> 01:44:58.670]  Please take action.
[01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:01.549]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son
[01:45:01.549 --> 01:45:03.630]  about his overseas business dealings?
[01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:06.190]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:07.710]  So let me get this straight.
[01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:11.070]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:12.750]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:15.790]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:18.190]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[01:45:18.190 --> 01:45:19.790]  that was investigating corruption,
[01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:21.549]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[01:45:21.549 --> 01:45:24.750]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:27.469]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:45:27.469 --> 01:45:30.110]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.110]  which the FBI also had,
[01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:34.349]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[01:45:34.349 --> 01:45:38.110]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:41.549]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents
[01:45:41.549 --> 01:45:44.269]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off
[01:45:44.269 --> 01:45:46.190]  for a similar charge in 2016,
[01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:48.910]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation
[01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:51.070]  into Donald Trump using falsified evidence
[01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:53.710]  provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:45:53.710 --> 01:45:55.070]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:04.269]  Two of our best-selling nootropics or brain boosters
[01:46:04.269 --> 01:46:06.830]  are now back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:07.870]  And for a limited time,
[01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:10.030]  they're 50% off when you get them together
[01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.870]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:14.590]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra,
[01:46:14.590 --> 01:46:16.190]  two separate formulas.
[01:46:16.190 --> 01:46:19.070]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:22.910]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy,
[01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:24.750]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:27.710]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula,
[01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:28.910]  that's BrainForce Ultra,
[01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:30.349]  that hits really, really quick.
[01:46:30.349 --> 01:46:30.830]  And I love it.
[01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:32.269]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:46:32.269 --> 01:46:33.389]  So if I've got to work at night,
[01:46:33.389 --> 01:46:34.510]  but don't want to stay up all night,
[01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:36.429]  I can take it and say nine o'clock at night,
[01:46:36.429 --> 01:46:37.630]  got to stay up till midnight working,
[01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:39.230]  doing a radio interview or something,
[01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:42.269]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:46:42.269 --> 01:46:44.349]  And then I get two, three hours of energy.
[01:46:44.349 --> 01:46:45.710]  And then you go right to bed after it.
[01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:47.549]  BrainForce Ultra, BrainForce Plus,
[01:46:47.549 --> 01:46:51.150]  both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[01:46:51.150 --> 01:46:52.429]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:46:52.429 --> 01:46:53.549]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:46:53.549 --> 01:46:55.389]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:46:55.389 --> 01:46:58.030]  50% off, infowarestore.com.
[01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:04.590]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:07.630]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:18.430]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:19.430]  This is Christy Lee.
[01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:27.030]  I'm here with John Scott, my husband, and the amazing Natalie Beisner, who is just really
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:31.269]  killing it on Instagram, particularly is where I see your work.
[01:47:31.269 --> 01:47:39.150]  And on that note, basically, what is your process for having these things that go viral
[01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:45.630]  about just basically thoughts on feminism and identity politics and such?
[01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:51.630]  Well, I never meant for anything to go viral, and I still don't totally know how that works.
[01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:58.230]  I think you just have a combination of some skill and some luck, good timing, but yeah,
[01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:02.470]  I try to speak to, one of the things I found when I left the left and walked away from
[01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:08.910]  the Democrat Party was how very little logic there is on that side and a lot of emotion
[01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:14.830]  and logic, truth, common sense, obviously God seems to be on not the side of the radical
[01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:15.830]  left.
[01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:21.990]  And so I try to break things down using logic, common sense, truth.
[01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:26.870]  I typically don't mention my faith because I think, unfortunately, that's easy for people
[01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:30.630]  to dismiss and say, well, I don't believe in that.
[01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:38.630]  But it's hard to dismiss science, common sense, truth, and that's harder to ignore.
[01:48:38.630 --> 01:48:43.870]  So that's what I try to do in 90 seconds because Instagram likes to have reels be 90 seconds.
[01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:49.550]  Yeah, I mean, that is the challenge, and so kudos to you for being able to spit those facts
[01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:53.630]  out so quickly and doing it in an entertaining, thought-provoking way.
[01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:56.790]  Well, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:48:56.790 --> 01:49:00.350]  Natalie Beisner, I'm definitely going to follow up with you, have you on my own show
[01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:07.750]  on AmpNews.us, hopefully soon, and just keep on doing what you're doing, folks.
[01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:11.670]  Check her out on Instagram if you can, and you can also find her on Twitter.
[01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.670]  Thank you so much.
[01:49:12.670 --> 01:49:13.670]  Thank you.
[01:49:13.670 --> 01:49:14.670]  You're welcome.
[01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:19.630]  All right, so we are going to go to Donna, who's been patiently waiting to share a prayer
[01:49:19.630 --> 01:49:22.430]  with us, I believe, right here in Texas.
[01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:24.550]  Donna, you're on the air.
[01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:31.070]  Hi, Christy and John, just first of all, congratulations, that's such exciting news.
[01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:32.070]  Thank you, Donna.
[01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:33.070]  Thank you.
[01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:34.070]  Yeah.
[01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:38.790]  Well, I actually mentioned the word prayer just because I wanted to call with some spiritual
[01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:46.110]  insight and just affirmation, but the thing that I see as a thread through your show,
[01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:55.110]  which is so beautiful, is awareness, compassion, action, whether it's Judge Jones, Natalie
[01:49:55.110 --> 01:50:00.870]  just came on, all of y'all, and what I wanted to share, and this is a prayer, I mean, obviously,
[01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:07.309]  our lives are a prayer, hopefully for the right things, but the compassion part, I wanted
[01:50:07.309 --> 01:50:08.430]  to raise awareness.
[01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:14.590]  I've called many times with Alex Jones, I've shared me as a recording artist, Donna Faulkner,
[01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:20.870]  I've shared my song, We Are One, with Owen a couple of months ago, and I've also shared
[01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:27.950]  insight with the audience on Alex's show to encourage people to give donations, to do charity,
[01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:35.630]  to do tzedakah, because I feel now more than ever, it's such a time for our community,
[01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:41.470]  our faith community specifically, but our community to be there for one another, to
[01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:48.870]  belong to one another, and I say that from a place of being in ministry for many, many
[01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:56.230]  years and ministering through music and also as a speaker, but also, Christi and John,
[01:50:56.230 --> 01:51:03.670]  going from the stages in ministering to shifting my ministry and not knowing virtually all
[01:51:03.670 --> 01:51:09.430]  these years now how to make it work, and I've gone houseless, and there is not, and this
[01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:17.190]  touches on what Judge Joe Brown said, as a single female or male that is not an illegal
[01:51:17.190 --> 01:51:25.030]  immigrant, not an ex-con, is not coming out of abuse, there's no help, and so I share
[01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:33.230]  that to say that here we are, we have a call to be there for our community, and I'm going
[01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:38.870]  to tell you, I'm calling because I'm going through a challenge, and I'm literally got
[01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:45.430]  to keep a roof over my head, so I myself have a give, send, go, and my name is Donna
[01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:46.430]  Faulkner.
[01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:51.470]  If people want to help, I mean, I'm doing my best, and my purpose is ministry, I encourage
[01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:57.190]  people constantly, but I'm physically suffering and physically fighting to save my physical
[01:51:57.190 --> 01:51:59.190]  health and my life.
[01:51:59.190 --> 01:52:02.390]  How do you spell your last name, Donna?
[01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:03.390]  Thank you.
[01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:11.670]  Donna Faulkner, F-A-U-L-K-N-E-R, Donna Faulkner, and people can see my music, We Are One, on
[01:52:11.670 --> 01:52:16.710]  YouTube, but they can go to give, send, go, and it's like there's nowhere else to go.
[01:52:16.710 --> 01:52:17.710]  Yeah.
[01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:24.630]  So I just encourage people to give to InfoWars because it encourages God, and give to the
[01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:29.350]  people in our faith, especially our community that needs help.
[01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:34.150]  Yeah, and then, like I said, I mean, all I saw was the word prayer when I saw that you
[01:52:34.150 --> 01:52:39.070]  were waiting in the line, so let that be the word to share with everyone.
[01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:40.070]  Let's pray earnestly.
[01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:41.990]  That was the verse of the day that I shared.
[01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:43.550]  Let's pray earnestly for each other.
[01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:45.970]  Pray earnestly for Donna Faulkner.
[01:52:45.970 --> 01:52:49.990]  You can find her on give, send, go, and you can find her music, We Are One, on YouTube.
[01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:53.710]  Thank you so much, Donna, and we're going to take another phone call, but go ahead,
[01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:54.710]  John.
[01:52:54.710 --> 01:53:02.910]  I was going to say, you know, it kind of touched what Donna was saying because if you look
[01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:07.950]  at with inflation, with the prices of everything, trying to go grocery shopping, I mean, me
[01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:10.670]  and you, honey, we're a two-income home.
[01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:15.110]  You know, between that, paying off old debts, things of that nature, I mean, how much do
[01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:17.190]  we rock after it?
[01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:18.190]  Still a struggle.
[01:53:18.190 --> 01:53:19.190]  You know what I mean?
[01:53:19.190 --> 01:53:20.190]  Yeah.
[01:53:20.190 --> 01:53:24.030]  I think people just make assumptions that everybody's great these days, just, you know, if you're
[01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:29.150]  not poor, well, and the middle class is being destroyed.
[01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:33.590]  It's making it to where things are week by week, week by week moves.
[01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:36.790]  There is no really long-term thought because there is no long-term at the moment for a
[01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:37.790]  lot of people.
[01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:38.790]  Yeah.
[01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:40.110]  So that makes me think.
[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:41.430]  I appreciate you calling, Donna.
[01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:42.430]  Yeah.
[01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:43.430]  Thank you, Donna.
[01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:45.150]  Let's go to Jim in Virginia.
[01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:46.150]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:47.150]  Hey, folks.
[01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:48.150]  How you doing?
[01:53:48.150 --> 01:53:49.150]  Good.
[01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:50.150]  How are you?
[01:53:50.150 --> 01:53:51.150]  Great.
[01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:52.150]  Great guests.
[01:53:52.150 --> 01:53:53.150]  Great.
[01:53:53.269 --> 01:53:54.269]  I'm glad the conversation works out there.
[01:53:54.269 --> 01:53:55.269]  Tough acts to follow here.
[01:53:55.269 --> 01:53:56.269]  Guys, I've been married to the same lady for 29 years.
[01:53:56.269 --> 01:53:57.269]  Congrats.
[01:53:57.269 --> 01:53:58.269]  Two kids, live in the American dream, married a Southern Democrat.
[01:53:58.269 --> 01:53:59.269]  And over this time, I've turned her about 80 percent to the right.
[01:53:59.269 --> 01:54:00.269]  But I can't get her on board with some of the preps that go along.
[01:54:00.269 --> 01:54:01.269]  The final dot in the I and cross the T. What can I say to her?
[01:54:01.269 --> 01:54:02.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:02.269 --> 01:54:03.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:04.269 --> 01:54:05.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:05.269 --> 01:54:06.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:06.269 --> 01:54:07.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:07.269 --> 01:54:08.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:08.269 --> 01:54:09.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:09.269 --> 01:54:10.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:10.269 --> 01:54:11.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:11.269 --> 01:54:12.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:12.269 --> 01:54:13.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:13.269 --> 01:54:14.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:14.269 --> 01:54:15.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:15.269 --> 01:54:16.269]  I don't know.
[01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:23.450]  the final dot in the I and cross the T. What can I say to her?
[01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:25.110]  What can I show her?
[01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:31.809]  She goes along with me, but she doesn't act as a couple.
[01:54:31.809 --> 01:54:33.910]  What would you guys say for me to do to her?
[01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:40.930]  We'll remind her you've been married 29 years, Jim, and we just celebrated her two-year anniversary,
[01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:43.890]  so that's a heck of a tall order to ask us for advice.
[01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:49.250]  Everything that I've ever read or heard is that you can't control, you cannot control
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.930]  the other person.
[01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:54.330]  And you can get frustrated, but at the end of the day you can't control.
[01:54:54.330 --> 01:54:58.010]  All you can do is pray, pray for the other person.
[01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:03.210]  I have a book that I read off and on, Power of a Praying Wife, and I do believe it.
[01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:06.130]  I just don't always, I'm not always consistent in reading it.
[01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:11.050]  But basically it's a devotional of praying for different things for my husband and being
[01:55:11.050 --> 01:55:13.250]  very specific and intentional about it.
[01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:18.170]  So if you scribe to that, pray intentionally for your wife and just continue to lead by
[01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:21.570]  example, lead by example and lead with love.
[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:22.570]  Do you have any thoughts?
[01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:26.970]  No, I think sometimes it comes, you know, it's almost like keep it simple.
[01:55:26.970 --> 01:55:32.730]  I mean sometimes it comes back to for me and you of what, what is it, what are the big
[01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:34.130]  priorities in our lives?
[01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:37.550]  Family, you know, that we share how important family is.
[01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:41.250]  We share how important God is in our lives and trying to walk that path.
[01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:44.730]  We even share with each other when we think, hey, we need to get more on the path.
[01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:48.970]  We've been slacking, you know.
[01:55:48.970 --> 01:55:52.330]  One of the hardest things I think to do, just like it is being human and staring at yourself
[01:55:52.330 --> 01:55:55.970]  in the mirror, sometimes it's hard to do that as a couple.
[01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:58.610]  You know, I think a lot of people struggle with that.
[01:55:58.610 --> 01:56:05.809]  Just of being able to be open and say, hey, this is how I feel and this is, how can I kind
[01:56:05.809 --> 01:56:06.809]  of open?
[01:56:06.809 --> 01:56:08.450]  Yeah, I mean, well, communication, right?
[01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:12.370]  How can I get you open to these thoughts and ideas or why don't you think these things?
[01:56:12.370 --> 01:56:13.370]  Hopefully that was helpful, Jim.
[01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:16.570]  I'm going to try and sneak in one more phone call before we say goodbye.
[01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:18.730]  Let's at least one more phone call.
[01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:21.330]  Let's talk to Todd in Ohio.
[01:56:21.330 --> 01:56:24.970]  That's where, where I met my husband is in Ohio.
[01:56:24.970 --> 01:56:25.970]  So go ahead, Todd.
[01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:28.130]  Sounds like you have a patriotic thing to share.
[01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:33.889]  Yes, I have, I have a little thing to say first and I want to mention about the national
[01:56:33.889 --> 01:56:34.889]  anthem.
[01:56:34.889 --> 01:56:35.889]  All right.
[01:56:35.889 --> 01:56:36.889]  We got about a minute just so you know.
[01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:37.889]  Go ahead.
[01:56:38.330 --> 01:56:39.330]  All right.
[01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:43.570]  The person, I attend a group where we'd have classes and we used to have a fine singer
[01:56:43.570 --> 01:56:47.250]  who wasn't able to come anymore to sing the national anthem.
[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:51.410]  And so I, I'm not comfortable getting up in front of people, but I figured it was important
[01:56:51.410 --> 01:56:56.610]  enough that I shoved myself out there and now I go up there and take the mic and enable
[01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:59.530]  our group to sing the national anthem again.
[01:56:59.530 --> 01:57:06.010]  And I want everybody to cherish each time they get to sing it because it's not assured
[01:57:06.010 --> 01:57:09.490]  that we'll be able to do it one day to the next.
[01:57:09.490 --> 01:57:14.210]  We just have to keep standing up and make the effort and do whatever we can to stand
[01:57:14.210 --> 01:57:19.770]  up for what the decent people of the world believe in.
[01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:20.770]  Yeah.
[01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:23.530]  They want us to forget our roots and let's not allow them.
[01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:24.530]  Thank you, Todd.
[01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:25.530]  Thanks, Todd.
[01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:28.930]  And thank you guys for joining me and my husband today.
[01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:31.730]  We hope that you have an amazing July 4th holiday.
[01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:32.930]  Any final words?
[01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:34.290]  No, that's it.
[01:57:34.290 --> 01:57:36.130]  Thank you for tuning in for our date night.
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:37.130]  Yeah.
[01:57:37.130 --> 01:57:38.130]  For our date night here on InfoWars.
[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:39.130]  Now I'm awake.
[01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:40.130]  Hopefully we can.
[01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:42.130]  He is drinking Wake Up America coffee.
[01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:43.130]  Yes.
[01:57:43.130 --> 01:57:44.130]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:45.130]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:46.130]  Get your coffee.
[01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:47.130]  Get your supplements.
[01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:48.130]  Thank you for joining us tonight.
[01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:49.130]  Wake up to the tyranny and fight.
[01:57:49.130 --> 01:57:51.889]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:57:51.889 --> 01:57:55.410]  And so please go to InfoWarsStore and just make a donation.
[01:57:55.410 --> 01:58:00.490]  And you can make a one-time or recurring, you have a little profile there, cancel anytime.

[01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:19.330]  on the products.
[01:58:19.330 --> 01:58:20.330]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:22.570]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[01:58:22.570 --> 01:58:25.150]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:27.290]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:28.610]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:32.570]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know
[01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:33.570]  it's hard.
[01:58:33.570 --> 01:58:34.570]  I know times are tough.
[01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:38.290]  So thank you for your support, but whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the
[01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:39.889]  articles and the videos.
[01:58:39.889 --> 01:58:40.889]  That you can do for free.
[01:58:40.889 --> 01:58:43.290]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:46.530]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:47.850]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

[01:58:52.770 --> 01:58:54.530]  of mouth and prayer.
[01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:57.930]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[01:58:57.930 --> 01:59:02.050]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:04.330]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
