[00:00.000 --> 00:11.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.360 --> 00:18.920]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.920 --> 00:31.640]  Texas Alex Jones man there is a lot of news unbelievable amounts of it and as
[00:31.640 --> 00:37.960]  usual I'll try to babble through most of it David Knight and Joe Biggs are in
[00:37.960 --> 00:45.320]  Virginia right now and we are gonna have a live report from them on the ground
[00:45.320 --> 00:52.800]  remember back in February we reported on the giant fake city built in the
[00:52.800 --> 00:59.440]  Wooded Hills of Virginia where they are basically training to occupy US cities
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.080]  well we have put in scores of phone calls and emails and requests to be given
[01:04.080 --> 01:13.400]  an interview and to be able to look at the base and go in and get a basic
[01:13.400 --> 01:17.880]  citizen inspection of it it's got models of what look like Baptist churches you
[01:17.880 --> 01:22.760]  name it the street signs are marked for the US marked DC subway and we know
[01:22.760 --> 01:26.160]  it's all part of the giant urban warfare training program and overall psi
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.200]  opt to condition the public but they have not responded to us and have ignored
[01:31.200 --> 01:35.880]  us and refused our request haven't even talked to us you know because we have
[01:35.880 --> 01:39.160]  millions of listeners and millions of viewers and 400 million views on one
[01:39.160 --> 01:46.280]  YouTube channel we don't exist we're just US citizens and well they're training
[01:46.280 --> 01:52.240]  the US military and therefore treason the Army times stars and stripes all push
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.040]  the idea of brigade homeland and troops on the streets something that was
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.000]  denied for 15 plus years when I was exposing it but the last five or six
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.600]  years has been admitted so we're gonna go to a live report with them outside the
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.120]  base coming up in the next segment and then they're going to try to go on the
[02:10.120 --> 02:15.760]  base and talk to the colonel who we've been in contact with and who will not
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.760]  give us a response about our request for an interview to be able to find out
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.960]  exactly what's going on now it's a military base inside of a military base
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.400]  and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs is now a full-time Info Wars reporter and moved
[02:31.400 --> 02:35.520]  down here from North Carolina he's a famous soldier they had a big ask our
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.640]  article about him three or four years ago when he was in Afghanistan and Iraq
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.600]  and they had embedded reporters Michael Hastings inside some of the heaviest
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.480]  battles that they've seen in recent times in those areas especially Afghanistan
[02:49.480 --> 02:53.120]  and then of course he helped expose the clear evidence that looks like Hastings
[02:53.120 --> 02:59.320]  was murdered so as kind of reporter we want he's down there as well to
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.280]  communicate in the Army parlance they're at the training center where they
[03:03.280 --> 03:08.200]  admit they're merging the FBI the local police everyone into this giant FEMA
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.280]  center and they a lot of times double these training centers as emergency
[03:12.280 --> 03:17.240]  relocation centers and from what Biggs is seen it does look like it's set up to
[03:17.240 --> 03:21.800]  be basically a giant FEMA camp it's got the sports stadiums the whole nine
[03:21.800 --> 03:28.000]  yards and it is to train the troops to basically storm and occupy and hold US
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.600]  cities take control of communications you name it and you're seeing army dot
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.320]  mill footage that they shot they haven't let any other media on the base they did
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.160]  talk to one reporter and allow him to do an interview that reporter was scared to
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.520]  talk to us in person but would talk said he would talk to David Knight over the
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.120]  phone so that that interview I'm told was to be conducted about an hour ago I
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.640]  haven't talked to our reporters yet we're connecting them right now so we'll
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.440]  spend some time on that live as this unfolds coming up in the next segment
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.000]  with our live audio video feeds the headline if you want to refresh
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  yourself the original article from February is US Army builds fake city in
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Virginia to practice military occupation of the US martial law training 300 acre
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.400]  town includes sports stadium school churches underground subway you name it
[04:16.400 --> 04:21.480]  so I said we send reporters out there and after I don't know four months of
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.080]  stonewalling or I guess about three four months of stonewalling we have sent
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.840]  our reporters to Virginia and so we're going to be talking to them now
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.280]  obviously the big news and I meant to cover the sheshdam glad dredgerport.com

[08:56.400 --> 09:03.000]  live to outside Bowling Green Virginia at a U.S. Army base that within it has a
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.280]  training camp with mock churches public schools and a DC subway the military
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.520]  admittedly has been training to take on the Tea Party and American gun owners
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.960]  that's even in foreign affairs publication that's in the Washington
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.200]  post Forbes the Washington Times we broke all that information but now it's
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.880]  confirmed and the reason the military is waking up right now is that they're
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.520]  being trained to carry this out now certainly this base has dual usage and
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.600]  but the military has been so trained that reporters are bad that we're going to
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.560]  see what happens when our reporters who are a few minutes outside the base or
[09:44.560 --> 09:49.160]  give you the name of the base and all the details try to go in and talk to the
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.800]  public information officer and the Colonel who we've been talking to for
[09:52.800 --> 09:57.000]  three plus months since February who refused to answer any questions or give
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.240]  us an interview we've been stonewalled so we've sent our reporters there the
[10:01.240 --> 10:06.720]  headline U.S. Army builds fake city to shoot at during training that's the
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.720]  London Telegraph we gave a deep analysis of it U.S. Army builds fake city in
[10:10.720 --> 10:17.080]  Virginia to practice military occupation of America so that is coming up in a

[11:09.920 --> 11:15.920]  felons and criminals in just one release this week and now people are
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.160]  telling like it is Congressman Lamar Smith of South Texas has come out and

[11:26.960 --> 11:30.960]  sanctioned prison break that's the headline Lamar Smith calls ice release
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.280]  of 36,000 criminal immigrants a presidential least sanctioned prison

[17:09.840 --> 17:13.800]  they're there training openly to take on the American people we have to draw
[17:13.800 --> 17:17.200]  attention to this they want to hide it in plain view a giant threat fusion
[17:17.200 --> 17:20.960]  center with the FBI the local police they're building these all over this is
[17:20.960 --> 17:24.600]  a federal takeover command base in my view probably a FEMA camp will get
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.760]  Biggs's take on the fences within the fences the concertino wire but gentlemen
[17:28.760 --> 17:34.000]  tell folks what's going on well Alex we're right here at the base we stopped
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.640]  at the guard shack the to have a an entry point within the Fort AP Hill there's a
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.280]  separate area here for the asymmetric warfare group we stopped there and we
[17:44.280 --> 17:48.400]  showed them the request that we had sent multiple times to talk to the lady who
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.760]  shot the video they have now let us they're gonna let us drive through the
[17:52.760 --> 17:57.120]  area so if you want us to take a video we can show you what we're seeing right
[17:57.120 --> 18:00.400]  now as we're driving oh good so they did the smart thing and let you now do an
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.680]  inspection instead of doing what the army did last time claiming we wanted to
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.120]  blow the base up last lady I was like since I'm a retired army I should have
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.680]  access all this stuff and she after I gave her my ID and all that she just
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.200]  kind of they opened the gates and said we could go through so we're okay good
[18:17.200 --> 18:21.080]  good good well before they throw you out then I want you to get HD shots of the
[18:21.080 --> 18:26.720]  church the US signs the subway stuff and then go find that colonel or whoever
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.600]  their public information person is and see if you can get a tour of them okay
[18:31.600 --> 18:34.840]  well we're going through right now they're letting us go in take a look at
[18:34.840 --> 18:40.000]  the place and it's not looking like it's very well focused here on the camera of
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.480]  it that's right if you just touch the screen it'll love focus for you or we
[18:45.480 --> 18:51.920]  can reconnect it it's fine but again we've got the crew it's focusing on the
[18:51.920 --> 18:55.240]  windshield you guys can just get out and get some shots and the main thing is get
[18:55.240 --> 18:58.720]  HD of this because I want to do an inspection of that base and that's good
[18:58.720 --> 19:01.440]  I know you guys are already there talking to the reporter that did the
[19:01.440 --> 19:05.240]  original report so I'm sure you already called them and that's a good thing I'm
[19:05.240 --> 19:08.280]  glad they didn't freak out like they usually do but like I said the military
[19:08.280 --> 19:12.600]  is waking up but we'll see what happens we'll see you in a minute the police
[19:12.600 --> 19:16.360]  cars arrive or you know folks try to grab your cameras like they did at the
[19:16.360 --> 19:22.720]  NSA when I sent Anthony Gutiarty and Josh Owens up there but continue to give
[19:22.720 --> 19:27.160]  us your take on this base let's get Biggs's take on the base when you guys
[19:27.160 --> 19:32.760]  scouted it out from the outside yesterday like I said we're gonna skip this
[19:32.760 --> 19:40.640]  network break the weird thing is you know I've been in a lot of army bases
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.920]  and how they have a fence set up with Constantine or wire around a piece of
[19:45.920 --> 19:51.160]  property within the base the only place I've ever seen
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.640]  we're getting some sky break up let's reconnect with them that's a directive
[19:55.640 --> 20:00.480]  reconnect with the sky and then we will try to do a u-stream see if that gets a
[20:00.480 --> 20:07.440]  better pickup but just main thing is I want HD shot of it and I want to go again
[20:07.440 --> 20:13.040]  get get footage of the churches and the sports stadiums and you know all the
[20:13.040 --> 20:16.480]  rest of it inside of there where they're training for this but this is good and
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.400]  then he was gonna he already told me it looks like a FEMA camp how they have a
[20:19.400 --> 20:23.600]  base and then Constantine or wire around the internal Trinidad acre training
[20:23.600 --> 20:29.080]  facility so again this is basically a FEMA training center hiding in plain
[20:29.080 --> 20:33.840]  view we know that the military trains with the FBI and local police at that
[20:33.840 --> 20:37.600]  facility and the issue is yes the police to get military training but the
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.440]  but the problem is they're integrating the forces together under secret DOD
[20:42.440 --> 20:47.440]  directives that we were able to get and leak back in 1998 which have been
[20:47.440 --> 20:53.960]  subsequently been declassified under the assistance program as the army calls it
[20:53.960 --> 20:58.680]  marines Alex this looks really good okay we do have high def now good job
[20:58.680 --> 21:02.920]  guys please continue all right yeah this is the first time I'd ever been inside an
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.640]  army base or they actually have a fence around a piece of property within the
[21:06.640 --> 21:10.520]  base the only time I've ever seen that at is at the Delta Force compound right
[21:10.520 --> 21:13.640]  now we're passing a train station that they have built up and as you can see
[21:13.640 --> 21:17.680]  it's pretty pretty detailed and realistic looking we're gonna start making our way
[21:17.680 --> 21:23.080]  around towards the the embassy center and the apartment complex they have in
[21:23.080 --> 21:28.640]  here now repeat what you told me this morning about what you saw from the
[21:28.640 --> 21:33.600]  outside I mean why would they want to have a base inside the Constantino
[21:33.600 --> 21:37.960]  wire around it well it's weird they don't mind just seeing in but it looks
[21:37.960 --> 21:44.040]  like once you get in they don't want you to get out yeah this is very interesting
[21:44.040 --> 21:48.320]  again only the army has released footage of this so far and now you're inside of
[21:48.320 --> 21:51.480]  it why wouldn't the rest of media want to know what's being trained for in here
[21:51.480 --> 21:55.640]  well from what the reporter we talked to today he said that no one's been here
[21:55.640 --> 21:59.320]  since this has been built since that original opening so it looks like we're
[21:59.320 --> 22:03.400]  gonna be the first people to come through here yeah we asked him if he had been
[22:03.400 --> 22:06.240]  back or anybody else has gone back because we were concerned about the
[22:06.240 --> 22:10.240]  connections that he mentioned between the FBI and law enforcement when we spoke
[22:10.240 --> 22:18.000]  to him he said that DEA also has been hang on we're gonna get here's a fire
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.080]  station over here you can see and he said there was an embassy building that
[22:22.080 --> 22:29.800]  might be I don't know maybe this is the embassy building here and there you go
[22:29.800 --> 22:34.600]  BB&T 24 hours I guess they've got branches and a rock as well I don't
[22:34.600 --> 22:39.240]  know building with actual chairs and all that stuff you can see well sure I
[22:39.240 --> 22:43.280]  mean obviously this all has dual use as well it's admitted the military's
[22:43.280 --> 22:47.520]  training to take on the American people we can put up the headline you know army
[22:47.520 --> 22:51.840]  trains for tea party insurrection Forbes magazine yeah let's go inspect that
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.000]  church I want you guys to get out at the church please US Army trains to take on
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.280]  the tea party and then again you can actually click similar headline the
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.320]  Forbes covering that so folks can see Forbes for themselves again this is a
[23:07.320 --> 23:10.120]  big deal when we have the biggest military in the world half the military
[23:10.120 --> 23:13.320]  expenditure in the world of all the other countries and more and more it's
[23:13.320 --> 23:18.320]  being focused on us and the media and the sitcoms and the dramas are predictive
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.120]  programming that the war is going to be with gun owners how the US military
[23:22.120 --> 23:27.000]  would crush a tea party rebellion Forbes I mean this is going on and again I've
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.200]  been obsessed with this ever since I learned about it under Bill Clinton he
[23:30.200 --> 23:33.160]  was training him for gun confiscation it's been a slow attempt to change the
[23:33.160 --> 23:38.720]  culture of the military and I think it's backfired you're walking up to the
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.360]  church but I want to get big take on that big do you think this is why the
[23:42.360 --> 23:45.680]  military is waking up or do you agree that a lot of the enlisted people in
[23:45.680 --> 23:50.680]  non-commissioned are aware of the police state I think some of them are
[23:50.680 --> 23:54.480]  starting to but I think this right here is going to be a like stained glass I
[23:54.480 --> 24:03.680]  just it went away now you guys are doing great I keep going bags the door is
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.840]  locked and we can't see through the window the door is locked in the window
[24:05.840 --> 24:09.440]  pains there you can't see the stained glasses you can't see through but I mean
[24:09.440 --> 24:12.160]  I think after this video today it's gonna wake up a lot of people in the
[24:12.160 --> 24:15.600]  military like you know why are we doing this I mean to see this kind of
[24:15.600 --> 24:19.680]  detail that we're out here right now and look those are crosses that's got a
[24:19.680 --> 24:25.920]  steeple and crosses on the windows that is a Christian church yes I've never
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.880]  seen a first Baptist in Syria Alex or Iraq or Afghanistan so what they're
[24:30.880 --> 24:37.640]  training for I don't know all right now Joe Biggs is again reporting from the
[24:37.640 --> 24:41.920]  military base there in Virginia what is your gut tell you this base is really
[24:41.920 --> 24:48.400]  forming we have a good idea and we had requests that never responded to us what
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.320]  is your gut tell you and your training in your experience well I mean they're
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.260]  definitely up to no good I mean my gut doesn't feel anything I mean I had
[24:55.260 --> 24:58.000]  goosebumps coming in here yesterday when we first came out here and approached
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.080]  it and looked around I mean when you try to as a civilian if you were to come on
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.120]  base from the outside road you can't really see and you can only see kind of
[25:05.120 --> 25:10.240]  the top of maybe a building or so but once you get down here I mean if I was
[25:10.240 --> 25:12.840]  actually still in the army and they brought me out here to train I mean I
[25:12.840 --> 25:15.200]  would be scared for what it is they're trying to do I mean what are they trying
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.480]  to get us ready for hopefully enough soldiers are awake and know that a
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.360]  really nothing can good come from this I mean I just I have goosebumps right now
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.200]  I'm well they're having all these giant urban warfare training drills in major
[25:28.200 --> 25:35.400]  cities and they admit it's a psi-op to acclimate the general public for war but
[25:35.400 --> 25:38.760]  but again it'd be one thing if we had a collapse or a meteorite or a bunch of
[25:38.760 --> 25:42.560]  reactors blow up we'd need the military on the streets but no the globalist
[25:42.560 --> 25:46.400]  are engineering a societal collapse pushing race war and all these other
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.960]  vulcanization tactics to then bring in the military as the savior and set the
[25:51.960 --> 25:55.720]  precedent what do you think about that analysis yeah I agree with you there Alex
[25:55.720 --> 26:02.160]  completely 110% let's get right to the traffic light over there that's
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.400]  incredible we need to find the entrance into the subway area there's a mosque
[26:05.400 --> 26:09.240]  over there as well well heard there's an underground part under this moss that
[26:09.240 --> 26:14.040]  has interconnecting tunnels between all the buildings what I found out so they
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.560]  said that supposed to be the part that makes a little bit more realistic how
[26:17.560 --> 26:20.880]  the Taliban burrow tunnels underground to go from building to building and
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.200]  that's how they are able to evade the the military in Iraq they did a lot of
[26:25.200 --> 26:28.000]  stuff like that they would burrow tunnels from building to building but
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.280]  when I'm up here I don't feel like I'm in Iraq or Afghanistan I feel like I'm
[26:31.280 --> 26:38.120]  in you know DC or something like that and I just we talked to earlier but the
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.080]  reporter we talked to earlier Alex was saying that the they didn't let them out
[26:42.080 --> 26:46.600]  when they took the tour here they only let them out in the subway area and the
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.120]  subway area he said was very detailed he said everything was in there so well
[26:51.120 --> 26:56.200]  we saw it it's model ever DC they admit that that's right I've watched a lot of
[26:56.200 --> 27:00.840]  videos from the asymmetric warfare group from 2006 and what they're saying is
[27:00.840 --> 27:06.360]  that they're concerned about not Muslims but about people who have political and
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.680]  economic grievances that's why they're focused on the Tea Party they say that
[27:09.680 --> 27:12.800]  in these countries that they've gone to it isn't the religious extremists he said
[27:12.800 --> 27:17.720]  they use the the religion as a framework as a foundation for what they want to do
[27:17.720 --> 27:21.240]  but it's people who feel like they no longer have any self-determination feel
[27:21.240 --> 27:23.920]  like they're being dominated whose freedoms are being taken away whose
[27:23.920 --> 27:27.160]  dignity is being taken away that's what they're saying that they're concerned
[27:27.160 --> 27:31.400]  about so that's why they're conflating the Tea Party with terrorists here in
[27:31.400 --> 27:35.560]  America that's why they have them in the scenarios is because they're focused on
[27:35.560 --> 27:38.880]  people that they're removing their dignity removing their freedom taking
[27:38.880 --> 27:42.040]  their resources as they've done in other countries that's what they're planning
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.480]  to do here but they're kind of doing it in a different order they're setting up
[27:45.480 --> 27:49.200]  gradually these kind of control points over transportation like you see at the
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.480]  airports and they're rolling this tyranny out in slow motion instead of
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.600]  coming in destroying the country first they're putting in all the control grid
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.160]  first and again mainstream publications admit this it's not even being hidden
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.040]  anymore because they have to mainline it before they actually try to roll it out
[28:04.040 --> 28:10.280]  during an economic collapse a new world war a SARS outbreak 22 people been sent
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.000]  home interfering they may have SARS two more hospital workers in the US have
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.880]  gotten SARS I mean there are real reasons to need the military to be ready to
[28:19.880 --> 28:24.920]  stabilize the country the problem is their training to take on the Tea Party
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.160]  and gun owners and you can see the scripting that we're going to stage
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.240]  terror attacks and so we are now the new terrorist and Al Qaeda is our new
[28:32.240 --> 28:37.160]  friend this is asinine yeah and one of the videos that I saw from a conference
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.760]  again I mentioned back in 2006 they put up on their own website a Marine Colonel
[28:41.760 --> 28:45.280]  who's retired said that the true believers whether they're Muslims
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.200]  Christians or even Marines are the ones who have to be eliminated you can't deal
[28:50.200 --> 28:53.520]  with them that's another reason why they're coming after Christians they
[28:53.520 --> 28:57.160]  don't want people who have a strong foundation who know what they believe
[28:57.160 --> 29:02.200]  people who are awake who are aware who are seeing things that are going on they
[29:02.200 --> 29:07.040]  want jellyfish that can be given a new world view every five minutes and what
[29:07.040 --> 29:10.080]  was the big Pentagon report came out just a few months ago it said they're
[29:10.080 --> 29:15.960]  worried about highly motivated individuals and dynamic individuals who
[29:15.960 --> 29:20.800]  just self-determined that they're afraid of freedom and humanity they're afraid
[29:20.800 --> 29:26.440]  of normal the competition yes that's what they were saying they said it they
[29:26.440 --> 29:31.160]  did a study of a survey of a billion Muslims and the ones that they found
[29:31.160 --> 29:36.800]  were potentially radical tell us stay there David your your audio is cut now
[29:36.800 --> 29:39.920]  we're gonna come right back to David Knight and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[29:39.920 --> 29:44.760]  they're at the military base of the big training camp looks like it operates as
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.640]  a FEMA center as well and I saw those underground subways they look like
[29:48.640 --> 29:51.560]  they're connected to something real we're on the March there's something else going

[33:31.000 --> 33:34.280]  analogy to get through to you because that's your main programming template
[33:34.280 --> 33:38.280]  in North America they're on record with that that was all Pentagon directed
[33:38.280 --> 33:42.960]  you understand you work for Cobra you dress like Cobra you have the tactics
[33:42.960 --> 33:49.280]  of Cobra you are Cobra you Cobra you want to be little boys or do you want to
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.200]  really join the Republic they know what's going on the Bundy ranch and they
[33:53.200 --> 33:56.520]  won't even let police information officer give us any information that's a
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.800]  bunch of bulls*** told these stupid GI Joe movies and stuff where the White
[34:00.800 --> 34:05.120]  House is attacked the White House is run by Cobra when I went through the
[34:05.120 --> 34:08.560]  process of becoming press secretary one of the things one of the first things
[34:08.560 --> 34:12.440]  they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program you're
[34:12.440 --> 34:19.280]  not even to discuss that it exists it's run by chaos it's run by specter special
[34:19.280 --> 34:24.680]  executive for counterintelligence terrorism revenge extortion they run
[34:24.680 --> 34:28.240]  little kids they run the snuff films they run the drugs they run it all and
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.280]  because you have like a bunch of naive jumps this whole thing's gonna come down
[34:32.280 --> 34:36.200]  on us very much concerns me considering that they have all this bulk
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.400]  ammunition that they're shooting targets of children would you like to tell me
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.800]  who it is that is doing that it is the Department of Homeland Security sir
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.520]  thank you for calling every police officer in this country to every FBI
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.400]  agent every Secret Service agent you work for specter you work for chaos you
[34:54.400 --> 35:03.360]  work for Cobra how do they get power they stage a terror attack using specter
[35:03.360 --> 35:08.240]  using Cobra who is Cobra arms dealing drug dealing money laundering group
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.520]  wearing masks they wear masks ladies and gentlemen because they're the corporate
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.200]  CEOs and they're manipulating the governments against each other Cobra
[35:17.200 --> 35:23.360]  runs the Muslims Cobra runs the CIA Cobra runs it all Cobra is real you can
[35:23.360 --> 35:29.360]  call it whatever you want Cobra is in control of America and Cobra says the
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.000]  veterans and the gun owners they're saying that we're the bad guys
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  who hurt themselves out are nothing more than domestic parents that's what Cobra
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.760]  would say that's what specter would say that's what Goldfinger would say
[35:49.760 --> 36:12.120]  because that's who those people are resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[36:12.120 --> 36:19.480]  God it's Alex Jones well I got to tell you amazing job putting that together
[36:19.480 --> 36:25.720]  by jacari Jackson he's not just in force nightly news anchor he also is a great
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.040]  video editor pointing out that our governments were taken over by shadow
[36:29.040 --> 36:34.000]  criminal operations that are now fully abolishing the old republic and it's
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.320]  just a fact now again recap the military base where you're located what's
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.720]  happening the staff sergeant Joe Biggs and David Knight both info wars nightly
[36:42.720 --> 36:49.440]  news reporters gentlemen break down what you've now been witnessing there at the
[36:49.440 --> 36:53.960]  base with the churches they have a mosque as well they're they're training
[36:53.960 --> 36:57.520]  with the FBI the police were the first independent journalists to be inside
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.920]  this base David Knight recap where you are coming up Alex we want to get inside
[37:01.920 --> 37:08.160]  the mosque here right now we are in the mosque we opened up the the area here as
[37:08.160 --> 37:11.800]  you can see on the on the sketch on the courtyard here this courtyard out here
[37:11.800 --> 37:15.040]  in front of the mosque and the door is actually open so we want to walk into
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.000]  this and see what it looks like inside the mosque I've never been in a mosque
[37:19.000 --> 37:26.240]  before but well let's see it's just a concrete you know that place looks more
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.400]  like an interrogation center and and a stockade the way in the wall is built
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.720]  little sales that looks more like a prison to me when you were outside keep
[37:35.720 --> 37:41.640]  but keep going in I think we lost our feed by I'm going in the building yeah
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.400]  get them reconnected tell them shoot high-def inside then I wanted to go back
[37:45.400 --> 37:49.240]  those look like jail cells across the way let's see if there's locks on those
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.760]  doors that that look like their prison grade I'm telling you folks this place
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.120]  looks like a FEMA camp masquerading as a trading center because the globalists
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.520]  love to have multi-functions and then you've got the underground railway system
[38:04.520 --> 38:10.320]  that we saw that looked like it was full-blown not mock that's what we need
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.120]  to get into the subterranean areas believe they're inside there right now
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.720]  hey guys I'm telling you I think this place is doubling as a prison what do
[38:18.720 --> 38:23.400]  you see directly in front of you at 12 o'clock well what I see here is this is
[38:23.400 --> 38:27.240]  a courtyard and it's just cinder block it's not finished but they've got a lot
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.960]  of compartments around that on that that's typical for a mosque or whatever
[38:30.960 --> 38:34.160]  we just went inside the front door turn around here Joe and get a picture of
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.840]  the front door we just went inside the front door there and there was more
[38:37.840 --> 38:44.280]  cinder blocks but there was an area on the inside that had a rounded recessed
[38:44.280 --> 38:49.760]  area alcove that looked like it would be modeled after a mosque so it looked like
[38:49.760 --> 38:55.080]  it was a mosque there we didn't see we didn't look too closely inside there
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.880]  because we lost connection with Skype once we went inside I want you to get a
[38:57.880 --> 39:01.880]  high def later and go back but let's go look at those those doors over there
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.680]  that looks like like an interrogation facility where you keep people those
[39:05.680 --> 39:11.720]  look like jail cells to me those are like that would be the prayer area and
[39:11.720 --> 39:16.680]  then possibly like a wash area where they could go in and maybe wash their hands
[39:16.680 --> 39:20.840]  but so that looks like what you saw in Iraq and Afghanistan no I'm just
[39:20.840 --> 39:23.840]  speculating that's what it could be but definitely I mean I mean that part right
[39:23.840 --> 39:26.480]  there that you see the gravel part with steps going up that would be like a
[39:26.480 --> 39:32.280]  prayer area where everyone would be in mass and saying their prayer not like
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.320]  that no let's go over there and look at that that looks suspicious and I want to
[39:36.320 --> 39:41.360]  find the subterranean entrance again they let you on the base I'm sure they're
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.360]  watching this right now so smart move by them to not freak out and act like we
[39:45.360 --> 39:48.560]  were doing something wrong when the NSA did that it became a big national news
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.960]  story so so this so they're watching right now make no mistake it's kind of
[39:52.960 --> 39:56.080]  like a movie where you go into Dracula's castle and he's nowhere to be found but
[39:56.080 --> 40:01.160]  you know he's watching you kind of strange to be in this large this large
[40:01.160 --> 40:04.520]  area that's totally empty and we know that they're training that is not a
[40:04.520 --> 40:07.640]  jail cell that has a light lock that's what I wanted to check so it's a
[40:07.640 --> 40:14.960]  storage yeah it's a storage area now now we've got a satellite overhead of the
[40:14.960 --> 40:18.400]  base we might want to show that where are you in the 300 acres right now
[40:18.400 --> 40:25.200]  Staff Sergeant Biggs how was it how was it shaped um it's almost like a like a
[40:25.200 --> 40:30.400]  squared shape that was like an axe head here we're like at the bottom corner
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.480]  right now the furthest away you could be from the road to see from the main road
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.160]  let's zoom in on that overhead right right we're at right to the left where
[40:38.160 --> 40:41.880]  the the mosque is on the other side over here this wall that we're in inside the
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.720]  compound soccer field with a track around it and then we could see some more
[40:46.720 --> 40:53.240]  overpasses walk over there and that map is of course before they built yeah yeah
[40:53.240 --> 40:57.880]  we've got a Google map the latest is before they built it well the most up
[40:57.880 --> 41:02.440]  this is been updated since the opening this isn't quite as it looks like they've
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.120]  probably done some more recent renovations since the original cutting of
[41:06.120 --> 41:13.080]  the rope and no one has approached you not yet I mean the the lady I showed her
[41:13.080 --> 41:18.120]  the email saying that we tried to contact to get in and I gave her my
[41:18.120 --> 41:21.760]  retirement card and I said you know I was like I have access to this I was like
[41:21.760 --> 41:26.240]  I should be able to go in there and she goes okay just go I guess that's good
[41:26.240 --> 41:32.000]  okay staff sergeant let's go over there and continue to just don't listen to me
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.920]  just go and check everything out go wherever you want to go next let's try
[41:34.920 --> 41:41.080]  to find the entrance to the subway because when I saw that footage that the
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.840]  Pentagon released the Army released that looked like a real subway to me and I
[41:45.840 --> 41:48.920]  want to see what's going on supposed to be one of the most detailed parts of
[41:48.920 --> 41:53.000]  this whole thing and there's underground tunnels in this whole area so
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.120]  that's going to be the the trick right there we got to find that entrance to
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.680]  see how we can get down in there it's got to be in one of these places probably
[42:00.680 --> 42:04.160]  like that bank or something well that's a huge road I mean that looks like a
[42:04.160 --> 42:08.240]  major highway there almost yeah that's yeah I mean you can see they got actual
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.800]  traffic line traffic lights and all that it's an actual supposed to be like a
[42:13.800 --> 42:17.040]  highway I'm still trying to find the overpass there's supposed to be a bridge
[42:17.040 --> 42:22.080]  around here somewhere that so we've checked out the Baptist Church we checked
[42:22.080 --> 42:30.160]  out the mosque any idea soccer field here did that reporter tell you where the
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.760]  entrance to the to the subway is no he didn't he said he got dropped off they
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.080]  they took them in a bus and only let them see that they got their ride through
[42:39.080 --> 42:42.480]  but they were not allowed to get out he said all they were allowed to do was get
[42:42.480 --> 42:45.920]  out of the bus right there at the entrance and then they pushed them inside
[42:45.920 --> 42:54.040]  and that's where they were able to see and again you're going up to what looks
[42:54.040 --> 42:59.080]  like a dwelling what would be a home or is that a business oh that's a bus over
[42:59.080 --> 43:06.440]  there a bus just pulled up oh good good good good check that out and then go
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.280]  check out the bus I think it's good to check out the bus if you guys just
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.560]  joined us we've got no well somebody just pulled in it looks like they're these
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.360]  are like offices or whatever that looks like an interrogation room it does and
[43:22.360 --> 43:27.960]  here it's yeah this does I mean it's got to chair set up with the desk see if
[43:27.960 --> 43:35.040]  you can put the camera up against it it may be able to get through here's a map
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.200]  does look like an interrogation area let's go let's go back to that well
[43:41.200 --> 43:43.880]  that was like a re-education camp to me the way it's set up with the sports
[43:43.880 --> 43:49.280]  stadium and everything and then there's a medical like it looks like a table over
[43:49.280 --> 43:57.520]  here where I now there's a train station a body down really there's a table to
[43:57.520 --> 44:00.880]  strap a body down let me see that let's pan towards that yeah I mean it's hard
[44:00.880 --> 44:07.400]  to see I'm seeing if I can block the light but it looks like well you know
[44:07.400 --> 44:11.520]  they've got black sites all over the world from Jordan to Romania for
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.560]  torturing people someone down so so you've been in Iraq you've been in
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.200]  Afghanistan multiple tours you're saying right now that looks like some type of
[44:20.200 --> 44:25.520]  interrogation area let's go back get more footage of that that's a big deal
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.680]  let's try to get some HD of that oh man I tell you it's so good to have the
[44:31.680 --> 44:36.280]  resources to have reporters to be able to send them out and do this so you guys
[44:36.280 --> 44:41.080]  were over by the mosque in the church so I guess you're in the UK in building
[44:41.080 --> 44:47.760]  you're in the UK in building I guess that's right by the mosque yeah then I
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.920]  want you to go check out the school and then look back around to the metro
[44:52.920 --> 44:59.760]  table now the guys go back to the shot of them yes I see it it looks like a
[44:59.760 --> 45:06.640]  medical exam table actually looks like a tortured table go back to that is
[45:06.640 --> 45:16.920]  incredible are you getting HD of this amazing oh my god all right I'm telling
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.280]  you folks this place is creepy why do you think they haven't come up to you yet
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.680]  all right feed cut calling back guys now we just have to keep resetting the feed
[45:28.680 --> 45:32.560]  great job with the crew on the ground and here if you just joined us they're
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.680]  outside Bowling Green Virginia at a US military base that no one's been allowed
[45:36.680 --> 45:41.520]  into and we just drove right in and are now getting the story that's how
[45:41.520 --> 45:44.560]  Bohemian Grove was that's how everything is people can't believe we ever do this
[45:44.560 --> 45:47.760]  stuff it's not that big of a deal you just go do it but you have to actually
[45:47.760 --> 45:53.160]  go do it just like the Bundy Ranch or any of these situations and Obama knows
[45:53.160 --> 45:56.160]  that he's just legalizing the felons and the illegal aliens and the murderers
[45:56.160 --> 45:59.920]  he's just turning off your power plants well we're just marching in and getting
[45:59.920 --> 46:03.360]  footage I mean it's it's what it comes down to is that all the evil men and
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.880]  tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing now that's so
[46:07.880 --> 46:10.840]  much news we're gonna get to after we cover this live but I'm not just gonna
[46:10.840 --> 46:16.560]  you know have some spooky weird FEMA camp thing with churches and a model of
[46:16.560 --> 46:22.840]  DC and not send reporters to that and so they're there staff sergeant Joe Biggs
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.440]  and David Knight are both on the ground okay gentlemen continue since your feed
[46:27.440 --> 46:34.880]  cut are there any other windows to look into in that building yeah there's one
[46:34.880 --> 46:41.600]  more window do you guys have the map the the map of the facility yeah I've got
[46:41.600 --> 46:45.400]  one on my phone somewhere because it looks like if you turn around towards
[46:45.400 --> 46:50.840]  the gate and go out the gate and take a left and then go on straight back towards
[46:50.840 --> 46:54.880]  the soccer field back around to the right at the right-hand side of the
[46:54.880 --> 47:06.400]  soccer field is underground pardon me what is that about underground they're
[47:06.400 --> 47:12.560]  frozen looks like a hatch or something inside of bugs I'm not sure exactly what's
[47:12.560 --> 47:17.480]  going on at this base but I guarantee it's CIA and of course the FBI is involved
[47:17.480 --> 47:21.920]  that's been confirmed so this is probably a black site okay and they
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.680]  literally just wandered in there look at this it's an underground hatch that's
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.520]  what I thought you said yep this door is locked and we can't go in now you know
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.120]  they're gonna say that's for training but it's perfect to hide clandestine
[47:38.120 --> 47:41.240]  torture center there you know they've got torture centers all over the world
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.560]  well that's like a sweat box a spot they just push it make you suffer for a
[47:45.560 --> 47:54.680]  while really yeah if you don't cooperate they'll put you down in a box were you
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.600]  ever a witness to any of that when you were in the army
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.520]  well when I was in Afghanistan they usually kept us outside these buildings
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.760]  and the other government agency guys probably like DDA CIA and all that they
[48:09.760 --> 48:12.400]  would go into these kind of rooms like that exactly and they would be a
[48:12.400 --> 48:17.360]  torturing people from in there in fact you told me privately cannot cannot say
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.320]  what you told me privately or is that about that's fine about how you deliver
[48:21.320 --> 48:24.880]  people to them yeah they would have us go grab people and then we would actually
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.680]  escort them in there and then once we got there the the agents whoever they
[48:29.680 --> 48:33.480]  were usually had thick beards and we could never take pictures of their face
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.320]  but they would go in and then torture whoever it was and we could just hear
[48:38.320 --> 48:42.520]  screams coming from that that building and I still hear those screams at night
[48:42.520 --> 48:46.360]  it's a horrible scream to hear a grown person like that good being tortured
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.960]  that's a pretty serious stuff but of course only the bad guys torture right
[48:51.960 --> 48:56.440]  folks wow well you've seen this facility and it sounds like you're saying this
[48:56.440 --> 48:59.920]  looks like a torture center to you that does right here this part we're in right
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.000]  now does yes and on the map on the map they call it we put the overhead back
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.680]  up of the official map that the army put out they have an acronym for that they
[49:09.680 --> 49:15.000]  call it the UKN what does that sound like unified what does UKN sound like
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.920]  biggs I've never heard that term but it to me it looks like well probably what
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.600]  the UN's gonna do to people eventually torture them and try to take over the
[49:25.600 --> 49:29.400]  world all right which direction you want to go you want to go check out the
[49:29.400 --> 49:33.720]  embassy and then go around by the soccer field and try to try to find an
[49:33.720 --> 49:40.920]  entrance that to the subways or do we have any ideas where that entrances there's
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.920]  a mock train center and above ground center that we saw rat right as we were
[49:44.920 --> 49:48.760]  pulling up I don't know if you guys can see that right as we're driving up but
[49:48.760 --> 49:52.160]  it looks like there's some parts to go around if we got back in the car they
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.040]  drive around to go over there's supposed to be an overpass over this here's a
[49:55.040 --> 49:58.560]  question are there any real railways around that base it looks like there are
[49:58.560 --> 50:04.560]  oh yeah yeah and this kind of an area it's a very they've got real railways
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.600]  running in there are you talking about outside the base you mean yeah I believe
[50:10.600 --> 50:14.600]  we saw a couple didn't we on the way up here yeah make sure to look for that
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.680]  again I'm throwing out my points what do you guys think you should do next well
[50:19.680 --> 50:22.920]  I'm kind of curious as to what this building is to my left right here it's
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.200]  very small windows and only a couple entrances well go tell you what we're
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.440]  gonna go over to it we're gonna go to break keep going out only you stream to

[54:44.680 --> 54:50.080]  inmate labor camp program all of this is real and public now they just don't give
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.160]  you the details on the specifics of each facility and I knew this one was
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.160]  special so the guys have confidently wandered right in and we may have snuck
[54:59.160 --> 55:02.920]  underneath the Giants nose my gut tells me they're watching the live feed
[55:02.920 --> 55:06.720]  obviously right now as even admitted the White House students into the show
[55:06.720 --> 55:11.480]  foreign governments do and they're leaving you alone because they realize
[55:11.480 --> 55:15.720]  making a scene and arresting you and making stuff up will only draw attention
[55:15.720 --> 55:20.160]  to the facility so they are making the right move in their Psyop that's what
[55:20.160 --> 55:25.640]  the deputy secretary of the defense said a few months ago they said we've got to
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.720]  stop lying and be more oh my gosh there's the entrance it looks like to the
[55:29.720 --> 55:33.880]  underground facility okay let's go to bigs right now bigs go ahead all right
[55:33.880 --> 55:38.200]  we're just walked over the overpass as you can see there's a train track right
[55:38.200 --> 55:41.000]  here and it's starting to lead into an underground area so we're gonna try to
[55:41.000 --> 55:49.960]  approach this and see what we can see from there yeah that looks uh well I
[55:49.960 --> 55:52.840]  don't I don't really know what to how to describe it until we know exactly what's
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.000]  going on and it does very dark and it goes deep down in here so we're gonna
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.480]  walk under here we'll quick and see what we can probably lose our feet
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.200]  this looks like the beginning of a zombie movie you're about to find my
[56:07.200 --> 56:12.520]  canisters in there with a bunch of Hillary Clinton clones god I hope not
[56:12.520 --> 56:19.360]  I don't know if I can handle that today here we go they're about to go into the
[56:19.360 --> 56:23.200]  subterranean area we don't know that looks like a real train track that
[56:23.200 --> 56:26.280]  they've directed in there but looks like they've cut some of the tracks and they
[56:26.280 --> 56:32.440]  just run into a wall yeah look down I mean this has got an actual this is real
[56:32.440 --> 56:38.400]  yeah I mean this is legit this is an actual switchboards and everything on

[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.600]  practice military occupation martial law training Trinidad acre town includes
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.960]  sports stadium school underground subway and our guys staff sergeant Joe
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:41.400]  Biggs and David Knight just marched into an underground tunnel and obviously
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:50.280]  their internet feed cut out so they are out of video audio contact going into the
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:56.680]  underground base and so many times like Bohemian Grove skull and bones that
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.120]  have been infiltrated by myself and others and the case of Bohemian Grove
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:06.080]  and military operations I would cover Delta Force operations you name it it's
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.160]  in my police state films people could not believe it like the military could
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.320]  not believe that I went and got footage of Delta Force in South Texas and then I
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.440]  had the tips to get it and then one time they had guys with guns put the guns
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.400]  to our chest and take our footage away but that was back when the system would
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.600]  get away with all this they know now that blows up in their face plus the
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.520]  military understands that this is treason that's going on I think that's a
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.160]  big part of why we're being left alone right now because they don't want to
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.080]  have a scene they will not respond to us about the base they will not talk to us
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.400]  we've called the base commander a colonel we have called their assistance we
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.040]  have sent them emails letters over the last four months we've been stonewalled
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:55.440]  so now our reporters have just waltzed right in and that's what I again people
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.640]  don't get people think when I stuck into Bohemian Grove that must have been
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.760]  fake because CBS reporters Vandy Fair reporters I mean it's it's got a more
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.600]  than 20 reporters have been arrested well yeah they go in and start asking
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.360]  people questions with a pad and paper I snuck in and then hid in the woods till
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.680]  night came and film the ritual that is the only reason I got in and was
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:23.160]  successful with Mike Hansen and once I got in I got on the pay phone said pay
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.880]  phones they're not cell phones in this gorge and I called John Ronson I said
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.440]  come on in this is how you do it then he swore me to secrecy that he'd ever been
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.280]  in there because he didn't want to get sued when he put out his TV show about
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.800]  it and then later he went oh I was in there too with Alex Jones people like
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.360]  Alex why didn't you say that well that's part of being a reporter is that you

[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.880]  and and and again I could talk about that 14 years later that was in July of
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:59.840]  2000

[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:18.040]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network our
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.640]  reporters David Knight and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs are outside Bowling Green
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:28.320]  Virginia at AP Hill Fort AP Hill which is a 300 acre facility with razor wire
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.680]  around it inside of another facility that Sergeant Biggs says he's not seen
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.640]  except in prison type facilities and bases in Afghanistan and Iraq he saw
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.720]  where he personally brought scores of people to be tortured and anybody that
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:50.720]  doubts Joe Biggs credentials he's had major Esquire pieces done on him with
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.800]  embedded reporters some of the heaviest fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq as well
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.760]  in a piece worked on for over a year with the late Michael Hastings of Rolling
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.160]  Stone before that vanity fair and he sees a very credible witness and he's
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.080]  saying it looked like a torture facility to him they've now come out of the tunnel
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.320]  where we lost video audio feeds what did you find down the railway tunnel
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:21.600]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs it's a pretty in-depth subway station as you tell a
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.520]  little wind we had to do some climbing to get in through there smells like pure
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:30.200]  gasoline but we actually got it under the subway car itself and you can see
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.680]  the map and it is actually Washington DC I mean they have it is in-depth it's
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.040]  pretty crazy to the amount of money you can tell they spent on this and they
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:47.760]  definitely put it to use right over here though what I noticed before we were
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.840]  walking down here there's some helicopter landing zones so they have
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.560]  LZ pads set up too as well now again you're just here calmly talking with
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:00.480]  you a witness to torture in Afghanistan Iraq and then now we're just
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.920]  here and you're saying yeah looks like an interrogation area looks like a
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:12.360]  torture box explained to people from your expert view what this place looks
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.800]  like it definitely doesn't look too good for America I mean you can see
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.800]  Homeland Security is buying those two billion rounds I mean they definitely have
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.640]  a reason to use those and buying up all those extra rounds and destroying them
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.320]  that shady I mean see a place like this I mean it just gives me the worst gut
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.920]  feeling in the world I don't think anything good can come from this no
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.720]  matter how they word this and say that they're doing joint operations with
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.560]  whoever to help them out it just doesn't look and feel right at all and the one
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.360]  building over there though I mean to the tee looks like an interrogation room
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.320]  that we had helped build in Afghanistan where we would bring in you know crop
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.680]  owners people had opium fields things like that and these guys would talk to
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.480]  them and I guess that's where they would try to find out whether or not they're
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.240]  gonna cooperate with the US government and or not and then we would go destroy
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.320]  those opium fields so if they didn't play ball the the fields were destroyed
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.080]  what happened if they played ball then those fields would be watched from time
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.880]  to time to make sure that no one else did destroy them whoever his whoever that
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.880]  farmers competition may be whether be Taliban or other farmers you're trying
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:27.080]  to sell and make that up money over here in the US so government helping produce
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.720]  the opium government torturing just as such an important topic now we brought
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.400]  it out since you're talking about it on air describe the top people you'd bring
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:41.120]  to the facilities that you're saying this looks like for for torture in your
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.440]  words earlier last hour I mean a lot of the times they look like right regular
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:55.760]  farmers you know I mean sometimes always kind of quote grabbing these guys have
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:03.200]  no definitely didn't look like bad Taliban people but these guys we just
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.760]  lost his feed I think the mic got unplugged for you guys so we're gonna
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.400]  check that mic feed I want you to recap what you just said and then I want to
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.320]  continue on and check out some of the other buildings and then I'm gonna let
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.120]  you guys go but with the feed still going in case something happens we'll
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.040]  have the feed it just won't be on air and I want to get high depth of
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.120]  everything you can and then I want to try to go out to the main base that that
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:32.320]  base is inside of and we'll first get your raw footage out of there and hide
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:37.720]  it someplace and then and and get lunch or something and then I want you to go
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:43.280]  back to the military base and actually talk to the people that are there at
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.120]  the base watching us right now so I guess in a couple hours they should know
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:54.520]  you're gonna be coming there does that sound like a good plan guys okay we're
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:59.280]  we're fixing their audio feed I can tell what it was guys the the external
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  mic plug must have come out and then we went to just the general mic on the
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.640]  phone so that's what happened there so we're going to get the technology back
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.680]  up and working best stuff out there is just off the shelf and then to be able
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.320]  to bring you this information first time we did live feeds with a laptop was back
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:24.560]  in 1988 we did before that in New York but at the DNC and we're really able to
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.120]  get a lot of information that way when stuff was happening in fact that video
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.880]  saved me when they said that I was saying kill Michelle Malcolm and it was
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.600]  people that were with her crouching down behind me screaming it and then they had
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.440]  the national news saying I had said kill a woman in one hour was all over
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.000]  national television and that was an attempt to destroy me but because we had
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.840]  that feed archived we had them doing it from behind showing it and that's how
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.920]  the system works folks so just remember they could pull any type of hoax at any
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:04.200]  time we're able to get reconnected with those guys not yet not well we can go to
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.880]  phone to or we don't need that good an audio we can go off the actual internal
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.680]  microphone if you want we're able to get them the message that it was a yes
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.040]  yes Mike issue they're checking the mic on all right whatever thanks doesn't
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.880]  matter I've run off with a couple of the company phones using them for stuff I
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.920]  need to bring those backs they have backup only have two phones but that's
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:31.840]  not enough all right continuing here ladies and gentlemen there's a lot of
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.800]  other news we haven't gotten to yet but this is the type of on the ground
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:42.320]  reporting that we bring you and this is just amazing news that is unfolding
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.280]  right now because Biggs has told me privately about stuff lots of us come
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.720]  out in the news about all the people they they would go grab and take them to
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.560]  be tortured and the screaming and you know the rest of it and the bloody rags
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.560]  that would come out when they were done with them sometimes they're just put on
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.400]  helicopters and disappeared and people to see to stop being naive and
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.560]  understand this is going on everywhere and it wasn't about defeating al Qaeda
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.760]  or the Taliban it was about controlling hundreds of billions a year of opium
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.000]  coming out of Afghanistan and it was produced in about seven percent of
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:22.640]  world supply in 2001 it's now producing 93% according to Interpol of world
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.200]  opium that's turned into heroin and the heroin is just everywhere now in the
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.080]  streets all over the place I go on the hike and bike trail never saw this
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.800]  woman just needles all the place people are just on heroin all over the place
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.800]  and because it's so cheap it's just pouring out on the streets and just like
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.160]  Vietnam you know who's bringing it in the big banks using the military and
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.200]  part mentalized to guard the opium fields or burn the ones that you know
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:53.200]  they don't control and it's pretty outrageous to see all this unfolding and
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.960]  to see all of this going on in this country now while we're figuring out
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:04.760]  what's going on with that guys just give me a status update status update just
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.240]  come on the mic yeah we're getting them on the phone you're on air right yeah
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.760]  good yep they're coming on the air here in a second we got them on the phone

[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.080]  your point about taking people to be tortured in Afghanistan and then what
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.240]  years that was going on and then continue to give us your take on what
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.040]  you're seeing at this AP Hill facility in Virginia and I want to get David
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.320]  Knight's breakdown yeah what I was talking about with that is you would have
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:41.120]  these agency representatives whoever they were ages and they typically don't
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.200]  look like your normal soldier you know the big long dark beard hat down the hat
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.720]  brim down to the bridge of their nose you can't face that well and you know
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.200]  they would come out on missions that we were asked you know we were told not to
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.240]  ask any questions they have a specific mission a size from what it was that we
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.520]  were doing and what they would do is you know I guess during that time when we
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.960]  were out doing our you know our magic trick you know with that the hands
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.040]  clasped up here and they're really there's something going on under the
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.360]  table you know we're giving out free food to the locals and these guys are
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.040]  helping out and that's you know Mark and then we would take the guy ask us to
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.320]  bring him in we take him into this makeshift facility looks a lot like what
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.480]  we just looked at in there with tables and stairs like that and we would pay
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.880]  an outside guard and you would hear screaming all right give us your take
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:33.080]  and we've got video established so we'll show some video shots but have audio on
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.640]  the phone again you said you saw what looked like a medical table in an
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:44.400]  interrogation area with with a sensory deprivation or sweat box yeah there was
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.120]  some kind of box over the wires and then there was a table that had wheels on the
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.680]  bottom they definitely looked like a medical table they would wrap a body
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:56.240]  down to it and then there were two chairs facing the table well you know our
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.920]  so-called US government's been caught with black sites in Germany Romania
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:07.640]  Poland Jordan AP Hill yeah Ford AP Hill I mean obviously it's got multi uses but
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.280]  down the road I'm told they already have the FBI and others there this looks
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.680]  like a big threat fusion center to me Roger that it definitely does right now
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.640]  I'm getting ready to walk over to my spot I found a landing zone for a
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.880]  helicopter so I'm looking around right there that's where the main four lane
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.800]  interstate walk area comes to an end and there's a helicopter landing zone it
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:37.640]  says a helipad 306 and it's right at the edge of the stocker field be sure and
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.600]  get footage of the Constantina wire because we're showing photos in Poland
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.440]  of a real CIA torture base and it looks just like the internal base that you're
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.680]  on similar to Camp x-ray that is within the larger Guantanamo Bay facility
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.040]  yeah you can see the sea why that kind of goes around on the edge of the
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.120]  soccer field I mean I doesn't look at place why I want to play soccer at Alex
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.520]  a big fence with the Constantina wire that was like a happy place to hold

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.360]  Biggs and David Knight and they're gonna continue to inspect the facility then
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  it's inside a military base they're gonna go to the greater military base and

[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.320]  though because they may not even know you're in there they may freak out that's
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.400]  just from experience before so Biggs closing comments from you on this right

[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.480]  for your safety and then I want to get David Knight's quick take on this as
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:56.520]  well so far like I said we've seen a lot of detailed structures out here from
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.120]  the inside and from the out you know the interesting part is those chambers over
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.520]  there where the medical tables were as well and that underground part that
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.400]  led to some kind of holding area under that building that's a bit eerie we
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:14.920]  walked into the the metro subway area that was very detailed way deep down
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.640]  underground too and you could definitely see that the map of all the DC roads
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.960]  about 20 minutes ago that bus pulled in are you gonna go over and see if
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:27.120]  anybody's in that yeah we're gonna walk up to it right now another training
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.920]  police nationwide to drive buses during emergencies David Knight more vehicles
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.760]  right now oh you hear more vehicles oh so yeah on the outside road though because
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:40.320]  we're getting close to the corner of the place I'm not sure if that bus was here
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.160]  or not we're not sure about that but you know the bottom line Alex is that when
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.200]  they did the tour and they showed the video they said there was a mosque all
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.160]  the good ones at the church I was really questioning whether there was even a
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.080]  mosque it turns out they do have a mosque but they're not talking about having
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.240]  the church they don't want people to realize that they perceive the American
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:02.880]  people as the enemy you can look at this town this is very much an American town
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.920]  scroll around here and look at this we've got a crosswalk sign over here that's a
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:13.200]  stop sign BB and T we've got traffic lights there we've got a phone booth I
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.320]  guess they got that cheap because I don't use those anymore looks like even
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.000]  newspaper stand a mailbox out there we've got street signs they've they've gone
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.080]  to a lot of detail and so the question is why is an asymmetric warfare group
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:32.280]  training for insurgency here I've watched their stuff over and over again as
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.120]  we all know they're going to train as close to the scenario that they plan to
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.960]  be operating in as possible this is very close to an American city very close
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.000]  and in the past what they've done is they've erected these building shelves
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.360]  and a lot of these buildings even though they're finished to some detail most of
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.920]  them are unfinished cinderblock but they do have windows they've got doors locks
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.400]  that sort of thing they do have this finished up like a regular city this is
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.960]  not a bombed out city like they typically train in in the desert for
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.880]  urban warfare as Joe's taught we were talking about this before they typically
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.800]  put that out in the desert they've just got the shells of buildings because they've
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:11.240]  already gone in with air strikes this is a different kind of war they're
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.600]  anticipating this is a war where they're going to be occupying a country for a
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.360]  long time and so the question is why they're making this so detailed about
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:26.160]  America well said David Knight what are you planning on doing now well I'd like
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.840]  to go back and take some shots of the mosque we lost reception when we went
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.280]  in there so we couldn't we had to go back outside again so I'd like to take
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.720]  some HD footage of that just want to get some more HD footage I think we've
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.160]  gotten into all the places that are open so yeah we'll try the fire department
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.800]  let me put the overhead back up and I'll mention all the buildings and see if
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.280]  you've been to them let's put that map back up if we can and I'll mention them
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:56.040]  are you been to the soccer area if you've been to the school the school
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.000]  school's across from the mosque right by the soccer field they didn't really have
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.360]  it well okay what they're called the school then is that building that was a
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.880]  building we call the torture center I don't know you got the UK and have you
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.600]  been to that you've got the church you've been there there's another UK and well
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.440]  there is a there is a center block building that we couldn't get into
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.760]  that's next to the soccer that is a couple of stories high we did not go
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.960]  into that one that's probably what they're talking about school and then
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.800]  this is the embassy right here the gate is open there we can go up and see if we
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:31.080]  can see anything through the windows of that I guess UKN means unknown and then
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.480]  you've got we need to find out what all those UKNs are have you been to the
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.560]  hotel have you been to the one right across from the embassy yeah that's what
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:42.400]  looks like kind of like that's right there yeah that's the hotel I guess they're
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.560]  calling that hotel and I don't know what they call this over here with the BB
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.840]  right across the street from it is that a bank or something they call it yeah UK
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.880]  unknown well they've got a ATM machine ATM machine and you've been inside the

[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:34.120]  our reporters are on the ground outside Bowling Green Virginia at Fort AP Hill
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.160]  that no other media has been allowed into the Pentagon put out some video to
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.040]  deter kept people in their vehicles we are going through every building that's
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:50.440]  open and it looks like it is a training facility jointly for torture overseas
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.520]  but could be used as a facility to torture people as well we know there's
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.120]  a lot of black sites just like it and looks to me like there's more going on
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.200]  than meets the eye underneath the facility Virginia's just riddle with
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.760]  underground railways other systems that's on record the Briar Green hotel is
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:12.280]  very famous in Virginia about three miles from where I set up by the airport
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:17.680]  they've got the Hilton that's a round hotel the former sack command base for
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.760]  this sector about a third of the country and it's got an underground base under
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.480]  it and railways out to Fort Hood and the nuclear weapon bunkers under it and I
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:32.360]  know that because I had family that lived here during the 50s and 60s and it
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.760]  was a sack base officially and I've talked to military this military base out
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:39.480]  there right now National Guard but it's more than that and they're like yeah you
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:42.680]  know about that I'm not supposed to talk about it there's all these snorkels
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.120]  sticking up on the side of the road to bring air down into the underground
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:51.280]  bases so this looks to me like that Ozarks mansion that the multi-billionaire
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.040]  a former NSA official who you know got paid all this government money he then
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:00.600]  built his own armored castle out there and they've had you know dump trucks for
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:05.000]  three years coming in and out of giant subterranean you know vaults underneath
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.640]  it it's definitely even mainstream news has said it's a secret government base
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.640]  and they're just digging in for collapse of civilization putting these
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.320]  facilities in all over the place and just doing all sorts of weird illegal
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.320]  surveillance and narcotics trafficking torture training it really is a
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.520]  nightmare scenario I mean big you know talking about delivering people for
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.240]  torture farmers and people that's your standard procedure for folks that were in
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:37.840]  the army and almost all the rest of my family that's been in the army going
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.920]  back to the fifties and sixties and seventies and eighties and nineties just
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:46.600]  goes oh yeah oh sure torture narcotics trafficking murder murder in the US I
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:53.560]  mean it's just the public is so naive about what really goes on and meanwhile
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.960]  they'll throw you in jail claiming you didn't pay your income tax but Obama can
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:04.200]  make all his friends basically tax exempt and outside of Obamacare now again
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.040]  we're still showing feeds that's good we'll be archiving that and having more
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.240]  on the nightly news tonight we'll go back to them as things unfold but it's kind
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:17.160]  of ghostly to have our reporters up there at Ford AP Hill and there are
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.040]  hundreds of thousands of people watching this on different video streams
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.640]  millions of people on the radio hearing it described it'll be archived tonight
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.720]  we'll put it out to YouTube for everybody it's just incredible and before
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:33.080]  I get into all the news I hope listeners realize I'm not complaining it's very
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.640]  animating it's very exciting to do what I do it's also very exhausting to know
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.920]  we're right and to know the big picture and to just sit here and watch it in
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.880]  slow motion the tyranny unfold but we're so blessed to be here and be able to
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.240]  run this operation it is you out there that are members of info wars news.com
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:57.200]  or prisonplanet.tv the nightly news subscription system the the HD uploads
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:04.360]  the high quality commercial free audio and video podcast all of my films the
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.320]  books I mean there's like 19 years of material the site's been around I don't
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.080]  know more than 12 years prisonplanet.tv is now a first-rate site it's been a
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.320]  little clunky over the years but it's gotten better and better and we're gonna
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.680]  be launching the next few days what I believe is the first version of the new
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.400]  redesign if it works well info wars will be updated to have a new better look I
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.120]  know folks that wanted that I've wanted that as well it's still a great side it
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.480]  would look wonderful eight years ago when Curtin Emma redesigned it he's been
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.680]  helping with the new redesign and again we're gonna do it in phases just folks
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.000]  don't like it changing this will be the first phase of change and a few months
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.440]  from now we'll change a little bit more a little bit more but the point is it's
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.080]  kind of like eBay people like the yellow color of eBay when they went to white
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:52.560]  people got mad they lost like a third of their traffic so they slowly over a
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:59.000]  year changed it from yellow down to white and changed the format so we're
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.840]  just tweaking it what works best but we're gonna do that and then with the
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.040]  rest of sites and launch a bunch of new stuff but that's exciting to have that
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.120]  done we're hopefully done in the next few days you'll see that roll out and

[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:30.000]  Reuters US releases satellite images of Russian forces near Ukraine of course
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.120]  Russia has always had some of its biggest military bases on the border with
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.320]  Ukraine they fought most their wars in that area including Hitler not
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.600]  defending the Russians the point is the globalist the EU are even worse than the
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.280]  Russian government okay it's very simple Russia to ban US from using space
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.040]  station over Ukraine sanctions that's London telegraph stuff is just getting
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.520]  crazier and crazier in retaliation for imposing sanctions Russia will also bar

[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.080]  believe any of this bull so this is escalating very very quickly you UN

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.240]  very upset that the UN's been caught I guarantee other part of it doing that
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.880]  de-dollarization Russia is like using medical helicopters to attack people with
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.280]  Red Cross on it think the Red Cross would like that Russia is on the verge
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.880]  of dealing a massive blow to the petro dollar dumping the dollar for any

[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.720]  important second amendment is a clear and present danger says Illinois
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.080]  concealed carry law allows doctors to make call on gun ownership we were sent
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.360]  this and I looked at it online since confirmed it's a state version of a
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:10.040]  federally issued public document the IDHS or Illinois Department of Homeland
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:13.880]  Security firearms ownership identification void mental health reporting
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.840]  system and they say you're basically having any type of problem or stress or
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.280]  anything your guns should be taken and they inform doctors health care
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:27.920]  providers everybody to spy on you and report that on you and to get to get
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:34.920]  your guns here's another second amendment article Florida lawmakers aim to
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.280]  restore children's right to open carry pop tart guns on campus that's right
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.640]  people been getting expelled arrested you name it for just drawing an image of
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:50.000]  a gunner writing about a gun in in in a story for English class or the pop tart
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.680]  looks like a gun to somebody the police gun total mental illness like saying you
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.760]  can't say the word bossy or you can't have tacos or it's racist I just thought
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.680]  it was tasty you've got that type just be hyper sensitive about stuff that isn't
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:07.440]  going on but then ignore all of the real tyranny I have a clip coming up I'm not
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.600]  going to play it now but transhumanist superhuman powers and life is in
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.760]  technologies will allow us to become like God says top transhumanist we're
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:24.520]  going to play a clip of that audio and video coming up here but let's shift
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:28.040]  gears into the really bombshell news that I mentioned earlier but it's so
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:32.320]  incredible you can see all these stories at drudgereport.com we've got some of
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.560]  them at mfarwars.com but this really is the ultra lawlessness of well we got to
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.280]  take you to jail you didn't pay you know for that speeding ticket and you know
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.920]  oh we got to take you to jail you weren't wearing your seatbelt they do

[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.400]  scanner they're back to doing that now the TSA is right back to it because you
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.520]  know you might be a terrorist even though the government publicly runs
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.800]  al-qaeda now no one denies that here it is Breitbart Lamar Smith calls ice
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.160]  release of 36,000 criminal immigrants a
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:17.440]  presidentially sanctioned prison break yes turn the rhetoric up to the level
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:23.800]  of reality I mean when you're getting overrun by criminal activity rapist
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:28.600]  murderers bank robbers this is just the latest release 36,000 it's hundreds of
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:33.120]  thousands I'm telling you folks illegal alien criminals not the hard work any
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.040]  legals that you see you know working in the fields restaurants you name it but
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.000]  my experience are really moral nice hard-working people but then you've got
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.080]  the criminals of Mexico who come here and this is the happy hunting ground one
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.320]  guy they say killed 20 something women that railway serial killer and they just
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.360]  couldn't stop him couldn't get him he got arrested over and over again drunk
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.000]  stumbling around but no one knew who he was I mean they're literally ghost folks
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.720]  and they're building a national ID system saying it's for the illegals but
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.240]  exempting them and really using it on citizens like Ron Paul said don't build
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:11.680]  a border fence it'll be used to keep us in and now they're admitting that amazing
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.800]  in fact there's a there's video that Lamar Smith in there and we should we do
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.080]  have a clip of Lamar Smith no we have a clip from Mark Levin show with Chris
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.840]  Crane the ice Union president that's right saying that basically La Raza which

[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:56.640]  now running our agency those groups are now running the agency how about that
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.080]  yes that's why we're going to rescue people that's why that's not a joke I
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.440]  forget all the names but I've seen it in the news over the years where the
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.240]  entire directorship almost the entire directorship is former La Raza or Ford
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.320]  Foundation yeah that's what he says here in the clip oh he says that in the
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.640]  clip I haven't even heard the clip oh he goes on it says that and running our
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.280]  agency well they're embedded in the White House I think Obama's top appointee to
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:25.760]  handle this stuff comes out of one of these groups doesn't she yes facility
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:29.800]  moon yes yes see I haven't even heard the clip I know what they're gonna say
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:35.240]  this is the truth I mean I'm and again nothing against Latin Americans folks
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:41.040]  but that's failed countries down there it's really elish and literally it's
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.960]  game over the government's bringing him in and even legalizing bank robbers and
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.880]  child molesters child rapists are being released by the thousands you cannot make
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.040]  this up I remember the first time I saw this going on under Bush they reported
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.360]  200 something thousand released the Houston Chronicle did it was like
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:02.720]  thousands of arsonists and I went there's thousands of arsonist thousands of
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:11.120]  rapists hundreds of child molesters child kidnappers I mean under the Bush plan
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.720]  that was a Democrat plan it's the same plan now that they won't let people see
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.480]  they make it secret but senator Sessions keeps releasing it and they'd
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.360]  threaten to censure him supposed to like well don't see the bill to the day we
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:26.200]  vote you swear in them at the ice meeting that you won't be a criminal
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.720]  anymore and that and then you're just released well I mean it's like I just

[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.200]  judges in Illinois and other places that throw people in jail for not paying
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:46.240]  credit cards even though there's no law that you've got to do that debtor
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.280]  prisons were outlawed hundreds of years ago in this country only about a hundred

[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:24.640]  coming out with anti-surveillance mask that you wear so that you can walk
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.400]  around and not be tracked everywhere you go of course they'll just program the
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:34.480]  computers where the cops come after whoever does an ID they're building this
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.160]  grid and speaking of that I have an article on that front that I want to hit
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:47.840]  right now out of CBS news I team Texas Texas firm tracking your car with
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:52.480]  license plate cameras it says they have a more than a thousand yeah you want to
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:55.920]  bet there they're networking the police cameras in with these companies folks
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.840]  they have partnerships and shelling the data and it says there's a hundred
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.080]  percent chance we live in a major city or ever gone to a shopping mall that
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.640]  you're being tracked by a company over the past six years drn has committed a
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.560]  network more than a thousand license plate readers located across the country
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.720]  often thought of as just a tool for law enforcement to track down selling
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:23.720]  vehicles drn is using automobile license plate readers to revolutionize the
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.160]  repossession industry you see AI technology in the hands of the
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:34.720]  corporations and again everyone's being recorded even if your cars paid for
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:40.400]  to just see if you know you might be someone who hasn't paid their their
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:46.920]  their bill and kills switches are in all the new cars taxing boxes are in all
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:49.400]  the new cars and now they're announcing oh we're gonna start taxing you by the
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:52.360]  mile remember I was the conspiracy theorist warning you about this stop
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:56.120]  living in denial folks it's all a clip of that happening you want to see that
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:57:01.920]  you have a clip of what of the I teams oh sure let's see that clip places the
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:05.400]  eyeballs of those people that were hanging their heads out the windows if
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.840]  they're not asking my permission I have a problem with that Kurt Schwartz is the
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.840]  Dallas attorney he says he worries about the number of license plate readers I
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:20.280]  don't expect it to be driving around in secret on the other hand I also don't
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:24.080]  expect to be followed everywhere that's right with the network of thousands of
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:29.440]  stuff right there folks it's an integrated master DARPA plan on record to
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:34.440]  control all reality and track everything with digital systems to have reality be
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:39.080]  searchable not just the internet the internet is a neural network AI system
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:43.720]  interfacing with homo sapien sapien and other new computer systems and
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:47.320]  artificially intelligent systems they believe are coming online probably
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:53.280]  already have to then put out the smart dust RFID face scan infrared digital
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:58.400]  template to literally track reality to then be able to program and control
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:04.720]  reality and I've been saying that for 15 years now it's mainline news that is the
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:10.020]  plan and by the way it's not nice people that run it it's an artificial system
[01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:14.560]  like fractional reserve banking and derivatives and high-frequency trading
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.600]  meant to scam you and in the free market as we know it and create a monopoly one
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:26.400]  system one unified hellish code a collective with engineered food water
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:31.240]  everything I mean it's just a whole new world the globalist want to be God they

[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:17.640]  while the globalists are killing the earth bringing in this tyranny look at
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.600]  this this is out of Reuters two US health workers ill after Mears exposure
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.520]  World Health Body meets in Geneva it's now spread out of the Middle East they
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:32.240]  have sent 22 or 20 healthcare workers home thinking they may have it if that's
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.520]  happen it's gonna start spreading to healthcare workers at Florida hospital
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:39.000]  exposed to a patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome that kills 30% of
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.320]  people come in contact have begun showing flu-like symptoms raising concerns
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:46.560]  about the ability of global health authorities to contain the mysterious
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:53.760]  and deadly virus could this be the crisis I mean this is really serious I'm
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.720]  watching this very closely the World Health Organization convened an
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:02.080]  emergency meeting in Geneva on Tuesday to decide whether the rising rate of
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:05.920]  confirmed cases most of them in Saudi Arabia constitutes a public health
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.120]  emergency or international concern man they could have mirrors killing 10
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.400]  million people they don't the borders up I'm telling you it's just it's just
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.400]  sick and again there's so much designer stuff so SARS mirrors all of it

[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.920]  family members in the last six months we are not in Kansas any more ladies and
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:32.000]  gentlemen and I'm not trying to be negative here I just want people to
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.440]  know what we're facing what's going on it's it's best to know that when you're
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:40.560]  walking around at night you know and you step in a hole and tear your Achilles
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.400]  tendon had been nice to know that hole was there I always use that analogy to
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.240]  step in a hole at night and I've actually done it climbing around like an
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:54.040]  idiot at night and it's just the type of things that go on and here we are as a
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:04:00.080]  society with an elite so disconnected and so hateful of this republic that
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:06.240]  they are building an open control grid to dominate good people while legalizing
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:11.520]  in one swath 36,000 legals who were aggravated felons I mean rapist
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:17.720]  arsonist child rapist but bank robbers I mean it's just it's just like if you're
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.000]  bank robber you're fine it's like the Jacobins and the French Revolution the
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.240]  French government the French royalty was bad but it was just replaced with
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:31.120]  something even more diabolical and people just committed to mayhem and death
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:38.480]  just lawless crazy town and it's a mass narcissism I'm seeing people at record
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:43.080]  numbers get delusional on power trips think they're invincible and just ruin
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:47.520]  their lives I know you're seeing it too and I don't know what's going on but
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:52.720]  man society from television everything is really screwed up right now and we
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.640]  are sitting on top of a giant time bomb we're gonna talk about it with Harry
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:04.000]  Dent straight ahead in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.400]  staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in

[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:18.480]  ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:23.280]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:28.600]  halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:33.640]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:06.400]  Hi I'm Janet Napolitano Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:12.440]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:20.600]  it seems apparent that our citizens are staying off the streets which may make
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:26.400]  scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes to recap
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:33.440]  those revisions women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:42.000]  brackets but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:52.160]  big 70 points the big score anyone any sex over 75 years old has been up to 100
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:09:01.560]  points as always how fast you move determines how long you live
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:12.720]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones we stand for the
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:16.560]  opposite of collectivism we stand for individualism and human empowerment
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.280]  that always gives you the great literature of the music the wealth the
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:28.360]  exploration the renaissance the trailblazing collectivism is always
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:34.560]  festooned with surveillance and black uniforms and nighttime rallies and
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:41.360]  and cult gangs that wreck civilizations and we see the very same corrupt
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:47.920]  manifestation today but with giant armies of decadent mobs demanding their
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.720]  free welfare demanding their free goodies I cannot think of a more insane
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:10:01.440]  example of the criminal activity that's going on that 36,000 illegal aliens who
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:06.400]  were aggravated felons hundreds of thousands are being released every year
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.400]  but aggravated felons they're not even really doing deportations anymore the
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.920]  judges are being ordered at these courts just to let them go and again I don't
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.960]  even dislike the immigrants that are in this country most of them now we've
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:26.400]  aborted most our kids 53 million we have 1.3 kids on average you know the whole
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.400]  west is dying from Japan to the US so we gotta have somebody to work to pay the
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.640]  Social Security the issue is is that we're telling the world send your
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:40.400]  criminals and you're unskilled and your socialists and they get here and then
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.080]  they vote for whoever will give them the most handouts as the country goes
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:49.160]  completely bankrupt what happens when it goes bankrupt well it's like Democratic
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:52.800]  parties and try to stage a race war and then use that to bring in tyranny I
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:57.960]  mean that's really the blueprint I see Lamar Smith calls ice release of 36,000
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:03.760]  criminal immigrants at presidential sanctioned prison break is it impeachable
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:10.480]  world that daily ask does a bear crap in the woods and we've got so many serious
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:15.360]  issues going on ladies and gentlemen that it is just outrageous that they've
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.800]  got Boehner pushing again for quote immigration reform we're the most wide
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:25.800]  open country in the world you can't go anywhere and have your baby paid for you

[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.520]  for we're a joke people and the political correctness isn't going to work on

[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.880]  protect themselves Harry thanks so much for coming on nice to be back Alex you
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:24.280]  know first of all I mean demographics is what we look at and and as bad as I'm
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:28.640]  forecasting for the United States after this massive baby boom generation which
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:34.080]  was augmented by a very large immigrant generation as much as our demographics
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:39.080]  point down there much worse in Europe much worse than East Asia areas that
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.800]  don't get as high immigrants the key thing is to have you know kind of
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:47.920]  constructive policies like Australia and Canada where they attract the best
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:51.880]  immigrants and the skills you need exactly you said earlier you replace the
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:56.600]  babies we're not having because we haven't been having babies since 1962 at
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.880]  the same rate as before and most countries aren't so you need a policy and
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:04.520]  Australia doesn't let people run across the border at random you have to
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.720]  qualify there they get more immigrants than we do per capita but higher
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:13.400]  educated less people on welfare roles so it's a more productive system we're
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:17.680]  the greatest country in the world and we've always attracted immigrants we
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:21.040]  were an immigrant country from the beginning but we have no rules for it
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.040]  until maybe recently we're just starting to think about it it's just not good
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.000]  policy but the fact that we've had such strong immigration especially over the
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.160]  last few decades makes us look a lot better than Europe I have one of the
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.000]  predictions I'm making Alex is not only we're gonna go off a demographic clip
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.280]  Germany and much of Europe's gonna go off a steeper demographic clip and
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.960]  anybody thinks especially Germany because Germany's getting old really really
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.160]  fast I totally agree with you and you know I get why Rand Paul says give me a
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.600]  real immigration plan and I'll be for amnesty but it has to be reasonable we
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:59.320]  can't let all the felons go free and then he gets attacked as being racist I
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.800]  mean obviously we need the demographics I'm all but there's so many good
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:08.240]  immigrants from Latin America or Eastern Europe or wherever but instead we
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.760]  literally get the dregs and so politically how will that affect us
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:17.600]  that's what I'm asking you that so many of these immigrants believe in
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.040]  communism and socialism and politically I understand the economic
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:26.960]  demographics are overall good except the welfare state what about that well
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:31.680]  you know I'm like yeah I'm very mixed I see a lot I used to lecture mostly to
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.280]  CEOs of small businesses to tech and Vistage and YPO young presidents
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:40.640]  organization and I found like the penniless immigrants were the strongest
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.520]  entrepreneurs they they had been poor they'd come out of a poor culture they
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:48.720]  would do anything to get ahead and they were very Republican in their values
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.240]  they they were very different so I think you get a whole array there it's just
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:55.320]  like you say if you can attract immigrants have a policy who do you want
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:59.560]  to track how do they get in and then then how do you what happens when they
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:04.400]  get in it as long as it's clear it can work our system's been totally unclear
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:08.840]  for decades we say it's illegal to come in but we turn our head the other way and
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.280]  then when they come in it's kind of wishy washy that they qualify for this or
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.920]  that of course they're gonna end up in your hospitals if they have a problem
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.640]  stuff so I don't blame the immigrants if I was in Mexico I'd want to come over
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:23.320]  here except for in recent years and by the way after the great recession in
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:29.160]  2008-9 we actually had as many in Mexican immigrants going back across the
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:33.640]  border to Mexico as coming over here and we've been predicting for 20 years that
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:37.640]  our birth rates would drop further in this downturn this slow period from
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:42.320]  2008 to 23 which is a simple demographic projection I can go over and
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:46.360]  the immigration would fall and immigration rates are already falling and
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:51.240]  in an upturn they're tolerated in a downturn they're not because people
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:55.320]  say well wait a minute we can't afford to be giving away jobs when we're losing
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.680]  them there's just got to be some way to counter the Democrats trying to radicalize
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:04.440]  all these people yeah again I just say be clear have rules for getting in I
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:09.040]  wouldn't go send everybody back across the board if you turned your your if you
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.440]  look the other way and didn't enforce it then you're not really taking the law
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:17.440]  seriously and I wouldn't want to disrupt families over here and the second
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:22.360]  generation immigrants they all speak English and then they tend to have you
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.040]  know more often than not a strong work ethic I find that immigrants
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:31.480]  demographically come in lower-income in education but they rise faster than the
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:35.440]  average American so overall we come on this show how do you stop that scenario
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:39.320]  that a free country makes you wealthy and then your kids and grandkids become
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.240]  lazy slobs how do we stop that because that's the paradox of freedom it
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:48.800]  creates so much wealth that then it creates pig like grandchildren yeah it's
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:51.800]  the same thing they say by three generations you get entrepreneurs that
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.240]  start fortunes and create wealth and then the next generation is highly
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:58.880]  educated and they become Harvard MBAs like me or lawyers and stuff and they do
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.080]  pretty good then by the third generation they're just partying and that is human
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:06.320]  nature it's the same thing we get in bubbles like this and we get in a long
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:11.440]  boom from 1983 to 2007 which I predicted a long time ago with demographic
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:16.960]  trends back start in 1988 people get more and more complacent and they think
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:20.200]  well you know we should get more and it should be easy and then bubbles come
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.040]  along and they say oh now we're getting something for nothing and we don't want
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.120]  the bubbles to ever end bubbles always end and bubbles come when people think
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:32.280]  things can't go down you don't have to invest anymore for long-term wealth you
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:36.760]  don't have to work for it it should just happen spontaneously because you exist
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.560]  and that's what we've been in since since the mid 90s bubble after bubble and I
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:45.560]  tell people if it looks like a bubble quacks like a bubble walks like a bubble
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.600]  it's a bubble and every economist and analyst is coming on on CNBC and the
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:54.520]  financial channels and say oh this isn't a bubble I've compared this in my book
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:58.800]  in chapter five in my recent newsletter every bubble in history they all look
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:02.520]  exactly like in fact they look just like the masters and Johnson's orgasm
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:06.520]  chart where you just go up it gets intense extreme and then it just crashes
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:11.080]  I mean you need a trigger so we're in a dangerous time and in my biggest message
[02:19:11.080 --> 02:19:14.960]  you know whether you're a penniless immigrant or your worths millions of
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.560]  dollars from this great bubble and all the financial assets bubbling up in the
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:22.160]  ultra-low rent interest rates would have been manipulated by the government
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:26.640]  which never turns out well protect your wealth you know keep your job work
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:31.080]  harder than ever protect your wealth in this bubble get out of inflated real
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:34.560]  estate and stocks that I think are very near a peak as I said last time I was
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:38.200]  on a stay there I want to get your real forecast that that unfortunately looks
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:42.280]  like it's going to come true Harry Dent.com will tell us about his new book as
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:47.160]  well give us a sneak peek into that and talk about how we protect ourselves what
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.680]  he thinks is going to happen in this country and then you've got the
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:54.800]  situations with the wars and energy and all the rest of it and then when he
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:20:00.160]  leaves us at about 45 after I'm going to get into a bunch of other breaking news.

[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:29.080]  you see him on CNBC CNN all of them breaking down what he thinks is going
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:31.640]  to happen and I've looked back at his predictions they've been very accurate
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.520]  but anyone could see this though the big demographic cliffs what's going to
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:40.000]  happen or is the power structure going to start wars his new book is the
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.760]  demographic cliff Harry S. Dent Jr. you can also go to his site and subscribe to
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:50.960]  his newsletter there my only issue is every time we see things happen like
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:57.120]  this in history this big war start there's all sorts of crisis what do you
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:01.080]  see happening and what do you think the triggers could be for this will it be an
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:05.800]  instant trigger or will it be gradual or we don't know well you know bubbles when
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:09.080]  they they don't correct or go down slowly they burst when they burst and we've
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.080]  had bubble after bubble and we've had you know real estate bubbles starting in
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.080]  Japan and then crashing and then the US and Spain and Ireland and then we're
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.480]  going to see China's the greatest bubble in history I go into that in the book
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:26.520]  it's beyond comparison because it's been so government driven people say to me
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:30.560]  oh well you know in Dubai or when I'm in China you'll say oh well ours the
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.920]  government won't let this burst when a government's behind a bubble it's going
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:37.680]  to be more extreme the free market system can get out of whack now and then
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.280]  through greed but when governments are pushing stuff there's no end to it so
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.880]  the China bubble is going to be the biggest trigger there's already cracks
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:48.400]  in that we've seen many things going wrong in China developers failing
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:53.600]  developers discounting condos for the first time people in China save tons of
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.120]  money the fluent people just invest in empty condos don't even try to rent
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:01.680]  them out and then they get really mad when developers have to discount from
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:05.880]  overbuilding and the government encourages us so China I could spend an
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.560]  hour on this Alex I'm not China is the greatest bubble in history I tell people
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:12.720]  if that bubble doesn't burst in the next several years I'm going to quit my
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.080]  profession moved to Australia and be a limo driver I mean I've never seen
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.920]  anything like this you know Germany as I said earlier well I was in late 89 I
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:26.160]  was the only guy in the world that predicted Japan was going to collapse
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.000]  in the 90s while the US and Europe had their greatest boom ever just on
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  demographics everybody else thought Japan was going to take over the world
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.280]  well Germany I'm looking at Germany's spending wave we call it a 46 47 year
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:44.680]  lag on on on the birth index for peak spending very simple analysis and it
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:48.160]  says Germany's going to go off a steeper cliff in the next eight to ten years
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:53.480]  than Japan did in the 1990s and it runs expecting Germany to save the euro and
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.920]  not going to happen in Italy and France and other countries and everybody in
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.840]  Europe follows Europe hasn't even gone off the cliff but one of the points of
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:06.640]  the book Alex is that the first Japan went off this baby boom slow down and
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:11.200]  spending first yeah 15 years ago yeah yeah then the US which we predicted over
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:15.360]  20 years ago starting in 2008 which was right on cue and we don't always look
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:18.880]  to be that accurate we just tell people look this is coming and now Europe is
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:22.720]  next and the rest of East Asia so demographics that work I want to I want
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:27.520]  to look at one chart I've got here says four primary cycles over 30 years I've
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.960]  developed four key cycles globally that make a difference and we can project
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:36.280]  long-term the first is this demographic boom bus cycle the blue line at the top
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:42.200]  that turned down in the US in late 2007 the second the red line is a geopolitical
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:47.840]  cycle you talk about wars and conflicts in the world 1983 to 2018 years this
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:53.120]  cycle is up nothing went wrong in the world falling inflation no major wars
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:57.000]  we had a tiny war with Iraq the first war and we were in and out in a hundred
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.080]  hours kicks it on Hussain's ass and then go back home but 2001 the tech
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:07.520]  correction turned into a great crash 9 11 hit and then the first Iraq war then
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:13.120]  the Afghanistan war now we got Syria the Arab Spring Russia and Ukraine this
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.680]  cycle points down till 2019 along with the demographic cycle the black line the
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:22.720]  third one down there is a 30-year commodity cycle this is important because
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:26.720]  it affects emerging countries they are commodity producers and exporters their
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.600]  stock markets people aren't aware this most emerging countries that do have
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:35.120]  good demographics unlike the US and Europe have been going down but this
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.640]  commodity prices are going down that hurts them this cycle points down for
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:43.080]  the next decade and finally we have a very important boom bus crash cycle
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:47.560]  about every 10 years it actually revolves around sunspot cycles I've been
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:51.920]  able to refine this in recent years with a lot of work and this cycle is the last
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:57.320]  and most sharply to point down from 2014 to 19 the point Alex do you have any
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.480]  idea why the sunspots are correlated yeah well you know people tell me who
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:05.680]  work in emergency rooms in police departments just a full moon you'll
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:09.960]  get three times as many as oh yeah murders and crimes this is the sun this
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:14.880]  cycle turns up solar radiation actually goes up pretty consistently for four to
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:19.400]  five years and then comes down for five to six years almost every great bull
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:24.160]  market and bubble has come in this up cycle and almost every serious crisis or
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.520]  crash or depression is coming this down that's it it's literally the cosmic
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:32.560]  rays affecting us literally the cosmic we're like plants yeah feel more
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:36.520]  optimistic or less or more energy or less just like a full moon but this is
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:40.960]  much bigger so this is the most implied intriguing sir long segment coming up
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.880]  stay there intriguing top analyst joins us right now ladies and gentlemen Harry

[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:35.400]  there been running his own operation for many years best-selling author and you
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:39.800]  can now get his new book that's linked up on a site we'll be talking about that
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:44.360]  here in a moment there's no doubt that this is about demographics and there's
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:50.480]  no doubt that the 10-year Sun cycle sometimes 11 years drives the weather
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:55.000]  drives the climate drives human activity and the ancients knew about these
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:01.560]  cycles and this is literally affecting our minds just like the moon affects the
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:06.960]  tide affects women going into labor this is not disputed but the UN five years
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:12.000]  ago when the Copenhagen World Tax stuff leaked they voted and said we don't care
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.600]  what other side to say the Sun does not affect climate we would be at absolute
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:23.240]  zero no life on this planet if the Sun wasn't there in fact there wouldn't be a
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:27.800]  gravitational pull we'd be floating around I mean we're a product of the
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:34.040]  Sun's creation and I can't believe I have to stake these simple things to you
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:37.400]  know establishment listeners I know most of you know all this it's just so
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:43.400]  frustrating that you big analyst it was a big article out yesterday I was as
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:47.240]  unwired about you know brain scientists you know working for the big fortune
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.120]  500 to manipulate people of course I mean that's what's going on and the
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:55.200]  public's been taught no there's nothing happening there's no manipulation you
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:59.160]  know there's no solar radiation affecting human activity oh it doesn't
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.120]  affect the weather everybody knows when there's a big sunspot that hits your
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:09.720]  region real weather forecasters we've had on physicists come on and and say no
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:13.600]  there's a big sunspot today so it'll probably rain real hard and then that
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.480]  comes in and forms the ionization that forms a nuclei in a clear blue sky you
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:22.080]  have thunderheads the next day and rain and I'm already burning up time we've
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.360]  got with our guest it's just that it's so interesting how as a top analyst he
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:29.760]  brings up sunspots which you can see on there so explain to us this sounds to
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:37.200]  me like a super storm of demographics and of resources and commodities and
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:44.760]  sunspots and population and I mean as a layperson listening to you sir it
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:48.720]  sounds to me like we better strap ourselves in that we got front-row seats
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:53.160]  to crazy town yeah now it's true Alex when I look at these four cycles that
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:56.800]  I've refined over 30 years and you you can't look at everything that's how
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:00.880]  economists get so confused you have to find out what really matters what really
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:04.880]  calls turning point these are the four cycles and they're all pointing down at
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:08.520]  the same time for the next six years the only time that's happened in the last
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:13.080]  century and a half was 1930 to 34 when we had the Great Depression the worst
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:17.080]  crash the worst bubble burst everything I'm talking about and people on the
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:21.920]  mainstream media look at me like I'm crazy I'm not crazy this is reality so so
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.120]  we do need to prepare people need to be extra cautious I'll show you the next
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:29.720]  chart I have real simple it's called a megaphone chart each bubble we've had in
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:33.440]  stock the one that peaked in 2000 well then we had a crash would then we had
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.040]  went to slight new hires highs in this chart we show 2007 what went to new
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:42.320]  lows in its crash well now we're going to slight new highs around 17,000 in the
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:46.640]  doubt and I'm simply predicting by this obvious pattern the next crash when all
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:51.480]  this fake stimulus fails again or China blows up it's going to take us to new
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:56.120]  lows around five to six thousand just the next few years and we don't bottom out
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:00.920]  in these cycles till about 2019 or 20 so we'll be lower than that people can see
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.280]  their entire retirement life savings and real estate and we're talking about real
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.440]  estate going down like in 2008 commodity stocks global emerging markets
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:15.400]  everything it's a great reset we call it it only comes once in a lifetime like the
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:20.800]  1930s or the 1870s with the railroad bus before that so nobody understands the
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:24.720]  bubbles nobody understands the burst and the media doesn't want to see it coming
[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:28.280]  because they want to keep everybody just happy and don't want anybody to panic you
[02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:31.760]  need to protect yourself now your business and your investments we have a
[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:36.120]  chapter in the book chapter seven for investments whole strategies and a whole
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:40.800]  chapter on business a chapter eight a whole chapter on government strategies for
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:44.720]  restructuring this debt and getting rid of this insanity rather than then
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:47.880]  encouraging it with more and more and that's the fake money and that's the
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.720]  demographic cliff your new book that I've been reading it's excellent now now
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:57.800]  expanding on this let me bring in some new factors government the British
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.960]  Ministry of Defense the Department of Defense here we've covered the reports
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.240]  here they said back in 2007 both groups issued it saying between the dates
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:08.840]  you're saying all hell's gonna break loose and saying basically exactly what
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:11.800]  you're saying but but acting like they don't know why it's gonna happen so
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.680]  they're getting ready digging in buying armored vehicles everywhere you know just
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:20.120]  digging in like it's Armageddon against the people and then separately you've
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.640]  got high-frequency trading algorithms well we heard a decade or so before the
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:30.160]  2008 plunge that oh these big scientists have computers they can you know keep it
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:34.360]  from happening my question is can they pull high-tech rabbits out of their
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:38.400]  hats with how rigged much of the markets are in my view correct me you think I'm
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:44.640]  wrong and and keep the bubbles going or like have a recession or depression in
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:49.200]  the real economy but inflate the fiat areas you know two separate economies a
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.880]  fake economy versus a real economy a partition system because we've entered
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:58.000]  such la la land as a layman I'm just saying do they have any rabbits in their
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.680]  hat to to continue this on and change the chart well you know they have
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:05.960]  quantitative easing now they that's not what they've done in the past past
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:09.720]  crises in the 70s and stuff or 30s they would lower interest rates to make
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:13.800]  borrowing easy cushion thing they wouldn't literally just throw money into
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.360]  the economy like dropping it from helicopters as they say this is new
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.560]  this is extreme it is like taking a financial drug it only makes your
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.200]  addiction worse we've been running up debts and deficits since the early
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:31.000]  70s for 40 years now we have the greatest debt bubble the highest debt
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.920]  ratios and more and more countries around the world the biggest demographic
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.880]  surge and now the biggest demographic drop there's no way this cannot end
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:43.720]  badly what they're doing is just putting more financial stimulus in the
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:47.600]  economy to keep it going a little longer but this is an artificial recovery
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:52.040]  real people with real mortgages aren't buying houses speculators are high
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:56.840]  frequency trading hedge funds 30 to 50 times leverage are largely driving up
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:01.320]  this market by low government interest rate if you make that come interest
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:05.680]  rates artificially low you will get a casino so the risk of quantitative
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:09.760]  easing is not rising inflation because all this debt the leverages causes
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:13.480]  depletion I've shown that clearly throughout history the the risk is that
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.080]  you create even bigger bubbles that have to burst and then you go down harder
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:20.560]  and that's what I'm saying each bubble as I showed in that last chart it's
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:24.240]  higher and more extreme and then when they burst it gets more extreme and
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:28.800]  and things go bad and at some point the China bubble and some of these bigger
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:32.360]  trends burst China is the biggest bubble in the world is the second largest
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:36.240]  country in the world they're the ones still buying real estate major cities
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:40.160]  driving up when the China bubble burst we're going to go down much harder than
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:45.760]  2008 9 that that I see very clearly not a matter of if it's a matter of when the
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:49.360]  best cycles I study and that's only guessing the short term say we're
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:52.560]  peeking here between April and June and we're going to start to see a major
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:58.120]  crash into the summer and it's going to take years to work out my fear is is
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:01.640]  that they'll just give trillions more to the big hedge funds the derivatives
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:05.600]  people to bail them out raise a bunch of taxes I mean we know what they'll do
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:11.280]  California is their model and so I predict that they'll just continue with
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.760]  everything they're doing they will you write out and that's what they have been
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.120]  doing but at some point when something goes wrong the subprime crisis that was
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:23.400]  just four states in the US California Arizona Nevada Florida four states the
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:28.280]  United States set up a worldwide crash and recession many real estate crashes
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:31.840]  well that wasn't just because of that but because the system was so stretched
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.120]  all it takes is something to go wrong and the whole thing blows up governments
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:40.160]  have stretched this so far by trying to put off this crisis and put it on the
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.280]  next administration or the next central banker then when it does blow it's going
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:48.480]  to blow harder than anybody thinks and they're not going to be able to stop it
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:52.280]  when it blows it first so so that's what I say what is your guide not a
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:55.400]  prediction what does your gut tell you the trigger might be or what it might
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:00.240]  look like I mean it could be the Ukraine situation it could be civil war in
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:04.520]  Saudi Arabia it could be China threatening to attack Japan I guess to
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:08.520]  get militant enthusiasm going to have them support the tottering regime I mean
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:13.240]  who knows what what's gonna blow well remember the geopolitical cycle is
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:16.360]  actually what you're saying that's been getting worse since 9-11 it will get
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.960]  worse ahead so you're going to see more problems in Middle East and China and all
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:23.920]  these areas but the biggest thing that central bankers would not be able to
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.600]  fight in Europe United States is that the China real estate bubble burst and
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:32.200]  and wealth by the wealthiest Chinese that controls 60% of their spending 50
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.400]  I mean 60% of their income 50% of their spending 85% of their real estate that
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:41.440]  vaporizes they would stop spending in China China would collapse they would
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:44.640]  stop investing around the world like the Japanese did when their bubble didn't
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.760]  burst in the early 90s and we would have a worldwide collapse that quantitative
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:54.440]  easing could not counter so that's worse than a war a worsening war in Egypt or
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:43:00.120]  Syria or Ukraine that's that's what I say I say China bubble bursting is going
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:04.840]  to be what people look back and history said oh that's what really I agree with
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:08.840]  you but I think they'll try to start a fight with Japan absolutely first
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:13.960]  everybody will do that it does make sense to try to start military conflicts
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:18.800]  when your economy's made bad I mean ask Hitler that's what he did in the 30 yeah
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:23.760]  it's a well I guess humans we live a life cycle we live 75 years we act just
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:29.320]  the same over and over again this time we've got nuclear weapons yeah and you've
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:34.120]  got very unsettled region again you talk about geopolitical conflicts Europe and
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:38.440]  United States are older it's the younger countries it is the Middle East you
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:42.160]  know it is parts of Asia that's where you're going to get more this older
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.240]  people don't go to war as easily as younger countries I'm much more worried
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:51.640]  about the Middle East and North Africa I want you to take five minutes because
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.240]  I've been asking a lot of the questions to cover any points you want instead of
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:58.680]  me just throwing stuff out there we know you know the most important thing
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:03.480]  Alex me because I study history and human nature like you say there's great
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:06.800]  things about us we're the smartest species on the planet we've done great
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:10.560]  things but but we're just totally stupid about about other things and we have
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:15.160]  endless conflicts and stuff the thing I see throughout history people just are
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:19.720]  blind to bubbles I mean I was over in Australia in February of this year for
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:23.120]  almost a whole month they got one of the most obvious real estate bubbles in the
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:27.760]  world and everybody over there has ten reasons why their bubble is special and
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:31.480]  it won't burst and I'm like oh you mean like the Japanese bubble was special and
[02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.160]  it wouldn't burst and the US bubble and the Spain bubble and on and on and on
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:40.760]  people don't get it and and and we've seen now multiple bubbles and things will
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:44.480]  crash and then the government will come up with some artificial stimulus program
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:48.680]  and people will run back and say well it's okay now and then people will come
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:51.840]  on the news I mean I like you Alex because you tell the truth that's what we
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:55.600]  do at Dent Research I just say look we do a lot of the unique things but the
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.800]  biggest thing about us we just look at reality and tell the truth growth is
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:05.000]  exponential but it's also cyclical and when you get bubbles they burst and they
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.800]  go back to where they started or lower and everybody has again a million
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:12.120]  reasons why this isn't a bubble and governments won't let it happen as I
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:17.240]  said before when governments get involved like in Dubai I was in Dubai in
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.440]  late 2006 and 2007 speaking at international conferences there and I
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:24.840]  said this is a worse bubble than Miami and California it's gonna burst and
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:28.120]  everybody said no the government won't let it I'm like now you're really in
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:33.120]  trouble the next year first drop in Dubai was 40% in one year in real
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.320]  estate and real estate doesn't crash nearly as much as stocks so so just
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:42.080]  wake up listen to the people who are telling the truth here because this is
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:47.640]  serious this is not another 20% or 30% correction or even a 40 or 50% they're
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:52.080]  going to see new highs my prediction very clearly in the book that this bubble
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.960]  really would have peaked naturally in late 2007 it has been extended one more
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:00.600]  time when it crashes the next time we're not going to get back to 17,000 in the
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.920]  Dow you'd be lucky to get 10,000 in the Dow after we go to 3, 4, 5, 6,000 and we
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.800]  will not turn around for a long time so the key is to preserve what you have if
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:14.840]  you have a good job then kiss your boss's ass and keep it maybe start
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:18.040]  something on the side make money in the side as many ways as it does but don't
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:21.240]  leave your job here if you've got assets that have bubbled up in real estate or
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.800]  stocks take those gains and lock them in and be safe and then when we get
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.080]  another crash which we will because we've had one every six seven years like
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:34.120]  a clock then you buy stop at 20 30 cents on the dollar and that's how you make
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.160]  money sure you don't make money by buying and holding stocks in this era and
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:42.800]  that's all common sense and what I don't get is if people just want to buy in
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:47.320]  early in a bubble and they know it's a bubble then fine that's your
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:52.800]  issue it's that people most of them worship the bubble they allow it to
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:57.600]  become totally irrational and then they get mad when you're right and it pops
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:02.120]  and is so destructive I mean look they get mad at me just for predicting it's
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:06.040]  a bubble people act like you're crazy how could you be saying this and I'm
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:09.320]  like we've already seen two bubbles burst and stocks alone in the United
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.320]  States in the last decade not to count every other bubble and gold and each one
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.040]  is getting worse I noticed I mean undoubtedly 2008 was worse than then
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:23.040]  than 2001 how bad's the next bubble gonna be it's always gonna be worse again
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:27.560]  we're saying just in the first decline in the next couple years the Dow's gonna
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:33.280]  go from around 17,000 to at least 6,000 that's a 65% decline much worse than the
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.720]  last crash ultimately I think the Dow's gonna go to 3 to 4,000 maybe lower by
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:42.440]  2020 we're talking about and this is typical of depressions and that follow
[02:47:42.440 --> 02:47:46.960]  debt bubbles and bubbles crashing stock markets go down about 80% they went
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.800]  down 89% of the Great Depression 82% and the Japan crash in the 90s and in
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:57.720]  early 2000 this is typical and people just act like well I know it's crazy that
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:01.880]  can't happen to us not to the United States or not in this new world no it's
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:06.360]  even worse our governments are making I can't even compare this bubble to the
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:10.800]  roaring 20s bubble or the 1870s bubble or the 1830s bubble in the past because
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:14.280]  governments have pushed them and we have been able to borrow so much more
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:17.720]  money and like you say on top of all that geopolitically we have nuclear
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:23.720]  weapons now in closing let's say a good scenario the bubble pops but it's not
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:28.320]  that drastic and let's say it's like 2008 or something they'll just try
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:32.960]  something new but things really break down a lot of people are already on the
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:36.680]  edge of bankruptcy I mean the economy and in reality is really bad and in my
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:42.160]  view I don't think we really had a recovery yeah 80% of people in surveys
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:45.640]  say you know we've never had a recovery the top 20% the more affluent with
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:50.360]  college degrees low unemployment and and who own most these financial assets
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.800]  quantitative easing actually did not help the everyday person much it helped
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.760]  the affluent people sure the bubble going and that's their only strategy they
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:02.440]  said look we created this bubble now we have to keep it going forever you that's
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:06.080]  like keeping the orgasm going forever I I don't know anybody out there can do it
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:10.320]  I can't do it well that's what I'm saying is they're creating a total two-party
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:15.000]  system where where the establishment it's all protected its investments are
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.880]  protected and then as the real economy dies it's creating like a new dark age
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:24.440]  or something how bad could the collapse get well you know we had 25% unemployment
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:28.160]  right now if you count the people who've left the workforce and just given up
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:33.160]  working it's really an 11 to 12% it'll probably double that right now the
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:38.440]  official employment unemployment rate 7% or so it'll probably end up at 15% but
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:42.280]  it's really going to be more like that 25% a lot of businesses are going to go
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:44.960]  under a lot of banks are going to go under that's a good in a lot of ways
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:49.400]  because businesses get more efficient and consolidate bank a lot of debt gets
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:52.160]  written off the best thing to get happen to the average family is get their
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:55.960]  mortgage written back down to what their damn houses were exactly government
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:59.880]  sort of required gift gift the benefits to the everyday household instead they
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:03.560]  gave the money to the bank quantitative easing went to the banks to keep them
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:07.360]  alive when they should have gone under and the average person should have gotten
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:12.920]  mortgage really exactly and people don't understand that simple simple fact
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:16.600]  that you've got to have that jubilee some time instead they give the gamblers
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:22.360]  at the hedge funds and everybody total carte blanche the henhouse to the
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:25.760]  wolves is what they did the people who created the bubble are getting all the
[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:29.960]  benefits because they can't afford the bubble to burst so you know that that's
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:33.840]  clear to me I think this is going to be clear in the future the key differences
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:37.280]  is I think this stimulus is failing our real estate recovery is failing because
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:42.000]  it wasn't real China is showing real cracks and I'm monitoring China weekly
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.480]  the Sunspot cycle looks like it actually finally peaked later than usual in
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:51.520]  February so that means a crash sooner than later and I just advise people keep

[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:52.720]  company as a private citizen and his dad does not endorse it I mean this is just
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:58.480]  so outrageous that the globalists are involved overthrowing Ukraine and then
[02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:02.280]  they would put his son in as one of the top executives to rake in just
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:06.480]  unbelievable amounts of money and then they criticize Putin for being involved
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:11.520]  in the government investments yeah it's wrong and it's just openly done and now
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:16.360]  we just accept the governing class will own the state-controlled blocks and make
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:20.640]  billions of dollars and just laugh at us and that's not an economy based on
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.200]  products is not or on innovation it's based on Joe Biden's smiley face son I
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:31.640]  mean I look at him and he makes me sick and communism doesn't exist folks it's
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:35.560]  just a thug system where you tell the general public oh you're gonna share
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:39.760]  all the things and we're gonna get the rich people and they go rob the new
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:43.280]  vote rich they go rob the real producers well I'm sure aren't perfect in most
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:48.520]  countries and they replace it with something a hundred times worse you know
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:50.960]  just cuz they're replacing something doesn't mean it's great look at all

[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:29.880]  they're little handheld computers we just joined us we were breaking down the
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:34.280]  fact that it's causing massive increases brain tumors here's some of the
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:40.920]  other news over five billion and counting for Obamacare website see
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:46.800]  cylinder they got in trouble for 500 mil but see if it's a quote website to his
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:51.080]  buddies and former members of the administration why five billion can be
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:57.200]  spent on something that doesn't work if you could build for $100,000 I mean it's
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:02.280]  just everything is a scam everything is a high is a robbery and that's why the
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:05.880]  only thing that has real inflation is luxury items because you got all these
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:09.440]  government corporate people that have stolen most their wealth not to be
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:13.320]  confused with the rest of corporate and business world that develops stuff it's
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:18.760]  two different groups and the government group and the corporations allied with
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:21.360]  it are against the free market group because once they beat that they've
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:25.360]  got total control of all the markets they don't want to compete they want to
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:29.240]  shut down their competition as John D. Rockefeller the first said what
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:36.720]  competition is a sin but it just clicked that this is a scam it's not a screw up
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:39.840]  of course it's not meant to work and from the beginning they wanted to be
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:43.440]  able to deny that I've always said that that's been confirmed that oh you know
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:46.400]  it's not that Obamacare is a scam just the website doesn't work but it was
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:55.920]  another scam to make five billion buh buh billion five buh buh billion I know
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:00.920]  that's obnoxious but has anyone ever heard of a five billion dollar website I
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:06.560]  mean it just hit me how these people are gang raping us I mean I have never even
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:12.880]  imagined I've got such future shock at this where now bad stuff happens in the
[03:02:12.880 --> 03:02:17.920]  future I'm just ready for it I am I am an idiot I mean I just looked at this
[03:02:17.920 --> 03:02:20.920]  headline it's off this morning that didn't click and then I looked at it I
[03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:25.280]  went when it was a billion dollars six months ago it was a big deal at this
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:31.080]  rate in a year it'll be 10 15 billion dollars what how about a trillion hell
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:35.840]  if you'll pay 15 billion for a website or five billion why not 15 trillion how
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.600]  about 89 quadrillion how about sickle zapples nibbles nibble gulag
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:46.400]  block a blocky and they got numbers that sound like that how about we put
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:50.120]  87,000 trillion zeros on the end of it how about we give everything in the
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:54.000]  world for the makers of the website because no one seems to care that the
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.160]  people involved in it work for Obama and that's a giant scam robbing the hell
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:09.160]  out of us I cannot believe that just hit me I mean five billion dollars they are
[03:03:09.160 --> 03:03:12.960]  taking people's houses poor people everywhere that can't pay all the taxes
