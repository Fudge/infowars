[00:58.960 --> 01:02.640]  going to talk also about the it actually goes much longer than a hundred
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.280]  years this kind of oppression from central banks what he talks about in his
[01:07.280 --> 01:11.760]  documentary it's a wonderful documentary i've seen the entire thing and it's a
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.560]  anybody that loves history anybody that's interested in money anybody that

[01:19.560 --> 01:23.600]  documentary we're going to talk to him about the history of money as well as
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.800]  the future of money and that's going to be coming up later on in the show so
[01:28.800 --> 01:32.400]  we also want to take some of your calls we're going to be talking to as I said
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.520]  and say good to you already and Paul Joseph Watson and we're going to take
[01:36.520 --> 01:39.240]  some of your calls and get some of your comments about special reports they've
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.840]  got coming our way now we just had an election we had actually in Texas we
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.360]  just had our first racist election that's right we used voter IDs actually
[01:50.360 --> 01:56.000]  photo voter IDs can you imagine that we actually required people to look at it
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.160]  an interesting thing is that we actually had about twice as many voters in Texas
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.520]  even though that was supposed to suppress turnout it actually didn't
[02:05.520 --> 02:11.480]  suppress turnout we had a lot of voters in Texas show up but you know showing a
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.160]  photo ID that's not really a racist thing is it is that really a racist thing
[02:16.160 --> 02:21.160]  the same laws that the Department of Justice Eric Holder is coming after
[02:21.160 --> 02:26.720]  Texas as well as North Carolina because they're requiring photo ID and yet they
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.960]  allow it in Indiana and many other states have exactly the same laws but
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.960]  they're coming after Texas and North Carolina why well they say that because
[02:35.960 --> 02:39.440]  these states are in the South because they're part of the old Confederacy that
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.880]  therefore these laws must be racist laws it's absolute nonsense I can tell you
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.280]  coming from North Carolina I had a friend of my brother-in-law's tell him
[02:50.280 --> 02:53.760]  that he went to vote and of course in North Carolina you would in the past just
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.720]  show up and give them a name and an address and they look it up well anybody
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.520]  can look up a name and address in a phone book so you can basically go in and
[03:00.520 --> 03:03.880]  vote the phone book and they give you plenty of time to do it too there's a
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.600]  long it's not just one election day of course that was another reform that we
[03:07.600 --> 03:12.200]  got was extending the election periods not just absentee ballots but you have a
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.200]  very long election period so dishonest person can go in and vote often and vote
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.840]  early as they say well my friend went in to vote and he gave them his name and
[03:22.840 --> 03:26.560]  address and they said that you've already voted today he said no they can't be
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.120]  there oh no you voted and your I think it was mother voted she was at the same
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.680]  address and she had deceased so you know both he and his dead mother had
[03:36.680 --> 03:43.000]  already voted that day now did he turn that in as a voter fraud complaint no he
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.760]  didn't have the time to bother with it he didn't want to come on the show and
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.360]  talk about it that happens though but people don't want to take time out of
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.000]  their life to pursue this and so what we hear from the Board of Elections is
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.240]  well it's not really a problem because it isn't happening it is happening it's
[03:57.240 --> 04:01.920]  very easy to happen it's not an oppressive thing to have voter ID as a
[04:01.920 --> 04:07.000]  matter of fact here in Texas you got seven choices of photo ID things like a
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.600]  driver's license a military ID or a passport it's not an oppressive or
[04:12.600 --> 04:18.360]  racist thing to require an ID a picture ID a lot of places require that just to
[04:18.360 --> 04:24.400]  cash a check or to do a transaction in a retail place we've also got other
[04:24.400 --> 04:28.320]  election results that are coming in you know I like to call these unelection
[04:28.320 --> 04:32.600]  results because you know an election you get to make a choice but not in the
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.120]  unelection and we're gonna talk about that right after the break we'll tell

[08:16.200 --> 08:30.160]  Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.280]  love that bumper if you haven't seen that you need to take a look at that on
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.960]  video they did a great job of retro bumper there as well as Alex kind of
[08:38.960 --> 08:44.720]  going into this Pokemon thing that he does there but not in real life so we're
[08:44.720 --> 08:48.800]  just talking before the break about how we just had our first racist election
[08:48.800 --> 08:54.080]  here in Texas that's right we had voter ID photo IDs like you have to show when
[08:54.080 --> 08:58.080]  you're cashing a check in most places and everybody said that's going to suppress
[08:58.080 --> 09:04.040]  voter turnout and yet we had a two-fold increase in voter turnout didn't happen
[09:04.040 --> 09:09.840]  and these are the same laws that many other states have Indiana several states
[09:09.840 --> 09:15.880]  in the Northeast have enacted photo ID photo ID laws and yet in Texas and in
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.880]  North Carolina Attorney General Eric Holder is coming after those state laws
[09:20.880 --> 09:25.200]  accusing them of being racist and that simply isn't the case as I mentioned
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.400]  before the break I know personally of someone who went to vote in North
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.480]  Carolina where when there were no voter ID laws and was told that he had already
[09:35.480 --> 09:39.000]  voted along with the dead relative that lived at the same address but you know I
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.920]  think the real story here is the unelection that is going on and we're
[09:43.920 --> 09:47.760]  getting returns from the unelection every day just a couple of days ago we
[09:47.760 --> 09:53.280]  learned that 900,000 people in California were unelected from their health care plan
[09:53.280 --> 09:59.160]  they didn't get a choice in that we now we find out that in Colorado 250,000
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.240]  people have been canceled from their health care plans that's kind of the
[10:03.240 --> 10:06.440]  unelection isn't it you know you were told that you could keep your health
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.240]  care plan you had picked out what you wanted can't you make a decision about
[10:11.240 --> 10:15.360]  your own life you know we're supposed to be able to make decisions to elect
[10:15.360 --> 10:21.040]  people to rule over us like kings and tyrants but we can't be allowed to make
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.120]  decisions about what our health care is going to be evidently according to
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.920]  Obama that's not really going too well he got skewered pretty well at the
[10:29.920 --> 10:37.400]  country music awards last night they had a couple of country western singers
[10:37.400 --> 10:42.720]  Brad Paisley and Kerry Underwood and they quipped I started signing up last
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.240]  Thursday and I'm almost done so I don't know that's pretty good turnaround they
[10:48.240 --> 10:51.920]  shouldn't be complaining about that we've also kind of got some returns from
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.680]  zombie elections we find out that in Washington State we had two dead
[10:56.680 --> 11:01.400]  candidates are winning their election races and I guess that really kind of
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.360]  works if you've got people who are dead voting you wouldn't you expect to vote
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.520]  for dead candidates who come up in the new party the dead party maybe the
[11:09.520 --> 11:12.400]  ungrateful dead I guess we're not grateful enough for what Obama has done
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.560]  for us with health care another sad thing that came out of the election
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.760]  results was the 22 million dollar propaganda campaign that Monsanto ran
[11:21.760 --> 11:27.960]  as Anthony Gutiarty reports on info wars and basically they outspent the
[11:27.960 --> 11:34.400]  opposition yet again on just an honest labeling campaign for GMO wouldn't you
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.440]  like to know what's in your food why can't we know what's in our food I guess
[11:40.440 --> 11:46.360]  like laws and sausage we're not allowed to know what's in our soda pop either we
[11:46.360 --> 11:49.720]  don't want to know what goes in there because if you knew what went into laws
[11:49.720 --> 11:53.200]  sausages and soda pop you probably wouldn't want to have anything to do with
[11:53.200 --> 12:01.560]  any of those and this happens over and over again that we get outspent and
[12:01.560 --> 12:07.120]  people are very easily swayed if they're see commercial after commercial
[12:07.120 --> 12:13.440]  obviously Mike Adams has a article that he put out after the election talking
[12:13.440 --> 12:18.560]  about that and saying over and over again we're getting taken out at these
[12:18.560 --> 12:24.680]  simple issues of just letting people know what's in their food and he pointed
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.560]  out that we need to change our strategy it's a very much we're trying to go
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.200]  against these people in their strength we can't out PR them we can't out
[12:36.200 --> 12:41.080]  advertise them and he says we need to go to some kind of an asymmetrical warfare
[12:41.080 --> 12:44.800]  and he's not talking about actually getting violent but he's talking about
[12:44.800 --> 12:48.520]  how we need to not you said the people that are running these campaigns are
[12:48.520 --> 12:51.840]  kind of nice there's a lot of areas that they don't really want to go and and
[12:51.840 --> 12:56.560]  Mike is alluding to something that he's got coming down the road but just in
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.480]  general we noticed this that you know if you've got a bear coming at you like
[13:01.480 --> 13:05.960]  I've talked about before back in North Carolina they tell you to throw sticks at
[13:05.960 --> 13:09.960]  the bear they tell you to yell and shout at the bear they tell you to look
[13:09.960 --> 13:14.400]  aggressive look big they don't tell you to say nice bear go away tell you to get
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.160]  really nice and soft because or to run away from it right you do that your
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.360]  history so you have to basically get in their faces the same sort of thing that
[13:23.360 --> 13:28.160]  Alex did on Pierce Morgan a lot of people like that of course there are
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.960]  people who didn't like that because they didn't like what Alex was saying but it
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.320]  was a very powerful thing to see someone not just engage in an intellectual
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.280]  debate but to actually get up and be passionate about freedom and that's what
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.840]  we need to see we need to see people passionate about freedom we need to show
[13:45.840 --> 13:50.440]  the effects of GMO we've got to show these pictures of the rats with massive
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.200]  tumors I mean we need to get tough with this instead of just being nice
[13:54.200 --> 14:00.040]  sometimes I'm accused of being too nice and too too soft on things we need
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.240]  people like Alex that are going to get out there and shout with passion and we
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.080]  need to get on that with the GMO because as I said they're they're they're
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.560]  taking us out because they can outspend us with PR now along the lines of
[14:13.560 --> 14:18.160]  Obamacare we have this strange thing of this this couple in Brooklyn that are
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.480]  going to get divorced so they can save money so they can afford health
[14:22.480 --> 14:26.640]  insurance you know I think instead of them divorcing we need to look at ways
[14:26.640 --> 14:32.560]  that we can divorce Obama or at least go into some kind of a legal separation
[14:32.560 --> 14:36.240]  and I think there's people who are coming up with that certainly as far as the
[14:36.240 --> 14:41.200]  NSA stuff goes we've got a lot of people that are coming up with market
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.280]  solutions to the invasions of privacy that have been going on now this has
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.400]  revealed several months ago and do you see anybody in Congress doing anything
[14:49.400 --> 14:54.040]  about it me neither but there are people in the tech community that have been
[14:54.040 --> 14:58.400]  busy about this on a lot of different fronts we've got the founder of Lava
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.920]  Bit and if you remember Lava Bit was the the email provider for Ed Snowden and
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.800]  the feds came to him and wanted encrypted emails that belonged to Ed Snowden
[15:08.800 --> 15:14.280]  and rather than turn them over he shut down his entire service and the same
[15:14.280 --> 15:18.640]  thing happened with Silent Circle that was run by Phil Zimmerman he's the guy
[15:18.640 --> 15:22.920]  that created PGP you may remember PGP that's been around a very very long time
[15:22.920 --> 15:27.400]  that's been around since the the internet was in its infancy I always
[15:27.400 --> 15:34.120]  found it clumsy to use and so I never really used PGP and but both of those
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.800]  services shut down and now they're looking at coming up with something called
[15:37.800 --> 15:43.280]  dark mail which they believe is going to be a solution to the privacy to the
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.760]  snooping and he had an interesting quote Levenson did he said if you knew
[15:46.760 --> 15:52.080]  what I know about email you might not use it it's kind of like what I mentioned
[15:52.080 --> 15:55.880]  before you know if you know what goes into into sausage and then the
[15:55.880 --> 15:58.760]  legislation you wouldn't want to have anything to do with either one of those
[15:58.760 --> 16:03.080]  as Bismarck said now he's not only coming up with dark mail but there's also
[16:03.080 --> 16:07.280]  projects out there Cody Wilson who did the 3d printable gun has got dark wallet
[16:07.280 --> 16:13.640]  which is a way to to keep your anonymity a little bit stronger protection
[16:13.640 --> 16:17.760]  for your anonymity within Bitcoin as you put things in your wallet and there
[16:17.760 --> 16:23.280]  are ways that people can can discover your wallet when the FBI confiscated the
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.800]  coins from Silk Road when they shut it down they got about 26,000 coins that
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.040]  was identified by someone in the Bitcoin community so now when those coins are
[16:33.040 --> 16:37.600]  spent you know that they're coming from the FBI they label that wallet dark wall
[16:37.600 --> 16:40.880]  so there's ways that they can do that if someone makes a connection to you then
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.440]  basically you lose that anonymity they're coming up with a new way to keep
[16:45.440 --> 16:48.800]  that private called dark wallet and of course there's another program you might
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.800]  want to know about safe slinger that's a free text security program that is
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.160]  available for free with iPhone and with Android I've got that that's actually a
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.680]  very interesting program because you basically get get with someone in
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.360]  person and you compare things that are on your two phones and you get matches on
[17:08.360 --> 17:12.360]  those two phones and that's the way you set up your your keys between those two
[17:12.360 --> 17:15.360]  people so you're not transmitting anything at all in the clear you're
[17:15.360 --> 17:19.040]  kind of doing it there where you're standing next to each other the free
[17:19.040 --> 17:22.440]  market is going to come up with solutions to this of tyranny and this
[17:22.440 --> 17:25.720]  oppression I don't think we're going to see it from the government certainly not
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.520]  going to see it from Washington they just keep on doing the same thing there's
[17:29.520 --> 17:33.480]  no legislation being brought out by anyone that I'm aware of that's going
[17:33.480 --> 17:37.160]  to rain any of this stuff in and every day we get more revelations about what
[17:37.160 --> 17:40.680]  the government's doing today we find from the New York Times that CIA is said
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.640]  to be paying AT&T for call data now here's the interesting thing about that
[17:45.640 --> 17:52.080]  what they say is that under a voluntary contract and not under subpoena that AT&T
[17:52.080 --> 17:55.880]  is cooperating with them so they're not getting subpoenas not getting court orders
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.160]  they're just doing it voluntarily the reason they can do that is because the
[18:00.160 --> 18:04.800]  government maintains the idea that if you give your information to a third
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.160]  party like to a phone company or to an internet provider then that third party
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.080]  can voluntarily turn over your private information and they don't need a search
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.680]  warrant in other words if they would have come directly to you they would need
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.320]  a search warrant but if they get it from somebody that you gave it to they're
[18:22.320 --> 18:26.760]  saying that they don't need a search warrant that's one of the major reasons
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.400]  that they're coming up with CISPA is to give litigation protection to these
[18:30.400 --> 18:34.720]  companies because they've essentially betrayed their trust to you even though
[18:34.720 --> 18:37.560]  they may have it and probably do have it buried somewhere and they're
[18:37.560 --> 18:43.400]  constantly changing terms of and services conditions still what they're
[18:43.400 --> 18:46.680]  doing is they're cooperating with the government and they still have some
[18:46.680 --> 18:50.360]  legal exposure in that so that's one of the things that CISPA was about was
[18:50.360 --> 18:54.480]  about giving these large corporations legal immunity from lawsuits because they
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.280]  violate your property your privacy turning over your information
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.520]  voluntarily to the government so we see that the CIA is doing that now with AT&T
[19:02.520 --> 19:06.480]  no big surprise there we also see though that the inventor of the worldwide web
[19:06.480 --> 19:13.560]  is criticizing the NSA over privacy breaches this is a story from that just
[19:13.560 --> 19:19.040]  broke today this is coming from the telegraph and this is the exactly the
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.120]  sort of thing we're seeing this is where our hope for privacy lies in the
[19:23.120 --> 19:28.080]  future we can't really divorce Obama and these other guys because they're kind
[19:28.080 --> 19:32.520]  of running these crooked elections but we can get a legal separation we can
[19:32.520 --> 19:37.120]  legally move ourselves away from these guys and there are a lot of people who
[19:37.120 --> 19:40.440]  are very angry very upset now that they see these Snowden revelations and
[19:40.440 --> 19:46.080]  they're going to keep offering solutions to us in the private sector where we can
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.840]  get another internet that's separate from it I don't think that the bricks
[19:50.840 --> 19:54.440]  internet number two from Russia and China I don't think that's gonna offer any
[19:54.440 --> 19:58.120]  privacy but we're gonna see what happens with these private ones we'll be right
[19:58.120 --> 20:03.440]  back every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.300]  uncertain future nothing can ensure your family security like an Atlas

[24:14.720 --> 24:19.320]  be joined here at the bottom of the hour with Paul Joseph Watson from England
[24:19.320 --> 24:24.440]  and we're gonna be talking about his article today about guy calling for
[24:24.440 --> 24:29.200]  forced abortions but there's a story that's going on here in Texas and I
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.440]  interviewed the fellow last Friday on the Info Wars Nightly News Mark Crutcher
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.480]  from Life Dynamics they broke this story back in May and so far nothing has
[24:40.480 --> 24:44.440]  happened with it they filmed let's take a look at what some of these witnesses
[24:44.440 --> 24:49.760]  in an abortion actually there's a clinic workers that have witnessed live babies
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.520]  being murdered by an abortionist they're exactly like the Kermit Gosnell case and
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.760]  let's look at what they had to say this is a short clip here you see the baby
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.440]  alive yes sir and him him to kill that baby outside the one yes sir and this
[25:05.440 --> 25:08.760]  would be done by jamming some sort of instrument into the either the eye or
[25:08.760 --> 25:15.840]  or a spot or a twitch actually twisting the head off the neck kind of with his
[25:15.840 --> 25:20.640]  own bare hands and you saw that happen yes sir so he would twist the head of
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.540]  sorry sometimes he would go through the stomach as well sometimes he would do
[25:25.540 --> 25:31.520]  what he would like force it through the stomach the the instrument for the is it
[25:31.520 --> 25:40.040]  be yours twist it yeah anything that he can get to the fastest like she said
[25:40.040 --> 25:45.440]  the umbilical he's probably perforating the umbilical cord I normally saw you
[25:45.440 --> 25:49.580]  the snippet of the spine or the introduction of the instrument in the
[25:49.580 --> 25:55.560]  soft spot of the fetus normally or twisting of the neck remember he would
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.320]  put like his finger yeah or his finger yeah he took his finger on the other
[26:00.320 --> 26:10.120]  throat yeah I have watched that several times and I cannot get used to that that
[26:10.120 --> 26:17.000]  is that is essentially the same thing that Kermit Gosnell was convicted to
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.480]  life in prison for and several of his workers co-workers there at that clinic
[26:22.480 --> 26:27.520]  and as life dynamics has pointed out if you are a worker in one of these clinics
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.360]  and you don't come forward and put this out there you are an accessory to murder
[26:31.360 --> 26:37.920]  and we've already seen that happen when the Kermit Gosnell case now this was
[26:37.920 --> 26:43.000]  just a clip of the testimony that they had they had the full testimony and they
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.600]  sent that to several law enforcement sources so they could see the unedited
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.960]  testimony they sent it to the homicide division of the Houston police department
[26:51.960 --> 26:56.840]  they sent it to the Texas Medical Board they sent it to the Texas Department of
[26:56.840 --> 27:02.680]  State Health Services and they sent it to some state legislators and 20 Texas
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.760]  lawmakers sent letters to these people saying that they wanted an
[27:06.760 --> 27:10.960]  investigation and yet here we are about five or six months later that was in May
[27:10.960 --> 27:16.640]  we're now in November nothing has been done yet it's kind of like the Sherlock
[27:16.640 --> 27:21.800]  Holmes story the dog that didn't bark and so the question is why is there no
[27:21.800 --> 27:27.560]  investigation going on there's connections between the mayor of
[27:27.560 --> 27:33.760]  Houston and Planned Parenthood her partner her she's openly homosexual her
[27:33.760 --> 27:40.760]  partner is a is very high up in the Planned Parenthood and also part of the
[27:40.760 --> 27:45.240]  there's some issues with campaign finance that I'm not sure if those were
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.920]  vetted out or if they're still under investigation but this article there was
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.360]  a lot of coverage of it in May when it happened because that they released this
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.800]  information right after the Gosnell trial and it was picked up by the Daily
[27:58.800 --> 28:01.960]  Mail and others the Daily Mail went the headline second house of horror
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.320]  abortion clinic where doctor twisted heads off of fetuses and next with his
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.440]  bare hands is investigated in Texas well it's not clear that it is being
[28:10.440 --> 28:14.400]  investigated in Texas scroll down to that article guys take a look at this
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.240]  abortion clinic and I've every time you see an abortion clinic this thing is
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.600]  set up it looks like some kind of a dark prison you can look at this on Google
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.920]  Street view that's what they embedded in the article metal gate around it
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.120]  concrete bunker-like building with a few windows most of the time they don't
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.960]  even have windows on the first floor so you can't see in it's a very very dark
[28:38.960 --> 28:44.680]  thing now a couple weeks after they put this out there was a reaction Houston
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.240]  Chronicle came out and said their headline was anti-abortion group targets
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.120]  doctor some call it a witch hunt and they had a quote in there now listen to
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.200]  this quote and consider the source this is from Amy Miller the founder of Whole
[28:59.200 --> 29:04.080]  Woman's Health which operates five abortion clinics in Texas she said you
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.360]  have to consider the source and the motivations you have to know it is a
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.960]  political tool with an agenda now Amy Miller who runs five abortion clinics
[29:12.960 --> 29:16.760]  she wouldn't have any motivations in this which he and calling it a witch hunt
[29:16.760 --> 29:23.160]  she wouldn't have any kind of agenda which he it's a very very sick thing but
[29:23.160 --> 29:29.160]  it's becoming socially acceptable for people to talk about not only abortions
[29:29.160 --> 29:34.920]  but to talk about forced abortions forced sterilization and we're gonna
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.360]  have we're gonna be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about the article that's
[29:38.360 --> 29:42.920]  on info wars today about that and about many other subjects when we come back
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.360]  it's something we all need to think about and I think when you see a partial
[29:47.360 --> 29:50.120]  birth abortion you see something like this it really makes you think we're on
[29:50.120 --> 29:58.280]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:11.200 --> 33:17.320]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[33:17.320 --> 33:21.400]  GCN radio network
[33:24.200 --> 33:28.880]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight billion for Alex and we're
[33:28.880 --> 33:33.280]  joined right now with Paul Joseph Watson from England one of our info wars
[33:33.280 --> 33:37.080]  staff writers I'm sure you've read his fine articles that he puts out all the
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.200]  time one of the key writers that we have here we've got a great staff on the
[33:41.200 --> 33:46.400]  website as you all know I'm sure Paul are you there yes good to be here David
[33:46.400 --> 33:50.440]  hey it's nice to talk to you finally I we've sent emails back and forth but I've
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.920]  never actually talked to you in the past so I don't know if you heard this story
[33:54.920 --> 33:58.920]  that I was just talking about that's happening in Houston we have another
[33:58.920 --> 34:03.760]  Kermit Gosnell situation we've got a doctor who has been accused of his
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.920]  staff of twisting the heads off of babies that are born live and yet here we
[34:08.920 --> 34:13.600]  are about six months after these revelations came out and no investigation
[34:13.600 --> 34:19.000]  is being conducted as far as we know I mean it's really amazing even the
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.920]  people I talked to who are against abortion they then either meet people
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.160]  directly come into contact with hospitals that provide carry out abortions
[34:28.160 --> 34:32.840]  and that turns them anti-abortion simply through seeing the horrific procedures
[34:32.840 --> 34:37.320]  because there's this idea that you know people think it's like putting down an
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.200]  animal or something it's not it's completely horrific if you actually look
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.560]  at the procedures that they have to go through to actually abort babies and you
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.600]  know in terms of Gosnell and people like him he kind of drew enjoyment out of it
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.600]  and even the people blowing the whistle on him they were involved in it as well
[34:54.600 --> 35:00.280]  but now we've got a guy who is a prominent activist gay rights activist who
[35:00.280 --> 35:05.000]  appeared on Australian television and he openly advocated that abortion be made
[35:05.000 --> 35:12.160]  mandatory for 30 years forced abortion and I think we've got the clip yeah
[35:12.160 --> 35:18.360]  let's play that clip do you each think would have the greatest potential to
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.200]  change the world for the better if it were implemented Dan let's start with
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.080]  you oh my god that's you got to give us a minute to think about that population
[35:28.080 --> 35:37.280]  control there's too many goddamn people on the planet you know I'm pro-choice
[35:37.280 --> 35:39.520]  I believe that women should have the right to control their bodies sometimes in
[35:39.520 --> 35:42.520]  my darker moments I'm anti-choice I think abortion should be mandatory for
[35:42.520 --> 35:51.080]  about 30 years that's a dangerous idea she wanted a dangerous idea so throw a
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.480]  chair on me that is very dangerous idea I actually have to think about it for a
[35:54.480 --> 36:00.320]  minute wow you know they can talk about that in the abstract but but I've got an
[36:00.320 --> 36:03.120]  idea I've got an idea that's pretty dangerous so we actually had a revolution
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.240]  over that we have a creator that endows us with certain inalienable rights like
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.600]  life and liberty and on the Jefferson who wrote that also said the God who gave
[36:11.600 --> 36:15.240]  us life gave us liberty at the same time the hand of force can destroy but not
[36:15.240 --> 36:19.840]  destroying them you cannot have any freedom if you're going to allow people
[36:19.840 --> 36:24.200]  to at some point in time kill other people because then it you get on this
[36:24.200 --> 36:28.520]  slippery slope as to when you can kill people when can you euthanize people when
[36:28.520 --> 36:35.480]  can you abort people well and you know how that is carried out in countries that
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.320]  do provide forced abortion is again horrific I mean look at China they
[36:40.320 --> 36:45.080]  literally kidnap women off the streets or out of their own beds beat them up
[36:45.080 --> 36:50.600]  forcibly drag them to state hospitals inject them with abortion inducing drugs
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.840]  and they have the forced abortion it's completely horrific and this is basically
[36:55.840 --> 36:59.840]  what he's calling for and this is not some you know guy on the sidelines he's
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.760]  quite prominent he's got 170,000 followers on Twitter he's regularly on
[37:04.760 --> 37:11.800]  HBO real time with with Bill Ma this is a prominent guy imagine the outrage if a
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.880]  prominent anti-abortion activist had called for all homosexuals to be killed
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.360]  that would be a massive massive outrage this happened three four days ago
[37:22.360 --> 37:28.720]  barely a whimper barely anything and we can get into the moral outrage in a
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.480]  minute but it's this notion about overpopulation which again and again we
[37:33.480 --> 37:38.240]  have to restate is a complete myth it's it's a bankrupt argument both
[37:38.240 --> 37:44.600]  scientifically and factually the replacement rate for humans is 2.1
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.480]  children if we don't achieve that rate globally then the human population will
[37:50.480 --> 37:56.720]  eventually die out already in half the world we're below 2.1 I mean look at
[37:56.720 --> 38:04.160]  Europe for example Italy is 1.4 Spain 1.48 Germany 1.36 even in
[38:04.160 --> 38:10.960]  America it's down to 1.89 which again is below the replacement rate a couple has
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.120]  to have 2.1 children for the replacement rate of human population to be kept
[38:16.120 --> 38:20.320]  stable if it's below that then we're in decline and there's a lot of factors they
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.920]  come into that it's not just economic factors it's also things like pollutants
[38:24.920 --> 38:30.680]  and the in the water or plastic BPA that lower fertility rates well precisely
[38:30.680 --> 38:34.600]  that there are a lot of different factors that contribute to it the general
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.840]  theme is what they call demographic transition which is this shift from
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.400]  high birth rate and high death rate which obviously happened during times of
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.680]  height and disease to low birth rate and low death rate which is the phase that
[38:49.680 --> 38:54.000]  we've now definitely shifted into so even in countries like Brazil India and
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.400]  Indonesia where people think that the population is skyrocketing beyond all
[38:58.400 --> 39:04.080]  control there in fact now also falling below the rate of fertility and the UN
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.240]  zone figures this is not info wars.com this is not some right-wing think tank
[39:09.240 --> 39:13.200]  that's come out with these figures this is the UN population fund their own
[39:13.200 --> 39:18.960]  figures show world population will get to about 9 billion by 2050 after that it
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.080]  will start to decline dramatically and the problem in the future is going to
[39:23.080 --> 39:28.680]  be pop underpopulation not overpopulation right so any policy or any
[39:28.680 --> 39:34.560]  advocacy based on the justification of preventing overpopulation is completely
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.800]  fraudulent and you see in Russia they've figured that out they're actually trying
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.120]  to give bonuses to people who have children Putin is but away from that
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.160]  away from the Malthusian nonsense that's been disproven over and over again
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.560]  back to the moral issue I guess it kind of comes back to the point where it's
[39:51.560 --> 39:54.720]  very easy for somebody to talk about population control in the abstract
[39:54.720 --> 39:58.000]  because they don't really see what's happening as you mentioned people that
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.280]  you know that have gone to abortion clinics and have seen it it takes it
[40:01.280 --> 40:05.920]  away from the abstract it's kind of like I think so many people in the abstract
[40:05.920 --> 40:09.840]  they're not really worried about the NSA listening to their data but you take
[40:09.840 --> 40:14.520]  that situation where Tom Mabe the comedian went out with a boom mic and
[40:14.520 --> 40:20.280]  a NSA or CIA type of suit you know black suit with sunglasses and he starts
[40:20.280 --> 40:23.760]  recording people's conversation standing in front of them with a boom mic they
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.320]  instantly see that as an offense and I think people obviously understand that
[40:29.320 --> 40:33.000]  when these children are born alive that that's a horrible thing what was
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.640]  described that this doctor was doing and you also see that happening with
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.560]  partial birth abortion where they would partially take the the child that could
[40:40.560 --> 40:44.560]  survive on its own and an abort the child and call it an abortion because
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.880]  part of the baby is still inside of the mother you get into this slippery slope
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.480]  area where are you going to say that it's a murder if it if the baby is
[40:53.480 --> 40:56.600]  partially inside the mother if it's totally removed from the mother if it's
[40:56.600 --> 41:00.800]  full-term at what point do you decide that it's murder and that's the problem
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.840]  it's kind of the same thing that we see happening in in GITMO there was an
[41:04.840 --> 41:11.080]  article today from Russia today and and this fellow was talking about how he was
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.720]  tortured in GITMO and he said it was an area without any laws and that's what
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.680]  happens when you give people the capability to torture and to kill then
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.720]  you've got a situation where it just it comes a situational ethics where they
[41:26.720 --> 41:32.400]  can change the situation they can do that to anybody yeah and it's it's n
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.880]  justifies the means isn't it it's this whole idea of disrespecting life and
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.120]  frowning upon life and thinking that life has no meaning no value which is
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.000]  what happens in China and increasingly in Western countries where you see you
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.640]  know babies by the side of the road or young children who have been run over
[41:49.640 --> 41:54.160]  by cars and people just walk past ignoring them as they lie in the gutter
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.360]  bleeding that's what it all leads towards and it's interesting with this
[41:58.360 --> 42:03.720]  whole overpopulation thing because I mean for example I was at a safari park
[42:03.720 --> 42:09.840]  near where I live recently and they were doing a cheetah demonstration and it
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.440]  turned out that the actual safari park was involved with David Attenborough who
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.240]  basically says that humans are a plague and we should stop feeding the third
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.400]  world the old guy theory yeah and the optimum population trust and they were
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.400]  indoctrinating British chill children through this optimum population trust to
[42:28.400 --> 42:34.760]  not have kids of their own in order to save the cheetahs now David how many
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.920]  wild cheetahs live in Britain you probably thought you probably saw them in
[42:40.920 --> 42:46.160]  that park didn't you Paul yeah that was probably half of them but again why are
[42:46.160 --> 42:51.680]  they teaching British kids not to have children to save the cheetahs how on
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.120]  earth are those two linked the decline of cheetah population is due to deforestation
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.400]  which coincidentally a lot of the global warming alarmists are behind with the
[43:01.400 --> 43:06.480]  growing of the biofuel which is causing massive deforestation but they link it
[43:06.480 --> 43:11.680]  to if you know you've got to only have one child or don't have any children at
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.720]  all in Britain which also has a fertility rate under 2.1 so we're dying
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.400]  off as well even with the immigration they're saying you can't have kids either
[43:21.400 --> 43:27.520]  to save the cheetahs they really hammer that there I remember taking my
[43:27.520 --> 43:33.440]  family to London about 15 years ago and going to the Children's Museum and they
[43:33.440 --> 43:37.840]  had a loop talking about exactly what you're talking about a loop it was
[43:37.840 --> 43:42.240]  essentially the Gaia theory you know where mankind is a virus on the planet
[43:42.240 --> 43:46.120]  surface and they just played this all these kids are up there playing at the
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.680]  highest level of floor they had a playing play area for the kids and they've got
[43:50.680 --> 43:55.520]  this large television set just playing this propaganda film over and over again
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.040]  telling them that humans are plague overpopulation is destroying all the
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.920]  other life forms and we need to get rid of the humans I mean it's absolute
[44:03.920 --> 44:10.400]  eugenicism it is but total population control even they must know that it's
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.080]  completely fraudulent they must know the real science which I just talked about
[44:14.080 --> 44:19.400]  so it got it even goes beyond like racist eugenicist beliefs about culling the
[44:19.400 --> 44:25.760]  herd to the point where the elite actors if they totally have hate and contempt
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.680]  for humanity like there's some kind of invading alien species that's being
[44:30.680 --> 44:36.040]  brought here to wipe us all out it's I mean it's difficult to put it into logic
[44:36.040 --> 44:39.720]  because they must know that it's complete nonsense and yet they still push
[44:39.720 --> 44:44.880]  it they indoctrinate the children with this belief this eugenicist belief yeah
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.200]  exactly now you got another article you want to talk about you told me that you
[44:49.200 --> 44:53.800]  told me bills in Europe of course are skyrocketing because of carbon taxes and
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.920]  other regulations it's another part of just the entire oppressive
[44:58.920 --> 45:03.120]  infrastructure of changing not only the number of people that we've got but the
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.800]  quality of everyone's life and really if you look at it's not just a quality of
[45:06.800 --> 45:10.800]  life issue but it is also an issue of how long you're going to live if you look
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.400]  at cheap available energy that's a very good predictor of lifespan for a
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.520]  community well yes you know co2 emissions are directly linked to
[45:21.520 --> 45:26.280]  prosperity to quality of life which is what this post industrial revolution is
[45:26.280 --> 45:30.920]  all about recently in Britain and in Europe in general people are paying 17
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.400]  percent more for their energy bills there was this big controversy about the
[45:34.400 --> 45:39.160]  energy companies raising their electricity and gas prices and the
[45:39.160 --> 45:43.320]  explanation given for that was that it was these greedy energy companies
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.840]  hoarding all the profit it was this socialistic explanation but what the news
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.600]  media especially the BBC didn't explain is the fact that these energy companies
[45:52.600 --> 45:59.760]  are mandated to implement European Union co2 emission targets of 20 percent
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.680]  below 1990 levels and the way they do that is by funding quote renewable energy
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.360]  like wind farms which as we know are completely useless it actually costs
[46:11.360 --> 46:15.440]  more money in public subsidies to keep them running than the actual
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.000]  monetary value of the energy they generate so these energy companies have
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.080]  to pay money to build wind farms meanwhile as in America with the EPA
[46:24.080 --> 46:29.280]  they're being forced to mothball coal plants which provide cheap energy and
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.360]  these costs for renewable energy are being passed on directly to the
[46:34.360 --> 46:40.320]  consumer so it's already a carbon tax by stealth so it's not the greedy energy
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.640]  companies that are doing this they're being mandated by law to enforce
[46:44.640 --> 46:50.480]  European Union co2 emission targets so again it goes back to this this idea of
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.840]  collecting power in the hands of the state socialists will complain and whine
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.560]  all day about high energy bills and they'll blame the greedy companies for
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.800]  it but it's not their fault they're only enforcing what they're mandated to do by
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.520]  the government which is what's causing these energy prices to rise yeah you
[47:09.520 --> 47:13.480]  know renewable energy is a very trendy thing and it's a great idea when you do
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.200]  it individually when you do it off the grid if you want to get solar power if
[47:17.200 --> 47:21.480]  you want to get wind power and you can pay the most expensive part of those
[47:21.480 --> 47:25.320]  systems is trying to store the energy so that you have something if you're off
[47:25.320 --> 47:28.800]  the grid you have something when the wind is not blowing or when the sun is
[47:28.800 --> 47:35.280]  not shining it really doesn't work for a major company for the utility companies
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.760]  that are on the grid because they have to store the energy and they can't keep
[47:39.760 --> 47:43.720]  up with the especially for wind power it's constantly if you look at the
[47:43.720 --> 47:48.360]  output it's not a constant output it's constantly changing and it basically is
[47:48.360 --> 47:53.680]  all over the place they built a large wind farm off the coast of Ireland and
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.120]  they thought that if they extended it over a larger area that they would smooth
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.080]  out the peaks in the trough but instead all they got were larger peaks and larger
[48:01.080 --> 48:05.560]  troughs and there's no way to smooth that out you can't have electricity that
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.920]  is that is pulsating up and down over the grid it has to be very stabilized so
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.320]  that what they wind up doing is cycling these existing coal plants as if they
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.840]  were some kind of an AC power source and it increases the carbon output of the
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.760]  of the coal plants by making them turn on and turn off to supplement the power
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.880]  that they're getting from the wind well precisely and I mean look look at what's
[48:31.880 --> 48:35.200]  happening in Spain you've got people who have got solar panels which is all fine
[48:35.200 --> 48:39.440]  and well and now the government is taxing them for generating energy with
[48:39.440 --> 48:44.920]  their own solar panels right they won't let you have self-sufficiency but the
[48:44.920 --> 48:50.120]  point about the energy bills is you know it's not about it's not hitting the
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.240]  corporations the oil and energy companies it's hitting 80 year old
[48:54.240 --> 48:59.000]  pensioners in Europe some of whom are literally gonna freeze to death this
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.040]  winter because they can't afford to pay the bills and it's these green taxes
[49:03.040 --> 49:08.640]  it's carbon taxes by default they didn't have to impose it on you know tax per
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.720]  mile in Europe they're already doing it in America you've got the shale boom
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.520]  which is kind of offsetting it a lot but it's gonna come to America too and
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.640]  again it's about post-industrial revolution it's about a green economy
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.280]  which in Spain has caused a 26 percent unemployment rate 56 percent youth
[49:26.280 --> 49:31.440]  unemployment rate and Obama said that was the model for America so you've got
[49:31.440 --> 49:35.640]  that to look forward to well you know you mentioned the tax per mile now
[49:35.640 --> 49:39.000]  they're starting to talk about that in the US as well so you get people who go
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.400]  out and they buy renewable energy sources like solar and then they get taxed
[49:43.400 --> 49:47.480]  by the Spanish authorities for having solar panels you have people who go out
[49:47.480 --> 49:52.000]  and buy fuel efficient cars and then they change the method of taxation we
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.320]  have a gasoline tax which is basically a use tax it's an anonymous use tax that
[49:57.320 --> 50:00.960]  you don't have to know where you're going or how much you're driving they
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.600]  don't have to track that but it also reflects your use of the road and you
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.680]  can do something to if you're concerned about exhaust emissions for whatever
[50:09.680 --> 50:12.520]  reason you can get a more fuel efficient car but now they're going to penalize the
[50:12.520 --> 50:17.040]  people who've invested in fuel efficient cars well that's that's similar to what's
[50:17.040 --> 50:22.880]  happening in France which is this eco tax on vehicles weighing over 3.5 tons so
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.640]  any vehicle that they're using to transport goods is now being hit with
[50:26.640 --> 50:31.080]  this eco tax they had to temporarily roll it back because this past weekend
[50:31.080 --> 50:35.960]  there were huge riots in Brittany and other areas of France but they're now
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.640]  again taxing as you said for use of vehicles not merely taxed by mile
[50:41.640 --> 50:45.440]  farmers in those areas as well because they're the ones who are really getting
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.680]  hit with it of course it's going to come out in people's food costs and people
[50:48.680 --> 50:51.960]  are going to say oh the greedy farmers just like to talk about the greedy coal
[50:51.960 --> 50:56.600]  companies hang on Paul we're going to be right back right after the break
[51:01.160 --> 51:08.120]  time and time again you need to come here and help us we need assistance please

[54:14.120 --> 54:17.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I'm
[54:17.800 --> 54:22.320]  talking to Paul Joseph Watson and we've been talking about renewable energy and
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.920]  what it's doing to fuel prices in England now I said we would take your
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.120]  calls and we've got a very special caller who always goes to the front of the
[54:30.120 --> 54:33.960]  line that's Alex Jones and he wanted to get in on this renewable energy discussion
[54:33.960 --> 54:40.120]  that we're having Alex are you there for the info wars operation about back in
[54:40.120 --> 54:43.920]  the office but it's listen to the great job you're both involved in it let you
[54:43.920 --> 54:46.920]  get those calls in the segment and then actually they've got a lot of other
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.720]  special reports coming up today with as a good shardy car attention and others
[54:51.720 --> 54:55.640]  and phone calls but listen I just want to make it clear the globalists are all
[54:55.640 --> 55:00.400]  on record I made the film in game about this with their own statements they are
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.520]  creating a post-industrial world on purpose because the mega elite
[55:04.520 --> 55:07.600]  corporations are all exempt from these regulations
[55:07.600 --> 55:12.720]  GE is exempt from the coal regulation that all the other companies aren't all
[55:12.720 --> 55:17.200]  the big companies are exempt from the Obamacare that is the heart of all this
[55:17.200 --> 55:21.800]  that cuts right through all their fake arguments they are conscious criminals
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.360]  consolidating the economy but creating socialism and communism at the grass
[55:26.360 --> 55:32.000]  roots they're also exempt under fascism with diplomatic immunity to make you
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.920]  dependent so they will always raise the taxes and they will always raise the
[55:35.920 --> 55:40.960]  price of energy the ultimate tax it's a form of seeds to where it's impossible
[55:40.960 --> 55:46.560]  to pay and that is how they social engineer it is totally diabolical look
[55:46.560 --> 55:50.160]  at Venezuela going bankrupt with their health care look at you health care
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.640]  going bankrupt but the elites all have their private clinics so so this is the
[55:54.640 --> 55:59.440]  plan if you want to understand it's not socialist mismanagement people wonder
[55:59.440 --> 56:05.400]  why it's so screwed up it couldn't be worse because it's precision military
[56:05.400 --> 56:11.400]  economic warfare on record and that's what they're doing that's why I'm not
[56:11.400 --> 56:14.760]  against people like I don't even think about that they say oh you don't want
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.080]  to accept me teaching your five-year-olds about it it's in all the government
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.760]  documents that we cover in in game 1.5 that they said we're going to teach this
[56:22.760 --> 56:27.920]  and go after heterosexuals of the family and tax the family where you cannot
[56:27.920 --> 56:31.920]  reproduce we're going to add steroids and that's why they have the gay leaders
[56:31.920 --> 56:37.560]  everywhere literally literally I was invited ten years ago to a birthday
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.680]  party of a cousin who's gay and the people all walked up to me bigoted
[56:42.680 --> 56:47.960]  I mean I'm talking at a bar with like a hundred gay people okay and impact all
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.240]  the straight people there and told me it was gross that I had a son and that my
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.000]  wife was pregnant again because she was there in pregnant and they literally ran
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.560]  us out of there they were bigoted I'm not bigoted and I'm sick of it this use
[57:00.560 --> 57:05.360]  a type of biological suicide bombing operation to cut everything off and to
[57:05.360 --> 57:08.640]  teach our kids you know that you don't need to have kids and it's bad and whole
[57:08.640 --> 57:13.040]  food people marched up to my wife probably 15 times and said you shouldn't
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.480]  have three kids they can go to hell I'll have more of my anyway God bless you
[57:18.480 --> 57:21.960]  gentlemen that's what I call them about they are the racists they are the biggest
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.040]  I'm not gonna be average gay person out there I'm talking about the
[57:26.040 --> 57:30.840]  establishment using it as a weapon against humanity God bless you gentlemen
[57:30.840 --> 57:34.880]  and it's not just that they're exempt from the taxes Alex is that look who they
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.560]  want us to pay for indulgences they want us to talk they want to give money to
[57:38.560 --> 57:44.000]  blood and go to alcohol and his partner blood they want us to pay them like a
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.160]  religious indulgence to use energy they want to make everybody renters they
[57:48.160 --> 57:51.680]  don't want anybody to have anything just like the Federal Reserve just like we
[57:51.680 --> 57:56.280]  have to pay them every time a dollar is created every time you use a wad of
[57:56.280 --> 58:02.400]  energy you have to pay blood and gore what do you think about that Paul well
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.280]  I mean that's it I'm going back to Ted Turner you got five kids I mean it's
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.960]  the one child policy for the world and he's got five children the same with
[58:11.960 --> 58:17.040]  Al Gore I think he's got four kids well yeah they're all exempt from it don't
[58:17.040 --> 58:21.040]  worry about that that's right yeah it is cultural Marxism isn't it this whole
[58:21.040 --> 58:26.200]  idea of attacking the family in Western civilization it's about creating the
[58:26.200 --> 58:29.720]  myth that oppression comes from traditional Western institutions and
[58:29.720 --> 58:33.600]  that is naturally oppressive well I go to listen cultural Marxism it goes all
[58:33.600 --> 58:36.760]  the way back to Plato's Republic he wanted to destroy the family because he
[58:36.760 --> 58:40.960]  wanted to make the government strong
[58:42.240 --> 58:49.000]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network

[59:05.520 --> 59:10.600]  always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the
[59:10.600 --> 59:15.360]  same values as their fellow patriots my Patriot supply brings us their

[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.160]  Alex Jones
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.320]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I've
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.880]  got Paul Joseph Watson on the line with me we just had a discussion with Alex
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:41.080]  also talking about the eugenics the forced abortions population control
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.120]  they're being called for the skyrocketing energy prices attacks on the family
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.600]  these are all related aren't they Paul they're all tied together it's part of
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.920]  the post-industrial revolution it's the attack on Western civilization the attack
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.400]  on biblical Christian beliefs which for better or worse have provided stability
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.560]  in the West and now they're trying to overthrow that and as I said before the
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.400]  break it's cultural Marxism to the nth degree that's right and and which we're
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.120]  talking about briefly I mentioned Plato's Republic he wanted to make sure
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.640]  that in his ideal Republic where you're going to have this benevolent dictator
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.320]  presumably he wanted to make sure that there was no family structure so he
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.720]  promoted sexual promiscuity so that nobody would know who their mother and
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.120]  father were and the children would be raised by the state and the children
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.600]  would be loyal to the state not to a family not to a mother and father and
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.080]  that's the same type of program that we see actually put into the government
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.640]  schools that was in the writing of Thomas Dewey and Horace Mann many of the
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.560]  founders of government education in America they were not happy with the
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.560]  way families were raising their children they didn't want them to have these
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.880]  religious values or whatever they wanted to move them into a socialist
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.480]  control where the government told them what to think what to do shaped
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.120]  everything for them the old adage give me a child by the time they're you know
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.200]  up to the age of three their mind for mind for life that type of thing it's
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.720]  similar isn't it to both the communist manifesto and that document which they
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.960]  called the 45 declared goals of communism that was all about weakening the
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.080]  family and also a lot of the cultural aspects that they introduced from the
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.080]  sixties onwards were about that including specifically modern art which it
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.480]  later turned out was funded from the fifties Jackson Pollock and all that
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.040]  crowd by the CIA itself to make art non-political so through a different a
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.920]  variety of different cultural ways they tried to weaken the the fundamental base
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.480]  of western civilization and they're aggressively doing it to this day that's
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.880]  right let's move on to another article that you've got up DHS publicly denies
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.800]  preparation for riots and civil unrest that you've been at the forefront of
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.920]  showing us what the DHS is really preparing for what Homeland Security is
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.920]  doing buying massive amounts of ammunition you went to the fed biz dot op
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.320]  site you showed the actual documents where they're ordering this stuff and
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.560]  there was a lot of pushback on it took a very long time but finally everybody
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:11.120]  started to realize this is real exactly and then the DHS came out a couple of
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.400]  days ago to the international business times and said basically these reports
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.440]  are false they're not preparing for riots their direct quote was this routine
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.160]  acquisition planning is not in response to or anticipation of any potential
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.560]  situation but in their own solicitation documents they said precisely the
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.000]  opposite the well these preparation these preparations are not routine in
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.240]  any way shape or form I mean just the ammunition that they're buying is enough
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.920]  as people pointed out to fight the Iraq war at its peak for 20 years and the
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:46.040]  armed guards 80 million dollars armed guards in New York they said I didn't
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.600]  say it info wars didn't say it the DHS said it was for quote public
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:54.480]  demonstrations and civil disturbances that those were they their words not
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.800]  mine and then with the pepper spray projectiles they said these are just for
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.240]  training purposes they bought 170 17,000 training projectiles they also purchased
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:11.560]  120,000 live projectiles so they're not just for training purposes and again
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.560]  when they bought riot gear back in June the DHS itself admitted that they were
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.480]  for quote riot control situations so they're admitting it's the riot control
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.680]  then publicly months later they come out and say oh it's just routine it's no
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.280]  specific situation again they're lying it says in their own documents that they
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.360]  are for riot control yeah they were telling us that's what hollow point
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.000]  bullets were for and they would go in and cherry pick the very smallest
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.400]  purchases and say there's nothing to worry about Paul it was great talking to

[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.240]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David night filling in for Alex we
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.440]  were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about calls for Malthusian population
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.760]  control and the applause that celebrities get when they call for that
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.200]  and before that I talked about a doctor that we've got here in Houston that is
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.400]  they're trying to get an investigation is not being investigated I wish I could
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.640]  say that he was but there's no evidence that the Houston authorities are
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.000]  actually conducting an investigation but he's been accused by workers in his
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.940]  clinic of killing babies that were born alive twisting the heads off of new
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:03.920]  born babies and so far as we can tell there's no investigation going in Houston
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.480]  about that but that's kind of the topic that we've been on we've been talking
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.840]  about that population control and now we've got Anthony Gutiarty from Story
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.200]  League joining us here and he's got an interesting take on this whole eugenesis
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.000]  bang from reddit tell us about that yeah exactly so just going into this even
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.760]  some of the most hardened listeners right now they might know eugenics by
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.440]  definition means selective breeding but throughout history its implementation
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.840]  has always been to take certain races certain individuals they deemed unfit
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.200]  to breed and sterilize them or kill them off and that even happened in the
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.640]  United States from about 1929 to 1974 admittedly in the open they would go
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.640]  in and break down your door and forcibly sterilize you I mean that's from the
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.320]  Associated Press we're talking about 60,000 people that were forcibly
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:55.560]  sterilized mainly black women and it is actually inherently real racism it's not
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.200]  phony racism like the media uses it's not like this voter ID thing I mean
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.080]  you're not asking for somebody you're not saying that we want to see your photo
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.880]  ID before so we can verify your identity vote you're actually saying we're gonna
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.520]  stop you from reproducing because of who you are now this is kick down your
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.560]  door yeah and inject you and sterilize you and you are unfit to breed you are
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.520]  not a human being with any rights going directly against the Constitution but
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.520]  the reason I get into this specifically is yes we did have that history where
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.480]  60,000 in the United States just after World War II were sterilized in many
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.840]  cases with North Carolina specifically where they awarded the families a mere
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.640]  $50,000 and said we're sorry that we sterilized individuals in your family
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.200]  and kicked down their door and beat them and everything like that sometimes
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.760]  killed them that was their severance package I guess they figured that was a
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.040]  benefit because they one of the tactics that abortionists will use is to tell
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.520]  a woman who's considering an abortion look at how much this child is gonna
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.560]  cost you in your life you can't afford this so I guess if they look at this and
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.440]  say well you know we saved you all this money that you're gonna have to feed
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.440]  this child and put them through college so we saved you all that money so here's
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.760]  your $50,000 now not to have children is ready now to say abortions are good up
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.760]  to age 5 but we're specifically going to get into this amazing revelation here
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.960]  that surprisingly apparently a large percentage of people actually support
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.240]  eugenics in modern day we're talking about forced sterilization of 13 year
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.960]  olds we're talking about saying that Hitler ruined eugenics for the rest of
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.800]  us we're talking about saying eugenics is good because it makes people more
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.800]  handsome we shouldn't let certain people breed we shouldn't let individuals who
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.520]  are susceptible to committing crimes breed and this is on reddit and I'm not
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.840]  against reddit I think it's actually a good hub for you know net internet
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.800]  freedom it's a good hub for alternative news but it's a collective group of
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.600]  individuals reddit is essentially a social community for those who are not
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.440]  aware it's essentially an adaptation let's say of Facebook it's a message
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.040]  board where you post articles and you can comment on them and it's just you know
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.240]  a medley of individuals but we've found that when you're using an anonymous
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:04.600]  username individuals will actually come out and support Hitler and will support
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.600]  you that's a good point yeah programming is so strong on that but first before we
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.760]  can get into that in this segment I want to talk specifically about historically
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.040]  leading up to this how it's already been going on for example we see the US
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.520]  government program that secretly injected citizens with plutonium just to
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.600]  see how it would affect them and how it affect different races of people so
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.360]  specifically I don't know if you're even aware of this David they called it
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.240]  one of the most appalling acts by the United States government even the
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:41.200]  mainstream media they went around in 1945 and secretly injected a 55 a 53-year-old
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.080]  man with 4.7 micrograms of plutonium and just to see what happened they did it
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.840]  with a bunch of others this is a specifically one individual his name
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.560]  was Ebb Cade and what happened was he was blasted with extreme amounts of
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.160]  plutonium and they cut out a piece of his bone without you know any any drugs
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.360]  or anything for sampling they pulled 15 of his teeth in order to test the
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.200]  effects of plutonium and the torture was so bad that he escaped the hospital in
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.560]  the middle of the night and ran away and from the prolonged torture where they
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.200]  just cutting him open just ripping things out of his body to test oh man to
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.280]  see the plutonium effects and say hey how did it affect this man you know how
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.880]  to affect this woman over and over again he escaped and then he eventually died
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.880]  yeah that's what's going on and that was funded by the government they told the
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.120]  doctors hey just don't tell anyone about it we'll give you a major severance
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.240]  package just do this to everyone and they would have people coming in with
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.920]  broken arms saying hey you know my arm is broken or a pregnant woman saying hey
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.360]  you know I'm not feeling too good oh yeah we've got something for that and
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.520]  they inject you with plutonium just to see what happened well you know Anthony
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.440]  it was about a year ago that story broke that in North Carolina right where I
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.760]  had moved from the EPA was grabbing people for they were trying to make a
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.160]  case for stronger regulate regulations of particulate matter and they were
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.840]  putting out ads for people specifically looking for people who had asthma or
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.480]  other breathing irregularities and they were hooking them up to machines that
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:13.480]  were feeding them diesel fumes directly and experimenting on them and a lawsuit
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.320]  was filed and the government said where the government we don't have to really
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.480]  follow those rules they you know they got away with it they didn't you know they
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.560]  didn't stop it they continued doing it and so that's still going on to this
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.600]  very day no it always happens and then like decades later a figure in the
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.200]  United States will apologize for it like Obama will say sorry we secretly
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.480]  injected you with STDs just to see what would happen and the reason we're
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.320]  talking about this is all of this ties into eugenics and let's give it a new
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.680]  term neo eugenics is the new idea here that is old-school Hitlerian style
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.240]  eugenics where it's out in the open going in and forcibly sterilizing people
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.120]  we're gonna get into what these people are saying in the comments with 3,000
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.000]  upvotes about Hitler just ruined eugenics for the rest of us how eugenics
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.440]  isn't even bad it's just been given a bad name and hey Tesla supported it
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.960]  Tesla did actually support it but let's let's get into this so the posts that
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.080]  we're speaking of right now and I only have the printouts I will have a report
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.880]  about this on story leak and infowars.com it's talking about today I
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.600]  learned that Nikola Tesla was in favor of sterilizing criminals and mentally
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.400]  unstable and believe that by 2100 the year 2100 no one who is not a
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.520]  desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. Now there's a bunch
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.720]  of different comments here with major upvotes specifically 2003,000 you know
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.120]  top comments top upvotes and this is a website that gets millions of users a
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.080]  day and again I'm not against the site overall it's just this thread of
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.720]  comments is amazing to me this guy says he's the number I believe is number 3
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:50.120]  comment on there at the majorly upvoted he says Hitler ruined eugenics for the
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:56.880]  rest of us it has 2325 upvotes that's mean 2325 people agree with it and
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.960]  that's not even counting the downvotes. The amazing thing is is that because Tesla
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.400]  was for it or because Hitler was for it I mean you look at this and you evaluate
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:12.000]  it on its own moral grounds you know it doesn't Tesla did electricity he wasn't
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.440]  a moral ethicist and so just because he supported this doesn't make it right but
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.720]  that's the way people think they look at people that they like or people that
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.640]  they don't like and that's what's their comment there's like you know it's
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.120]  programming you're a hundred percent right look at the drama series where they
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.920]  admit that they were given money to support Obamacare and stuff like that
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:33.160]  anything people see on TV they try to be that yeah because that is their only
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.760]  embodiment of social interaction sometimes and they sell personalities
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.800]  that's the way Obama got in because most people liked him he wasn't he had no
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.440]  history nobody knew what he was really where he was coming from well he did
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.320]  have some history in in Chicago and he knew that he was the most supportive of
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.360]  abortions of any anybody that had ever been in office he supported late term
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.680]  abortions very strongly we knew a few other things about him for the most
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.640]  part he was a blank slate and even the people who voted for him said they were
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.320]  very disappointed that they thought he was going to be like X he turned out to
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.320]  be like Y but they were voting for a personality and that's what people are
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.800]  doing here there they're like you said they're they're attaching themselves to
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.920]  personality you know Hitler was bad he gave a stigma to this
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.640]  Tesla was good so let's let's talk about Tesla liking eugenics so we can make
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.920]  eugenics popular now well that's why Bill Gates says you know we did need to
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.600]  vaccinate more people so that we can reduce the population people like that
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.120]  are propped up on a pedal stool and act like they're genius so we need to listen
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.840]  to them but at a deeper level it's this weird ironic disturbing racism that is
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.400]  actually proliferating this entire progressive concept or this entire you
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.720]  neo eugenics concept that yes certain people are unfit to breathe the elderly
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.040]  are waste of space you know we actually should have death panels but then at the
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:50.480]  same time they'll say you know all white people are bad because George Zimmerman
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.680]  who isn't even white you know defended himself against a black man and it's
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.040]  this weird distorted nefarious race baiting when we're looking at comments
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.160]  now from individuals that would no question identify as progressives or
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.920]  liberals or whatever and doesn't even matter it's it's all phony system I know
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:13.720]  that but look at this comment this guy he has 194 at votes and he is being
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:19.600]  supported he says honestly if they can make it 100% reversible all males should
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.320]  be sterilized before they turn 13 no more oopsies it will have to be
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.560]  consensual to have children and he goes on and says hey you know there are women
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.560]  who poke holes and poke holes and condoms to and impregnate others and you
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.120]  know stuff like that we need to end this right now and he goes on to say he had a
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.360]  child on accident and it was not a purpose and a mistake and he said you
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.360]  can be upset at me for saying this but I told my son he was an accident and I
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.080]  would like to prevent future people from having kids who aren't fit to breed and
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.840]  then others go in and they say well hey did you hear about this new male birth
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.720]  control procedure it's 100% effective in last 10 years and the response is just
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.320]  telling my roommates about this possibly the best invention ever permanent
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.320]  sterilization and then they say well hey it's worth it you know a needle to the
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.720]  generals is a lot less painful than letting go of your future plans because
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.760]  you had a child come into the picture while children are now evil yeah I mean
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.200]  people actually think that everyone should be forcibly sterilized before
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.360]  they turn 13 I mean maybe they're gonna get that with Gardasil anyway though in
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.920]  California you don't need parental permission to go in and inject
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.440]  girls and soon enough boys with Gardasil. That's really scary and you know
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:35.760]  people like this are the ones who are very easily brought into being thinking
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.320]  that they're going to be part of the elite who are going to be fine you know
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.280]  if we're gonna take out the entire population with some kind of mouse pox
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.520]  that's okay I'm gonna be one of the guys that's gonna survive I'm gonna
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:52.400]  cooperate with the system that kind of rampant elitism divorced from any
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.600]  morality divorced from any sensitivity to anybody is really really frightening
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.080]  we're gonna be back talk a little bit more about this with Anthony Guciardi
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.400]  stay tuned. My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.320]  important information concerning you and your family's health. Radiation levels

[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.600]  Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and I'm joined in studio here with Anthony
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.640]  Gucciardi of StoryLeak and we were just talking about our did Hitler give
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.240]  eugenics a bad name? There's a lot of people out there now that are still
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.680]  talking about population control. As Anthony pointed out we've got a long
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.000]  history in this country of experimentation on people and we just
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.680]  had that a year ago with the EPA in North Carolina conducting experiments
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.080]  having people directly breathe diesel gas but it's far worse than that as
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.680]  Anthony pointed out. We got people who were injected with plutonium and other
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:59.520]  horrendous things. We've got a clip here from Bill Gates talking about death
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.560]  panels and health care. Let's take a look at what the elitists really think and
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:11.120]  before we do that let me give out our phone number 800-259-9231. If you agree
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.720]  with this elitism with this eugenics give us a call if you want to make the
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.600]  case that you think that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name you think that we
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.680]  really ought to control the population think we really ought to be selective
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.120]  about who's allowed to have children if you think that the population is too
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.320]  great and we need to have forced population control forced abortions
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.760]  give us a call at 800-259-9231 we only want people who disagree with us on
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:39.000]  this. Let's take a look at that what Bill Gates thinks about this. That's a
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.040]  trade-off society's making because of very very high medical costs and a lack
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.960]  of willingness to say you know is spending a million dollars on that last
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.120]  three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off the
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.840]  those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs but that's
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.360]  called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion so you
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.560]  of course that's an interesting thing you just said would you just the last
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.240]  three months in life for one person something because we haven't had a
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.400]  discussion of how to allocate that money I mean there you go I mean if Bill
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.720]  Gates is for it and Tesla is for it I mean how can we disagree with people of
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.560]  that statue notice how calm they are oh that's an interesting idea that we
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.120]  should kill off people that we are deeming less worthy than ourselves it's
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.520]  the whole notion here and the reason we're highlighting this is that this
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.320]  isn't just a historical fact that 60,000 were forced to be sterilized this
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.920]  isn't just a historical fact of the government admittedly documents show
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.160]  and they're now apologizing for it injected people with STDs injected
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.720]  people with plutonium just to see what would happen that is actually real
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.600]  racism that is actually real population control hitlerian style and then we're
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.720]  looking at these comments here and there's a little bit a few more off of
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.600]  Reddit which again is just a community website Reddit itself is not saying this
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.680]  just it's it's equivalent to Facebook people on Facebook saying this but
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.360]  there's thousands of them there's millions of users on this website saying
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.680]  upvoting these different comments they're saying for example it's not that
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.640]  the morals were different back then it's that science was if sterilizing the
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.120]  mentally ill would actually work to prevent crime I'd be all for it though
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.680]  it'd be something of a sacrifice obviously that's another comment the
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.520]  problem is that it wouldn't work so it would be a cruel seeming and pointless
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.640]  sacrifice so I do oppose it and he goes on to say but you know if it did work if
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.360]  we could identify pre-crime then we should sterilize them because they're
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.880]  criminals so what does pre-crime mean? Well maybe we could tell you know by the
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:44.440]  number of bumps on their head you know remember phrenology where they would
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.920]  identify people as criminals by their facial features I mean that was
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.320]  essentially kind of feeding in and away to this whole racism thing you look a
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.520]  certain way you act a certain way you know we can take out one of things about
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:59.280]  Bill Gates comment there that strikes me is the fact that he's going to make
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.240]  these decisions for us and that all comes along with the government
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.560]  controlling our health care again you know he's sitting there thinking well you
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.920]  know what should our trade-offs be should we allow this older person to have
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.400]  health care or should we buy or should we pay 10 teachers in other words they're
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.200]  making these decisions for us it's kind of a mixture of paternalism and
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.600]  elitism but it's really got a eugenics base to it yeah because they're not even
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.880]  just saying should we give them health care they're saying we're just gonna let
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.080]  them die mm-hmm we're not gonna perform the surgery that we should we're going
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.480]  to kill them even if they don't have money even if they have money but we're
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.000]  talking about we're not just talking about hey this group says you know that
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.200]  maybe they shouldn't break we're talking about going into ghettos they would and
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.240]  just sterilize people and just knock their doors down I mean that is
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.920]  forcible action and what's amazing to me while we're highlighting it is that
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.800]  there's new this neo eugenics is a term that we're making up right now to
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.520]  describe this they're going in and saying all across the board here that
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.520]  it's actually a good idea and then we ask what does pre-crime even mean how
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.960]  do you determine that well someone a conspiracy theorist is now according to
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.680]  the Bible of psychiatric medicine a mental illness oh yeah so
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.360]  criticizing the government well hey because if you criticize the government
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.880]  you may actually you know be a criminal you may actually get upset and start
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:20.000]  shooting people or do something about it violent yeah I mean the TSA shooter they
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.600]  say that anyone who's ever criticized the TSA is responsible for that anyone so
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:29.000]  basically 99% of Americans are now evil and insane so they should be
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.320]  sterilized I mean that's how that works absolutely amazing we want to take your

[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.000]  filling in for Alex and I'm joined here in studio with Anthony Gutiarty from
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.480]  Story League and we were just talking about these reddit comments people are
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.760]  making anonymously talking about how they agree with eugenicism and we've got
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.360]  the phones open for people who agree with that as well we want to hear what
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:49.680]  they have to say and actually the phone lines are lighting up with people who
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.520]  agree with eugenics let's go the very first one James in New York James are
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:02.000]  you there? Hey do you think that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name? I can't really
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.160]  speak on it but you know I just want to bring a different perspective to the
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.200]  conversation especially about abortion I really do believe people should have
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:18.360]  the right to know to have the right ability to have an abortion you know
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.960]  when especially in these urban neighborhoods you know every time you
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.680]  turn around when I just got out of high school every time you turn around you see
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.480]  a 16-year-old girl pregnant a 17-year-old girl pregnant and you don't
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.760]  know for many different reasons for lack of family support, an environment, a
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:42.480]  state and when children are born into that environment it's just not fair to the
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.480]  child. Well what do you think about North Carolina they went into the ghettos
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.200]  and they forcibly sterilized specifically black women and they said
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.760]  they were unfit to breed do you think that's a good idea? No I'm not saying it
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:00.120]  but I do believe we should have the right to have an abortion especially when
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.920]  you know that you're the child that you're going to be bringing into the
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:06.880]  situation you know it's not going to be the situation is not going to be
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.960]  right for the child. Well you know James James what about adoption yeah I've got
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.440]  two adopted children I know a lot of people who want to adopt children and
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.800]  it's not very easy as a matter of fact in North Carolina we were forbidden at the
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  time we were looking to adopt we're forbidden from adopting multiracial
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.440]  multiracial children I know some friends now who have been able to do that
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.160]  they adopted a sibling group their white couple and they adopted some black
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:36.000]  siblings what about adoption isn't that an option for the children instead of
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:44.920]  killing them? Adoption isn't an option but then you would adopt so you don't know who is going to end up with a kid
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:52.000]  you know who's going to end up with a kid you don't know of course you have people
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.680]  I mean people who come out of adoption situations are too easy. Sorry you called
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.080]  it's cutting up but I don't think James I think James agrees with abortion which
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.000]  I think is part of eugenics but I don't think he overall agrees with the whole
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.360]  concept of forced sterilizations and selective breeding. Yeah but you know
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.800]  abortion came out of eugenicist philosophy and Margaret Sanger was very
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.160]  clear that she started abortion it was targeted towards black families and we've
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:28.000]  got a great documentary here Maffa 21. Yes James something James are you black?
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.840]  Yes I am. Do you not think there's a direct assault on black people with in
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.240]  regards to abortion I mean what is it 40 million babies predominantly black
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.040]  killed I mean do you think it's a good idea though you're saying it's actually
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:50.260]  a good idea to go in. It's a lot of direct assault against black people we'd go for days about that you know. So why do you
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:55.840]  support abortions I mean if anything if anything it is a bunch of rich white
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.040]  men going in and saying we need to kill black babies I mean how is how are you
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.600]  supporting that. That's how that's how Planned Parenthood started. Yeah absolutely
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.600]  in fact Margaret Sanger I believe was extremely racist I mean they would
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.080]  use the most racist terms ever heard in my life and then and it amazes me that
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.560]  it's some issue of women's rights now it's some issue of is you're racist if
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.840]  you're against abortion when they're targeting predominantly black babies and
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.240]  black families. As a matter of fact there's a whole documentary that we sell
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.320]  here at Info Wars called Mafa 21. Yeah that was done by Mark Crutcher the guy
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.800]  who discovered this abortionist in Houston who's killing live babies. It
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.720]  focuses entirely on the war against the black community as being that the the
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.120]  source of the abortion industry. James why have you let them break you down? Why
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.600]  do you not think they're capable of having a child? What I mean you're
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.120]  telling me that you believe that it's good that these these black girls get
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:52.440]  abortions because they do not fit to have a child age 16. Why aren't we
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.880]  talking about abortions in upscale rich yacht communities? I mean what's the
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.840]  difference? You're letting them win. You're letting them break you down man.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:03.120]  You have the power to take care of a family. You have all that power. You
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.240]  don't need the government to come in and run your life and kill your babies. Is
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:21.880]  it not an attack on you? Well that's this whole idea that children are bad. Children
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:27.440]  are not bad. Children are a gift. Not at all. Not at all. But if the mother is 16
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:34.200]  years old barely has an education, I think she's gonna have a chance. Because everybody
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:40.280]  makes mistakes. She should definitely have a chance. You know. If you make that
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:47.120]  argument. It's not it's not it's not it's not it's a lot of girls who are 16 and you
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.400]  know they raise their children and it comes out you know a good situation. But
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.840]  I know from Brooklyn I see it. I see it. I understand where you come from James.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.960]  We need to move on to another caller but I just want to say this one thing. Attack on
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.840]  the culture period. There's an attack on the culture. This is a symptom. This is
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:11.280]  not the ultimate issue here. The symptom is the ghettos are by design
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.760]  implemented. The economy is by design collapsed and there is an attack
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:20.320]  majorly on the black culture period. And that's what's spawning all of this to
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.560]  the point now where there you know people are in horrible situations that I
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.080]  actually know personally and are saying well we need an abortion because we
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.640]  can't support the child. This is a response. This is not now the debate is
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.400]  should we get an abortion. It should be. Why is this even happening? Why is the
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.360]  culture being destroyed? We need to reclaim it. It's also it's also a slippery
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:40.760]  slope of saying that quality of life is the determining factor as to whether
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760]  or not somebody should even have life. And then what's what's a good quality of
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:48.120]  life? Exactly. We have somebody who is who has some kind of a physical
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.480]  challenge. Do we then kill them? Because you know they don't really have as good
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.360]  life as I would have. Let's say that they're in a wheelchair. Let's go to
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.240]  Dennis in Texas. Dennis what do you think about this? Do you think about a
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:06.200]  sterilized 13 year olds or something like that? Well I'll tell you what you
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.920]  know I've seen so many 13 year olds having like so many kids and the
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:18.560]  parents allowing that and making it available to be okay. And you need to
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.560]  weigh that out okay. Now if you live in my community you'd be so disgusted. You
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:30.000]  know I live in a rural community okay. And you would not believe what I see
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.680]  that's a heartache every day. Now I'm not saying like hey you know let's
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.600]  kill them because they're retarded or they're mentally deficient. Let's make
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.920]  their lives extremely comfortable. Let's make them okay to live within their
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:54.280]  means but fix them. And you fix them by sterilizing them and taking away their
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.200]  right to produce and actually live and have a family. And who I mean are you
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.000]  for the just across the board sterilization of 13 year olds without
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.640]  their permission? Hey if they got a problem that means that they're not
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:16.080]  going to be socially adept into the ability to live a normal life. Who makes
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.400]  that mean though? Yeah who makes that determination though? And once we set up
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.680]  some standards what keeps those standards from sliding? Well let's look at
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:30.360]  this now I saw this one little ad in some T&N saying where there's this like
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:38.040]  a lady in England and she decided she's gonna marry some autistic guy and she
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:42.120]  was looking forward to having children. Dennis let me ask you a question have
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.320]  you ever been depressed? Let me ask you a question have you ever been depressed in
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.320]  your life? No I don't get depressed because I'm too depressed. You've never felt
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.400]  sad you've never felt sad before and down just kind of depressed? No no I'm too
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:01.360]  busy. Dennis have you ever questioned the government? Dennis you are a
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:05.400]  psychiatric patient you are mentally ill you are unfit to breed. I mean going by
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:10.160]  this logic the DSM listen the fifth iteration of the DSM the Bible of
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.360]  psychiatric psychiatric medicine says if you're questioning the government
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:18.600]  constantly you are mentally ill. So Dennis you are actually mentally ill.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.120]  Oppositional defiant disorder. What you need to do is if you're mentally ill
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:27.560]  then you're unfit to breed because your children then could become mentally ill.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.520]  I mean genealogically if you're questioning the government it's very
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:34.000]  possible your children could question the government therefore you are unfit to
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.800]  breed Dennis. It doesn't matter about any of your other qualities. You are
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.160]  mentally ill. So do you understand now how this works? You are mentally ill and
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.960]  you are unfit to breed. On the upside down because what you're trying to do to me
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.600]  is you're trying to make me take away from the reality of the situation to
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.200]  look at to where the reality of the situation is that the psychiatric
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.080]  Bible says those who question the government are mentally ill and you're
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:04.200]  in the same paradigm as someone who might have autism or someone who might
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:08.280]  actually be suicidal or have schizophrenia. It's all the same
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.000]  distinction of mental illness. If you are depressed you are mentally ill. If you
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.800]  have thoughts of aggression which pharmaceutical drugs give you you are
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:20.320]  mentally ill and then you'll be given pharmaceutical drugs which give you more
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:24.640]  psychiatric symptoms which make you further mentally ill. Therefore one in
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:29.080]  ten people now are having mainline mental illness. Fifty percent of people in
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.040]  their lifetime will be taking drugs for that and our mentally or will be
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.080]  perceived as mentally ill and as every iteration of the DSM comes out more and
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:39.720]  more people are considered crazy and mentally ill. So when we go and we say
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.920]  that these people mentally aren't fit to breed 99% of everyone that's saying
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.280]  that can also be classified as unfit to breed. Do you see how that works? So when
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:51.080]  you start pushing the precedent but yeah maybe we should sterilize these certain
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.200]  types of people. Anyone that's saying that, chances are unless you're one of
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.560]  the 500 elite there exempt from this, you're going to be sterilized as well.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.440]  It doesn't matter. It's all the same class and that's how Obamacare works as
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:06.200]  well. The whole system, the idea that these people that think you're crazy and
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.040]  want to kill you are going to give you health care for free and going to give
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.600]  you a system that enhances your health is a massive joke. But before you go,
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.040]  before we go, because we've got to move on, we somehow have so many people that
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.320]  support eugenics. Did Hitler give eugenics a bad name?
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:28.080]  No, he didn't. Not all. No, he did. Okay. Thank you very much. Go ahead. Go ahead.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.120]  Alright, let's move on to the next one then. Yeah, let's go to Andrew in
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:41.000]  Massachusetts. Andrew, are you there? Okay. Okay, let's go to Howie in
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.560]  Pennsylvania. Hey, Howie, what do you think about that? Did Hitler give you
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.640]  eugenics a bad name? That's kind of a trick question, but I'm just going to skip over that and say,
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.880]  I do think that sterilization should be implemented because, you know,
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:05.240]  anything can be good. It depends who's in charge of it. I think that we should be
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.200]  in charge of it and say that anybody that wrote a white paper about sterilizing
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:15.520]  people en masse, they should be sterilized. Well, you know how you're right. You're funny,
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.560]  because I knew we would get at least, because here's the reality. I mean,
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.640]  any sane individual, like actually real, awake individual agrees that eugenics is a
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.280]  bad idea. I mean, across the board, I mean, agrees that, yeah, Hitler was not
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.920]  right, but apparently a small section of people actually do think, as we've seen
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.280]  from these comments, I mean, thousands of people upvoting and saying, yeah,
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.200]  Hitler gave eugenics a bad name. We should sterilize all 13-year-olds. But, I mean,
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.360]  the reality is anyone saying that should sterilize themselves. I mean, isn't that
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.160]  right, Howie? You think anyone saying that we should sterilize people and have
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.560]  abortions up to age five, well, they should just do it themselves then. They
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:54.440]  should just kill themselves, huh? Right, yeah, exactly. You first, buddy. Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.560]  Well, let's thank you, Howie, for some realism here, but let's talk to someone
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:02.360]  else who believes that Hitler is right. Let's talk to Don and Connecticut. Now, Don,
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.880]  you said that, you think because of the welfare state that we should have eugenics?
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.000]  Well, they go together. They go together? Well, you're gonna have half the people in
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.920]  this country on welfare. Then, um, what else are we gonna do? How about we abort
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:25.040]  the welfare state? Well, I consider abortion to be justifiable homicide. I am
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:29.680]  pro-choice, definitely. But I do not believe in eugenics, you know, which
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.280]  should be the individual who should buy it. Justifiable. Wait, wait, yeah, let's
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.000]  let's probe that a little bit. So if I were to go up to a pregnant woman and
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.600]  stab her in the stomach and kill her baby, should I go to jail? Gonna end up
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.640]  happening if people don't get the connection. If they don't get the
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:52.720]  connection between this unlimited welfare state, we have limited resources
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:47:00.400]  and you, all of a sudden, you're gonna want everybody who wants my money have
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:03.680]  it for whatever reason. So you think we should just kill everyone
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:10.320]  on welfare? But because they go together and people need to connect that, they
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.800]  need to understand that if you're going to have a state that, you know, you get
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:22.080]  to claim my money. So we should just kill everyone who's on welfare. Listen, listen,
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.960]  if Hitler said kill everyone on welfare, do you think that's a good idea? So much
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.480]  money. Now explain to us why you would say that that is that's homicide but it's
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.240]  justifiable homicide and which and do you put any limits on that as far as what
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:43.920]  age? Yeah it is, it is murder. I mean I'm pro-choice and I will admit it's murder
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:50.880]  but it's justifiable homicide. Up to what age would you... It's my body, it's my
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:57.360]  choice. What about the choice of the child that you're committing
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.000]  homicide on? What age would you take that to? Would you stop that at three
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.960]  months or three years or at what point should we have justifiable homicide of
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.840]  children? You know, every case is different. Oh wow. Every woman has, there's all
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:18.000]  sorts of reasons why a woman might get an abortion too late but it does. I mean it
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:25.440]  should leave you out definitely because it's homicide. It should bother you. It
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.320]  shouldn't be the way it is now people you know using it for birth control. I should
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:38.240]  give people a heads up. I took somebody to Planned Parenthood for an abortion who
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:44.160]  swear that they did not mess up. They took their birth control pills and I'm
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.240]  sitting there in the waiting room with probably 14 other women who also swear
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.080]  that they took their birth control pills. Somebody needs to investigate Planned
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:01.040]  Parenthood because that's the very source of the birth control pills these
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.880]  women had. Well let me ask you, since you said that you're okay with
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:12.120]  homicide, I mean are you okay with what this Houston doctor is accused of or the
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.840]  children are born alive and he twists the head off of the child, you're okay
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:24.520]  with that? It's so disgusting and it's ridiculous. I imagine that guy, that
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:31.480]  manifestation of sadism that's being you know public like that. So only some
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.440]  killing of babies is justifiable homicide but other kind of
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:43.400]  killing of children is not that good right? No. Okay. So basically whatever
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.000]  doesn't emotionally hurt you as bad that's you know that's that's okay but
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.760]  if it emotionally hurts you then that's not justifiable. So law should basically
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.360]  written based on the emotions of its citizenry and that you know that
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:00.880]  offends me that that baby was killed in that circumstance but you know backyard
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:05.920]  McDonald's abortions that are now legal you know that's okay those are fine so
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:09.080]  well thank you we appreciate your call we want to get to more people who are
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:14.800]  into eugenics but the basic idea that it's justifiable in some cases and not
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.080]  so much in the other ones it's just it's just complete nonsense based on
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.920]  absolutely no foundation of anything and that's what happens when you go away
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:24.680]  from reality you go away from the Constitution you go away from principles
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.080]  that we followed for hundreds if not thousands of years and you take it and
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.960]  you say well I feel this way about one thing and my emotions are over here on
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:35.880]  another one it gets completely tossed up well they're not really different
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:40.120]  separate areas either no they overlap into each other because Margaret Sanger
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.720]  who started abortion talked about quality of life issues she was also eugenicist
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.760]  she was a eugenicist so abortion eugenics they all overlap with each other
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:53.680]  and they reinforce each other exactly Obamacare is the way that is going to
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.200]  happen just as we saw Bill Gates talking about that we're gonna be right back
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.680]  and we're gonna be talking to Bill still about the Federal Reserve my name is
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.200]  Frank Bates and I got a confession to make just a few days ago FEMA went
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.920]  directly to my supplier and tried to buy my entire stockpile of high quality
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.600]  survival food it sounds crazy but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:20.120]  a minute revealing FEMA's plot can land me in hot water and I think you
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:25.560]  deserve to know exactly what they're doing go to FEMA hates this calm to see
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.200]  undeniable video proof that the government is on the hunt for as much
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:34.280]  survival food as they can grab in 24 hours be warned it's really disturbing
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:39.680]  because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't go to FEMA hates this
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.440]  calm to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right now and
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.520]  my supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:53.480]  across America do it now because I don't know how long it will be online so go
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:52:00.920]  to FEMA hates this calm while you can that's FEMA hates this calm my name is
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.680]  Bruno I'm 52 years old I've tried different protein powders over the
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.920]  years and they've all tasted pretty bad I tried one rolled away and found it to
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.880]  be delicious after 10 weeks on one world way my wife commented you have more
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:15.680]  muscles and your leaner than when you were 20 years old my body has changed
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.200]  dramatically I'm a cyclist normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.160]  after being on one world way I wrote 10 days in a row and over 100 degree heat
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.920]  and then I take another two servings of one world way and then work out at the
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:33.160]  gym for another hour and a half I just couldn't believe these results my
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.520]  normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:41.400]  don't take my word for it one world way comes in single servings just give it a
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:47.840]  try for a health and taste sensation you'll love call 888-988-3325

[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:14.440]  DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:20.080]  it has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:24.960]  the same values as their fellow patriots my patriots supply brings us their

[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:36.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we're gonna change
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:43.520]  gears radically here we're gonna go from talking about justifiable homicide as
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.240]  this lady put a called abortions I think we've got a lot of callers who are
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.160]  gonna hold on the line to talk to us about this after we talked to Bill
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:54.640]  still but he's been very patiently waiting to talk to us about his film
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.800]  about the Federal Reserve this is the 100th anniversary of the thing we call
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.080]  the Federal Reserve and he has a wonderful documentary about about that
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:09.840]  that we sell at info wars store.com it's Jekyll Island and I've seen this
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.720]  documentary I'm very anxious to talk to Bill about what he thinks the future
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.040]  holds and if there's any way to rein in the Federal Reserve but we're gonna talk
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.360]  about the effects that it's had and the history of the Federal Reserve Bill
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.840]  still has many films that you may have seen he has the Secret of Oz he is a
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.280]  former newspaper editor and publisher he's written for USA Today, The Saturday
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:39.480]  Evening Post, LA Times and Omni Magazine. Bill are you there? Hello?
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:46.240]  Hey Bill how you doing? I'm doing well thank you. I just saw your film Jekyll
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.360]  Island and it's really timely with the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:55.360]  I think it's really really an amazing story that people need to see they need
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.080]  to understand the history of how we got this they need to understand the
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:01.520]  implications of this as you pointed out there's a couple of things that have
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:05.880]  really ruined country after country throughout history that's a fractional
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.880]  reserve lending system and the debt that they impose on sovereign nations. Yeah
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:17.520]  really the two major problems with the the world economy and the economy of
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.400]  every nation are number one government borrowing and number two fractional
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:29.160]  reserve lending they are two distinct forces but the first the first problem
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.240]  that I would try to go fix is we don't need to just pay down the national debt
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.960]  we need to eliminate the ability of the federal government to borrow because the
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.360]  borrower as the Bible says in Proverbs the borrower becomes servant to the
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:47.600]  lender and so therefore you have instead of a republic or a democratic
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.160]  republic or a constitutional republic you have nothing but a body plutocracy
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:58.560]  that is ruled by the banking class and this is what humanity has tried to
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.600]  escape for the last 2,000 years and we're rapidly devolving now back in the
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.320]  last 50 years towards a less freedom towards more centralized control and I'm
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:13.400]  not just talking about centralized control of government I'm talking about
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.760]  centralized control by the debt-based banking system that's right and they're
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.000]  the reason most of us think that government is no longer responsive to
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.920]  we the people is because they are now completely responsive and subservient to
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.440]  those to whom they owe this debt namely the largest commercial banks. It's
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.920]  amazing in your film Jekyll Island you go back in quite a ways into history
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:43.680]  especially back to the Napoleonic times the Louisiana Purchase and how the
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:49.680]  Rothschild family got in control of major countries in Europe but then you
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:53.600]  take it forward to when the Federal Reserve was created it's kind of
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.120]  interesting this secret train ride on Senator Aldrich's private Pullman car
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.840]  that's black I like the way the documentary starts out with that this is
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.120]  something that was set up to stop the rapid that the what they call the
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.680]  business cycle the boom and bust cycles and yet the Federal Reserve hasn't
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:16.680]  really worked out too well in terms of that has it. No it hasn't and in fact
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:21.000]  just 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve what did we have we had
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.320]  the largest crash in US history leading to the deepest depression of the 20th
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:33.200]  century so and interestingly enough there's there's this rumor going
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.040]  around at the Fed has come back hang on Bill we're gonna be right back right
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:41.640]  after the break stay tuned you guys will hear the rest of the story. You are

[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.600]  Alex Jones
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight fully in for Alex and we've
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:36.640]  got on the phone with us documentary filmmaker Bill Still who just completed
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:41.320]  the documentary film Jekyll Island and Jekyll Island tells a story of the
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.040]  Federal Reserve and really kind of underscores the fact that the Federal
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.040]  Reserve is not federal and they don't really have any reserves and it's
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.680]  something that has was created to solve the problem of the business cycle but
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:57.480]  it's actually has made it quite bad as Bill was just saying before we went to
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.800]  break Bill as they came in and set up the Federal Reserve it was only just a
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:06.440]  few years after that we had the Great Depression the largest of course the
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:11.880]  worst economic situation the world has seen worldwide well yeah worldwide but
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:17.400]  that was not the deepest depression in in US history the the years after the
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.440]  Civil War were actually the deepest depression if you look at it from a
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:29.280]  percentage of money disappearing from the US economy I think with 84% the the
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.160]  money in the system was reduced by 84% during those 30 years and this this led
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:42.360]  up the the bankers caused a series of booms and busts to try to justify bringing
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:46.920]  a massive centralized system the Federal Reserve system and and that's really
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:51.560]  how we got it now as I was say getting ready to say before the break there's a
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.720]  rumor going around that the Fed has a 100-year charter and that's going to come
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:02.280]  up here on December 23rd that's just not the case right initially it was given
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.800]  only a 20-year charter and there's a reason and in corporate rule making
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.560]  because the Fed is a corporation they did admit that when they changed the law
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.320]  in 1927 if there's some there's some rule and in corporate America that you
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.040]  don't want a corporation to last over 20 years so they they made the Fed they
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.200]  gave the Fed a 20-year charter and then after only 13 years they decided well
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.840]  we're gonna jump in there and change it and make it indeterminate as the law
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:36.880]  states so in 1927 that was changed and the Fed now has a perpetual charter hmm
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:43.000]  so how do we get rid of the Fed well it's it's gonna take a tremendous public
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:48.560]  awareness and I personally don't think it's going to happen until a lot more
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:53.280]  pain has been applied to the US economy right now we're in the mother of all
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:59.120]  bubbles with the stock market and at some point that's got to collapse you
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:06.000]  just can't continue to expand the money supply logarithmically and yet even now
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.640]  we see unemployment rates and and money going to the middle class the middle
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:16.640]  class economic experience is no better than flat despite the fact that we're
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:22.000]  the Fed is pumping an unlimited and not an unlimited but an unprecedented amount
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.400]  of money into the system over a trillion dollars a year this has never happened
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.480]  before in US history and still it it's for the middle class there's really no
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.200]  change in fact our purchasing power is continuing to go down all this money is
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.080]  being concentrated to an ever greater degree in the hands of the banking class
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:47.000]  and that's it there's just no way around that that is not going to turn around
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.080]  it's going to do nothing but not only increase but accelerate the rate of
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:56.200]  increase until the system collapses and at that point then we can finally have
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:00.920]  an opportunity for real change because people will see that the solutions that
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:07.160]  have been offered in the past were lies just as mr. Obama's healthcare bill
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:12.360]  so that's that's the problem we're going to have to have some more pain and we've
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.240]  seen this in the past we've seen the World Bank under Robert McNamara going
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.240]  in and getting third-world nations totally inundated with national debt and
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:24.160]  he was criticized the World Bank was criticized for what they called rent
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.840]  seeking status in other words turning these getting these countries so far in
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.560]  debt that they could never get out of it and that's what we see happening
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.800]  throughout history as your documentary points out the banks will get countries
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.520]  so far into debt that they can never get out and that's why they talk about
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.880]  turning everybody into renters well thank you very much for joining us today
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:47.200]  bill and I really appreciate that that documentary is Jekyll Island as we
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:51.600]  approach the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve find out about its true
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:55.120]  history find out that it's not really federal and there's no reserve it's a
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:00.760]  private bank that is destroying our country financially

[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.000]  to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight filling in for Alex now if you caught
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.720]  the show in the last segment we were talking about eugenics with Anthony
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.440]  Gucciardi a story leak and we were asking people if they agreed with eugenics
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:49.680]  if they agreed with the comment stream that we found on Reddit that said that
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:54.320]  Hitler gave eugenics a bad name and so we've been taking some calls from people
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:59.320]  who wanted to defend eugenics or to defend abortion we just had a lady say
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:04.320]  that she thought that abortion was justifiable homicide we couldn't really
[02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:08.400]  pin her down as to how it was justified but we've got some other people on the
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:12.480]  line would like to talk to that I think support eugenics we've got Kyle in
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:16.240]  Colorado Kyle what would you like to tell us about eugenics that you agree
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:24.400]  with hello hello Kyle yeah yeah I think I know the argument they're sort of
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.960]  trying to make the people who support eugenics
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:33.920]  mm-hmm the fact that we don't have enough food in our world we don't have
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:42.520]  enough us you know resources that they say China you know they go around and
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:49.240]  they only let the boys live we have other cultures though who have had forced
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:55.480]  breeding you know the Tahitians they have to go have sex with their brothers
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:59.760]  and sisters before they could go out into the community well you know the
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.320]  argument that we don't have enough food and water for people to eat that's
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.720]  something that was made by Malthus back in the 18th century and that's something
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:09.840]  that's been proven over and over again to be wrong because people don't just come
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:15.040]  into society as useless eaters they actually produce things on their own I
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.600]  mean which which ones of the kids do we get rid of do we get rid of the
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:25.160]  Teslas do we get rid of the Beethoven's who do we get rid of how do we know we
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:31.040]  I mean I'm a father myself and you know children are our future what we need to
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:37.440]  do is come together as human and and respect the fact that what we're what
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.400]  we're doing and the arguments that people have are just illusions per se I
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:47.920]  mean I don't know I can't I can't agree with state-run breeding like what the
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:54.080]  Spartans did or the Tahitians did but I mean it has produced strong cultures
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:01.520]  over the centuries I just believe that you know if you believe in you know
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:05.160]  murdering children and all that other stuff you could just go to China because
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.800]  that's what they do there all the time we've seen how that plays out they're
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:16.800]  still doing it all over the world so we like argue that is it right or do we
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:21.120]  argue on how we need to stop it now because it's still going on
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.960]  well absolutely absolutely and we need to stop it and we needed something that's
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:30.120]  radical as they asked Dan Savage they said come up with a radical controversial
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:34.920]  idea to improve the planet well I think maybe respecting people individual
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:39.960]  liberty individual dignity and freedom you know it was a radical idea for B. F.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:43.760]  Skinner to say that he was going to take away people's freedom and dignity and it
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:47.640]  was a radical idea when Jefferson said that you can't do that you can destroy
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:52.080]  somebody's life and their freedom but you cannot disjoin those two things
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.280]  they're essential to our personhood and if you let somebody do that to someone
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:00.960]  who is weaker someone who fits some arbitrary criteria it's going to come
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:03.640]  back around to you but let's see if somebody else wants to defend this we've
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:10.280]  got a Patty in Arizona Patty how do you feel about eugenics abortion I feel
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:15.280]  that no man has the right to make that decision for another human being but
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:20.520]  that is their God-given right to have children I have a daughter who was
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.680]  diagnosed developmentally slow she's now 25 but after she got married several
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:30.440]  years later she got pregnant and from the time she was a nine they had been
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:36.960]  telling me the county would come to me send their health people and say don't
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:41.440]  you think you should have her fix you know she should never have children and
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:46.720]  it was like you know this is her decision you know and I had two beautiful
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:51.480]  granddaughters they did not allow her to keep them they fought her to the nail
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:56.600]  because they decided that wasn't going to happen that she would not be
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.760]  adequate an adequate parent and she finally after a year and a half after
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:08.440]  the first one just gave up because she they just gave her so much so the state
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:13.000]  came by confiscated her children because of what because of her IQ or I mean
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.920]  whether specific instances that they cited what did they do she well she
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.720]  was back in Minnesota and they were telling her oh you're going to be a
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.360]  great little mom and you're going to keep your baby and I finally called that
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:31.640]  there and said quit lying to my daughter because I know you people and you are
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.720]  going to take her baby the minute it's born I said you better go tell her the
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:38.560]  truth so a week later they went back there and told her the truth and said
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.320]  the minute you have this child we're gonna let you hold it one time and then
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.920]  we already have a home for it and but they were letting her think that she was
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.320]  going to be this great little mom and keep her child and I finally told her
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:58.760]  okay come there zone and she came here but they had given her wrote up all
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:05.720]  kinds of actually false statements about her from Minnesota and they just kept
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:12.760]  at her they'd let her so it's kind of like a kind of like a pre-crime thing
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.280]  right based on based on who she was I mean they didn't if they're going to
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:23.520]  take the child at birth then she hasn't at that point done anything to endanger
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:30.280]  the child no absolutely and they they kept saying well anyway she has she has
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:35.800]  two little daughters and we've been very blessed that foster mother has adopted
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:39.760]  both the children and has let her stay in their lives and she gets to see them
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.600]  once a week and she finally just there was it wasn't gonna matter what kind of
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:48.920]  group she jumped through they were never going to let her keep those kids but she
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:53.000]  had the after she had her second child she made the opportunity she made the
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.760]  decision to get thick and that's what she wanted to do and that was her choice
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.160]  she was a grown woman she was 24 years old you know right yeah it was too
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:07.280]  heartbreaking for an average children taken away well that's a sad story thank
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:12.280]  you for telling us that we should always remember that every human life is
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.280]  precious I know so many people who have had mentally handicapped children
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.480]  children with Down syndrome these are wonderful children if you love them and
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:28.840]  any parent who's had a Down syndrome child will tell you that that it really
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:33.440]  is kind of what you make out of it you know God gives us different situations
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:38.200]  in life and they can be a wonderful situation or if we come at it with a
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.800]  different attitude and it's a very challenging situation I'm not undermining
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.360]  how challenging this is but I can tell you over and over again parents that I
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:51.480]  know that have had children with with health consequences or mental
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:54.760]  consequences and it's been one of the biggest blessings of their life they'll
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:16:01.040]  tell you let's talk to Kyle and Marilyn Kyle what do you think about eugenics
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:08.680]  all right before I answer on whether or not I believe that hip again eugenics a
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:14.320]  bad name can I ask you what would be your definition of eugenics that what would
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:20.280]  be my definition of eugenics yeah well eugenics literally means to improve the
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:24.520]  gene pool and typically when people do that they have some criteria where they
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:29.520]  think that people that have particular characteristics whether that is a racial
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:33.240]  characteristic or whether those are characteristics of their mental capacity
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:38.000]  or it might be their physical capacity that those people should be first of all
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.840]  sterilized in many cases put down that's that's my understanding of eugenics
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:47.080]  what's yours okay so so what you're saying is you think that eugenics is
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:53.120]  basically the physical or mental manipulation of humans into getting
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:17:00.640]  almost like an elite race or you know an elite elite humanity yeah you get what
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.440]  I'm saying yeah we'll tell us what your definition of it is well I would I would
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:09.880]  agree with you with that well what see what I say yes I would say
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:16.920]  Hitler did give eugenics a bad name and I would say that because I believe eugenics
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:24.840]  can be used in a good way i.e. through everybody getting the right nutrition
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:29.360]  the right education you know people not getting these vaccines people not getting
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:37.240]  these genetically modified foods people you know not being not being subjected
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:43.480]  to this this horrible you know the media this music media the entertainment
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:47.520]  everything like that it teaches people bad morals bad values and people didn't
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:55.360]  have those types of those types true but I would I would say that eugenics is not
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:00.800]  that broadly construed to say this just generally improving the human condition
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.520]  whether it's health or environment or educational exposure I think eugenics is
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:12.280]  very very particular in terms of selecting out not only selecting what is
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:16.240]  good but selecting what is good by eliminating what you perceive to be as
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:23.360]  bad okay and again I agree with that I mean I perceived all these cancers all
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:27.400]  these illnesses all of them are bad but through the type of eugenics we can we
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.480]  can get rid of all these things and you know obviously I don't agree with forced
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:36.760]  sterilization forced abortion anything like that and you know everybody
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:41.280]  saying oh you have the right I don't want to hear anybody say that oh you have the
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:44.960]  right you have the free will to choose to kill your child nobody should have
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:49.840]  that right or that that choice to kill a child that's never right and I admire
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.120]  you when you just said that you have adopted children there's so many good
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:59.440]  people out there that do that are out there to adopt children and like for
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  example me and my wife I got my wife pregnant when she was 18 years old I'm
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:11.000]  24 now I had a song when I was 21 and I made 35,000 a year she was staying at
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.800]  home with people organic I don't want to hear people say that they you know you
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.120]  know you can't get out of the system you can't you know you're making only a
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.040]  certain amount of money you can only do so much because I get by just fine and
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.880]  can save plenty of money that's right it's sometimes those challenges are what
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.200]  we need in life and and like I said before many people that I know that
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:36.680]  have had children with health issues I was just handed this function this paper
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:39.960]  from the Asperger's Association of New England and they were talking about how
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:44.000]  that's simply a high-functioning form of autism and we've had a lot of people
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  that they believe have had Asperger's syndrome some of them Jane Austin Emily
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:54.080]  Dickinson even Thomas Edison they say well whether or not that's true it's
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:59.160]  still a human life people still have a right to their own life and their
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:03.160]  liberty and we'll be right back taking more calls for over five years you've

[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:26.560]  and we've been talking since the bottom of the hour last hour Anthony Gucci
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:31.120]  already came on and we were talking about this reddit stream that he found
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.360]  where people said Hitler gave eugenics a bad name amazing comments amazing things
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.540]  you see people say when they can get on the internet and talk anonymously you
[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:44.720]  find out what they really think and we saw some pretty amazing some pretty
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.600]  scary comments on there one of them says well we don't think that it should be
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:54.240]  mandatory but let's make it fashionable let's make it trendy let's encourage
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:58.840]  people let's let's make them feel like they're dressed poorly or they're
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.600]  awkward if they have too many children let's say we've got colors that we're
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:07.720]  taking their opinions on it we got Tom in Maryland we got him at the top of the
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:12.040]  line because he agrees with eugenics and we want to know why he wants to explain
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.880]  why does Tom what do you agree with eugenics well real quick just the
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:23.520]  second way on your last to comment at the risk of being labeled a Nazi I do
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:32.320]  understand from reading and from various sources that Hitler forbade the use of
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:39.000]  nuclear weapons that could affect his troops don't know if it's true or not
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:45.520]  but it's certainly a contrast to what we're doing with depleted uranium so
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:50.160]  absolutely I would say that after Operation Paperclip we had a lot a lot
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.640]  of Nazi scientists who came to the United States and those types of
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.880]  operations that they have been doing in concentration camps on POW prisoners on
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:03.640]  concentration camp prisoners they continued those types of experiments at
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:07.960]  Fort Detrick and other places nuclear biological chemical experiments we
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:12.520]  Anthony was talking about the plutonium experiments that they conducted on people
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.040]  so there's been a lot of experimentation here in the United States and we need to
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:22.320]  come to the grips with the idea that just because we're America that doesn't
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:25.920]  make us the good guys our American government has done things just like
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:30.720]  the Nazis have done in some cases worse and we should not give our own
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:35.880]  government a pass that's that's a kind of tribalistic thinking that divorces
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:39.420]  the actual facts actual things that people are doing and kind of says well
[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:42.160]  we're good guys because we're Americans they're bad guys because they're Nazis
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.680]  and it's a kind of thinking that keeps us from actually looking at the policies
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.840]  of Hitler and making those comparisons here in the United States and say look
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.560]  we're making these same mistakes we're heading down this same path but go ahead
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:58.840]  tell us about what you think about eugenics that's for sure but my point
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:04.800]  was my and maybe you can verify this through your sources my point was that
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:11.960]  Hitler had a nuclear option and didn't use it and I don't know what that says
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:18.320]  about him and his regime which obviously was out of control but I just want to
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.160]  make that point under the eugenics question though what your other callers
[02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:28.280]  said a few calls back if I can try to defend them a little bit I think what
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:36.160]  he was trying to say is that we do have an actual concern over over population
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:43.480]  gluttony is not good in any situation and we can see that in certain countries
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:50.440]  and I don't think it's up to any individual man or woman to make a
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:54.520]  decision well you know we can go into certainly we can go into an area that's
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:59.880]  got a very high population density like India and we can say that the problems
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:03.520]  are the number of people that they have but are they really the number of people
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.440]  that they have or is it maybe something that is like the kind of economic system
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.000]  that they live under the kind of government that they live under could
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.720]  it be that if they had a different set of values there if they had more liberty
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.760]  more freedom if they had a different kind of economic structure perhaps it's the
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:25.040]  banks perhaps it's central banks that are creating economic desperation there
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:27.600]  you know that happened in the United States as we just talked about with the
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:31.040]  Federal Reserve they created desperate conditions here in the United States
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:34.920]  because of fiscal policy it wasn't because the number of people that we
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:38.840]  had the Great Depression it was because of banking policies so when we look at
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.920]  that it's not necessarily you can't make the correlation that it's because we've
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:47.320]  got too many people I'm just making an observation I think your views are going
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:53.240]  to know with my quite a bit what I'm getting to is I think it's probably a
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:58.640]  combination of what you're saying and I do think there are situations where
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:03.440]  indeed people are having too many kids that they simply can't care for it
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:10.240]  however on the flip side of the coin we have most governments from my
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:18.160]  observations it warring people into entitlement and dependence as opposed to
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:24.320]  empowering them and educating them so that they can make sound and rational
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:28.560]  decisions absolutely that's that's been the goal of governments and like I
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:31.840]  point out that's it's not only just the communists and the socialists they've
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.600]  taken it to a fine science but it goes all the way back to Plato's time where
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.480]  he wanted to destroy the family why because he wanted them to be totally
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:45.000]  dependent upon the government he wanted them to see the government as a source
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.800]  of everything be dependent upon the government just as you pointed out for
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:52.760]  everything whether it's food or clothing we'll be right back the empires on the

[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:06.080]  flush those lines but you know we had one of the callers who talked to us was
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.480]  really kind of I think confusing eugenics with just kind of improving the
[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.560]  human condition and saying there are things that we can do to help people's
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:17.240]  health things that are damaging us genetically in the environment and he
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.800]  was absolutely right one of the things that you can do for yourself to help you

[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.480]  happening here in Austin now it's happening in Austin but this is
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.680]  something that's happening all over the country as we just learned earlier this
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:20.640]  week tell us what's going on here now I was looking at the local news today and
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:23.560]  you know we have a lot of events here in Austin it's a very happening city we
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:27.600]  have the UT football games we have the four new formula one racetrack concerts
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:31.760]  South by Southwest all kinds of things so they brought in the police chief from
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:36.560]  Boston to talk to Acevedo and police chief Art Acevedo here in the city of
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:40.160]  Austin to talk about terrorism preparedness and things that we could do
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:43.200]  to prepare and I have this clip queued up and I want to play this clip and get
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:48.640]  your comment on it yeah let's go ahead play the clip guys to put more eyes on
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.760]  the street APD is also relying heavily on technology they have a public safety
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:58.920]  camera system that continues to grow helping them solve crimes within minutes
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:02.760]  we know that there's a tremendous number of cameras in the in the private
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:07.040]  sector and right now we're working to try to get those private cameras in
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:15.160]  public places tied into our system so we can use those non-governmental cameras
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:21.000]  to put more eyes on the street APD is also relying heavily on use which means
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  that if you have let's say you have a restaurant on 6th Street the very
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.040]  happening Street here in Austin they want to be able to tap into those cameras
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:31.840]  now obviously if we had a situation like a Boston bombing or you know somebody
[02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:34.920]  mugged in the back alley you know hopefully the the business owner would
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.480]  provide the information to the police but to say that we want to be able to
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:43.360]  tap into your your video feed anytime we choose to that's a very unsettling
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:46.480]  thing we seen it happen over and over again where there's an incident like
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:51.320]  9-11 or a shooting and they come in and they take the recordings from they
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:54.440]  confiscate the recordings from the private companies and we never see them
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:57.560]  again yeah and that's exactly what happened when you said with 9-11 with
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.280]  the Pentagon yeah with all the the cameras around the Pentagon and they
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.000]  came to the various hotels and gas stations and what have you and
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.560]  confiscated those tapes they've not seen the light of day and then they show
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:12.320]  you this these few still images of it of the object striking the Pentagon that's
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:15.920]  right and when they've got cameras themselves spaced every few feet all
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.320]  around the perimeter of the Pentagon from every different angle and then they
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:22.720]  they never showed us any of those they confiscated the private cameras and so
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:25.920]  now they're doing this but I think there's something else going on here too
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:30.000]  and that is it was just a couple of days ago and this was linked on Drudge how
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:35.120]  malls are preparing to keep shoppers safe this holiday season by sending their
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.040]  camera feeds directly to the police department oh that's that's so lovely
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:44.680]  yeah and I think people are starting to understand that even implicitly they're
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.520]  understanding that the next place we're going to see violence is the malls
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:53.280]  because the TSA wants to continue to metastasize throughout society with these
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:57.320]  unconstitutional searches that they're doing oh exactly exactly and you always
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:01.800]  see these movies these futuristic video games and so forth and my question is my
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:05.080]  mind you know how do they get so much surveillance how do the people stand
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:09.200]  idly by and allow the police and the police state to place all these cameras
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:12.240]  everywhere because you know they have the traffic cams and you know other
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:16.440]  places yeah you know how do they get pretty much a 360 view of the city and
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:19.920]  it's things like this and it sounds good at the first you know you may catch a
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.080]  mug you may catch you know a bank robber or two but you're also giving up your
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:28.840]  privacy yeah they the city of Austin and which goes into a larger feed I'm sure
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.560]  can tap in and just watch you doing mundane activities which could be mundane
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:35.360]  it could be damning to you if you're doing if you're one of these thought
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:39.760]  criminals if you have a have on the wrong Halloween costume well going back
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:45.080]  to what happens when there is an incident take the LA shooting for example
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:49.840]  right at the airport we had all kinds of conflicting stories about what the
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:53.200]  shooter looked like mm-hmm first eyewitness reports that came out and the
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:57.480]  first reports from law enforcement were that he was wearing a blue TSA uniform
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:02.200]  right we heard that he was a heavy-set man and the guy who was saying that said
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:04.840]  he's much heavier than me and that guy was was fairly heavy and then we
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:09.360]  everything switches and we see that no he was actually wearing a camouflage
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:14.200]  uniform no he was actually a thin 23 year old mm-hmm we hear different
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:17.800]  descriptions of the gun that's being used right early witnesses eyewitness
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:21.360]  reports said that he was the first shots were made by this guy wearing a blue
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.280]  uniform with a pop a pump shotgun mm-hmm and then he switched to a pistol then
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:31.200]  when the official story comes out it's now an ar-15 which is the difference to
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.440]  go between a shotgun to a pistol to a ar-15 well that's the gun that they want
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:39.080]  to demonize all the time right it's the quote-unquote and salt assault rifle and
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:44.960]  yet talking about these cameras have we seen anything no to back up this radical
[02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:49.040]  change of narrative this is why people don't believe the government's official
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:54.280]  stories mm-hmm that and the fact that the timing is so suspicious as to why they
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:57.880]  would do this yes I also want to talk more about drills David because you
[02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:00.960]  talked about the LA X shooting mm-hmm let's talk of this for a second about
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:03.840]  the drill that was going on because we saw the police chief come out and said
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:06.920]  yeah we were running this exact same drill two or three weeks ago and you
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:10.040]  know the two guys in the back you know they're doing this doing this oh man
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:13.440]  he shouldn't have said that and and you know we see these drills happening all
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:16.640]  the time we don't just see him here we see him in Oklahoma City and other
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:20.400]  places yes and as well meaning as these police may be I'm not saying that
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:24.560]  everybody's in on you know whatever may have gone on but as well meaning as they
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:28.280]  may be even with these drills they cannot protect you all the time and I
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:30.640]  think that's something that people need to take away from these situations
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:34.200]  because I just this story last night on the nightly news about a woman who had
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:38.800]  multiple complaints against her ex-boyfriend and he said you know police
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.720]  come help me stay troopers come and help me and they said they were quote too
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.880]  busy to respond to her respond to her incident we also see the situations up
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:49.840]  in Detroit the police say come here at your own risk we cannot protect you but
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:53.880]  back to the drills we saw the police chief at LAX say that they were running
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:57.720]  the same drill and it's very unsettling to me and also to other people because
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:01.240]  we see these all the time with these following these mass shootings or before
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:05.560]  or even simultaneous with these mass shootings and bombings and so forth it
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.680]  gives them away and and they're doing so many drills now that you can they're
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:13.720]  kind of covering it up that way but we've seen over and over again like you
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:18.160]  said the exact same scenario exact same scenario at exactly the same time at
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:22.280]  exactly the same place and when they're doing a false flag what that allows them
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:27.600]  to do is if they're caught they can say it's simply a drill mm-hmm it also means
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:32.080]  that those first responders who are not in on what's happening think that it's
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:35.880]  part of the drill so they back off and they don't respond as quickly and so
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:39.040]  that's what we're concerned about when we see a drill the first thing we look at
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.440]  we see a drill we see all kinds of descriptions of what's happening there
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:48.040]  that are conflicting radically we see the story radically changing we see no
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:52.000]  footage of what actually happened just like in Boston we never saw the footage
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.800]  of the brothers except the fact that they're walking around the corner of a
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:58.760]  building with backpacks on we never saw the footage of them actually setting
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:02.160]  bags down as we were told by the governor and then when they questioned him
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:05.640]  further on it he said well I actually didn't see the footage it was described
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:09.880]  to me by the FBI so even the governor had not been shown this footage even
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:12.840]  though they've got cameras everywhere even though they're tapping in now to
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:16.600]  private cameras we're still not allowed to see this and we're supposed to
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:22.040]  credulously believe everything that the government tells us and if they change
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:26.160]  the story 180 degrees tomorrow we're supposed to just say oh well that's the
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:30.120]  new reality and forget forget what they told us a very day before this you
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:34.560]  brought up Boston and remember the the drill the University of Mobile Coach I
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:37.920]  believe it was the track coach so yeah you know you know when the thing was
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:41.320]  going on they said don't worry this is just a drill you know and then they said
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:45.280]  I believe it's a Boston Globe reported that they were having a bomb explosion or
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.840]  a mock bomb explosion something along those lines at the same time you know
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.720]  it's all these drills going on damn but Donnie's up there asking questions are
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:55.800]  they drills I said no they're not drills well the Boston Globe reported it we
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:58.960]  have eyewitness accounts of it or ear witness accounts of the people hearing
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:03.240]  it but that doesn't mean anything but it's still the issue that the TSA as we
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:07.760]  know can't protect anybody security experts have been telling us all along
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:10.160]  that everything that's going on the airport and you know it if you've been
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:12.920]  there you know that there's there's nothing that they're doing that is
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:16.760]  effective we know even in LAX they're one of their own employees one of the
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:19.600]  contractors are running around throwing ice cream people I mean they're
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:24.160]  terrorizing themselves that's right but but the guy who created it the the
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:28.000]  congressman from Florida said that he wanted to get rid of his bastard child
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:33.200]  because their success rate was so low when they sent trial people through with
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:37.040]  with bombs or with guns that they were not interjecting that they were not
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:39.720]  catching those things and so he said it's totally ineffective and everybody
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:43.480]  knows that it's not effective John Corbett who filed this lawsuit against the
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.560]  TSA he pointed out in the lawsuit that what they have done with these new
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.960]  procedures these invasive procedures the naked body scanners the invasive pat
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:55.320]  downs that violate our fourth amendment protection violate our dignity or
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:59.200]  freedom so what they've done is they've created massive lines at the entrance to
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:03.080]  the airport so you've got a massive people just standing around like
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:07.080]  targets oh yeah and somebody can walk up there that hasn't gone through
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:10.400]  screening and just start massively killing people because especially in
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:14.200]  California it's pretty much a gun-free zone throughout the state but certainly
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:16.800]  at the airports but in those airports they know that nobody is going to be
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:20.320]  armed and so they can basically kill the people that are waiting to go through
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:26.000]  these invasive procedures I think it's also very important to realize that John
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:31.760]  Corbett's lawsuit was published by the government on Pacer.gov they
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:36.240]  published both a they they published an unredacted version of his lawsuit he
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:40.640]  was able through discovery to look at their documents and see that they knew
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:44.000]  that there was no threat against airplanes or airports and they have
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.680]  known this for a long time exactly they've known this for a long time they
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.080]  do not want people to realize that we being that we're being harassed at the
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:56.800]  airports because when there's no threat against us they didn't want that to come
[02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:00.640]  out they desperately needed a threat and we know that they're aware of this
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.520]  because when he came on the show he's been on the show with I interviewed him
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:07.960]  Alex has interviewed him a couple of times we've done articles about the
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:13.480]  lawsuit because it was very interesting Pacer.gov is the place where all the
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.600]  federal lawsuits are posted and the government mistakenly posted the
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:22.120]  unredacted version so we can see what the TSA doesn't want us to know the TSA
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:26.600]  does not want us to know that there is no threat that they're protecting us from
[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:29.800]  and when they did that they took it down in the first place you know people
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.480]  slide through all the time with drugs and whatever else and it's a very
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:36.240]  arbitrary thing with sometimes you know you don't even get you don't even go
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:39.520]  through the naked body scanner they may have you go through the do just a pat
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:42.960]  down or something else and I don't like the pat down either yeah you know the
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:46.360]  pat down agent isn't going to catch something that could be seen on an x-ray
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.320]  scanner and John Corbett had produced a video he's quite an activist on the TSA
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:57.280]  he had produced a video there we got somebody now listen it's torture in me
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:00.640]  seeing that newscast we can do this on the nightly news or something we can
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:05.800]  look it up on that whole camera deal that started in Homeland Security about
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.520]  ten years ago in New York DC and Boston that's why they're here that's really an
[02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:14.120]  NSA Homeland Security deal and then they're trying to make it the law that
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.200]  if you're a business you've got a wire through you get insurance discounts
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.520]  including cameras inside and remember when they first put these cameras in 20
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:25.480]  years ago oh it's never for surveillance it's for traffic so the whole point is
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:29.800]  the government staging the terror attacks right so I mean I just saw you
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.280]  guys talking about it and you know for me for me that's really the big point
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.920]  here is that we need to understand that our days of data is definitely on the
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:45.240]  tip of the spear right into Texas with the feds to bring in these control grids
[02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:50.120]  that you can believe if just like the Boston bombing they had thousands of
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:53.400]  cameras and they cover up all the contractors in the backpacks and the
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:58.400]  Saudis and the dead bodies and I mean they staged it right okay and the Boston
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.040]  police covered it up my reporter was there they came in secret service had
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:06.960]  shot up don't ask questions FBI and they the government did that period it's a
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:11.280]  false fly just like Latio it's on record we proved it and they you know we know
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:16.240]  what they've done so getting back to the TSA we got that contest going $10,000
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:20.960]  to do a video on the TSA and NSA since they're trying to go after folks saying
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:25.280]  you can't criticize them we need to have folks go to the YouTube channel it's the
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.640]  featured deal and and watch that and get it out to folks and have all the
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:32.600]  filmmakers do this because when they try to censor free speech we redouble down
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:35.880]  start interrupt you guys that's right January 7th I don't mean like sitting
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:41.960]  like Igor sitting on a soldier but anyways folks it's time to get angry
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:45.240]  and stand up to these people they're trying to take over right now that's
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:48.480]  right one of the things that they hate is to be made fun of and this is your
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.120]  perfect opportunity and you can you can take satisfaction of that plus you can
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:55.920]  also win $10,000 and that data is a great way to start off the year January the
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:00.200]  7th I think it is a deadline yeah yeah go to info wars.com and get the full
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:04.240]  contest rules we always stress the people follow the contest rules David
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:08.520]  you just a contest I've just a contest and a lot of the problems we have it's
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.000]  people that don't follow the rules make sure you follow all the rules get it in
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.240]  on time the proper length there's rules like no profanity and so forth so make
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.080]  sure you follow those guidelines it's a way to really get under their skin they
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:23.380]  hate that they knew what was going on with the John Corbett lawsuit as well
[02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:28.320]  as soon as we had him on they put a gag order on him and said you can't talk
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:31.920]  about that so he could talk about the fact that he had been gagged and his
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.960]  first amendment rights have been shut up but the stuff is out there it's in
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:41.480]  public domain now the fact that he quoted these documents from the TSA
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.080]  internally saying that terrorists were simply working on fundraising recruiting
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:50.360]  and propagandizing and that's exactly what we see the TSA doing they're
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.160]  recruiting fundraising and propagandizing the terrorists have one
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.040]  because absolutely agenda is to change our way of life whoever the terrorists
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:01.480]  may be and may not always be al-qaeda you know whoever the terrorists is their
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.400]  goals to change our way of life and now we have to they laugh I bet they watch
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:08.840]  these reports and laugh aha you get you get felt up at the airport you get in
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.440]  naked body scan they're tapping into your your private security fees are
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.480]  tapping into your phone they're doing all this we've they've won that's right
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:21.440]  and we see the metastasizing security status as Alex pointed out having these
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.080]  cameras everywhere and feeding them back to the government to their fusion
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.160]  centers so they can watch as it's an absolute total surveillance state it's
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:32.320]  everything in your digital life everything in your physical life they
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:35.840]  want to track your cars they want to know how much you've driven where you've
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:39.640]  driven when you've driven they want to tax you and they want to control you oh
[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:43.720]  yeah they want to control your internet searches all that all of that yeah now
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:46.840]  David I have some more news when we we're talking about these drills at lax I
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.720]  just want to bring people's attention I've gotten some emails and some things
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:54.120]  on the tips here telling us about drills that are going on this very weekend here
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:59.080]  in the state of Texas now these are in the Dallas Fort Worth area and from what
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:02.640]  I understand it's multiple drills at multiple locations so I don't know all
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:06.920]  the all the details on it and here's one if we can pull up that article from the
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:12.080]  Arlington voice a men opposition council approves urban shield exercise now
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:16.400]  urban shield also did a exercise a drill in Boston before the Boston bombing
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:20.240]  and we saw how effective that was at actually stopping a terrorist event
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:23.240]  they just had an urban shield in California towards the end of October
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:26.640]  two yes yes so I mean these things are these and then we had a shooting in LA
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:31.080]  yeah wasn't exactly the same area but it's kind of interesting thanks now if
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:35.280]  you look the article says urban shield is described as a full-scale exercise meant
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:39.680]  to test North Texas's ability to respond to simultaneous terrorist attacks in
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:42.800]  emergency scenarios I know we're going to break so we can talk a little bit
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:46.080]  more about this on the other side so I will be right back I'm here in studio
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:50.440]  with Jacari Jackson and we're talking about the burgeoning metastasizing
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:55.040]  police state cameras everywhere and drills constantly being conducted against

[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:16.440]  joined here in studio with Jakari Jackson and we've just been talking about the
[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:22.480]  traveling road show that the government has training for economic collapse or
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:27.080]  shutting off all of the food stamps or crashing the dollar whatever it seems
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:31.000]  like everything the government is doing domestically is gearing up for this
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.120]  impending crash and now we've got Operation Urban Shield coming to Dallas
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:38.800]  don't we? That's exactly right David now Urban Shield is gonna be taking place in

[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:18.200]  ask how can I get right how can I help just go film these things send them to
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:22.800]  us we'll put it up on info wars.com absolutely now Obama was just in Dallas
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:27.360]  defending Obamacare and we've got this clip from it let's take a look at what
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:30.440]  he was just yesterday he was in Dallas so let's take a look at what he had to say
[02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:35.060]  if you've got health care already then you can keep your plan if you are
[02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:38.940]  satisfied with it if you like the plan you have you can keep it I intend to
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:42.620]  keep this promise if you like your health care plan you'll be able to keep
[02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:46.440]  your health care plan you like your plan and your doctor you can keep them
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:50.640]  you'll be able to keep your health care plan if you like your plan you keep
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:54.640]  your play sure like your doctor you like your plan you can keep your doctor you
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:55.640]  You can keep your plan.
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.480]  You like your current insurance, you keep that insurance, period.
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:04.500]  One of the things that sometimes gets me a little frustrated, although I understand it
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:15.800]  because I'm in politics, is folks who are complaining about how the website's not working.
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:20.040]  The first month I've not been happy with.
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:29.720]  You've all heard about the website woes, nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:36.920]  now there's great insurance to be had out there, choice and competition, where people
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:42.920]  can save money for a better product, except too many folks haven't been able to get through
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:43.920]  the website.
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:49.920]  Now, this is like having a really good product in a store and the cash registers don't
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:57.400]  work and there are enough parking spots and nobody can get through the door and so we
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:00.760]  are working overtime to get this fixed.
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:07.080]  Now, as you recall, David, we had John McAfee of McAfee Antibuyers software here in studio
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:10.240]  and he said he was asked to participate in the Obamacare website.
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:12.400]  He said flat out that site is not designed to work.
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:13.640]  Mike Adams said the same thing.
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:16.640]  It's amazing to hear him defend this because what he is doing is he's saying, you know,
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:20.680]  there's great insurance to be had out there, but we've created this massive bottleneck that
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:21.960]  you can't get to it.
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:26.080]  So it's still a great plan, but you just can't get to it because we've created a bottleneck.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.360]  The government does that everywhere.
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:29.960]  They do it whenever there's a major disaster and FEMA comes in.
[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:31.120]  They create a bottleneck.
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:35.760]  They keep private individuals, churches, charities from being able to deliver stuff
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:37.400]  to people who need it.
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:41.160]  They always create this bottleneck and that's all this website, that's all Obamacare is,
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:45.480]  but I mentioned at the beginning of the program, what we're getting now are the unelection returns.
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:48.640]  You know, it's not just the election that was Tuesday, but we're finding out that you
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:54.000]  got 900,000 people kicked out of their plans that they wanted, plans that they chose, plans
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.600]  that they thought were good, plans that in fact were better because they had deductibles
[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:01.920]  that were anywhere from two to five times cheaper.
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:07.120]  They had insurance monthly payments that were two to five times cheaper as well.
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:12.600]  We see another quarter of a million people unelected from their choices in Colorado.
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:14.120]  So it's going on everywhere.
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:18.480]  Oh, definitely, so this is what you wanted, if this is what you wanted with the Obamacare,
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:19.480]  now you have it.
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:20.480]  Great.
[02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:21.480]  Great defense.
[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:22.480]  Yeah, it's a great product.
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:27.880]  You just can't get to it because of his poorly designed, untested, unfinished website.
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:29.280]  Well, that's it for today.
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:31.400]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:32.800]  Join us then.
[02:58:32.800 --> 02:58:34.240]  And for War's Nightly News tonight.
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:44.240]  That's right.
