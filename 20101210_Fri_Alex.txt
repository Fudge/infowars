[02:00.400 --> 02:05.840]  this news in front of me i've got so many incredible stacks we're gonna get into
[02:05.840 --> 02:12.400]  ron paul author of in the fed to lead panel overseeing the central bank that's
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.160]  out of bloomberg speaking of bloomberg he's gonna run for president i mean that
[02:17.160 --> 02:24.160]  it much is clear and bloomberg's non-campaign for president is basically
[02:24.160 --> 02:27.120]  behaving just like someone who's getting ready to run for president so is rick
[02:27.120 --> 02:33.280]  parry the governor of texas and bloomberg is not a quote independent
[02:33.280 --> 02:40.760]  bloomberg is more extreme than even other members of the democratic party he
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.240]  should be a member of the communist party the way he behaves and michael
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.960]  bloomberg is just totally anti-second amendment he wants to try to tax you or
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.520]  arrest restauranteers if they put too much salt in your food he is the
[02:58.520 --> 03:04.480]  antithesis of the type of person we need as a president in a free republic he
[03:04.480 --> 03:08.240]  would it be a great president or big brother in an imaginary world like
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.920]  nice 84 or if we could teleport him back to Stalinist Russia or malice china so
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.560]  bloomberg we've got to start beating the drum against that guy and of course rick
[03:18.560 --> 03:23.240]  parry's horrible as well another establishment type but at least he isn't
[03:23.240 --> 03:29.320]  for banning your guns so that is coming up also i've got mixed feelings about
[03:29.320 --> 03:31.920]  this and i meant to talk about it yesterday i'm gonna try to get into it
[03:31.920 --> 03:38.160]  some today but we are jam-packed with guests incentives for machete denied the
[03:38.160 --> 03:44.120]  awesome america statesman reports the film is a basically like a ford
[03:44.120 --> 03:50.920]  foundation liberation theology racial division film that shows texas
[03:50.920 --> 03:54.480]  lawmakers in cowboy hats shooting pregnant hispanics in the stomach and
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.720]  basically every white person is a screaming racist who needs to die with
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.520]  a mexican uprising race war and i just pointed out that if the texas film
[04:03.520 --> 04:10.920]  commission denied funding on on on tax breaks to a film about weiko because they
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.600]  thought it showed texas in a bad light that they have to deny funding of this
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.160]  now i said don't deny the funding they need to change the texas law where sure
[04:19.160 --> 04:23.240]  have tax incentives for film but government shouldn't be involved in
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.240]  what the messages are after all we're not east germany or at least we weren't
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.600]  in the past and now they've denied them it's gonna be at least 1.7 million and
[04:33.600 --> 04:38.560]  i just puts a bad taste in my mouth but justice be done may the heavens fall it
[04:38.560 --> 04:41.960]  was you the listeners in this radio show that caused the film commission to do
[04:41.960 --> 04:46.760]  this there's no doubt about that it's an outrageous hispanic version of birth
[04:46.760 --> 04:52.320]  of a nation and it's it's despicable but nevertheless boy i bet robert
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.680]  rodriguez doesn't like me too much we'll be right back with all the rest of the

[07:21.840 --> 07:26.880]  us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.680]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying

[07:35.680 --> 07:39.600]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[07:39.600 --> 07:43.680]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[08:42.880 --> 08:49.720]  the networks are still still had funds so very interesting to have the CBC here
[08:49.720 --> 08:57.600]  they have a show called the fifth of state that I have found is the fairest
[08:57.600 --> 09:03.520]  media a program that I've seen of anything around the world when it comes
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.440]  to really looking at 9-11 when it comes to researching the different views that
[09:11.440 --> 09:17.320]  are out there so this isn't for the fifth of state is for another show but I
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.600]  look forward to seeing what they what they produce coming up on this airs
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.680]  sometime next year okay folks we've got Rand Paul popping in towards the end of

[09:32.680 --> 09:39.000]  down in Mexico with the new attempt to openly set up a world dictatorship
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.800]  through the phony green movement we also are going to be talking to Bob
[09:46.800 --> 09:51.720]  Chapman of international forecaster and Michael Michael Braverman and I tell
[09:51.720 --> 09:59.880]  you when it rains it pours let me let me turn my phone ringer off here it's a
[09:59.880 --> 10:06.240]  crazy crazy show here today let me just run down some of what we're going to be
[10:06.240 --> 10:12.040]  covering Pentagon papers whistleblower calls for a new 9-1-1 investigation
[10:12.040 --> 10:18.080]  Daniel Ellsberg oh going back three years ago was on this show and basically
[10:18.080 --> 10:21.840]  said he questioned the official story of 9-11 and then we went with that
[10:21.840 --> 10:26.160]  headline and he contacted us back that day and said well that's what I said but
[10:26.160 --> 10:29.920]  that's not exactly what I meant I'm getting a lot of heat for this and we
[10:29.920 --> 10:37.000]  said okay whatever we'll change the headline and but I mean he said what he
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.720]  said well now he's back in the news today and the main players in releasing
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.000]  the Pentagon papers were Daniel Ellsberg and Senator Mike Ravel Ellsberg of
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.840]  course the former military analyst and famed whistleblower from the Rand
[10:50.840 --> 10:54.960]  Corporation who smuggle the Pentagon papers out senator Ravel the person who
[10:54.960 --> 10:59.120]  read the papers in the congressional record this act made the papers public
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.640]  record so that they could not be censored by the government Ellsberg and
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.560]  Ravel are receiving a lot of media attention right now for their support
[11:05.560 --> 11:10.200]  of WikiLeaks like let's get senator Ravel on for some reason we can't ever
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.520]  get Ellsberg back on but try to get me a Ravel next week guys I want to get him
[11:14.520 --> 11:19.000]  on but little attention has been paid to Ellsberg and Ravel support for a new
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.880]  9-11 investigation well I mean I know Ravel's been on before I know he's been
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.640]  promoting it Ellsberg says that the case of a certain 9-11 whistleblower is far
[11:27.640 --> 11:32.760]  more explosive than the Pentagon papers and of course that is Sybil Edmonds who
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.600]  was an FBI translator listening to NSA communicates and she told the 9-11
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.920]  Commission what was really going on in closed session and she was gagged they
[11:43.920 --> 11:46.720]  said you know honey come here and tell us what you know and she went and told
[11:46.720 --> 11:49.680]  them and then they said okay your international security don't tell
[11:49.680 --> 11:58.800]  anybody well she broke about a year ago that gag order and said to the world I
[11:58.800 --> 12:03.920]  listened to transmissions this is Sybil Edmonds with the CIA commanding Al
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.480]  Qaeda and other criminal groups in narcotics trafficking weapons trafficking
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.080]  child kidnapping I mean just every form of evil you can imagine oh and what's in
[12:14.080 --> 12:20.360]  the Houston press what's in other news today WikiLeaks Texas company helped
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.840]  pimp little boys in Afghanistan I mean this is always coming out about Dine
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.640]  Corps it's been congressional hearings and oh now they have it on Fox oh we
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.720]  have to help the Taliban grow the opium that's being breaking records in its
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.200]  production and shipping and in to the US or Al Qaeda will get the money see now
[12:39.200 --> 12:43.560]  they hide it all in plain view in spy talk in the Washington Post the CIA comes
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.840]  out a few months ago and says yeah we made a fake bin Laden video they come
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.240]  out and they admit yeah we lied about WMD's they come out and go yeah we're
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.200]  helping them grow the opium yeah you know it's in federal court that black
[12:56.200 --> 13:01.800]  water now XC it's coming out in these sworn depositions about the naked
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.920]  parties the drugs the shooting people for fun on the highways we've already got
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.840]  video of other contractors and troops killing people for fun we have all of
[13:11.840 --> 13:17.280]  this information and just more and more of it comes out it turns out the Iraqis
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.520]  were telling the truth about the contractors and others just running
[13:20.520 --> 13:26.400]  around shooting up buildings and cars and people in broad daylight for fun
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.160]  in fact we first learned about it because many of these contractors and
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.760]  and groups would would put Elvis music to it and and post it on YouTube of them
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.880]  just sitting off the side of the highway just shooting up minivans and cars in
[13:40.880 --> 13:48.000]  downtown Baghdad for their own enjoyment when you don't have any oversight when
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.080]  you have the CIA operating in secret since 1947 when you have the trillions
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.120]  of dollars that have been spent on black budget programs you're going to have
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.280]  corruption and it's going to get worse and worse and worse and more and more
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.720]  crazy people who who are sadistic and control freaks and who enjoy hurting
[14:06.720 --> 14:12.520]  people bloodthirsty individuals are going to get into positions of power and
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.160]  so what we know is there has been basically a competition in Western
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.920]  governments and the last 60 years or so to see who can be more corrupt who can
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.680]  be more deceptive who can lie the best who can make the biggest payoffs who can
[14:28.680 --> 14:34.680]  steal the most money and the population not just of the United States or Europe
[14:34.680 --> 14:38.800]  or Canada but the entire population in the world is beginning to wake up to this
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.720]  fact what did Zbigniew Brzezinski say just a few months ago addressing the
[14:43.720 --> 14:48.560]  Council on Foreign Relations Canada branch he said for the first time in
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.880]  history humanity is awake and staring staring at the elite staring at the
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.800]  global power blocks the Anglo-American establishment and that there's going to
[14:57.800 --> 15:04.120]  be intensified resistance to globalism and the once arrogant Council on
[15:04.120 --> 15:09.840]  Foreign Relations look like they've seen a ghost look like they'd open their
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.440]  front door and seen a monster at it and Frankenstein they're scared and that
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.440]  makes the ruling class very very dangerous right now people know they've
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.200]  been lied to over and over again people know that special interests are
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.040]  controlling the major governments of the planet individuals have lost
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.440]  confidence in the system and for a good reason and how is the establishment
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.120]  responding worldwide with police state with surveillance with secret police
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.040]  with provocateurs with intimidation
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.640]  CNN and others have reported that tourism is down the last five years of the
[15:48.640 --> 15:56.400]  United States by upwards of 34% that $9 billion a year conservatively is being
[15:56.400 --> 16:02.200]  lost because foreigners whether it's from Africa or Asia or Latin America or
[16:02.200 --> 16:08.360]  Europe don't want to come here they know a Orwellian police state when they see
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.280]  it they know when TSA is groping them and sticking their hands down their
[16:12.280 --> 16:18.200]  pants and putting them in the naked body scanners that this isn't freedom they
[16:18.200 --> 16:23.840]  know when major retail stores across the United States put literal telescreens
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.880]  in at the checkout counters saying watch other shoppers report to Homeland
[16:27.880 --> 16:34.840]  Security they know that that's creepy absurdist almost cartoon level
[16:34.840 --> 16:44.080]  corruption I mean it it it's hard to believe even as it happens because it's
[16:44.080 --> 16:52.840]  so wild it's so bizarre it's like a Kurt Vonnegut book that he will you know
[16:52.840 --> 16:57.120]  wrote back in the 1950s about an absurdist police state future it's that
[16:57.120 --> 17:04.440]  crazy of course we know Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 truther Kurt sent me a signed
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.920]  lithograph he did of the open birdcage and I had a chance to talk to him and
[17:09.920 --> 17:13.120]  his assistant as well but he thought that he was too old to do any more
[17:13.120 --> 17:19.800]  interviews and he'd already sworn six months before at a final speech at a
[17:19.800 --> 17:23.760]  university that that would be his last and then he died a few months after I
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.240]  was contacted by him that was too bad but of course Kurt Vonnegut did know 9-11
[17:28.240 --> 17:33.320]  was an inside job and Daniel Ellsberg saying investigated and six of the ten
[17:33.320 --> 17:37.400]  commissioners are saying the Pentagon criminally lied and covered up what
[17:37.400 --> 17:43.960]  really happened so that tiny scared minority that crouches down and licks
[17:43.960 --> 17:50.640]  the hand of tyranny that that tells the majority of us that are not even smart
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.120]  but but but not brain dead not brain dead to the point that we recognize
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.560]  absurd tyranny when we see it and now that they've gone from the enhanced
[18:00.560 --> 18:04.640]  pat downs to the super rape pat downs where they stick their hands under your
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.000]  blouse or in your pants and actually grab your genitals this happened to Ron
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.840]  Paul it's happened to Jesse Ventura where they grabbed from the outside now the
[18:14.840 --> 18:20.440]  head Indian ambassador from India is saying that she will never come to the
[18:20.440 --> 18:27.200]  United States again that's a that's a quote has vowed to never return to
[18:27.200 --> 18:32.240]  America after being confined to a glass cage and groped and if you complain
[18:32.240 --> 18:36.080]  they'll leave you in the glass cage for hours and when you miss your flight they
[18:36.080 --> 18:42.720]  laugh at you minimum wage brown shirts on a gunish power trip and this isn't
[18:42.720 --> 18:47.920]  just confined to the United States when I flew in to cover Bilderberg in Ottawa
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.720]  in 2006 they screamed at me they cussed at me they told me they were gonna send
[18:53.720 --> 19:00.400]  me to prison they told me I wasn't gonna be allowed to to go and and cover the
[19:00.400 --> 19:06.920]  conference until the media CBC radio locally found out about it and came down
[19:06.920 --> 19:10.800]  there and then they turned ashen white and came in apologize and said please
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.200]  don't tell him I was mean to you I have a daughter I don't want her to lose her
[19:14.200 --> 19:20.440]  job and they let me go but when the Polish immigrant after close to a day of
[19:20.440 --> 19:24.520]  confinement through a fit they just went in and beat him to death this stuff is
[19:24.520 --> 19:31.520]  going on all over the world tyranny is here and so the insanity of all of this
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.760]  is coming home to roost and people aren't going along with it anymore
[19:37.760 --> 19:44.160]  that's why the system is in trouble they're trying to buffalo us and just
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.840]  overwhelm us with all this crazy corruption to where we just give up and
[19:47.840 --> 19:54.520]  roll over and give in but see that can backfire and it is when a pimp's breaking

[25:31.000 --> 25:35.640]  martial law and the Pentagon putting out reports on it you mean you don't like
[25:35.640 --> 25:39.560]  the private fellow reserve telling Congress that they're not gonna tell our
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.160]  elected representatives where the trillions have gone you don't like
[25:44.160 --> 25:48.920]  obese people in in in in jack boot uniform sticking their hands in your

[26:16.160 --> 26:21.440]  realize that government's gotten too big it's out of control the super state
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.800]  tells us everything it does is for our own good that meanwhile the government
[26:25.800 --> 26:29.680]  puts sodium fluoride in the water which every major scientist we talked to you
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.240]  out there and all the government's own internal reports admit causes lowered IQ
[26:33.240 --> 26:38.520]  massive increases in bone cancer hundreds of thousands of people die every
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.200]  year of bad drug interactions and they know all about that but they approve it

[27:12.840 --> 27:17.120]  turning into one giant FEMA camp here's another report on it by Steve Watson
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.960]  TSA subjects Indian ambassador to US to glass cage enhanced groping the Indian
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.400]  Embassy in Washington is to issue a formal complaint to the US State
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.040]  Department following the treatment of a leading Indian diplomat at the hands of
[27:30.040 --> 27:35.240]  the TSA Indian Ambassador United States Mira Shankar pictured above with
[27:35.240 --> 27:39.840]  President Obama was pulled out of a security line at Jackson Evers International
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.520]  Airport in Mississippi see normally they'd be flying in diplomatic planes but
[27:43.520 --> 27:48.760]  oh she had to fly with the commoners taken into what has become known as the
[27:48.760 --> 27:54.240]  TSA glass cage and forced to undergo an enhanced pat down in full view of the
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.120]  public and guess what she says she's never coming here again that's how
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.760]  people respond but Americans have like frogs in the cold water and they turn
[28:03.760 --> 28:06.800]  the heat up slow and we're like oh this is like a hot tub then we kind of pass
[28:06.800 --> 28:10.600]  out but now we're kind of waking up that the water is actually boiling and going
[28:10.600 --> 28:14.640]  I might want to jump out of this pot and the government the media are like no
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.720]  it's a conspiracy theory having hands stuck down your pants is freedom you

[28:25.040 --> 28:31.200]  freedom Wesley Snipes going to prison for not reportedly paying taxes is good
[28:31.200 --> 28:36.520]  but wrangle only getting censured a slap on the wrist that's freedom
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.240]  Geithner the Treasury Secretary you know not paying a lot of his taxes that's

[28:52.360 --> 28:56.000]  corruption you know why they look at you like there's something wrong with you
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.360]  because deep down they're afraid they know life's crazy but they have no respect
[29:01.360 --> 29:04.880]  for themselves and so they just decide to laugh it off or look at you like your
[29:04.880 --> 29:09.360]  nuts they look at you like your nuts because they're upset they're scared and
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.600]  they've bought into the lie that everything's okay and so they've got to
[29:13.600 --> 29:17.760]  continue to rationalize and tell themselves that there's no problems and
[29:17.760 --> 29:22.360]  so now they've accepted bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger lies oh they
[29:22.360 --> 29:25.320]  can put their hands down your pants put you through a naked body scanner why not

[29:33.440 --> 29:37.760]  hired to watch their flocks and spy on them for Homeland Security under the
[29:37.760 --> 29:41.640]  clergy response team and to tell their flocks submit to government it's of the

[34:11.640 --> 34:16.040]  get into that but now one of the people that's been put in pressure is in the
[34:16.040 --> 34:23.520]  news this congressman Cohen and I'll be talking more about that next week but
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.440]  regardless people better pay attention to these shows because Lord knows you
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.480]  will ever see him again and tonight I was down there with Ventura and the
[34:30.480 --> 34:34.400]  Gulf Coast investigating this you think you know everything that happened with
[34:34.400 --> 34:39.120]  that Gulf oil spill they've done an in-depth investigation that is just as
[34:39.120 --> 34:45.200]  powerful as the water show they did last week or the program on JFK or the
[34:45.200 --> 34:50.720]  police state episode that upset the homeland security people so much but
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.680]  we're going to Michael here in just a moment but before I go there Paul Watson
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.760]  has a new article out I don't watch Clint Beck very often as I'm busy doing my
[34:58.760 --> 35:04.240]  own show I just have been told by people at Fox News that Beck does have a team
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.240]  of people watching our show tracking it and more and more in the last two years
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.200]  much of what you see on his show the research came originally from this
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.960]  radio show which I think is great I mean I just want to get the word out and
[35:16.960 --> 35:22.240]  expose the New World Order the problem is that Glenn Beck will then kind of
[35:22.240 --> 35:27.920]  backtrack and stab Ron Paul in the back or demonize people that question FEMA
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.280]  camps or demonize 9-11 truthers but then a month ago he came out we played the
[35:32.280 --> 35:35.960]  clip and said the government's getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City and
[35:35.960 --> 35:41.720]  blame it on conservatives well wait a minute Glenn you're a traitor if you
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.560]  say the government might be staging terror attacks if you're Alex Jones but
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.840]  then when you say it it's okay well now he's coming out saying wiki leaks is
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.840]  is good when he was saying it was bad a week ago and and now there's this
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.560]  development Glenn Beck channels Alex Jones economic crisis food riots and
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.640]  martial law coming well that's what the Pentagon says and I've been screaming
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.880]  bloody murder about these declassified documents for three years of course they
[36:09.880 --> 36:14.840]  know it's coming the big banks that run our country engineered it and we may be
[36:14.840 --> 36:18.800]  able to stop it though if they think we're not gonna go along with it they'll
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.760]  back off if imitation is the most sincere form of a flattery should we be
[36:24.760 --> 36:29.200]  elated or alarm that Fox News host Glenn Beck now sounds almost identical to
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.600]  Alex Jones earlier this week on his television program Glenn talked about
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.240]  Pentagon war games which featured National Guard soldiers training to take
[36:38.240 --> 36:44.000]  on protesters holding signs with the words food now scrawled on them yeah
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.080]  and I've been to urban warfare drills 11 years ago where they scream I'm an
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.040]  American please know not the camp and they say where do you come from well I
[36:52.040 --> 36:56.800]  came from San Francisco where'd you get the gun and the Marines even have a guy
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.440]  get on his knees and they say watch this execution of course I started warning
[37:01.440 --> 37:07.320]  everybody and I put the video out it's called police state 2000 and then Glenn
[37:07.320 --> 37:12.560]  Beck years ago attack Ron Paul myself and others saying we were nuts now he's
[37:12.560 --> 37:19.000]  changing I mean when you go videotape Marines and army even 60 minutes did and
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.280]  show them using microwave guns on citizens you know people playing the part
[37:23.280 --> 37:27.080]  of citizens and drills I mean they're gearing up for war with us it's
[37:27.080 --> 37:31.200]  unconstitutional it's tyrannical and they were doing this a decade ago for a
[37:31.200 --> 37:37.680]  financial collapse right when they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act it
[37:37.680 --> 37:41.480]  continues here on Beck's website the blaze a lengthy article appeared in which
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.120]  the author warned the military is preparing its domestic response to a
[37:45.120 --> 37:48.760]  political economic collapse focused around civil unrest over lack of food
[37:48.760 --> 37:52.840]  caused by the financial crisis of course we were talking about this years
[37:52.840 --> 37:57.440]  ago and at the time Beck labeled us domestic extremists and said the army
[37:57.440 --> 38:02.480]  might need to be used against us remember that for doing so Beck had a
[38:02.480 --> 38:09.080]  complete change of heart or is this 180 degree flip regarding WikiLeaks
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.840]  Julian Assange is realizing that the threat posed by those who wish to abolish
[38:13.840 --> 38:17.640]  free speech the United States is far greater than any harm done by WikiLeaks
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.240]  itself suggests that Beck is starting to see beyond the left-right paradigm
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.360]  and you know he said that he just a year ago thought the judge Napolitano was
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.280]  kind of crazy now he totally agrees with him and we know Napolitano is on
[38:31.280 --> 38:37.080]  board with Liberty he came out and said that 9-11 what we know of 9-11 is a lie
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.560]  and that it will be seen in the history books just like the JFK assassination as
[38:41.560 --> 38:46.200]  a fraud and the article continues and we've asked the question time and time
[38:46.200 --> 38:51.560]  again but to know real answer if Beck continues to talk like this will Fox News
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.640]  allow him to stay on the air or is the whole thing all part of a revelation of
[38:56.640 --> 39:00.960]  the method process back is on the verge of going head-to-head with the same
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.080]  military industrial complex that will enforce any martial law scenario the
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.480]  same entity that finds and controls and the corporate media which provides
[39:11.480 --> 39:17.120]  Beck with his platform this dichotomy seems incontrovertible but it's
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.240]  certainly going to be interesting to see how such a seemingly discordant
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.880]  conflict plays out in the long run and I'm glad that Michael Braverman is here
[39:26.880 --> 39:32.840]  because everything that we cover in the incredible police state FEMA camp episode
[39:32.840 --> 39:38.920]  of November 12th now back two years after saying there's no plan to arrest
[39:38.920 --> 39:44.120]  Americans by the military is now coming out and admitting it so why does he get
[39:44.120 --> 39:50.560]  to talk about it Michael but but but the episode of police states gone well I
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.720]  tell you it's amazing about it's amazing about back and how he kind of flip
[39:55.720 --> 40:00.840]  flops but I think what's happening is is people are beginning to see the light
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.120]  Alex and you've been you know out there kind of screaming in the wilderness for
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.880]  all these years I just want to say one thing about the police state before we
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.120]  move on and this again you know I always talk to you and we always get you know
[40:12.120 --> 40:16.880]  kind of get into things so what I always say to your listeners and to people don't
[40:16.880 --> 40:21.640]  take my word for it don't take Alex's word for it go on your computer hit
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.080]  Google and and hit the the words I'm going to tell you and you'll see it it
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.800]  comes up and one of the things that really struck me and then if we can move
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.840]  on to the Gulf oil conspiracy but the thing that really struck me was I went
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.760]  to the Missouri Fusion Center remember we talked about the Fusion Centers it's
[40:39.760 --> 40:44.000]  called the Missouri Intelligence Analysis Center me and you can go right on you
[40:44.000 --> 40:50.760]  can look at their thing and right in the me act website you will see a thing
[40:50.760 --> 40:54.880]  about how to identify a domestic terrorist and it goes on and it talks
[40:54.880 --> 40:57.520]  about a bunch of stuff and that you get this is written by a bunch of you know
[40:57.520 --> 41:01.480]  probably moronic bureaucrats you know sit in a room very proud of themselves but
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.440]  here's what they say sometimes domestic terrorists can be identified by the
[41:06.440 --> 41:14.120]  third-party affiliation that they have look for Ron Paul stickers on cars it's
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.600]  right there in black and white generally people carrying around the movies
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.280]  zeitgeist might be people you want to look in but you know you might want to
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.000]  check into oh and by the way anybody who attacks the Federal Reserve yeah you
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.080]  might want to kind of stoop on them too and one last group one last group of
[41:31.080 --> 41:35.440]  dangerous and desperadoes is out there that we really need to spy on and that
[41:35.440 --> 41:41.400]  group conspiracy theorists well that's what Cass Sunstein at the White House
[41:41.400 --> 41:47.360]  says he says arrest people find people who criticize the government now we
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.280]  have the FCC Commissioner coming out and saying that freedom of speech in the
[41:52.280 --> 41:58.080]  media it was an aberration and that the government's gonna decide just like in
[41:58.080 --> 42:01.960]  East Germany what we're gonna see I mean this is really happening and the
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.840]  ruling class knows the people are waking up and so Glenn Beck and others
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.280]  cannot ignore you know the real audience anymore people see it can you go on the
[42:12.280 --> 42:15.160]  internet you can see you can see what these guys did you know then they you
[42:15.160 --> 42:18.160]  know then when a bunch of public outcry happened in Missouri then of course they
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.520]  pulled it they said no no no we didn't really mean that no no you know we were
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.520]  just kidding you know we didn't really mean that that was just an internal
[42:24.520 --> 42:27.840]  document we have hundreds of other federally written documents that mirror
[42:27.840 --> 42:32.080]  that I mean this is all written by the feds and now they admit quote domestic
[42:32.080 --> 42:36.680]  extremist are the number one threat it's not the foreign turban demand that's
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.960]  right from the caves but no now it's that returning veteran that's right and
[42:40.960 --> 42:43.920]  you know people think you know it's just a bunch of conspiracy theorists and a
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.600]  bunch of nuts just ask yourself let's say you like Ron Paul and let's say you
[42:48.600 --> 42:51.680]  put a Ron Paul sticker on your car and you drive around with your on Paul
[42:51.680 --> 42:54.840]  sticker and oh by the way maybe have a couple books on the federal reserve in
[42:54.840 --> 43:00.400]  your car you have automatically branded yourself a target just because you
[43:00.400 --> 43:03.840]  exercise your right free speech you write the political expression and you
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.160]  suck around Paul sticker on your car now me I you know again as you I always say
[43:08.160 --> 43:11.680]  Alex and I come to this you know I'm an agnostic and I kind of come to this you
[43:11.680 --> 43:14.200]  know I came to this with an open mind and you know there's certain things that
[43:14.200 --> 43:17.760]  you know we may disagree on and there's certain things I think really don't pan
[43:17.760 --> 43:22.560]  out this one does it's right there and I don't want to be living a country where
[43:22.560 --> 43:25.640]  if I put a political sticker on my car I mean maybe I'm gonna support the Green
[43:25.640 --> 43:29.000]  Party maybe I'm gonna support the Peace and Freedom Party maybe I'm gonna
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.680]  support you know the Alex Jones Party well that's what's happening is the
[43:34.680 --> 43:38.560]  ruling class the private federal reserve that's stolen trillions of
[43:38.560 --> 43:41.640]  dollars and won't tell Congress where the money is they're threatened by us
[43:41.640 --> 43:47.040]  going out speaking to fellow citizens creating political movements and taking
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.520]  our nation back peacefully I mean it is we the people right but but now we see
[43:52.520 --> 43:57.280]  that Homeland Security is pointed at peaceful political movements and they
[43:57.280 --> 44:00.600]  want to create a chilling effect but it's not working you know the Boehner the
[44:00.600 --> 44:04.840]  congressman tried to block Ron Paul becoming the head of the oversight
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.880]  committee that controls the Federal Reserve Ron Paul somebody who wants to
[44:08.880 --> 44:12.760]  abolish the Federal Reserve he's now the chairman of that committee you know we
[44:12.760 --> 44:17.320]  we run this country and if we want to get the private Federal Reserve out of
[44:17.320 --> 44:20.720]  our nation and abolish it instead of it being the second largest owner of our
[44:20.720 --> 44:24.880]  debt it's our right to do it and it's in the Constitution that the Congress
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.640]  should control the issuance of currency and credit not some private banking
[44:28.640 --> 44:33.280]  consortium and here's Bloomberg today Ron Paul author of in the Fed to lead
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.680]  panel overseeing central bank so it's our country we're taking the states back
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.920]  we're taking the federal government back we're not extremist we're Americans
[44:42.920 --> 44:47.160]  we're the majority we have the common sense and these foreign corporations that
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.500]  have come in and taken over our government and sucked it dry of corporate
[44:50.500 --> 44:53.880]  welfare and that are bankrupting our country they're gonna be brought to
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.280]  justice through the political system and that's why the establishment stages
[44:58.280 --> 45:02.840]  terror attacks it's why they engage in all this demonization is because they
[45:02.840 --> 45:07.440]  want to play the part of the good guys protecting us from ourselves they want
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.160]  to train us that the citizens are bad that the citizens are the enemy now
[45:11.160 --> 45:14.120]  Michael I want to shift gears in the time we have today and I want to thank
[45:14.120 --> 45:18.560]  you for coming on with this and I want to thank you for involving me in the
[45:18.560 --> 45:22.280]  first season and the second season I'm really proud of the show I think the
[45:22.280 --> 45:26.720]  second season is even more powerful with the JFK deathbed confession of E
[45:26.720 --> 45:30.920]  Howard Hunt there's the smoking gun with you know going out improving the
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.960]  fusion centers the FEMA camps the legislation putting the congressman on
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.640]  the hot seat and him melting down I mean incredible Perry Mason type you know
[45:40.640 --> 45:45.780]  moments here and talking to the crew a lot of you believe this is the big
[45:45.780 --> 45:50.000]  sleeper the stuff that we discovered in the gulf tell us as much as you can about
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.760]  what's coming up tonight 10 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central on true TV you
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.560]  got it well first thing the first thing I'm gonna say is I want everyone to just
[45:58.560 --> 46:01.480]  think about this and then you'll understand where I'm going in one
[46:01.480 --> 46:07.320]  second the largest single industry in terms of dollar value in the world by
[46:07.320 --> 46:11.880]  far the oil business if you take it all in composite the refining the drilling
[46:11.880 --> 46:16.120]  the ancillary products the infrastructure all that stuff it is the
[46:16.120 --> 46:19.320]  largest single business in the world now people say well how much of the oil
[46:19.320 --> 46:23.400]  business worth well the answer is you can't calculate it it's quite literally
[46:23.400 --> 46:31.760]  what that word incalculable because it is so rich it is so powerful it is so it's
[46:31.760 --> 46:37.040]  tentacle spread so completely and our entire civilization is based on it and
[46:37.040 --> 46:40.600]  the distillates are the plastics the cars the kind of opposites the
[46:40.600 --> 46:44.920]  televisions calculate you cannot calculate how much money they have so as
[46:44.920 --> 46:50.040]  Jesse always says and a lot of other smart people say follow the money the
[46:50.040 --> 46:54.040]  last episode I heard about the wealthy oil business with $60 trillion that's
[46:54.040 --> 46:58.040]  trillion with the T so if you had $60 trillion it ain't hard to spend a
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.080]  couple of billion dollars you know spread it around you can you can make a
[47:01.080 --> 47:04.600]  you can cover up a lot of stuff you can buy a lot of politicians with a couple
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.720]  of spare billions so that's how you want to start that's how I want to start
[47:08.720 --> 47:12.200]  this and if you put that frame around it and you understand that we're talking
[47:12.200 --> 47:15.680]  about we're not talking about millions millions is jump change
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.800]  we're talking about billions we're talking about spare billions to just
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.280]  throw around and spread around and buy whatever you need to buy okay that takes
[47:24.280 --> 47:29.320]  us to the Gulf conspiracy here's BP foreign corporation worth a huge amount
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.960]  of dough it's almost impossible to figure out what their profits are
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.160]  because of all the foreign holdings with foreign holding companies just like the
[47:37.160 --> 47:40.760]  whole rest of the oil business these companies as we said before in this show
[47:40.760 --> 47:44.880]  they have no loyalty to any country they have no national loyalty they have one
[47:44.880 --> 47:50.760]  loyalty and that is to themselves and to the elites so now you see here's this
[47:50.760 --> 47:55.080]  rig in the Gulf and it blows up and it's a human tragedy seven people died 27 or
[47:55.080 --> 48:01.760]  injured excuse me 11 people died 27 or injured horrible thing I don't want to
[48:01.760 --> 48:04.320]  get into whether it was an accident I don't want to get into whether it was
[48:04.320 --> 48:08.000]  planned although I have my opinions about that which I will discuss but here's
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.760]  here's what I want to get into I want to get into the reality the facts the facts
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.000]  are that Halliburton was a partner on that well there are three partners
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.760]  Trans Ocean BP and Halliburton Halliburton does all that the drilling fluids and
[48:21.760 --> 48:26.480]  they cement the well and all that other stuff okay 12 days before this well
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.360]  blew 12 days Halliburton went out and bought on the public market company
[48:31.360 --> 48:34.720]  called boots and boots which is this famous company founded by Rededair the
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.320]  guy who put out the oil fires in Iraq and what these guys do is they go out can
[48:39.320 --> 48:44.920]  they put out oil fires and they clean up oil disasters so 12 days they buy the
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.920]  company 12 days later the rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico who gets a job to
[48:48.920 --> 48:53.080]  clean it up and put out the fire not hard to figure this one out boots and
[48:53.080 --> 48:59.000]  boots so what you have is you have these companies these giant globe globe
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.440]  spanning multinational companies they make it common and they make it going
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.760]  and that's what people have to realize they make it common and going they've
[49:07.760 --> 49:12.520]  got the game rigged it got the system you know you know set up so they went out
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.000]  and buy this company now does that mean that they knew the rig was going to
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.320]  explode I have a lot of people on this show tonight at 10 o'clock who will say
[49:19.320 --> 49:25.840]  yes they knew it it was a deliberate the explosion of the rig the BP rig was
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.480]  deliberate but regardless we also know they then lied and said core exit isn't
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.080]  dangerous that's covered they lied to said 70% of the oils cleaned up when it
[49:35.080 --> 49:39.440]  wasn't I mean they just this whole then they block the states and locales from
[49:39.440 --> 49:45.120]  being able to protect their shores I mean this is crazy oh yeah well let's
[49:45.120 --> 49:47.920]  talk about correction for a second because Alex this is where you you know
[49:47.920 --> 49:51.760]  you'll see tonight your listeners will see tonight that you have a big part of
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.400]  the show because you actually gave us the tip about correct it and I'll talk
[49:55.400 --> 49:58.720]  about it really briefly because it's another example of this
[49:58.720 --> 50:04.480]  this unbelievable colossal corruption that if you get a word in the novel
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.720]  no one would believe it correct the 9500 as Alex you you gave us this
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.360]  information is a very very toxic dispersant but then disperse anything
[50:13.360 --> 50:16.880]  what it does is it breaks up the oil I guess technically does it break up the
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.720]  oil into the little micro drop makes it stop floating yeah it stops floating
[50:20.720 --> 50:23.320]  these little micro droplets think of the bottom of the ocean where of course
[50:23.320 --> 50:26.760]  they're going to the ecosystem but everyone goes hey the oil's gone it's
[50:26.760 --> 50:32.200]  all dispersed but corrects it 9500 is incredibly toxic I could read it was
[50:32.200 --> 50:36.080]  the chemicals again this is all on the internet cadmium chromium arsenic you
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.920]  name it and Alex you gave us the blockbuster of all and I don't even
[50:39.920 --> 50:44.440]  know if I want to give it away but it has to do with the Exxon Valdez oil spill
[50:44.440 --> 50:49.160]  20 years ago and what happened to those cleanup workers because they use
[50:49.160 --> 50:53.520]  corrects it and by the way I mean the show is under pressure may not be on
[50:53.520 --> 50:58.040]  next year this potentially might not air tonight I mean they're not gonna like

[55:52.720 --> 56:00.520]  people see how hardcore this year's conspiracy theory is let's continue with
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.160]  the different bombshells that you can give us a first look at here Michael

[56:26.880 --> 56:30.360]  help keep us on the air and obviously that's everybody's goal so thanks
[56:30.360 --> 56:33.720]  thanks for that except for the men in suits breaking into things and in
[56:33.720 --> 56:38.840]  people's trash and well yeah they don't say people do not like this show and
[56:38.840 --> 56:41.800]  as I said before I call it the miracle show the fact that we're on the air we
[56:41.800 --> 56:46.240]  got it on the air and what will keep us on the air is ratings I mean let's be
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.920]  honest though I mean you were sworn to secrecy Ventura may speak out about it
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.840]  now some of it's come out in the press so I can say a little bit you know people
[56:54.840 --> 56:58.240]  like will tell us well if people tell me things in confidence then I can't tell
[56:58.240 --> 57:01.640]  people that's how that works or then you're known for not being able to be
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.160]  in somebody's confidence but I mean this is not hype I mean you know one of the
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.920]  shows is not reared and I guess probably never will the police state episode
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.520]  and the I mean you guys are under pressure I mean this is a real show this
[57:15.520 --> 57:19.040]  is upsetting the system yeah well there's no doubt that there are people
[57:19.040 --> 57:25.160]  they're people against the show and as I told you before you know there's
[57:25.160 --> 57:27.600]  certain things I can't talk about it doesn't even have to do with the police
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.000]  state episode is bigger than that there are there are some forces out there
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.520]  that I know from intermediaries because I've made a lot of context doing this
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.800]  show they want to show off they do not want to show on they don't want the
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.640]  information out of there remember you have a huge audience but remember the
[57:43.640 --> 57:48.960]  potential audience of true TV is 93 million households 93 million and they
[57:48.960 --> 57:52.440]  know that it's people who've never been exposed to the truth most of them
[57:52.440 --> 57:55.720]  because I mean they've got a what they've aired last season's episodes more
[57:55.720 --> 58:01.160]  than 50 times a piece yeah so I mean we're talking about a hundred hundreds of
[58:01.160 --> 58:04.080]  millions of people being able to see this yeah it's amazing and what they're
[58:04.080 --> 58:09.800]  gonna see tonight Alex is is so explosive that I don't think people will believe it I
[58:09.800 --> 58:13.560]  think people are gonna watch it and go are you kidding me so we talked about the
[58:13.560 --> 58:16.640]  Gulf oil we talked about the BP and I talked about you know they purchased
[58:16.640 --> 58:20.520]  this cleanup company now we're talking about Corexit and Corexit is this
[58:20.520 --> 58:25.200]  incredibly toxic stuff there are dispersants that work much better that
[58:25.200 --> 58:29.600]  are organically based they use bacteria but no VP didn't use those they use
[58:29.600 --> 58:35.520]  Corexit 9500 now why well the reason is because there's huge connections hold on
[58:35.520 --> 58:38.480]  stay there back in one minute five more minutes with Michael Braverman then Bob
[58:38.480 --> 58:46.920]  Chapman Rand Paul and many others thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live

[58:53.880 --> 58:58.360]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:58.360 --> 59:02.760]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.760 --> 59:07.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:07.040 --> 59:11.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.480]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:15.480 --> 59:20.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:20.040 --> 59:24.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:24.160 --> 59:28.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:28.120 --> 59:31.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.920 --> 59:34.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.640 --> 59:39.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[59:39.920 --> 59:44.360]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the

[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:12.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:21.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.240]  Jones Bob Chapman's joining us coming up the next segment and I'll use that time

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:38.800]  situation cover the latest on government surveillance what's happening with the
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.520]  economy the TSA that's all coming up we got about five minutes left with Michael
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.280]  Braverman and I'm telling you these these shows and I didn't call them and
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.440]  tell them this last season because they were great but but this year with the
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:57.760]  police state and the water I mean I call them after I see it and I say I can't
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.280]  believe that just went on television I mean this is a first and for those that
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.960]  have heard me hype it I've gotten hundreds and hundreds of emails going
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:10.280]  wow you weren't joking about these new shows in fact it's more powerful than
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.800]  what you even said remember this isn't how much Jones on the radio and the
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.320]  internet this is television on a mainline network and the globalist are
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.240]  upset Michael in closing we got about four minutes you run through the other
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.880]  bullet points okay I'll go quick so we know about correction we covered that
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.320]  and just understand that that company is usually connected to BP and now we
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.400]  move on to what the end game is and what is the end game what we're gonna
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:46.640]  present to you tonight at 10 o'clock is the BP oil spill is not just something
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.160]  that just happened it's connected and it's connected to starting with Katrina
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.600]  and the government's ridiculous response to Katrina we believe and we're gonna
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.120]  present some evidence that is absolutely explosive you have the
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.360]  documents we have the doctor this is confirmed you don't want to let him know
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.120]  well I'm gonna tell him something I'm gonna tell him something that is that is
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.640]  the big oil companies remember I told you how huge they are how you can't
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.640]  calculate how much money they have and big government legal oil and big
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.520]  government are joined together and the plan the plot the conspiracy is to turn
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.200]  Louisiana and the whole Gulf Coast into a giant oil depot a huge oil refiner
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.600]  because remember this 30% of America's oil 30% comes through two ports in
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.840]  Louisiana and what's in Louisiana a bunch of pesky fishermen a bunch of
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.840]  pesky environmentalists a bunch of loudmouth they want to get rid of them
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.760]  they want to get rid of them because they want to have their way with the
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.200]  state and the whole Gulf if you all don't believe me if it sounds like I'm just
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.280]  hyping and I'm just yelling and screaming in the wilderness watch the show
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:03.400]  well you know what's incredible Michael at the Cancun meeting we have the
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.480]  official UN document it talks about forced relocations of populations
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:15.000]  worldwide out of areas that cause a large carbon footprint and so it's all
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.560]  about forcing people out of areas and you guys got the documents particularly
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.160]  that that's what they plan that's why they won't let anybody rebuild down there
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.600]  they want them gone they want them gone and we get we get we get the core of
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.400]  engineers and Jesse put some on the hot seat and I just gonna tell you guys will
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.680]  not believe it is this even more powerful because I wasn't there for that
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.880]  I was down there only for a few days yeah is this even more powerful than then
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.400]  than the congressman crapping his pants oh it's unbelievable believe it you're
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.480]  gonna watch this and you're gonna see these people and you know they think
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.080]  to just kind of a really nice interview and I'll admit one thing I did surprise
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.560]  them because they didn't know was Jesse interviewing him and we set it up and
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.200]  Jesse walks out and the guy goes oh it's Jesse Ventura he was a PR flak but
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.440]  with him was this very mysterious dr. Reese and you're not gonna believe what
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.640]  you see you're not gonna believe it and and I'm right there and I'm you know
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.520]  filming it when I'm producing it and I'm going I don't believe this I mean we
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.040]  caught these people you know right there on the open with their pants down
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.480]  yeah with your pants down it was 150 degrees and I'm thinking like we just
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:27.000]  quiet people you know you're sweating it ain't because it's 115 and they were
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.240]  making Jesse for the show wear that black suit why I make him I know that
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.160]  poor guy he's mad at me for that but anyway but it's pretty explosive and I
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.720]  think if you you watch it to the end and you're gonna go you know this show

[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:09.360]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network well he
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.560]  joins us every friday he's only with us for a half hour regrettably today because
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.520]  the producer so jam packed the show which is great but it's a catch 22 senator
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:24.040]  ran paul elect coming up later james dilling pole covering the attempted
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:29.040]  world government un takeover criminal confab going on down in cancun mexico
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.600]  that's falling apart again thank god as the fraud comes out but since michael
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.280]  braverman for conspiracy theory was talking about the government documents
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.640]  they got this is confirmed that this is part of a relocation program on the
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.440]  gulf coast from about the middle of texas on the coast all the way over to
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.080]  florida and so they just want to set the precedent and everybody used to
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.760]  pollution shut down the smaller companies that can't make the payoffs and
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.240]  then only allow the big three oil companies in there just like the bill in
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.640]  food safety publicly written by big agribusiness to shut down small farms
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.680]  and ranches just like the health care bill it's now hundreds a week of waivers
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.040]  to big mega corporations like mcdonald's and others you don't have to get
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.040]  insurance for your employees but everybody else does nobody can compete
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.600]  against that it's all about vertical integration but here's the special
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:28.200]  climate change program 2009 2012 summary executive summary and we've written
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:34.760]  articles about this and it says on page six forced relocation of populations to
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.760]  lower their carbon footprint bob Chapman I mean this is this is this is what
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.640]  the game is all about you always talk about the the the double set of rules
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.880]  Wesley Snipes gets three years in prison even though he was found not guilty on
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.360]  the big charge wrangle clearly not paying millions in taxes he gets a slap on
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.000]  the wrist because they're above the law talk about that
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.080]  I'm I think as far as the corporations are concerned it's a perfect example of
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.400]  corporatism fascism and you talk about vertical integration and that's
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.520]  exactly what it is you hit a spot on and there is a double standard the
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.840]  gentleman mrs. Snipes should have never gone to jail I mean they've had far
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.480]  worse cases than that and the people have walked with a fine and they're setting
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:37.160]  up as an example wrangle is a dreadful person and he belongs in jail and did
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:43.560]  you see the picture with his son reported a theft inside of the government
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:51.040]  Cadillac that he was driving yes that's that they don't care they believe
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.720]  that they were above the law and they can do anything they want to do it's
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.040]  amazing of this full spectrum of news out there let's get into WikiLeaks
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:07.880]  first Assange lawyers are preparing for US spying indictment I had John Young
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.800]  who registered the WikiLeaks name he really is the original WikiLeaker he
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.720]  says stuff on the Vatican's coming out on banks on torture chambers on our
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:26.000]  government trafficking and WMDs that's that's pretty scary well I hope it comes
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:34.720]  out if we need it and but on the other hand we as you said last week we have
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:42.360]  to make sure that mr. Si is treated fairly and that this thing is not going
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:48.240]  to turn into let's kill the internet well that's what they're saying they're
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.440]  calling it the Patriot Act for the internet and young made the key point
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.280]  and of course you were an intelligence you can talk about this that they're
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:02.960]  giving us good tidbits but notice it it's basically a regurgitation of the
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.520]  same pro-war anti-Iran anti-Pakistan propaganda and I ran at Pakistan both
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.040]  say they concur with your analysis that this is staged but there's other
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.240]  tidbits about dying core and child trafficking and things that are mixed
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.000]  in there so they're doing this to get credibility and then they're going to
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.320]  start releasing stuff on Russia and and and other enemies so let's talk about
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:34.840]  that well it it reminds me of a typical disinformation situation where you get
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.120]  95% truth even though it's a regurgitated truth and then they get
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.920]  their 5% in the message sort of what Glenn Beck has been doing and and this
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.000]  is what they're up to here it's a exercise and disinformation we could get
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.760]  some goodies out of it but they'll deliberately put them in there knowing
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.600]  that no harm will come from it eventually and it'll make it seem like all
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:11.000]  of the information is bona fide for what's coming up targeting specific banks
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.920]  that are enemies of Soros and the Soros connection is a hundred percent clear
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:19.280]  we predicted months ago that Assange is a useful idiot who would probably be
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.240]  burned in prison or killed and now no bond for not using a condom and
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:32.080]  consensual sex I mean boy I tell you this is tyranny it sure is it sure is I
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.320]  just picked up an article today and I picked up two Mexican Americans with a
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.880]  hundred and ninety grand in their vehicle and the judge says you got to
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:46.560]  give it back and the police department didn't give it back because Homeland
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.280]  Security scooped it and said it belongs to us because their drug deal is which
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.320]  they're not it just another example these people do anything they want well
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.560]  they claimed in in San Diego the guy's house was full of bombs he said let this
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.000]  is on record AP let me back in to prove they're not bombs this is what he's not
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.960]  convicted they blow up the house burn it down and are now going to convict him
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.400]  with no evidence they could show up at anybody's house and burn it down now and
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.680]  say there were bombs inside of it I mean due process is going out the window
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:25.640]  here you're right and another thing doing what they did in that area was very
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:32.520]  dangerous especially this time of year for fires because everything is like
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:39.480]  a tinderbox there and that could have got out of control and you know fires
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:47.280]  jump and they could have had a real roaring fire in that area well the whole
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.840]  thing is judgment the whole thing is very very suspicious it might have been
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.160]  some type of government operation to that this guy was tied into and that they
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.560]  didn't want regular cops and media seeing what was really in there I mean
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.040]  this is a this is a first and to now have them come out and say yes we are
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.920]  watching all your credit card purchases and and and loyalty card purchases in
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.280]  real time I mean every time they do that it's a felony it's illegal but they
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.760]  don't care they just announce it now Bob that's right they don't care and that's
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:24.800]  why I tell people if you can you only use credit cards for emergencies pay
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.760]  cash and try not to use them at all I mean I haven't had a credit card for
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:37.600]  15 years Bob what do you make of glenbeck this week admitting FEMA camps
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.360]  admitting military planning to round us up he's gone from saying we're liars and
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:48.160]  that we should have the military come after us as dangerous people to now many
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:57.280]  episodes literally channeling yours truly well I think probably they know
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:04.480]  that eventually Jesse's program on the camps is going to come out and they're
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.120]  just preempting it that's what I think they're up to they want to get their
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:16.440]  piece of the meat first and then when Jesse's is allowed to run which will
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.600]  happen eventually then they can say well we already talked about that we told
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:29.920]  you all about that and this just proves it Bob let's look at the economy
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:36.960]  quantify it what does it mean when they you had the headlines a few days ago
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:43.320]  dealing with the record Treasury sell-off in the last two years and then I saw
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.920]  separate articles talking about record numbers of investors and countries not
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:58.680]  buying treasury offerings what does that mean it means that if others will not
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:05.000]  buy treasuries whether traded in the market or at auction it means that the
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.400]  Federal Reserve has to buy them and they could do that one or two ways they
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:16.160]  can extract banks to go in and use cash surplus to buy treasures which is
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:22.680]  synonymous with cash or they can create money out of thin air and do the same
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.680]  thing the money out of thin air is monetization so isn't the money that
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:33.200]  comes from the banks because the money that was lent to the banks by the Fed in
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.640]  the first place and I think they've been holding those balances and abeyance to
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:47.080]  use just for such an opportunity and when they do that they don't have to print
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.520]  more money because they already printed it yeah Bob what is it what does it
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.920]  signify when we see the headline you know record Treasury sell-off what does
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:00.600]  that mean it means foreigners in all likelihood of the sellers of treasuries
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:06.400]  they can easily control the short end of the market and that would be anything
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:13.840]  up to two-year paper 30 days 90 days 180 days one year two year and then beyond
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:20.320]  that the which is called the long end of the market they have more difficulty in
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.640]  controlling it and right now with all the selling going on they're probably
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.520]  saying well it moved from two and a half to three point three oh percent we'll
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.680]  wait and see where it looks like it's gonna stop for the time being and then
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.200]  we'll drive the yield back down again driving the bonds back up again some of
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:49.560]  these funds will call them that invest in that kind of security and normally
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:56.520]  call paper they're taking some pretty bad losses I know I I saw it today that
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:04.320]  PIMCO get banged around pretty hard and because when the yield goes up the value
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.280]  of the bond goes down and when the value of bond goes down that's not very good
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:14.920]  and so but anyway they'll be back if they haven't gone away permanently they
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.600]  being in the Fed and they're gonna drive those rates back down again if they can
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.200]  and they probably can they don't want that mortgage rate of 4.66 percent for
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.320]  30 30 30 year fixed rate mortgages they want it down I mean people can't
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:38.840]  qualify it at 416 number might 466 and if if it goes any higher the 10-year and
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:45.120]  that's what the mortgage the 30-year mortgage rate is based upon if it goes
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:50.000]  higher say another quarter of a point the five percent it's gonna leave an
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.040]  awful lot of possible buyers out of the market because they won't be able to
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.640]  qualify because of the higher price payments that they'll be into okay
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:05.400]  overall politically though am I right in saying that this is rumblings mainly
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.320]  connected to China and Russia saying that in their trade between each other
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.360]  they are now dumping the dollar I mean how big of a move was that two weeks
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:20.040]  ago or a week and a half ago when they made that announcement it's giant it's
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:27.760]  a very big move in in the in the 10-year and 30-year paper which is the most
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:35.480]  common in the long end but also what Russia and China announced and you can't
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.960]  blame them I mean who would want to continue to have to take currency like
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:45.480]  the US dollar which continues to decline in value overall who would want to keep
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:52.040]  that when they have too much already so they don't want to use it they want to
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.400]  use their own currencies which to me I would say why didn't they do that a long
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:02.000]  time ago and I'm sure the other BRIC nations will do the same thing and they're
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.240]  trying to protect themselves they're buying gold hand over fist and they
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.280]  Russians are make no bones about it you know we bought the IMS sells they buy and
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:20.680]  because I'm sure that the the US government's upset about it but what
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.520]  are they supposed to do do you think this grassroots monster do you think this
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:30.440]  grassroots movement that started on a four or five months ago on the internet
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.720]  that Kaiser's been beating the drum on the last month do you think that's having
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.920]  any effect on driving up a silver past $30 absolutely and I think you know we
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:46.840]  discussed this last week and I think it was so simple that nobody thought about
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:52.680]  it except max and I think that was terrific and yes they've put in a lot
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:57.280]  of pressure on the physical end of the market and they're not going to be able
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.120]  to hold it back they were in there now last few days knocking silver and gold
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.200]  down that's okay Bob we just buy some cheaper and it's going to go back up
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:10.800]  again which it is that they don't have enough power to keep it down because they
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.400]  can't sell physical they don't have any silver at all well that's my next
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:20.480]  question yeah in your 50 years of tracking this I've just been watching
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:26.240]  them for 15 or so but am I correct from your research and saying that I'm
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.920]  calling local coin shops I'm talking to people around the country either they're
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:36.280]  sold out or there's huge premiums from their wholesalers so they've got a charge
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.000]  a lot more to their customers and the gap between what spot silver and gold is
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.840]  is getting wider and wider between reality what silver and gold are actually
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:51.560]  selling for in reality and as that gap gets wider and wider it's going to pull
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:23:01.760]  the false spot number towards the real number inexorably absolutely it was just
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:09.440]  a piece of depth magic and yes as we discussed last week you know losing
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.560]  five or ten billion dollars is not going to put those two banks out of business
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.240]  but what it shows is and you said this yourself we are bringing the fight to the
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:26.320]  enemy and they have not had that happen before and I absolutely love it well
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.200]  they are starting to get horrified but but more of it is just that the average
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.720]  person out there who's even in the media or government was living in the same
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:41.520]  propaganda as the general public and and and and folks are especially people in
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.920]  power positions are starting to realize that there really is a world government
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:50.960]  that it really is sadistic that it really is villainous and verminous and
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.280]  larceness and dangerous and it's so over-the-top with big sis announcing
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.320]  that they want to have and they're going to put in 800 Walmart's and Mall of
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.320]  America and Target and everywhere else telescreens with government messages
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.600]  about spying on other shoppers and your neighbors and and now foreign ambassadors
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.080]  won't come here because they're having their genitals grabbed at airports I
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.840]  mean it they've tried to push this insanity on us by just operating like
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.880]  it's normal and no big deal and they they had people in a trance but now
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.120]  they've gone too fast and it's making people wake up and they're getting
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.520]  angry and and and sure the general public doesn't have all the answers but
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.320]  they're beginning to seek after them and what Zabicki Brzezinski said six months
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:43.480]  ago is really starting to be proven true you're absolutely right and so isn't he
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:51.840]  he started this the information to his friends about two years ago and we talked
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.920]  about it on the program and they're terrified no one's ever brought the
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:06.720]  battle to them before whether it was in 1348 or 1620 this is it we've got the
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.120]  internet we get talk radio and we tell the people the truth and they can't
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.000]  handle the truth and so they have problems and when they have to expedite
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.440]  programs it makes them make mistakes and the more mistakes they make the more
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:27.840]  possibility is more people are going to wake up and their programs are not going
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.600]  to work because they're going to get neutralized and that's what you're
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.920]  doing on the radio with your program you're killing them absolutely killing
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:42.320]  them verbally well that's why they want to provocateur events like the Wiki
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.120]  leaks as a pretext to start cracking down the press and they've got bills
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.560]  introduced we've been covering them now there's new ones here in the stack where
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.400]  if you report on any type of leak which has always been the bedrock of the first
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:58.960]  amendment that you're going to get hard prison time the system is desperate to
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.440]  clamp down because they've tried to make all their crimes secret we have a right
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.000]  to know that you know this claim of national security it's a fraud real
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.600]  national security is having a transparent government the real threat is
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:16.960]  having a secret government we know what those always turn into and you know what
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.720]  it could be a big turning point is a Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul will call
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:29.720]  him the odd couple politically and and Ron is going to run the subcommittee
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.640]  mr. Bacchus has said that he's going to appoint him as you well know and I
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:42.040]  wonder if what we did last week and up until yesterday had any real effect on
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:48.400]  the decision to allow Ron to have that post well we know we roll over and don't
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.000]  fight they're gonna win and we know that when we do fight that we've got a good
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.680]  chance of winning then and you know quitters never win and winners never
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:04.720]  quit mom well mr. Bona his phones and I get this straight from subscribers it
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.360]  came back to me after they had heard your program and they get on there right
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:14.440]  away and the average weight was for 45 minutes to an hour to reach a human being
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:22.040]  but what they did is on Monday they because of the jamming of the lines of
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:30.160]  phones coming in calls coming in they put it on answering service and so that
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.160]  they wouldn't have that you know answer the phone but we told we told boner but
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.440]  I mean we told boner here on air or congressman he says the names banner we
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:44.040]  just quote his real name a boner the minion of the globalist newt yenridge
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.120]  he's a protege of him we told him look the tea party is in and the real tea
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:55.640]  party is gonna come to your home office I mean in his home district there and
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.080]  we're gonna go to all your events and and and you're going to be politically
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.480]  destroyed and I think he understands that but again it shows the power of us
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.320]  peacefully with peaceful political discourse are beginning to shut these
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.080]  people down and they are horrified in the last minute and a half we've got
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.080]  left Bob Chapman the international forecaster calm how do you see them
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:22.760]  striking back to try to counter us I think the main instrument right now is
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:28.440]  homeland security the things that they're doing along with the thigh war
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.000]  program that they've got going on tsa then they're not gonna let up on that
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.640]  and that's obvious and I think the next thing is after the holidays when
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.200]  people don't normally travel too much I think a lot of people won't travel by
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:50.840]  air at all and you'll probably watch a drop of one-third to perhaps even 50
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.600]  percent less travelers going into the air and going through that maddening
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:02.800]  experience what about false flag terror I talked to Governor Ventura on Monday
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.360]  and he just said Alex in my gut I could see him staging something you know
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.800]  people are waking up too fast well he's right about waking up too fast and
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:20.000]  so of course he's an integral part of that and if if he is nothing else he's
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.400]  a warrior and they don't want to go head-to-head with warriors they missed a
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:34.480]  milk toast and so the the the efforts that we see by them to count them in
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:38.320]  what they're doing and not gonna work we just got to keep after them and that's
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.680]  what we're doing absolutely folks even calling it a free copy of the forecaster
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.200]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:51.560]  three seven Bob have a great weekend coming up we'll see you next Friday we're

[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.360]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.160]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:14.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows

[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.360]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:28.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.520]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.880]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.560]  lord mongton and others have done if they cut the carbon off to those people
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.000]  and they don't care if the climate aid information came out they're going
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.280]  forward and they're producing TV ads and ads for theaters that so children being
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.360]  murdered by explosives by their school teachers if they don't submit to the
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.880]  carbon dictatorship suddenly they're saying yes we're fascist
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.120]  fascism is good if it's for the earth yes so it seems that in a type of
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:04.520]  mentally ill temper tantrum they are just frothing and revealing themselves and
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.040]  saying you know what it wasn't about rising sea levels there's too many
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.240]  people is so it's their hate letter to humanity you know I love humanity I'm a
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.640]  fan of man they're the opposite they they they hate humanity they hate people
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:23.080]  they don't control this is a control freak religion mr. Dillingpole do you
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:27.920]  agree that we're seeing them more and more really reveal who they are yeah I
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.760]  think the mask the mask is slipping you you would like it enough to talk to
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.160]  the monk and yesterday I think his analysis of what has gone on at Cancun
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:42.480]  is entirely correct but it has been spun in the mainstream media as this
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:48.120]  non-event of this kind of disaster you know no policies were were formulated
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:54.480]  etc etc this is actually not true it is it is it is world government through the
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:01.880]  back door through administered by the United Nations imposing yet further
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:10.480]  climate regulation on the world I mean the idea that the western countries are
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:18.320]  to provide 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to some new UN fund that sounds
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.680]  very sinister to me we don't get to vote on this we don't get to control where
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:28.680]  this money is spent these are our faceless aparachics of the the UN
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:34.760]  world government system and of course as we know it is all based on a lie in it
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:41.320]  a fundamental lie that the demand that the man-made carbon dioxide is a poison
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:45.960]  and that it is warming the world well let me tell you I am speaking in England
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:52.480]  where we have just had the two coldest weeks in the end of November beginning
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:57.800]  of December since records began the coldest end of November beginning
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.880]  December since the central England temperature record started in the 1650s
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:08.680]  now if that's not a sign that global warming isn't such a big problem as the
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:12.800]  UN tells us I don't know what is well they spin that and they say oh it's cold
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.040]  because it's warming they're saying the same thing in Cancun where they're
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.360]  having record cold temperatures down there in the Yucatan Peninsula right
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.440]  down by the end of North America where Central America starts and they're
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:32.400]  going more and more into deceptive mode on one hand they're telling us that
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:36.480]  they're doing this to save us from ourselves too many people Ted Turner
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.160]  saying it's a one-child policy but as you rightly said they're now playing along
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.760]  like oh we don't want anything big just give us this hundred billion set up all
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.520]  these new bureaucracy so it's global governance by stealth James Dilling
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:55.440]  poll the telegraph tell the listeners out there and viewers from all these
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.160]  documents you're going over what is most important coming out of this this
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.320]  this this confab I think what you have to you have to look at it in context you
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:12.120]  have to remember how it all started with the real some summit founded by Morris
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:17.640]  Strong the Canadian Marxist and believer in one world government and there they
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.320]  set down the blueprint for one world government which we of course you know
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:30.760]  very well is called agenda 21 and agenda 21 effectively uses the cause of
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:37.680]  environmentalism as a way as a kind of righteous cloak in which with which to
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.280]  develop one world government control through taxation through regulation it
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.360]  gives them the moral high ground to be our godlike priest and then we buy our
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:54.640]  carbon indulgences from them or we go to a figurative humanistic hell yeah well
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.560]  there's one thing I admire about these people they are very ingenious the way
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.160]  they can they can turn on a pin you know okay so for a long long time they've
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.480]  been telling us you know we had one guy in England a few years ago saying look
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.080]  kids you may not ever see snow again you know future generations will know what
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.480]  would not know what the white stuff that we would that we speed in was okay well
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.800]  suddenly we get this cold weather that's inconveniently cold weather and
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.960]  suddenly they say no no no no you don't understand when we have cold weather
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:38.200]  that is a sign of global warming it's a sign that are the the Gulf Stream is
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:43.560]  freezing up and we're going to get even even one more as it told her or maybe
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.520]  there's ocean acidification or if not ocean acidification there's someone new
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.640]  thing we can dream up just give us a chance and this is how it goes on all
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.760]  the time they they don't really care about they use the Leninist method which
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:04.600]  is essentially any lie you tell in the service of of what you believe is a good
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.880]  cause any lie is justified and this is the problem doesn't matter what the
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:14.760]  weather does it doesn't matter what the truth is they will go on pursuing that
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.680]  agenda of control well now they say the ocean is going to turn into acid and
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.240]  that an ice age is coming you know they said that back in the 60s and 70s that
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.720]  it was an ice age then they said it was warming in the summer it's warming in
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.400]  the winter it's cooling and but but more and more people are seeing through
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:38.280]  them I mean politically they're losing the people but they don't care they're
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.080]  trying to take over cities counties different regions they just never stop
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.920]  beating people over the head with it meanwhile all these real serious
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.320]  environmental problems are completely ignored yes I think we live in a two on
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:58.880]  a two-tier planet now there is there is one part of the planet which is run by
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.000]  people you know the people in government the environmental movement the people in
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.280]  the energy companies they are all pushing their agenda and then you've got
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.920]  got people like you know you and me people who listen to this show really
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.360]  most ordinary people now look outside their windows when they go hang on a
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.240]  second we've been told it's getting you know it's getting warmer and warmer why
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:27.560]  is it so cold outside you know where is the evidence that the co2 is causing
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.400]  all this so the real you know free citizens are looking at the world and
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.960]  saying enough is enough this is a contract but administrators our
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.600]  bureaucrats are carrying on as if nothing has changed as if as if climate
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.960]  gate never happened as if the scientists hadn't been exposed as frauds and
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:52.120]  shams and crooks and this is a problem I mean this is not just to do with climate
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:57.000]  this is this is part of a bigger picture which is to do with liberty versus
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.760]  tyranny well in fact that's where I was going next James we have the Indian
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.440]  ambassador a woman with her crotch groped put in the glass cage and she says
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.800]  I'm never coming back to the US again other countries are freaking out they
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:19.080]  come here and people actually in many cases stick their hands down their pants
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:24.240]  they put them in radiation scanners they're now putting up at Walmart's 800
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:30.400]  of them telescreens with Janet Napolitano big sis literally saying watch
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:35.560]  the shoppers terrorists could be anywhere but then meanwhile the castle
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.080]  drawbridge is open the southern border is basically wide open that would be like
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.720]  defending some French fortress from invaders you know 500 years ago and
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.720]  opening all of the gates but then running in and having the castle guards
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:55.640]  point their swords at a two-year-old in a straw bed I mean I mean the gates are
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.760]  wide open the country's overrun and they're running around the countryside
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.080]  training pastors to spy on their flock and look for libertarian extremist I
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.320]  mean this is on record and they don't care if everybody's waking up and not flying
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.400]  and getting angry they say hey you don't like that we're gonna have TSA on the
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.360]  streets yeah well Alex I do worry hearing you talk about these things
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:26.740]  because as you know here I am in the the EU SSR I feel that the battle for
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:29.480]  liberty has already been lost in this part of the world and I look across the
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.640]  Atlantic maybe this is the case of the grass is always greener I look across
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:38.720]  the Atlantic and I think at least you Americans are going to show us in Europe
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.280]  the way out of this mess you are going to show us what it means to be free and
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.840]  you know my hope is that 2012 you are going to get a small government
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.080]  president somebody who really understands the problem somebody who
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.800]  believes in liberty who understands the principle the first principle that you're
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.800]  founding fathers if this doesn't happen we are all totally stuffed I mean the
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:07.400]  West is lost I see the possibility of some semblance of freedom of a kind
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.480]  operating in the east you know but I mean they have different ways over there
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.840]  I mean I don't know the Chinese set a particularly good example and I mean
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:18.720]  countries like Singapore are quite authoritarian but at least they have a
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.080]  semblance of economic freedom and that they understand the principles of small
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.440]  government if you if you Americans do not do not learn your lesson of what's
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:33.120]  happened in Europe you are going to be screwed as we are screwed and I think you
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:36.800]  should think very very carefully about who you elected your president and you
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.960]  need to monitor all these Republicans who've come in you know in the mid
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.680]  terms who are talking about about tea party values and stuff I think you want
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:50.480]  to be one of them very carefully because I'm already seeing signs that they are
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:57.720]  just corporatist like all the rest well absolutely and we hope for somebody
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:03.640]  like Ron Ron Paul or Rand Paul the problem is that it takes close to a
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.880]  billion to run successfully for president yeah there's another way to
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.000]  defeat them to take the states back and then block the federal government
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.520]  that's what the founders envisioned so there's more than one way to skin a cat
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:20.120]  we've got to go with this from every angle and resist and say no no no but
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:25.600]  but but but speaking of European tyranny I'm not really a fan of some of the
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:31.080]  George Soros type connections to WikiLeaks and I'm just totally agree
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.640]  with you I mean interesting libertarians in Britain and perhaps the same in
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:40.520]  America are completely divided over Julian Assange some of all have he
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.800]  pronounced his surname I don't know he's Australian isn't he I mean some people are
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.800]  saying that he's an absolute hero you know we should be celebrating he's
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.720]  fighting our battles I think he's probably a bit of a cook and the idea
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:57.400]  that if George Soros is funding something you know it's going to be a bad
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.200]  thing well that's where I'm going with this is he's clearly the patchy and you
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.240]  notice the leaks are just continuing they put him out there push him to the
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:12.160]  front yeah I interviewed John Young of Krypton he's on record with registering
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.720]  it then it got taken over by Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.200]  who openly says infiltrate the web to bring the web down now they're
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.160]  introducing legislation to censor the press they're talking about indicting
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:31.160]  New York Times reporters and so I think this is all an elaborate event to
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:38.200]  basically have a Pearl Harbor or 9-11 for the internet and then come in and
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.920]  restrict you know not George Soros but people like James Dillingpole or Alex
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.120]  Jones I've been saying this for months now now it's beginning to unfold but
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.760]  regardless of what we think of Assange dressed up in you know clownish
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.960]  suits and things you know out there play-balling I mean you know I mean who
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.840]  blames me you know he's a worldly guy's having some fun but the larger issue is
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:06.360]  we can't allow him under EU feminazi rules with this woman with CIA
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.240]  connections and writing things about how to set men up in the legal system and
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.640]  they're throwing parties for him the day after he supposedly rapes him and
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.720]  that they're sending text out on on Twitter about how wonderful it all is
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.160]  and they're buying in bus tickets but then they're saying well he argued about
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.400]  the condom and and and so that's the quote liberal fascism is that if you
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:31.640]  disagree with global warming they want to arrest you in Europe if you have
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.320]  unprotected sex it's rape I mean that's what the feminist teach they teach that
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:40.520]  that that sex is rape when a man's involved because men are the devil yes
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.560]  yes yes absolutely but I think you're absolutely right on the bigger picture
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.600]  here Alex it is a it is very there is no question that the system the the the
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.320]  various governments that the various administrators in Europe and in America
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.920]  would really love to close down the internet or I mean or Robert limited
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.880]  freedoms you know for example climate gate the climate gate would never have
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.920]  happened if it hadn't been for the for the Internet and you look at the
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:15.720]  difference in the way that climate gate was reported in the MSM by not at all
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.240]  and the way it was reported on the internet by an awful lot but we broke
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.200]  their blockade it took three weeks but their total blockade failed I'm sorry
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:34.800]  go ahead yeah you know I kind of like like like you and pretty like most of
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:39.920]  us I had faith in the system I had faith in the establishment because I thought well
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.160]  you know governments you know they're doing their best and they're trying to
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.880]  help us and blah blah blah blah it's only as I've got older and wiser and
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:53.680]  looked at the world and realized that that really the whole system is a
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.360]  conspiracy against the against the individual against personal freedom so
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:05.960]  many people now are cozying up to to the systems of government in order to make
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:12.400]  their money you know for example Britain is the percentage of the economy now
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:19.840]  owned by the British government is 57% well in the Victorian era at the peak
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:24.680]  of Britain's economic power government had about 10% of the economy can you see
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:31.960]  what it can do to a nation when when the public sector the state owns 57% of the
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:39.400]  economy even in the Soviet block at the height of the Cold War the the
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:45.120]  communist the governments in countries like like Romania and Hungary had about
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:54.560]  70% of the economy so Britain is only 13% away of being a communist state well
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:00.120]  it certainly is and and we see powerful robber barons funding the mega state
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.560]  because that knocks out all their competition and I found that if you
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:08.720]  explain that to a grassroots liberal they stop the bedwetting and figure it
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.920]  out they really think government loves them and is going to give them a free
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.160]  lollipop all government is going to do is basically cut their legs off to make
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.520]  them dependent and and and and and then allow only the biggest pigs to get at the
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.320]  trough and feed and we're the little piglets the rants we're gonna be pushed
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:29.760]  to the sides and we're gonna starve to death yeah well I think one of the
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:38.360]  one of the great the evil lies told by the left is that that capitalism is the
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.680]  same as corporatism capitalism I believe in capitalism I believe in free
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:47.600]  markets I believe that people should be allowed to make money and spend that
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.500]  money as they see fit that's freedom stay there tell us the difference on the
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:55.480]  other side James Dillingpole I'm Alex Jones present planet TV info wars.com

[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:22.200]  James Dillingpole telegraph writer from England got cut off with his point
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:26.640]  about the difference between corporatism that Mussolini talked about
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:33.160]  being fascism that he loved versus real free market I call it crony
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:37.680]  capitalism or insider capitalism and then notice that all these big quote
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:42.560]  insider capitalist TV stations like MSNBC they've blamed the derivative
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:47.760]  scandal on the free market but it's government backing that fraud that
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:51.000]  allowed it to happen and it's government regulators that allowed it to
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.480]  happen who engineered the fraud with people like Bernie Madoff going back
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:12.600]  to your point James Dillingpole. Yes well exactly I mean one of the worst things that could happen after this current financial crisis that we're experiencing the worst thing that could possibly happen is that people buy the lie that this is what happens when free market capitalism goes wrong
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.080]  this is not what happens when free market capitalism goes wrong this is what happens
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:24.520]  when government regulation distorts the market and skews the system so that the
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:29.880]  free market capitalism cannot self-regulate as it does it left to its own
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.120]  devices that's how it works apply and demand it's very simple it's a
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.200]  beautiful system. And if a company engages in fraud you know they get in
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:44.080]  trouble from the state level and people learn that that company's a fraud and
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.200]  don't invest with them just like a restaurant that gives people food poisoning
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.320]  they're going to get shut down because people aren't going to visit them. You're
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:56.680]  absolutely right I think one of the terrible assumptions of big
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.880]  government is that people are stupid and therefore they need to be treated like
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:06.880]  cattle and and heard it around by the enlightened few. And we know that since
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.760]  government took over education in Europe in the US the US has gone from number
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.600]  one to number 26 or 25 way behind even third-world countries because they've
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.360]  been treating us like cattle some people are becoming cattle. Hey we've had
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.100]  exactly the same experience in England and it has been a disaster we were
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:28.840]  plummeting in the international league tables you know we can't read and write
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:36.880]  anymore it's extraordinary. But to get back to the original point I'm sure you've had our old friend Michael Moore on your show an awful lot he must be a big fan I imagine.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:43.240]  Michael Moore made that terrible movie in which he about capitalism in which he
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.960]  tried to blame capitalism for the world's ills. Look, nobody likes big
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.520]  businesses, big business, nobody likes Shell, BP, all these corporate
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:59.960]  multinational giants which are in bed with big government. They're
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.320]  governments I mean they've got their own spies their own systems they attach
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.840]  themselves to government contracts so government welfare I mean they basically
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:13.560]  are governments. Exactly and the reason these big companies they love regulation
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.400]  they want more regulation because they know it imposes costs which they can
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:23.680]  afford but the little guy trying to run his company cannot afford you know they
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.800]  can't afford little guys can't afford all the regulation to do with with you
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.360]  know employing a certain number of minorities and women and allowing them time
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.880]  off and stuff they can't afford the regulation BP Shell they can wear it
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:43.040]  it's not it's not Exxon they can wear it it's not a problem for them so they
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.240]  love regulation. Well it's like this food safety act it's admitted that was
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:58.000]  written by big agribusiness to shut down small farms and ranches. Yeah, absolutely, of course it was, you really have to look at the example of what happened in Nazi Germany.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.240]  Nazi Germany all the big companies got in bed with the government you know you
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:07.320]  scratch our backs we'll scratch yours and we'll get on with the system but
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:12.360]  private property you know forget about that forget about three markets forget
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.040]  about freedom. James I want you to do five more minutes with us one minute
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:20.680]  break I'm gonna come back and get briefly into some more of what you see
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:26.200]  happening going on down in southern Mexico at Cancun and when we're gonna
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.000]  learn if these scallywags are successful that's pretty frightening that
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  you're saying they may be they're playing possum right now and we'll also
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.720]  talk about Ted Turner the hypocrite you Genesis we're back in 60 seconds and I'm

[01:59:53.560 --> 02:00:01.320]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:12.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:20.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:24.000]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:29.960]  we're now in hour number three coming up in about 30 minutes we're scheduled to
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:35.680]  be joined by Senator elect Rand Paul I've got some questions for him on the
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:40.480]  economy on what his agenda is going to be if you've got questions for him you
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:45.320]  can send it to twitter.com forward slash came and see on the wall over there
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:50.400]  through the glare twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones and we'll get a
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:56.920]  few of your questions in for Senator elect Rand Paul as well who's scheduled
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:59.960]  to be coming up again I'm gonna in the next two segments I'm gonna cover news
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:05.640]  there's a lot of it I haven't gotten to yet but James finishing up other tidbits
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:09.920]  I noticed on your blog you point out that we should ban dihydrogen monoxide
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:15.920]  and we've done the study most greenies agree ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:22.200]  Well it's a deadly substance as you know Alex sharks live in it sharks and crocodiles and piranhas
[02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:28.680]  it can drown you very easily it erodes metal it's the primary cause of the
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:33.960]  clouds which which are responsible for global warming so I think if we don't
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.240]  ban this many dihydrogen monoxide we're all gonna die and this of course is what
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.640]  many of the delegates at the Cancun were signing up for they were asked to sign a
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.320]  petition and they were filmed signing that petition to ban dihydrogen
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.720]  monoxide and of course what they didn't didn't realize because they're stupid
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.480]  that way is that dihydrogen monoxide is the same thing as H2O which of course as
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.080]  oil listeners know is water I mean this is the kind of this is the kind of world
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.680]  we live in where people will sign petitions to ban something which which is
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.840]  perfectly harmless. Luckily enough Greenpeace I think tried to do something
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:14.840]  similar with chlorine they tried to ban an element well it's just not possible
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:21.720]  you can't do that. Well I mean here they are being asked to sign at the delegates
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:25.680]  this is the type of idiots the UN gets and they're saying ban water and and
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.680]  I've seen other TV hosts do the same thing at environmental events
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:35.280]  Penn and Teller got over 95% of the people to sign it. Yeah they're good men
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.040]  Penn and Teller they're on they're on our side but Alex we've got two weapons in this
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.520]  war at least two weapons one of them is the truth and the truth is on our side
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.320]  and it is not on their side and the second thing we've got is humor I like
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:52.360]  nothing more than baiting liberals and I've just written a book about this
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:58.000]  the very thing called 365 ways to drive a liberal crazy coming out in
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.560]  Regnery next in January. Oh good we'll have you on. And it's just designed to
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:07.320]  annoy you know liberals in countless different ways you know jokes about
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:12.320]  Ted Turner and jokes about all our people. But why do we call them liberals they're
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:15.920]  not I mean grass roots they're liberals well-meaning idiots that say ban water
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.200]  but up top they're vicious criminals. We are the true liberals we are the
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.240]  classical liberals we believe in small government they are a perverted form of
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:26.800]  liberals. We're gonna have you on about the new book coming up but just in the
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.600]  last minute and a half what else is on the radar screen are you saying they
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.880]  could be successful getting this world government set up at this meeting. Well
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:39.200]  besides the truth and humor we also have the weather on our side don't we I think
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:42.800]  it's gonna be it's gonna get better again get worse before it gets better. I
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:46.480]  think people are gonna get angrier and angrier and angrier and ask what is
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:51.600]  why are our governments behaving in this crazy way. I see no sign so far that our
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.400]  governments are changing at all I mean okay you've got you've got the midterms
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:58.640]  and that but still every major government in the world is committed to the
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.880]  idea of man-made global warming as a problem that needs addressing and
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.200]  until somebody starts giving away and shows some sense we are not going to
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:13.560]  improve things. Well amazing I really appreciate you joining us but but I mean
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:16.320]  earlier you said they're playing possum they could get something through I
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:23.320]  mean you look at the European Union look how how that has grown you know by
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:27.280]  constantly denying that it's trying to grow by saying you know trust us no where
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:30.600]  we don't want to be a political union we just want to be an economic union
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:40.080]  oh hang on a second looks like we've turned into a political union as well and look you're now stuck with this currency that you can't get rid of you can't devalue your economy screwed
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.280]  sorry about that but I'm afraid I'll be ruled by Germans now in other words the
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.360]  European Union has achieved what Hitler couldn't never achieve in seven years of
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.480]  war it's done it you know Europe is stuffed. Amazing we'll talk to you coming up
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:57.320]  in January when the new book comes out. God bless you James Dellingpole. Thank
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:01.160]  you guys. All right we'll be right back with a bunch of news then Rand Paul.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:05.360]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:11.240]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says
[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:16.040]  that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:20.520]  most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:24.880]  existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.840]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:32.920]  established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:37.280]  sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret

[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:06.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:10.800]  is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.760]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:19.440]  turned immense influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:24.080]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:28.440]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:33.720]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.000]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.520]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:46.080]  check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:51.720]  we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:57.840]  DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at

[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:06.320]  Business Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:13.320]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:23.480]  We are now back live. I'm pretty excited about getting Rand Paul on the shows. I
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:28.040]  can now call him senator. You know that drives the globalist to absolutely mad
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:35.920]  with rage but he's coming up here in about 25 minutes or so from now you know
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.200]  the best way to get to all this news is just to start covering it. I'm gonna do
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:47.000]  it right now. 100 million sign up to report on themselves on Twitter in 2010
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:53.280]  a Matt Ryan article talking about how a Twitter's an admitted tracking grid.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.520]  People say then why are you on Twitter? Well we're using the matrix to fight the
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:05.880]  matrix. It's the same thing with Google and all of it continuing that with some
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.800]  of the new WikiLeaks information. I'm gonna get to that coming up here in a
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.240]  moment but let's cover WikiLeaks right now. Here's Reuters, WikiLeaks, Cables.
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:21.120]  Pfizer took aim at Nigeria. US drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.640]  evidence of corruption against Nigeria's attorney general to convince him to drop
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:30.120]  legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children and I see
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:36.000]  it in the news today and in Reuters about a bunch of deaths from another drug
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.240]  company and vaccines so it's just ongoing the type of dirty tricks that
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:46.920]  that are engaged in effect in front of pull up that Reuters story right now. I
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.880]  think I hit print on it earlier so it should be it wasn't my health stack
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.440]  should probably be in the printer over there. Continuing Russian official
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:59.320]  WikiLeaks Julian Assange should receive a Nobel Prize then it goes on to say an
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.840]  unnamed Russian official suggested Wednesday that detainee WikiLeaks
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:06.600]  found Julian Assange should be awarded a Nobel Prize. Non-governmental and
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.080]  governmental organizations should think of ways to help him. A source in the
[02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:16.200]  Kremlin administration told RAI Novostat perhaps he should be awarded a Nobel
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:21.680]  Prize. Wonder what happened to him if he started leaking Russian secrets though.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:25.800]  Again continuing Glenn Beck is starting to change his mind on WikiLeaks
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:30.320]  starting to say regardless what you think of Assange you've got to you get
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.920]  him out of jail because he's being set up and this endangers the entire media
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:41.520]  and free speech if we don't. Wow I agree with him on that. Hackers today vowed
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:47.400]  to disrupt online shoppers on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:54.000]  attacking Visa, Mastercard sites and many other sites associated with shutting
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.200]  off Julian Assange and WikiLeaks bank accounts and other things.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:02.400]  UN Human Rights head concerned over pressure on WikiLeaks the United
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.400]  Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights since she is concerned over
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.280]  reports of government pressure on internet service providers and other
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:13.640]  companies so the UN gets to play the part of the good cop here when they are a
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:19.560]  creature of the Anglo-American military industrial complex. Anonymous big hacker
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:25.000]  group are running attacks on anti WikiLeaks sites with low Orion Ion
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:32.280]  Canon and you can go over that at some Cryptone.org the system that they are
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:37.200]  using to do that that's not an actual Ion Canon from space I guess they're
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:45.120]  using the term from Star Wars for this particular system. Dutch police arrest a
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.960]  suspect in Pro WikiLeaks hacking this is out of the Wall Street Journal Dutch
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:52.680]  authorities said they arrested a 16 year old boy suspected of being involved in
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.560]  attacks on the websites of Mastercard and Visa that were allegedly mounted by
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:04.840]  sympathizers of document leaking WikiLeaks site continuing with what's
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:11.600]  happening with WikiLeaks here Assange lawyers prepare for U.S. spying
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:19.000]  indictment attorneys say American indictment related to espionage act
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:24.560]  imminent for WikiLeaks founder amazing you've got a foreigner who's not even
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:33.080]  American citizen and they're talking about indicting him for espionage when
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.360]  he's not even in their power he didn't engage in the supposed espionage within
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:40.880]  the United States they're just basically putting a bounding out on him or
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.200]  we're getting ready to this this is unprecedented I mean will the Communist
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.240]  Chinese if I post a secret document hypothetically that came out of their
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:55.560]  country will they announce they want me arrested for espionage and then they
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.040]  grabbed me and claimed that I was rude to the Tooth Fairy or something or that
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:03.960]  I didn't wear a condom or something and then I'll just disappear into a black
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:12.000]  hole of purgatory regardless of what you think about WikiLeaks you've got to get
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.920]  Assange out of there they are going to burn free speech and the First
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:20.080]  Amendment and and they're going to use him as the match to do it WikiLeaks
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.280]  founder Julian Assange the man behind the publication the more than a quarter
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:26.720]  million class of our U.S. diplomatic cables could soon be facing spying
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:30.800]  charges in the U.S. related to the espionage act Assange lawyers said to
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:36.120]  Dave our position of course is that we don't believe it applies mr. Assange and
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:40.240]  that in any event he's entitled to First Amendment protections as publisher of
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:45.040]  WikiLeaks and any prosecution of the espionage act would in my view be
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.720]  unconstitutional and put at risk all media organizations in the U.S. Assange's
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:55.240]  attorney Jennifer Robinson told ABC News well no kidding torturing people's
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:00.480]  children to get answers out of them is totally wicked and illegal stealing
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.360]  trillions of dollars is illegal and not telling Congress where the money went
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:09.280]  us having TSA goons radiates you and stick their hands down your pants is
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.400]  illegal so much of what this criminal constellation known as government does
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:20.360]  is illegal but they don't care they just do it and I'm telling you this is
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:26.080]  Cass Sunstein who was at the beginning at the setup of WikiLeaks we know that
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:31.640]  he wrote an article bragging about it in the Washington Post and this is a
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:35.480]  government intelligence operation and right now I can say with certainty
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:41.280]  Julian Assange is the 2010 Lee Harvey Oswald Tim McVeigh but of the
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:46.800]  information age they're gonna use us to pass the cybersecurity all this other
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:52.720]  legislation this is dangerous this is dangerous dangerous dangerous I mean
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.160]  what did Obama trying to pass right now in Congress and it looks like it's gonna
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:01.320]  pass where U.S. company small businesses can't even bid on military contracts
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:07.880]  whether it's putting in plumbing or a new roof or m16s or bullets cartridges
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:11.600]  and they can just put them all on a blacklist and I even let them know
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.440]  they're on a secret list no judge no jury just the Pentagon does it and only
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:20.600]  select groups get the contracts this is the new America just total insider
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.600]  lawlessness
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:35.080]  meanwhile you have the Prince Prince Charles and his haggling Camilla
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:40.600]  bulls or whatever her name is Camilla Parker bulls there are people rampaging
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:45.360]  all over London about having their two issues tripled oh but the taxes are all

[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:03.520]  people are running around and and they threw some bags of paint on the car
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:07.920]  reportedly and yelled at them and said off with their head and the head of the
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:13.400]  Metro police in London says they were lucky not to be shot police chief says
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:19.760]  armed officers showed enormous restraint as mob attacked Charles and Camilla I've
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:24.760]  seen the video it's pretty nittying it's people slapping on the windows and and
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:32.520]  Camilla Parker bulls the Duchess of detritus or whatever her name is the
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.440]  Duchess of filth the Duchess of garbage you know people say that these
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.960]  criminals don't run anything two years ago in Canada that the Queen used the
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:43.840]  governor-general to shut down the parliament because they didn't do what
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:50.200]  she wanted happened in 79 in the late 70s in Australia I mean this is a criminal
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:58.960]  organization so the the mob bosses son with his hag are all dressed up in
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:07.000]  their trumpet outfits and the Duchess of detritus and the prince of puke were

[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.120]  to put it into police force and the CPS to kidnap their children but these these
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:10.720]  filthy brits who don't like our German royal family that runs everything the
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:16.000]  sax cover goothers and we'll deal with them I mean literally Charles looked

[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:31.080]  I'm sorry you can tell they all both of them almost did a Queen Elizabeth the
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:36.120]  second in their pants you know I don't usually do potty humor but around the
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:40.360]  office you know when somebody's got to get out of a meeting or something they're
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:45.000]  like I'm sorry it'll just be a Rockefeller you know that means a quick
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.400]  you know minute or two but sometimes they go hey I gotta do a Queen Elizabeth
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:55.240]  the second number two and all right folks I apologize our radio stations a
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:02.840]  very family-friendly clean show but when I start imitating the royals I look at
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.800]  them running around like a vermin in the streets I can't wait for our world
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.160]  government extermination forces in place to remove as many of them as possible
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:16.200]  I love sucking off of them but goodness I like to go out to the theater dressed up
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:21.720]  like an effeminate peacock with all of my metals for stuning my breast with my
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:27.360]  hagglet wearing a giant crown on a head but to actually see them turn against me
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:32.120]  I guess all those PR shows we finance telling them how weak and pathetic we
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:36.000]  are aren't working they actually know that we're the ones sucking everything
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.560]  out of them I just lectured them last month that they shouldn't take a hot
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:47.360]  bath but I have a royal trains and 77 aircraft and 94 palaces but they
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:51.200]  shouldn't be able to take a hot bath and I'm so pleased that the old ladies have
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:54.680]  arrived in the buses to stay warm now because they can't pay for the gas
[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:59.440]  allowance but now we're heating all of our palaces quite nicely and after we've

[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:23.200]  we are back live I mentioned some of this yesterday but I want to get back into
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:28.080]  it because I need to write an article about this or make a video about it
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:34.800]  because for 15 years I've known about the government worldwide in every Western
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.520]  nation from Australia to the US from Canada to England from Germany to
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:45.600]  Denmark taking people's blood at birth and putting it in a UN financed global
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.520]  government database and finally lawsuits got filed by some of my listeners in
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:55.200]  Minnesota over this and in Texas and they've won and they found out that yes
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:58.920]  it's an army database well it's more than that look I was sent the documents
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:04.720]  almost 15 years ago by a nurse in San Antonio and Jason Douglas wrote a great
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:08.720]  article but he's going off what the media said you know 2002 Texas started
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:15.520]  taking blood no 39 years ago worldwide they began taking blood from all
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:20.320]  newborns and lying and saying it's got to be sent to the health department to do
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.280]  a blood test they take two sets they do the blood test at the hospital or sent
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:29.480]  into a lab that blood goes and is being kept and sold to pharma companies and
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:33.480]  they've had cases where they patented certain proteins and things in your
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:36.600]  blood and then when you go to get genetic treatment later guess what they've
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:40.800]  already got you on file and it's for eugenics and bioweapons development
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:48.720]  that's all come out so it's it's it's so frustrating that even now that this is
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:53.560]  admitted that I must not have done my job because you know people don't even
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:58.080]  know the tip of the iceberg but you know there's a whitewash out of KXAM the
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.500]  statesman had one and they go on to admit that in the last lawsuit the
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:08.120]  government settled they admitted that they were selling it to the army well
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.000]  it's not just that it's a state law you know they claim oh it's a state law we
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.800]  test the blood for for the diseases but it's a state law to get your blood to
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:19.320]  give to the army it's illegal what they're doing with it but they have the
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:23.440]  law about collecting it and the law is on the hospitals you as a parent don't
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:30.040]  have to do it it's a law that they have to attempt it and there's now a class
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:33.840]  action suit been filed over newborn babies blood going to the Pentagon going
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:40.880]  to private companies and at the end of it the the government says it's
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.600]  preposterous that we've got a DNA database when they say a minute before
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:51.960]  on the TV piece and in the paper that that's what the lawsuit showed but those
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.520]  documents are all public now this stuff anybody did the research it's all out
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:01.360]  there okay they for 39 years if you were born in New Zealand Australia England
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.680]  Canada the United States Western Europe there's a we've already been under a
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:11.880]  global government it's all standardized we've got head start they've got
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:16.560]  secure start you know in Europe and other areas we've got telescreens
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:23.360]  barking orders they've got them going in England it's the same deal it's
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:30.400]  continuity of agenda and people better wake up to that and here's another one
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.920]  the Texas Tribune lawsuit alleges DSHS sold baby DNA samples that's admitted
[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:41.080]  you can't get the mainstream media around here to report on what's admitted
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:45.520]  it'd be like if the space shuttle took off and you know flew into orbit they'd
[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.040]  say allegedly the space shuttle took off or if the Sun came up they have a
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:54.240]  headline allegedly the Sun came up but then somebody goes on a message board
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:58.280]  and says there are some of bin Laden and they're gonna attack and the AP and
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:02.440]  Reuters run headlines bin Laden says he's gonna attack and then later they say
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:08.360]  this came from a message board see they're always playing it down and I'm
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.800]  not saying these these writers that can't say any of the statesmen or eight
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:15.320]  government agents they've already bought into tyranny and that this is all for
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:18.320]  their own good and government loves them and their child like in their
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.680]  mentality so well it can't be true they sold it secretly that's a little scary
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:26.560]  so even though it's admitted they did we'll just say it's a ledge so we all
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:31.320]  feel better you know we don't want to create mistrust of the government
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  because civically the right thing to do is to teach trust you know they teach
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.960]  in journalism school in this country to teach trust of the government what is
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.920]  Congressman Cohen trying to shut down Jesse Ventura's TV show saying his
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:47.960]  editorial he says that you know we've got to have a media that teaches people to
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:54.600]  trust the government that's that's how out of touch they are the government
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:58.080]  thinks you're cattle they stick their hands down your pants they put you in
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:01.940]  scanners they're taking blood samples at checkpoints warrantlessly under federal
[02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:05.520]  grants local police are being federalized their spine on everything you
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:12.520]  do it's out of control and it needs to stop you know well we're about to go to
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:16.800]  break and then come back with a senator like Rand Paul hopefully because he's
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:20.720]  busy schedule I do just want to remind folks this this show is listed

[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:49.480]  home of the brain seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone
[02:32:49.480 --> 02:33:01.920]  go to gusset.com forward slash America today
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:15.280]  of the information war it's Alex Jones alright he's promised to come back in
[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:19.160]  the new year for longer we only got him for about 10 15 minutes right now how
[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:26.960]  amazing senator elect Rand Paul going to the Senate senator I just want to say
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:32.160]  congratulations to you well thank you it's good to be with you again Alex my
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:35.440]  first question is they threw everything they could at you one of the biggest
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:40.480]  demonization campaigns in modern history it failed what does that say about the
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:46.120]  dinosaur corporate establishment media well I think it's amazing that you know
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:49.680]  not only do they throw the kitchen sink at us they made up a few things along
[02:33:49.680 --> 02:33:54.280]  the way but what I would say is that the mainstream media doesn't control the
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:57.840]  process anymore I think there are so many other outlets where people are
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:03.800]  getting their news talk radios a big one the internet's another big one and I
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.080]  think also that the scare tactics of saying oh so-and-so is going to take
[02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:14.040]  away or cut off your grandmother's social security doesn't work anymore because
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:18.840]  people realize that if we do nothing no one will have social security no one
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:23.160]  will have Medicare because the politicians have basically spent all the
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:26.840]  money and there has to be some reform whether you like it or not there's
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:30.040]  gonna have to be some kind of entitlement reform well moving quickly
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:34.160]  through these questions again you're gracious to join us obviously I'm sure
[02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:38.400]  you know that Cass Sunstein at the White House the commissar excuse me
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:42.880]  commissioner of the FCC said freedom without government control of media was
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:47.720]  an aberration they're really moving in right now to try to curtail free speech
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:52.680]  what's your concern with that senator well funny I've been concerned about the
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:56.480]  fairness doctrine ever since I was a teenager and I can remember writing to a
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:01.240]  conservative leader back then and the conservative leaders said oh we need a
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:04.840]  fairness doctrine because the liberals are controlling all the radio and the
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:08.280]  television now it's funny it's the opposite now that there's more
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:12.960]  conservative commentators the liberals want to stifle the conservatives but I
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:16.400]  think free speech is free speech whether it's a liberal commentator or
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:20.600]  conservative commentator and that we shouldn't have the government involved
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:24.760]  in deciding what we hear on the radio waves what we read in the newspaper what
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:29.920]  we write what is written in books senator obviously you're watching the
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:35.440]  lame duck congress try to legalize illegal aliens with the dream act trying
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:40.400]  to further gut society trying to pass the food safety bill which was written
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:46.800]  by big agri to shut down local farms and ranches boy I tell you they are really
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:52.040]  showing how disconnected they are are you gonna try to lead in the Senate to
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:55.920]  make sure that whatever horrible things they do like Obamacare and other things
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:01.080]  are repealed absolutely and the other thing is is you gotta wonder why when
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.120]  we just had such a big historic mandate of an election that they're trying to
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:09.560]  ram all these things things through in a lame duck of course we know why but the
[02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.880]  thing is is we shouldn't let them do it the people have spoken and elected you
[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:18.400]  know nearly a hundred new people in the house thirteen new people in the Senate
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:22.920]  that we need to wait till the the electoral process has been allowed to
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:26.760]  occur and the new people get there so yes anything they try to do in this
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:32.400]  session I think we will try to reverse and I think that you're already hearing
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:35.800]  people you know people are saying that let's wait for the new people that's
[02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:40.520]  the senator to be said today let's wait for the new senators absolutely they've
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:44.820]  certainly been rebuked in their activities but they're like a bunch of
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:49.440]  drunken sailors trying to steal as much as they can speaking of your father
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:56.360]  headline Ron Paul author of in the Fed to lead panel overseeing central bank
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:01.680]  are you going to join with your father in an attempt to get rid of the private
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:05.720]  Federal Reserve system that won't tell Congress where the trillions went well
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:10.400]  how exciting is it to have the the probably historically the number one
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.680]  critic of the Fed being in charge of oversight of the Fed that's got to excite
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:18.800]  people throughout the country and I think a lot of good will come of it I
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:22.360]  think the first thing we have to do is try to audit the Fed and have a real
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:27.400]  meaningful audit of the Fed I was amazed at the coalition my dad put together
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:32.480]  over 330 people in the house signed on to it thirty some odd people in the
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:38.520]  Senate and yet like so many legislative shenanigans they stole victory from him
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:42.480]  and they gave us a watered-down audit but even the watered-down audit we're
[02:37:42.480 --> 02:37:46.360]  getting some information about what the Fed bought but boy he could really get
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:50.240]  through if he could get through a real audit I will be supporting and
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:55.640]  introducing that in the Senate as well so I think the potential for us shedding
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:38:00.280]  some light on what the Fed does is enormous a lot of folks obviously want
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:07.080]  your father to run for president are you thinking about or are you getting
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:13.040]  questions senator elect about running for president yourself well no but it's
[02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:17.440]  very complimentary to get such a question but you know I think I haven't
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:21.280]  even really been sworn into my first office it might be premature for me to
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:24.840]  be thinking about it was the same thing with George Washington he went right
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:30.200]  from general to president I mean we need doctors and farmers and people to be
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:35.640]  senators and and and presidents we don't need you know the the lawyers I mean
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.480]  it's so great that you and your father are both doctors I mean you're there
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:45.440]  right now seeing patients today in between this interview I mean your
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.160]  victory is our victory and and I just want to commend you well I appreciate
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:53.520]  that I know you've got a lot of loyal listeners and we hear from them and we
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.840]  meet them across the country and all across Kentucky I end up running into
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:02.720]  your loyal fans but the the interesting thing is is we're going to do some
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:07.280]  things that have never been done before in the sense that as soon as I get there
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:10.800]  I'm going to talk about and introduce a bill that will cut a significant amount
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:14.640]  of spending we have a bill we're working on that will cut 500 billion
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.520]  dollars worth of spending and that's what we've got to start and I think the
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:22.040]  American people are ready to hear it because the American people know that
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.280]  we're mortgaging our future to China that we're printing up the money to pay
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:30.360]  for these massive deaths and that ultimately as the day of reckoning
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:36.000]  comes closer and closer we are in fear of destroying our country if we don't do
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.080]  something about this and so I think people are no longer afraid at least I'm
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:44.400]  not afraid to go ahead and introduce significant spending cuts and say look
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.280]  if you're serious about this problem you need to vote for this absolutely
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.840]  discussion senator sorry interrupted we only got about six minutes left with you
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:56.360]  here today and I've got so many questions it turn MSNBC was deceitful they
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.960]  lied about what your real views were they tried all sorts of dirty tricks they
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:04.520]  said if you don't like Obamacare you are a racist we now learn that hundreds of
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:10.520]  millions of dollars from your father's even partial audit of our tax money went
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:16.080]  to General Electric and MSNBC how creepy is that to know that a government
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:22.360]  media source like like the Kremlin or something went after you well the weird
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:26.520]  thing about it also is is that you know I tell people that once upon a time our
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:32.840]  dollar was backed by gold until about 1971 at least partially from 71 to about
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:38.880]  the year 2005 our dollar was backed by at least US Treasury bills debt wasn't the
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:42.160]  best thing in the world but it was the least of the government debt from about
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:49.240]  2005 on though it's backed by I guess buying GE MSNBC backed by buying used
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:54.920]  car loans basically backed by what we were what the government calls toxic
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.280]  assets things that you and I and no person with a rational investment mine
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:03.560]  would ever buy we were forced to buy by the Federal Reserve buying it but that's
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:08.920]  essentially what backs the US dollar now toxic assets are now what we pyramid
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:15.240]  the dollar on and that is worrisome incredible dealing with the carbon tax
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:21.160]  when you said I've got a message from the Tea Party to Washington we're going
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:26.400]  to stop you from this carbon tax California went ahead with it a 20%
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.200]  tax they're already got over 30% unemployment 60 minutes reports what
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:37.240]  are you going to do as a senator sir to try to aggressively block Obama from
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:42.520]  implementing his agenda by stealth through the EPA and FDA and other groups
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.200]  yeah that's one of my biggest fears and one of the things that through the
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.560]  election I learned more about our government was that I was amazed and
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:56.720]  appalled to know how much the unelected bureaucrats are doing and that basically
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:00.640]  if something fails in the Senate or on the House they simply do it anyway through
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:05.760]  these bureaucracies and so part of the reform agenda that I think the Tea Party
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:10.920]  stands for one of the items that I will push for is sunsetting all regulations
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:15.720]  basically if they pass the regulation it has to be voted on in Congress by a
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:20.040]  certain period of time maybe six months maybe a year but it cannot just be put
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:24.320]  on the books by unelected bureaucrats and really we're in danger of having the
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:28.840]  government run by these standing bureaucracies you know the founding
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:33.480]  fathers talked about standing armies now what we have is a standing bureaucracy
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.040]  that we need to fear and we really need to have governmental reform and that's
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:41.280]  a big thing that I'm going to be pushing as part of what I call the Tea Party
[02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:47.640]  platform amazing senator dealing with the TSA we had your father the honorable
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:52.400]  congressman and medical doctor from Texas where I hail from we had him on
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:55.040]  about three weeks ago and it made national news and the drudge report and
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:58.720]  ABC News in other places he hadn't really complained about it previously he was
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:03.440]  against the TSA and it's groping and radiating people but now the TSA isn't
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:06.480]  announcing they're going to continue sticking their hands actually in people's
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:10.400]  pants they only grabbed him on the outside of the pants and the same thing
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.080]  happened to former governor Ventura and now the Indian ambassador says she'll
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:19.240]  never come back here again that's in the news today I mean who runs things the
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:23.880]  TSA and Homeland Security or the Congress plus what are the feds doing
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:27.600]  seizing control of transportation now they're expanding out to the roads
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.960]  they're putting telescreens in Walmart with Napolitano giving people orders
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.000]  what's your take on all this Orwellian stuff and what's your plan to deal with
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.320]  that I think it's amazing that after 10 years we still don't have a frequent
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:45.640]  flyer plan it just shows you the incompetence of the federal government
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.320]  that you know I my father flies twice a week my brother-in-law flies three or
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:54.800]  four times a week why is there not some sort of voluntary program or private
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:58.920]  program where you could volunteer to have a little more background check but
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:03.480]  do it voluntarily and have a private group that you do it and then they you
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:08.760]  fly through the airport or walk through without obstruction there's no reason
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:12.160]  why this couldn't be done except for the government does not seem to be able to
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:17.720]  do anything in a logical fashion and so instead of saying well let's investigate
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:21.520]  certain people who are flying in from certain countries most of the danger I
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.560]  think at risk on the planes is inner people coming from other countries so
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:31.120]  why don't we look at those folks you know look at the flight plan of who's
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:34.960]  coming to visit us from certain countries and do some investigation in
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:40.480]  advance of those folks but I think we're wasting time on the millions and
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:44.400]  millions of Americans who aren't a threat and when you waste so much time on
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.080]  those people you don't have enough time to spend on the people who are a
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:53.200]  threat well senator Rand Paul joining us live only a matter to left they know
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:57.040]  that the American people aren't the threat but the Mayak and Homeland Security
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:01.000]  Report you know again your father it said if you have a Ron Paul sticker
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.120]  that's the enemy returning veterans it was in the news yesterday that TSA's
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:08.920]  harassing our returning troops I mean you're being diplomatic and I respect
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:11.840]  that but but what do you I mean in your gut do you agree that this is just a
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:17.080]  federal power grab and they want to train us you know normal citizens to
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:22.200]  basically submit like we're criminals in a prison I think the danger anytime you
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.200]  give a government agency so much power is that exactly what Rahm Emanuel said
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:33.320]  about government you know let no crisis go wasted let no crisis deter us or you
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:38.640]  know you let's use those crises to go ahead and foment and use government to
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:43.960]  grow larger and larger so yeah there is a danger and what they do is they suck
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:48.160]  in some well-meaning people and they want the power to say that it's going
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:51.480]  after terrorism which none of us want terrorists to be allowed to attack our
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:55.360]  country but in the process we all get swooped up in it and all of our
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:58.760]  liberties get infringed upon and that that's the real danger in these things
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:04.240]  but it always works upon trying to show you something that is rational
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:07.680]  something that people don't want to have happened nobody wants another
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:12.720]  terrorist attack but in doing so then everybody gets lumped in together and
[02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:19.200]  our freedoms get you know eroded and taken away last question sir obviously
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:24.480]  there are a lot of Republicans and like like Boehner who it was in
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:27.000]  Bloomberg was going to try to block your father getting the committee
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:31.800]  chairmanship that he was already supposed to get in seniority and and
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:34.760]  blocking so many others he's a protégé of Newt Gennrich who supports
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.640]  global warming taxes and you know globalism I'm not trying to get a fight
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:43.800]  going between Republicans but we've seen former senator Trent Lott bragging the
[02:46:43.800 --> 02:46:48.600]  news that hey we're gonna co-opt all these new senators and house members I
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:52.840]  would hope that if you do see the co-opting that that not only we know
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:55.840]  you won't sell out we know that you're honorable family you're an honorable
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.640]  person values are what matter but hopefully you'll blow the whistle and
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:05.920]  and and truly lead and and let us know about you know who the good guys are and
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.680]  who the bad guys are we know senator Dementz good and a few others but what's
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:13.320]  your basic statement on that I mean are they already trying to pull you into the
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.760]  smoky rooms well I think what's interesting is that we've already had an
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:21.040]  impact and we haven't even gotten up there and I think they have heard the
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:24.400]  message and you've heard some of them saying you know what we heard the
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:29.720]  message of the election but the the real devil is in the details and you know
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:34.560]  what these negotiations are what happens behind closed doors and I will do my
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:40.120]  utmost to shine light on that but also to stand up in the Senate and say this
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:44.280]  isn't what we're going to do we have to do something about the debt and we can't
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:49.000]  just keep spending money so yeah I think you'll find that I will be a voice
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.640]  that will look for opportunities at every turn to try to slow down their
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:59.120]  agenda and also to correct things and I think that that's not really been done
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:02.440]  in the past because so many of the people who get elected have been in
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:06.360]  office forever and ever I've never been in office before so I think it gives me
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:11.520]  a perspective where I haven't been beaten down by the system and I go
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:15.840]  there really truly with the belief that I can and want to be part of a movement
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.360]  that changes our country for the better yes sir in closing and I've got to get
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:25.640]  back to patience well one caveat here I know that that we do need to cut spending
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:30.000]  you've you've called for cutting this a defense I believe you said by a hundred
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:35.200]  billion that's that's large that's substantive but also don't we need to
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:39.520]  say no more bailouts if somebody like Paulson comes down there again like
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.480]  happened in October two years ago and says we're gonna have martial law we're
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:47.960]  gonna have collapse if you don't do this I mean what do we do at that point
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:53.160]  when they try to hold our financial system hostage again I mean what are you
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:56.680]  planning to do at that point I think you need to have people who are brave
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:49:01.240]  enough and confident enough in their belief and freedom to stand up and say
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:08.520]  we can survive a bankruptcy and also to point out that AIG bankruptcy or lack of
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:12.840]  bankruptcy in their bailout basically wasn't bailing out just AIG it was
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.440]  bailing out a lot of Wall Street bankers who had money in AIG but also was
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.440]  bailing out a lot of foreign banks so really a lot of this is just pointing out
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:27.040]  the truth and letting people know that and I think people are very upset when
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:33.320]  they find out that you know very very wealthy inside bankers in in New York as
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:37.760]  well as across the country and across the world benefited from average middle class
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:42.400]  taxpayers like the rest of us having to send money to Washington to bail out AIG
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:46.480]  what they do is they're all gang up and say oh it'd be the end of the world if
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:50.640]  you don't do this but my dad's always made a good point that all the people
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.040]  who said it would be the end of the world and that there'd be a collapse of
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:58.040]  the economy we're all the same people who didn't predict any of this coming so
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:01.600]  we don't have to accept their word at face value that we have to take their
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:06.920]  predictions as they were well thank you senator elect and we look forward to
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.720]  talking to you when you are in office this is a great victory for all lovers
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:14.960]  of liberty they threw everything they could at you and collectively all of us
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:20.040]  and they failed this could be history if we get Ron Paul in as president as John
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:24.920]  Adams and then down the road like John Quincy Adams ran Paul sir God bless you
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:29.160]  have a great holiday say hi to your wife and sons and say hi to your father and
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:34.200]  mother just God bless you senator thank you out amazing there he goes senator
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:40.080]  Rand Paul and they pulled their hair out they did everything they could to stop
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:46.320]  us and they failed and it's like a victory of Washington at Trenton we're
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:51.160]  gonna have more victories and hey some of us aren't gonna make it out of this but
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:55.120]  in the end my great-great-great-great-grandchildren are gonna be just
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:51:02.160]  like Buck Rogers we're going to the stars and they're not gonna stop us is it
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.000]  really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys 18
