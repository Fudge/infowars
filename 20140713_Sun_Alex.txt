[02:23.820 --> 02:30.340]  world cup 2014 and we've got record ratings worldwide on espn and
[02:30.340 --> 02:38.980]  telemundo I think that's really what matters right now so I want to apologize
[02:38.980 --> 02:43.620]  and open the phones up for the full broadcast to discuss the world cup
[02:43.620 --> 02:50.100]  ladies and gentlemen that's all we'll be discussing today is all the people of
[02:50.100 --> 02:53.580]  the world losing their basic liberties losing their freedoms under total
[02:53.580 --> 02:59.820]  social engineering watching simulated combat ritualized male combat on the
[02:59.820 --> 03:04.500]  sonker field only places allowed for male combat is in simulated sports
[03:04.500 --> 03:09.980]  simulated gladiatorial events bread and circus while the real game of life goes
[03:09.980 --> 03:16.820]  on all around us and Eric Holder the mafia chief openly declares his main
[03:16.820 --> 03:22.860]  enemy to be domestic tea party grips who he says are planning major attacks and
[03:22.860 --> 03:28.020]  Obama says it may even be nuclear now how do you think Obama would ever get
[03:28.020 --> 03:33.780]  total control mmm what would you do if you were Obama gonna have to leave
[03:33.780 --> 03:36.900]  office in about a year and a half would you steal everything shut off the
[03:36.900 --> 03:41.340]  power plants open the borders try to bankrupt the country sign us on the
[03:41.340 --> 03:45.060]  board derivatives the value of the dollar fund al-qaeda worldwide yeah you do
[03:45.060 --> 03:51.900]  all that but you'd also stage terror attacks which they now say are imminent
[03:51.900 --> 03:55.020]  by the tea party they train the Pentagon that we're about to attack we've never
[03:55.020 --> 04:00.220]  attacked and then magically they say it's about to happen and when it happens
[04:00.220 --> 04:06.020]  all the reporters are going to be so upset on the news about whatever daycare
[04:06.020 --> 04:10.900]  center at a federal facility the feds bomb again like a 95 it's like a dog
[04:10.900 --> 04:14.420]  to vomit these criminals do the same thing over and over again so that's
[04:14.420 --> 04:20.620]  what I'm thinking about today even though I'll be honest with you I grew up
[04:20.620 --> 04:24.580]  playing golf a little bit and I grew up playing soccer so I play football too but
[04:24.580 --> 04:28.460]  but I like sports that are on in the background so you're not watching it I
[04:28.460 --> 04:31.940]  like football but it's just every play and every this is dominates the part of
[04:31.940 --> 04:34.620]  your conversation it's kind of fun to have golf in the background once you
[04:34.620 --> 04:37.060]  know because you wait a few minutes somebody heads and then you see the hole
[04:37.060 --> 04:41.020]  in one or whatever see the buggy or see whatever's going on with somebody chip
[04:41.020 --> 04:46.260]  from the sandbox and then soccer I kind of like this is on the background I'm
[04:46.260 --> 04:50.540]  kind of the roar of the crowds kind of soothing like the ocean kind of a white
[04:50.540 --> 04:57.060]  noise sound and then ah go go or the so I kind of like World Cup maybe I've been
[04:57.060 --> 04:59.860]  wrong maybe I shouldn't care about freedom just watch that from the water
[04:59.860 --> 05:04.740]  table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and
[05:04.740 --> 05:08.660]  more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[05:08.660 --> 05:12.460]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of
[05:12.460 --> 05:16.340]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[05:16.340 --> 05:20.420]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[05:20.420 --> 05:24.500]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[05:24.500 --> 05:28.500]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[05:28.500 --> 05:31.700]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[05:31.700 --> 05:35.740]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[05:35.740 --> 05:39.940]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[05:39.940 --> 05:43.940]  we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[05:43.940 --> 05:48.380]  manufactured in the USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a
[05:48.380 --> 05:51.580]  convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic
[05:51.580 --> 05:55.780]  environment now available exclusively an info wars life.com or by calling toll
[05:55.780 --> 05:59.700]  three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[05:59.700 --> 06:06.500]  renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the
[06:06.500 --> 06:14.140]  Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United
[06:14.140 --> 06:19.500]  States to take action and reply. Dr. Martin Luther King the
[06:19.500 --> 06:23.740]  also of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in
[06:23.740 --> 06:39.380]  Memphis, Tennessee we're live the 13th day of July 2014 it's time to strap
[06:39.380 --> 06:43.460]  yourselves in. People calling themselves members of the weather underground last
[06:43.460 --> 06:48.780]  night planted bombs in federal office. I go now in the White House. It's a baby's out of
[06:48.780 --> 06:55.780]  the air. The next time they plant the bombs they'll blame it on us. False
[06:55.780 --> 07:17.380]  flag. Tell us about Santa Claus next. The Navy SEAL spoke out that it
[07:17.380 --> 07:29.180]  was fake. There's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and
[07:29.180 --> 07:32.860]  everybody in between is that we all hated the bank. That's why you voted for it.
[07:32.860 --> 07:37.020]  Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[07:37.020 --> 07:41.740]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. It's now about 3 billion.
[07:41.740 --> 07:47.460]  It is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[07:47.460 --> 07:51.380]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[07:51.380 --> 07:55.780]  reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill. I'm here to warn people you
[07:55.780 --> 08:02.260]  keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game. From the front lines of the
[08:02.260 --> 08:10.500]  information war it's Alex Jones. This is not a game thank you for joining us on
[08:10.500 --> 08:17.660]  the July 13th 2014 live worldwide broadcast. I am your host Alex Jones and
[08:17.660 --> 08:22.660]  we will open the phones up at the bottom of the hour and then for the balance of
[08:22.660 --> 08:27.260]  the transmission. We're here every Sunday syndicated across the land and we
[08:27.260 --> 08:31.340]  return weekdays with a syndicated broadcast 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central
[08:31.340 --> 08:38.900]  standard time. The news websites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot
[08:38.900 --> 08:47.460]  com. Well where to begin today? Where to start? Our own David Knight is
[08:47.460 --> 08:51.420]  interviewing. My own Darren McBrain is interviewing. I think I should interview
[08:51.420 --> 08:58.340]  him and of course he's William Benny who was basically fourth in command of the
[08:58.340 --> 09:04.300]  National Security Agency and he quietly quit a decade ago because of the focus
[09:04.300 --> 09:08.380]  on the general public and the total dragnet. He has told a conference in
[09:08.380 --> 09:13.060]  London and he's in the front page London Guardian this Sunday that the ultimate
[09:13.060 --> 09:19.340]  goal of the NSA is total population control and that when he was at the
[09:19.340 --> 09:25.780]  NSA a decade ago 80% of all calls were recorded. He estimates now everything is
[09:25.780 --> 09:30.900]  recorded with the computing power and I've interviewed many other top whistle
[09:30.900 --> 09:36.060]  blowers like one of the guys that headed up an entire division of NSA
[09:36.060 --> 09:42.260]  internal security and it's by the way I want to get I want to get Wayne
[09:42.260 --> 09:47.100]  Madsen on this week it's been too long yeah I'm probably three months that's
[09:47.100 --> 09:49.980]  why I knew about all this I mean I just get on air and say everything's being
[09:49.980 --> 09:55.020]  listened to illegally they're paying billions a year to telecoms to do it in
[09:55.020 --> 09:59.900]  a big boondoggle I didn't just come up with that I've been on the air almost 20
[09:59.900 --> 10:05.340]  years I didn't just come up with that I had the whistleblowers who were talking
[10:05.340 --> 10:09.180]  to Congress on c-span and I would just tell my producer they call up and set
[10:09.180 --> 10:15.900]  them up for the show this stuff is all on c-span it's all in different political
[10:15.900 --> 10:20.660]  publications that are more technical but the general public gets their news from
[10:20.660 --> 10:26.780]  CNN MSNBC and folks you're not going to be told about this on these channels the
[10:26.780 --> 10:30.660]  Guardian was about to go bankrupt two years ago until the NSA story broke now
[10:30.660 --> 10:35.180]  they basically read like info wars calm every day they have narrowed their laws
[10:35.180 --> 10:40.420]  and are about to go profitable that's a nice little story for the rest of the
[10:40.420 --> 10:45.500]  dying mainstream media if you weren't such a lap dogs of the establishment so
[10:45.500 --> 10:49.820]  happy to cover anything and everything up people would read your publications
[10:49.820 --> 10:56.660]  they would subscribe they would support you but New York Times has been bankrupt
[10:56.660 --> 11:01.300]  for about five years on record and Carlos Slim the big Mexican mob boss owns
[11:01.300 --> 11:07.500]  it now and it's just a joke the establishment still pays to keep MSNBC
[11:07.500 --> 11:11.620]  in the New York Times going and CNN going you know they're totally bankrupt on
[11:11.620 --> 11:15.660]  record all three institutions are in the red for many years running because it's
[11:15.660 --> 11:21.020]  just there to act like everything's still okay I mean they all know their
[11:21.020 --> 11:25.860]  collapse they all know it's over Matt Rudge back in 1999 gave a speech at the
[11:25.860 --> 11:29.540]  press club that I want to air in full next week I had that a few months ago
[11:29.540 --> 11:33.740]  we never did it I want to write a note I want to get that thing off the C-span
[11:33.740 --> 11:38.780]  archives and I want to augment it I want to add ad lines to the 20 minute
[11:38.780 --> 11:43.380]  speech or so showing everything he said coming true so it's not just him at the
[11:43.380 --> 11:47.140]  press club I want to give that to McBreen Monday maybe have it by next
[11:47.140 --> 11:52.300]  Thursday or Friday and again what we do is we kind of war game here on air with
[11:52.300 --> 11:55.180]  the producers and the crews that's why everything you end up hearing later is
[11:55.180 --> 11:59.180]  discussed here on the broadcast but I really please put a note because I already
[11:59.180 --> 12:02.300]  had that out a few months ago we didn't do it I want to make sure that happens and
[12:02.300 --> 12:05.420]  I want to get William Benning on because I know he's been interviewed by other
[12:05.420 --> 12:09.780]  reporters but not by me and it just he's really making some hardcore statements
[12:09.780 --> 12:14.580]  now and he's been persecuted by the way for it so we're gonna be getting
[12:14.580 --> 12:18.380]  getting him back on the broadcast so so that's story number one we have a
[12:18.380 --> 12:22.460]  document cam shot today's not a low news day but only about an hour of
[12:22.460 --> 12:25.940]  preparation today not the customary four or five hours so there's probably only
[12:25.940 --> 12:31.860]  60 70 news articles here but but let me just read you some headlines before I
[12:31.860 --> 12:36.820]  get into the top story in the next segment the end of America it's like
[12:36.820 --> 12:40.820]  the country had a heart attack the heart's not beating we've got five minutes
[12:40.820 --> 12:47.060]  for a defibrillator to get the heart going five minutes politically is about
[12:47.060 --> 12:54.380]  a year and we're already so screwed up I don't know if the country can be revived
[12:54.380 --> 12:58.100]  but it's gonna be worse if we don't politically try to change things it's
[12:58.100 --> 13:01.580]  kind of like we're going to crash it's not kind of like it is we're crash
[13:01.580 --> 13:05.780]  landing can we get the landing gear down can we try to slow the aircraft down
[13:05.780 --> 13:11.060]  and get the tail down instead of the nose it's kind of down to that point and
[13:11.060 --> 13:15.420]  you've all been conditioned to live in denial and just say conspiracy theory no
[13:15.420 --> 13:19.060]  corruption in government that's a conspiracy theory no danger and powerful
[13:19.060 --> 13:22.500]  elites that's a conspiracy theory no tyranny and governments ever happened
[13:22.500 --> 13:26.620]  as Obama said don't listen to people he said back in January of this year that
[13:26.620 --> 13:29.660]  talk about always having tyranny around the corner that's just a lie
[13:29.660 --> 13:36.860]  governments a force of good well we bought into that and now our goose is
[13:36.860 --> 13:41.740]  pretty much cooked and I'm not very happy about the fact I've been proven
[13:41.740 --> 13:48.180]  correct in spades it's it's it's bittersweet because people aren't
[13:48.180 --> 13:54.060]  laughing anymore that really nobody laughs anymore they just say well why
[13:54.060 --> 13:57.620]  don't you tell us how to fix it hey man I'm trying to just cover what the
[13:57.620 --> 14:01.940]  enemy's doing I'm here as a wartime reporter showing how the whole world's
[14:01.940 --> 14:06.180]  been conquered by criminal con artists interest that own the media and on the
[14:06.180 --> 14:11.780]  federal law enforcement worldwide and and I know a lot of ways to fix things
[14:11.780 --> 14:17.260]  but it's a process and it's about you getting angry you getting upset you not
[14:17.260 --> 14:22.140]  complying you getting involved and most importantly it's about people in the
[14:22.140 --> 14:26.460]  system realizing they've been compartmentalized they've been lied to
[14:26.460 --> 14:31.540]  and that this system is going to destroy them as well because I'm I'd be for the
[14:31.540 --> 14:35.180]  status quo if you know things weren't that bad the status quo generally
[14:35.180 --> 14:38.380]  historically is better than change because you can get a violent revolution
[14:38.380 --> 14:42.300]  and it tends to be worse in almost every case but the globalist political system
[14:42.300 --> 14:49.100]  is a revolution against decency against stability it's very radical it's it's
[14:49.100 --> 14:58.020]  viral it's it's cancerous and it grows it gets worse it progresses it doesn't
[14:58.020 --> 15:05.460]  get better it gets worse so you can debate with me all day if I'm right
[15:05.460 --> 15:08.900]  about this or right about that the point is our house is burning down
[15:08.900 --> 15:14.660]  collectively and all hands need to be on deck we need to get serious and realize
[15:14.660 --> 15:18.700]  it's not like people 10 years ago 20 years ago saying if we don't turn things
[15:18.700 --> 15:22.580]  around it's gonna hurt our children it's 20 years later it's now our children
[15:22.580 --> 15:28.060]  it's here it's judgment day Ron Paul's up on info wars.com globally the
[15:28.060 --> 15:32.380]  libertarian leader recognized worldwide an icon I interviewed him for 30 minutes
[15:32.380 --> 15:37.140]  Friday and he said the collapse is close it's imminent we're already deep into
[15:37.140 --> 15:40.820]  but it's about to get more serious every major country's leaving the dollar
[15:40.820 --> 15:46.300]  right now wars are starting everywhere everything you expect during what leads
[15:46.300 --> 15:50.460]  into the greatest crisis humanity's ever seen and if we don't survive this
[15:50.460 --> 15:54.780]  crisis we'll have thermal nuclear war bare minimum global depression and
[15:54.780 --> 15:59.620]  meltdown and most of us won't live stay with us
[15:59.620 --> 16:07.060]  hi I'm Dr. Edward Groot it took me 20 years of searching the globe to find

[20:20.420 --> 20:25.940]  Jones yeah and for worse.com
[20:25.940 --> 20:36.260]  live from Austin Texas Broadcasting Worldwide by the way it's Alex Jones that
[20:36.260 --> 20:39.980]  is not a good impersonator of Mike judge that's Mike judge doing that we're good
[20:39.980 --> 20:45.820]  buddies another fellow Austinite oh my judge has been a I'm not dropping names
[20:45.820 --> 20:51.900]  interesting factoid he's been a listener and a viewer since 1996 and he's
[20:51.900 --> 20:54.900]  said that one interview we did with him it's an hour long on info wars.com
[20:54.900 --> 20:58.980]  it's a TV interview video interview at his house here in Austin that I didn't
[20:58.980 --> 21:01.740]  even know so he said in the interview I mean I'd heard a little bit about it
[21:01.740 --> 21:05.260]  from Rick Linklater a long time ago but I was like oh yeah right you know Hank
[21:05.260 --> 21:11.420]  Hill's a little bit of me but but so is Gribble the conspiracy theorist and then
[21:11.420 --> 21:17.060]  he goes no you are a composite in multiple characters in that show so that
[21:17.060 --> 21:23.300]  shows how even when I was on access television back in like 95 96 97 I was
[21:23.300 --> 21:27.140]  influencing the world there's the headline animator Mike judge
[21:27.140 --> 21:31.580]  idiocracy is happening now he was in but had saved the world's name of the
[21:31.580 --> 21:36.500]  documentary you want to go watch it like we heard that last year here I'm gonna
[21:36.500 --> 21:40.620]  get Mike back on he said he'll come back on he's always out in Hollywood now
[21:40.620 --> 21:47.620]  working on his hit show on HBO Silicon Valley which I'm like I don't watch a lot
[21:47.620 --> 21:51.420]  of TV but I do watch some HBO that's a great show hilarious pretty racy though
[21:51.420 --> 21:55.380]  not a family show I didn't mean to go off into a name-dropping issue quite
[21:55.380 --> 21:59.220]  frankly they were airing a fun intro and I was getting mad I was like no we need
[21:59.220 --> 22:03.500]  serious intros this is the most serious issues we can be discussing and that
[22:03.500 --> 22:08.860]  it's just surreal to hear beavis you know the voice of beavis saying yeah
[22:08.860 --> 22:15.140]  infoworks.com it was funny first time I played those liners people are on YouTube
[22:15.140 --> 22:18.700]  when the video went out a day later going I can do a better one than whoever's
[22:18.700 --> 22:24.460]  doing that like you can't do better than the original because the original is
[22:24.460 --> 22:27.940]  the original it's kind of like even if you did something better some other
[22:27.940 --> 22:32.700]  character it's still not better than the person that did the original I don't know
[22:32.700 --> 22:39.820]  how to explain that to people but it's that simple it's that simple okay side
[22:39.820 --> 22:43.620]  issue it would be a viral video but I can't release the videos I have of me and
[22:43.620 --> 22:47.100]  Mike shooting 50 caliber rifles and stuff out of his ranch but that's another side
[22:47.100 --> 22:55.420]  issue you know I'm doing what I do so often I am procrastinating he's small
[22:55.420 --> 23:02.380]  huh thought your head would be bigger look like a peanut you know a pimps love
[23:02.380 --> 23:08.180]  is different than the love of a square all right I'm gonna stop quoting
[23:08.180 --> 23:13.620]  idiocracy right now most people don't even know what I'm talking about we're
[23:13.620 --> 23:19.260]  gonna do a review of idiocracy soon because it is an evergreen film and you
[23:19.260 --> 23:24.380]  should Mike judge make a idiocracy to I don't know who knows maybe it's being
[23:24.380 --> 23:29.340]  discussed I'm not sure but President Camacho will step down in the future and
[23:29.340 --> 23:33.540]  it will be me we'll put the president all right ladies and gentlemen that's
[23:33.540 --> 23:40.260]  enough yes there is the FDA approved pyramid a food a brondo is the top five
[23:40.260 --> 23:47.340]  slots and then Carl's juniors extra big butt fries and then the other part of it
[23:47.340 --> 23:56.420]  is a flasher in and of course the futuristic coffee place Starbucks alright
[23:56.420 --> 24:01.340]  that's enough I'm already 23 minutes into this transmission 24 minutes now and
[24:01.340 --> 24:05.100]  I'm not being serious and I should be serious it's not a good thing that I'm
[24:05.100 --> 24:11.180]  being joking around today but that tends to happen let me just read some of
[24:11.180 --> 24:16.380]  these headlines let's just see if I can do it once in my life feds ask churches
[24:16.380 --> 24:20.660]  to house migrant families daily caller they're already paying with churches to
[24:20.660 --> 24:25.220]  do it in a criminal conspiracy and that is now going public so they're acting

[25:30.500 --> 25:34.660]  only stay on the train to the United States that's from world that daily
[25:34.660 --> 25:40.380]  with Dr. Corsi continuing CNN report only cost a dollar thirty cents to do
[25:40.380 --> 25:48.220]  that BP border patrol agents 70% of agents being pulled off patrols for
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.500]  paperwork we're gonna get to that clip in a minute holders says yes the
[25:51.500 --> 25:55.180]  immigration laws are being enforced they've just decided to legalize
[25:55.180 --> 25:58.820]  everybody so that's just some of the news we have on that front let's get to
[25:58.820 --> 26:04.900]  those clips let's get to those clips right now because that's really important
[26:04.900 --> 26:10.940]  this is more patrol agent Hector Garza first let's play the clip from earlier
[26:10.940 --> 26:14.300]  in the week not the new clip where he says what I've been saying for a month
[26:14.300 --> 26:18.220]  since we broke the video of the feds giving them vouchers at the border on
[26:18.220 --> 26:21.980]  Greyhound to go anywhere they want just anybody you get old man young person
[26:21.980 --> 26:26.500]  murderer criminal child the child things are at herring that's only one small
[26:26.500 --> 26:30.220]  portion of this well the senior border patrol agent we talked to the head of
[26:30.220 --> 26:34.500]  the union as well concurring says that it's basically an ordered stand down and
[26:34.500 --> 26:38.420]  that the border patrol now is the immigrant illegal immigrant importation
[26:38.420 --> 26:43.100]  agency it's harder for a citizen to get back into the US than for an illegal
[26:43.100 --> 26:48.380]  alien so this is lawlessness to buy government here's that clip when you say
[26:48.380 --> 26:54.140]  that the federal government's aiding in a betting sounds like they're supposed
[26:54.140 --> 26:57.580]  to be protecting this border you mean aiding in a bed what do you mean
[26:57.580 --> 27:00.980]  specifically actually what's happening is that the federal government is
[27:00.980 --> 27:05.900]  actually completing the smuggling cycle by having a parent sending their their
[27:05.900 --> 27:10.940]  child to the US border have them having them smuggled that is only part of the
[27:10.940 --> 27:15.340]  smuggling cycle then it comes to the federal government steps in we apprehend
[27:15.340 --> 27:18.140]  them we process these illegal aliens and then we release them to their to their
[27:18.140 --> 27:22.180]  family members in the US yeah we just completed a smuggling cycle now let's
[27:22.180 --> 27:26.580]  go to his next clip just yesterday where he talks about this is all just a fact
[27:26.580 --> 27:30.260]  I mean I don't just believe him he's an honorable person going under a lot of
[27:30.260 --> 27:33.100]  heat to tell the truth we've talked to the president the vice president of the
[27:33.100 --> 27:36.140]  Border Patrol Union now they've been given gag orders let's talk to him
[27:36.140 --> 27:40.300]  privately you've heard him a lot on the show now you don't because there's a
[27:40.300 --> 27:45.060]  federal gag order but a gag order doesn't stand if you know a gag order so
[27:45.060 --> 27:49.140]  somebody can child molester a gag order so somebody can ship narcotics into
[27:49.140 --> 27:54.060]  school grounds I mean Obama and holders gag orders they can do you know what
[27:54.060 --> 27:59.860]  with them seriously they can stick them where the sun doesn't shine and I don't
[27:59.860 --> 28:03.620]  mean to use so much French these days but I mean when your borders collapsing
[28:03.620 --> 28:08.260]  it's the proper term to use this is treason ploward and pebbin bankrupt the
[28:08.260 --> 28:12.420]  country and with thousands of socialists are now descending on Southern
[28:12.420 --> 28:15.580]  California where the borders open we have video of it last week my reporters
[28:15.580 --> 28:19.060]  were down there openly saying no this is ploward and pebbin we're collapsing the
[28:19.060 --> 28:22.900]  border the immigrants vote socialist we're gonna get your guns I mean they're
[28:22.900 --> 28:25.860]  not even hiding it let's go to this clip as we go to break here's the same
[28:25.860 --> 28:29.500]  Border Patrol agent talking about 70% of border patrols doing paperwork now
[28:29.500 --> 28:33.020]  Border Patrol agents are not actually patrolling the border right now that
[28:33.020 --> 28:38.240]  they're actually dealing with the crisis of handling the concerns tied to those
[28:38.240 --> 28:44.020]  children approximately a 70% of the border patrol agents are have been
[28:44.020 --> 28:47.900]  reassigned for administrative duties and those duties include the processing
[28:47.900 --> 28:52.580]  that's right carry for aliens we're going like legalizing them so so the
[28:52.580 --> 28:57.500]  Border Patrol is now the border importation agency the drags of the
[28:57.500 --> 29:02.900]  world criminals people that have disabilities children you know from the
[29:02.900 --> 29:07.660]  water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming
[29:07.660 --> 29:11.420]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside this

[29:15.580 --> 29:19.620]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time

[29:34.940 --> 29:39.020]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my

[33:49.260 --> 33:53.580]  Congress and don't trust federal judges, then we're gonna have some problems.
[33:53.580 --> 33:56.580]  What difference at this point does it make?
[33:56.580 --> 33:58.580]  Everything is awesome.
[33:58.580 --> 34:00.580]  Oh my gosh, I love this song.
[34:00.580 --> 34:07.580]  I love it too, man. I love that Obamacare has 21 taxes, 7 on them on poor people.
[34:07.580 --> 34:12.580]  That's not counting other hidden taxes, like making them cut people from full
[34:12.580 --> 34:17.220]  time to part time to avoid Obamacare. Yeah, stalling the country out, shipping
[34:17.220 --> 34:23.940]  unlimited illegal aliens, making them legal instantly for three years. I mean,
[34:23.940 --> 34:29.580]  it is just awesome to have people that hate the average American worker so much
[34:29.580 --> 34:34.060]  running the country. And what's incredible about it is it's really
[34:34.060 --> 34:40.660]  happening. We really have a government that ships the illegals in, has a deal
[34:40.660 --> 34:47.020]  with Mexico to legalize the Guatemalans and other Central and South Americans
[34:47.020 --> 34:51.820]  to then conduit them up on big trains to our border where they're loaded by the
[34:51.820 --> 34:58.340]  tens of thousands per day on two buses and shipped under any name they want
[34:58.340 --> 35:04.660]  around the country. And then it was even in mainstream news on Friday. I couldn't
[35:04.660 --> 35:11.220]  believe it when the TSA admitted we've been told to let illegals fly without
[35:11.220 --> 35:15.860]  IDs. You know, I've seen that many times where I'm being grubbed and children
[35:15.860 --> 35:20.060]  are being grubbed and there's naked body scanners and we're all suspects while
[35:20.060 --> 35:24.100]  the government funds Al Qaeda and ISIS worldwide. It's all about training us
[35:24.100 --> 35:30.180]  for slaves, but I've seen illegals with no ID. They don't even call somebody
[35:30.180 --> 35:34.820]  over to speak Spanish. They just let them through to fly.
[35:34.820 --> 35:40.100]  Breitbart, exclusive TSA allowing illegals to fly without verifiable ID says
[35:40.100 --> 35:45.340]  Border Patrol Union. I've seen that myself and talked about it for years
[35:45.340 --> 35:50.380]  because it's all a hoax. It's an out of control government and bureaucracy
[35:50.380 --> 35:54.300]  and corporate interests that are anti-free market monopolist that control
[35:54.300 --> 36:02.220]  it that want us to learn to be prisoners. And as the number four former head of
[36:02.220 --> 36:07.140]  the NSA, William Benny has now told the London Guardian the ultimate goal of the
[36:07.140 --> 36:14.580]  NSA is total population control. Control. They know what you're buying, what
[36:14.580 --> 36:17.620]  you're doing, and you're like, why don't care? They use that info to game the
[36:17.620 --> 36:21.620]  markets and they give that info to select interest who can then corner the
[36:21.620 --> 36:26.460]  market. It's like high-frequency trading with Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan
[36:26.460 --> 36:32.940]  plugged into the stock market gaming it. It's like a casino, but
[36:32.940 --> 36:36.700]  people think, oh, I'll win in the system. No, you won't. Not unless you're one of
[36:36.700 --> 36:44.500]  the gamers. In other news, bloggers, surveillance in Obama's or Wellyan's
[36:44.500 --> 36:50.260]  state. Obama's or Wellyan's state. No, it's the political classes or Wellyan's
[36:50.260 --> 36:54.540]  state. Don't just blame Obama. He's bad enough, but this is whistleblower. NSA
[36:54.540 --> 37:00.300]  stores 80% of all phone calls, not just metadata. Pentagon correspondent for the
[37:00.300 --> 37:04.820]  New York Times refers to Americans as children. The New York Times says the
[37:04.820 --> 37:08.780]  media and government work together to keep the truth from us and he goes on to
[37:08.780 --> 37:15.900]  describe us. It's a disgusting article. Tom Shanker, working with the NSA and CIA
[37:15.900 --> 37:20.820]  as the relationship between the government media is like a marriage. It is
[37:20.820 --> 37:28.260]  dysfunctional to be sure, but we stay together for the kids. Jeffrey Dahmer did
[37:28.260 --> 37:31.260]  what he did for the kids as well. He grabbed him off the street and you know
[37:31.260 --> 37:36.180]  what he did for the children. And now we've got to legalize all these people
[37:36.180 --> 37:40.980]  because they're only advertising the teenagers that are the future Democratic
[37:40.980 --> 37:45.620]  voting group. And again, I'm not even a Republican, but I'm sitting here watching
[37:45.620 --> 37:49.100]  the Republican Party. We need a third and fourth party, but I'm watching the only
[37:49.100 --> 37:53.060]  other party that the libertarians are trying to take over. Come it's suicide
[37:53.060 --> 37:57.820]  because his leadership has been bought off, baner, you name it. And it's just
[37:57.820 --> 38:05.820]  insane. It's insane. Political correctness is a suicide pact. Obama calls
[38:05.820 --> 38:09.860]  GOP lawsuit over executive outreach. I want to cue that up and play it. A
[38:09.860 --> 38:15.260]  political stunt. Obama unloaded on House Republicans in a plan to sue him for
[38:15.260 --> 38:19.260]  executive outreach. This has been going on for a while, but it's back in the
[38:19.260 --> 38:25.020]  news today. And Al Gore wants it criminalized to disagree with him that
[38:25.020 --> 38:31.860]  you know, we should basically pay him pay him to breathe. Let's go ahead and go
[38:31.860 --> 38:38.220]  to that clip of Obama. Well, you notice that he didn't specifically say what
[38:38.220 --> 38:44.340]  exactly he was objecting to. I'm not going to apologize for trying to do
[38:44.340 --> 38:50.060]  something while they're doing nothing. Even if you get sued. You know, the suit
[38:50.060 --> 38:55.780]  is a stunt. Here he is talking to Stephanophilus, a literal Clinton crime
[38:55.780 --> 39:00.380]  family operative. And the Clintons run Obama. He's there. He's there. They have
[39:00.380 --> 39:05.260]  a word for it. It begins with B. He is there. You know what they call it. It's
[39:05.260 --> 39:11.500]  the name of a female dog. Obama is their B. Just like we all are, basically. And
[39:11.500 --> 39:16.460]  the Clintons, they'll have a Clinton and his wife. Clinton's had so many heart
[39:16.460 --> 39:20.940]  attacks and so coked out of his mind on record. And so many rape cases pending
[39:20.940 --> 39:24.620]  in court. He's not really running things, but Hillary, the Clinton crime
[39:24.620 --> 39:29.420]  machine, the files they have, everything they've done is basically in charge of
[39:29.420 --> 39:33.500]  all this. And Obama says, I don't know what Congress has said about. Okay, let me
[39:33.500 --> 39:38.260]  tell you, you became the head of the UN Security Council, violating Article 1
[39:38.260 --> 39:42.660]  Section 9. No president ever did that to be a sitting, sworn head of the UN.
[39:42.660 --> 39:49.340]  Totally illegal. You put our military in three separate commands and letters to
[39:49.340 --> 39:53.820]  Congress without authorization over our military, NATO over our military. That's
[39:53.820 --> 39:57.580]  worse than you being a dictator. You said you got your authorization from NATO to
[39:57.580 --> 40:01.700]  do all these different things in Libya, Syria, you name it. Let's just keep
[40:01.700 --> 40:04.740]  going here. You gave billions of dollars to energy companies without
[40:04.740 --> 40:07.260]  congressional approval to your political friends that didn't even build
[40:07.260 --> 40:12.140]  anything. You stayed shipping guns into Mexico in your own memos that CBS News
[40:12.140 --> 40:16.420]  got to blame the Second Amendment and the false flag to frame gun owners. You
[40:16.420 --> 40:20.820]  should keep going. Ordered the Border Patrol to stand down four months ago on
[40:20.820 --> 40:25.180]  record and to stop apprehending illegals and instead do their paperwork to make
[40:25.180 --> 40:29.900]  them legal with the former head of the Ford Foundation now heading up the
[40:29.900 --> 40:34.980]  Immigration Department to openly legalize all these people. You openly
[40:34.980 --> 40:39.740]  passed Obamacare, there's 21 taxes, most of them on poor people, to transfer
[40:39.740 --> 40:44.780]  money offshore and double and triple prices. You did not faithfully defend
[40:44.780 --> 40:48.620]  and execute the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. You have openly said if
[40:48.620 --> 40:52.540]  Congress won't do what you want, that's gridlock. No, that's another branch of
[40:52.540 --> 40:58.340]  government not agreeing with you and that you will act alone whenever you
[40:58.340 --> 41:03.340]  want on guns, you name it, and abandon importation of guns. Use the EPA to shut
[41:03.340 --> 41:08.020]  down every bullet manufacturer in the country. The last one closed in January.
[41:08.020 --> 41:12.900]  The last smelters of lead that is. And now you're trying to block Chinese lead
[41:12.900 --> 41:20.660]  coming in. You on every front are butchering the country and involved in
[41:20.660 --> 41:26.780]  a revolution against this Republic and you say you don't know why people are
[41:26.780 --> 41:31.980]  upset and then he gave a speech in Austin. Two speeches in Austin and both
[41:31.980 --> 41:37.900]  speeches and they were televised. He said he said why they won't do anything.
[41:37.900 --> 41:41.780]  I'll act. Remember the first few years. Well, I can't be a dictator. I can't
[41:41.780 --> 41:47.140]  just act alone in every speech he gave. So they would beg. No, act alone, act
[41:47.140 --> 41:51.300]  alone. Well, I can't do that. I would give you free everything, but I just can't.
[41:51.300 --> 41:55.180]  Now he's going, no, I'll act alone. I'll act alone. I remember saying years ago on
[41:55.180 --> 41:58.780]  air. You said it as well. All you out there were freaked out about it, that he
[41:58.780 --> 42:02.260]  was priming the pump. Gee, if I was a dictator, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[42:02.260 --> 42:09.580]  Remember Bush said that too. You know, but gee, Jeepers creepers. And now they're
[42:09.580 --> 42:16.020]  doing it. And now Obama says he will act alone on immigration when it's
[42:16.020 --> 42:20.460]  Congress that makes the immigration laws. It's Congress that coins the money and
[42:20.460 --> 42:25.620]  orders the money and levies the taxes, but he's acting alone on EPA regulations.
[42:25.620 --> 42:33.220]  Coal power plants on record put out less carbon dioxide and less water vapor and
[42:33.220 --> 42:37.700]  all the rest of it than gasoline or natural gas. But Obama wants them all
[42:37.700 --> 42:42.260]  banned to jack up your power prices as his buddies on the alternative. If
[42:42.260 --> 42:46.500]  shutting off our power without congressional approval isn't an act of a
[42:46.500 --> 42:50.660]  dictator, I don't know what is. And I've told Congress privately, a lot of people
[42:50.660 --> 42:53.900]  I talked to off air, you need to call them a dictator. They've been doing that.
[42:53.900 --> 42:57.460]  That's good because when you're faced with tyranny, you got to admit it's
[42:57.460 --> 43:00.140]  tyranny. I'm going to come back, give you the number, get into a ton of other news
[43:00.140 --> 43:05.020]  and then take your calls. I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it
[43:05.020 --> 43:09.700]  was helping me and my family so much, get healthy and detoxify. Most people know
[43:09.700 --> 43:15.460]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so
[43:15.460 --> 43:19.700]  many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product
[43:19.700 --> 43:24.660]  being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent
[43:24.660 --> 43:28.940]  iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago he said, listen, if
[43:28.940 --> 43:32.860]  you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth
[43:32.860 --> 43:37.460]  crystals and the results that I personally have had have been life
[43:37.460 --> 43:42.820]  changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and
[43:42.820 --> 43:47.260]  gentlemen. This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,

[45:02.740 --> 45:07.660]  soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each
[45:07.660 --> 45:11.700]  and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been
[45:11.700 --> 45:15.380]  shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[45:15.380 --> 45:19.860]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[45:19.860 --> 45:23.620]  chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the
[45:23.620 --> 45:27.460]  United States. Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to
[45:27.460 --> 45:31.140]  numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans live
[45:31.140 --> 45:34.820]  with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics
[45:34.820 --> 45:39.620]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the
[45:39.620 --> 45:43.380]  toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against. Made
[45:43.380 --> 45:47.860]  with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new

[48:11.220 --> 48:17.100]  Wildcard line. We don't have one of those that we should. You gotta love this
[48:17.100 --> 48:40.580]  deep purple. I can't deny it. It's not the kill. It's the thrill of the chase and
[48:40.580 --> 48:48.540]  we're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. Knockin' at the back
[48:48.540 --> 48:59.860]  door. There's no denying. I'm gonna stop it. I should start a radio show where I
[48:59.860 --> 49:04.980]  play annoying music for some people. Hey what's going on with the World Cup?
[49:04.980 --> 49:10.940]  Germany versus Poland. I'm trying to make all the soccer fans upset that I
[49:10.940 --> 49:14.460]  don't know that it's Germany versus Argentina. What is going on with that
[49:14.460 --> 49:18.460]  right now? Because you know our borders are fallen. They've changed laws to take
[49:18.460 --> 49:21.900]  our bank accounts. Europe is now following suit as we said they would
[49:21.900 --> 49:27.380]  last year when they tested out in Portugal. Deutschland is one. Argentina is
[49:27.380 --> 49:32.580]  zero. You know England could never defeat the Germans. Of course I'm Welch
[49:32.580 --> 49:38.340]  myself so I'm not I'm not a you know anti-anglophile but I'm not a Deutsch
[49:38.340 --> 49:45.300]  file as well. I don't worship either group but England on record had the
[49:45.300 --> 49:48.900]  German question of World War I and World War II. Their answer in World War I
[49:48.900 --> 49:52.500]  to overthrow the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was to kill a bunch of royalty and
[49:52.500 --> 49:56.580]  make them mad to start a war. And in World War II they just put Hitler in.
[49:56.580 --> 50:00.900]  He started funding him 20 years before to take over the country and it's been
[50:00.900 --> 50:05.140]  declassified. He was basically a British agent. Didn't mean he worked for him. They
[50:05.140 --> 50:11.700]  just helped get him in. Kind of like the West. Britain started this about 114
[50:11.700 --> 50:17.300]  years ago in 1900 in Saudi Arabia or Saudi Arabia today. Funding radical
[50:17.300 --> 50:22.580]  Islam. The radicalism is real but the West is funding it and using it as a
[50:22.580 --> 50:26.500]  pretext to destabilize them at least. And that's actually in the news today.
[50:26.500 --> 50:34.180]  That's coming up in the next hour but again toll-free number to join us 877-8925-39.
[50:34.180 --> 50:39.460]  All I ask is that if you don't have a good phone don't call in. It's like my
[50:39.460 --> 50:42.660]  cell phone always sounds terrible when I call in so I don't usually do that unless
[50:42.660 --> 50:47.460]  it's an emergency when I got a fill-in host or somebody. So just please have a
[50:47.460 --> 50:51.140]  good phone. If you disagree with me it's even better. That tends to wake me up a
[50:51.140 --> 50:55.300]  little bit but we'd love to hear from you out there. Not that I'm not awake.
[50:55.300 --> 50:59.540]  Okay so calls coming up in the next hour.
[50:59.540 --> 51:04.820]  Here's the big news. He said this a month ago but he said it again.
[51:04.820 --> 51:08.340]  The story's the top story on infowars.com
[51:08.340 --> 51:11.860]  and also drugreport.com where we got it. Weekly standard.
[51:11.860 --> 51:16.100]  Holder homegrown violent extremists keep me up at night.
[51:16.100 --> 51:19.700]  And of course the Justice Department's own numbers say that the smallest
[51:19.700 --> 51:22.820]  criminal group out there is homegrown extremists.
[51:22.820 --> 51:28.100]  They believe that about one cop gets killed a year.
[51:28.100 --> 51:32.660]  It's it's been like 14 or something since since 2000.
[51:32.660 --> 51:37.380]  And I mean honey bees kill 200 something, lost 300 something,
[51:37.380 --> 51:41.860]  deer 200 something. I mean it's just but but he just keeps them up at night.
[51:41.860 --> 51:46.660]  And Obama incurs and says extremists with nukes. They're gonna blow up New York City.
[51:46.660 --> 51:49.700]  Should I play the Obama clip before he said that he doesn't know who's gonna do
[51:49.700 --> 51:52.020]  it. They're gonna blow up New York with a nuke.
[51:52.020 --> 51:55.300]  And the Pentagon trains to fight the Tea Party. I'm gonna explain something to you.
[51:55.300 --> 51:59.620]  The Pentagon doesn't train to fight somebody unless that's their next
[51:59.620 --> 52:02.260]  enemy. So when you see in the Army Times and
[52:02.260 --> 52:06.340]  Stars and Stripes and Forbes and Reuters and AP
[52:06.340 --> 52:09.940]  that they believe gun owning veteran Tea Party Christians
[52:09.940 --> 52:14.100]  and conservatives and libertarians are gonna attack police stations and blow
[52:14.100 --> 52:16.900]  things up. They're going to do it and blame it on us.
[52:16.900 --> 52:20.580]  Any moron can figure that out. You got groups doing nothing
[52:20.580 --> 52:23.860]  and they say we're gonna do all this and there are a bunch of criminals taking
[52:23.860 --> 52:27.380]  over. How did Hitler attack Poland? He blew
[52:27.380 --> 52:31.140]  up his own military base and blamed it on him. I mean this is the oldest
[52:31.140 --> 52:34.660]  trick in the book.
[52:35.540 --> 52:40.340]  And you can see it coming from a trillion miles away boys and girls.
[52:40.340 --> 52:43.140]  So we open the phones up later. Maybe you want to comment on that.
[52:43.140 --> 52:47.540]  Because what is the next move for I shouldn't call him obozo. It's his
[52:47.540 --> 52:52.340]  followers that are obozos. And again Obama himself is a puppet but
[52:52.340 --> 52:58.020]  he loves it and he's the front man. And so we talk about Obama.
[52:58.020 --> 53:04.660]  He's the packaging. He's the paint on the monster truck that's running over us.
[53:04.660 --> 53:09.300]  He's the front man, the figurehead
[53:09.300 --> 53:16.020]  of all this happening. All I know is homeland security
[53:16.020 --> 53:20.260]  is a giant stinking fraud from pillar to post.
[53:20.260 --> 53:25.140]  I flew back in a few weeks ago from a vacation for six days.
[53:25.140 --> 53:29.300]  There's some great diving and stuff in
[53:29.300 --> 53:34.100]  Grand Cayman. And they had a computer there when I flew in and it
[53:34.100 --> 53:37.620]  out of like hundreds of people put a black ax on me and said search me.
[53:37.620 --> 53:42.020]  Put me into immigration control. Basically proctology exam. It's a little
[53:42.020 --> 53:47.220]  gift from the globalist. But see humance involves human intelligence.
[53:47.220 --> 53:51.300]  And so I get up there and the guy's a listener and he goes I can't believe
[53:51.300 --> 53:54.900]  this. He'd be sort of cussing. He said I listened to your show. You've been
[53:54.900 --> 53:58.420]  rebroadcast last week or you've had David Knight in the show. He goes my god.
[53:58.420 --> 54:01.780]  He goes you ought to see it. He goes Republican you know congressman come
[54:01.780 --> 54:05.220]  through here and this happens to him. But illegals we're just told let them
[54:05.220 --> 54:07.540]  walk right through. What's in the news this week? The
[54:07.540 --> 54:11.220]  literal illegals with no documentation. Just fly into Houston. They're just
[54:11.220 --> 54:13.700]  right through. A well-known talk show host with no
[54:13.700 --> 54:17.860]  criminal record. And I was literally slated to be drug off folks.
[54:17.860 --> 54:21.540]  And just torn through. And he just started cussing and said this is
[54:21.540 --> 54:24.260]  BS. These computers are taken over. I'm not doing it.
[54:24.260 --> 54:27.700]  Bam. Stamps it and sends me through.
[54:27.700 --> 54:33.220]  But see soon humans will be out of the decision making process.
[54:34.180 --> 54:36.740]  I mean knock on wood. I don't think I've had a speeding ticket in about eight
[54:36.740 --> 54:40.420]  years. Five six seven years. I don't know.
[54:40.420 --> 54:45.220]  But I couldn't get into the United States. He saw that he was like my kid I
[54:45.220 --> 54:48.260]  believe he'd check me. Yeah there's nothing here.
[54:48.260 --> 54:52.180]  And the guy just said I and started cussing. He had told me he was a listener
[54:52.180 --> 54:54.660]  to that point.
[54:56.420 --> 54:58.980]  I mean he was professional about his cussing under his breath. He's like I
[54:58.980 --> 55:03.460]  can't believe I screwed up his country is. Because let me tell you something.
[55:03.460 --> 55:06.500]  He started telling me all about it. Tell people we're getting mad in line about
[55:06.500 --> 55:09.540]  10 minutes later. Just telling me how it's all a fraud.
[55:09.540 --> 55:13.780]  And how he has to let people in with no IDs.
[55:19.460 --> 55:23.380]  I mean what a screwed up country man. What a screw and there it is.
[55:23.380 --> 55:30.100]  Breitbart exclusive board patrol admits TSA allowing illegals to fly without IDs.
[55:30.100 --> 55:34.580]  That is how screwed up this is folks.
[55:35.380 --> 55:38.420]  Let's play those older clips since I mentioned it. We have the one where he
[55:38.420 --> 55:42.100]  says the border's under control. That's like Obama seeing he knows virtually.
[55:42.100 --> 55:45.460]  Let's play that one and then the one where he says he loses sleep at night
[55:45.460 --> 55:48.820]  worried about the patriots. And of course he does. We know who he is.
[55:48.820 --> 55:52.180]  Of course criminals are up at night worried about people that aren't evil.
[55:52.180 --> 55:56.500]  Here we go. Yes the immigration laws are being enforced though we are
[55:56.500 --> 56:00.660]  faced with an extraordinary situation where thousands of people,
[56:00.660 --> 56:05.460]  young people especially, are fleeing Central America for economic reasons to
[56:05.460 --> 56:09.780]  get away from really endemic violence in their
[56:09.780 --> 56:12.340]  countries. The president has put together a proposal
[56:12.340 --> 56:15.060]  to a congress asking for almost four billion dollars.
[56:15.060 --> 56:18.900]  We are surging immigration judges to the process.
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.020]  This is how you had to process and legalize them and let them in.
[56:22.020 --> 56:25.460]  This is how dumb they think you are. Give us three point six billion dollars
[56:25.460 --> 56:30.980]  and we'll fix it. Having the border patrol now be a red carpet conveyor belt
[56:30.980 --> 56:35.620]  into the country. And I don't mind the public. You're busy. You're working.
[56:35.620 --> 56:38.420]  You got a life. You know you hear oh there's a crisis on
[56:38.420 --> 56:40.900]  the border. They created it. They advertised it.
[56:40.900 --> 56:45.700]  They made deals with Guatemala. Obama and Biden met with them. It's on record
[56:45.700 --> 56:49.620]  to make a deal with Mexico that had controlled its border to let unlimited
[56:49.620 --> 56:54.340]  people including felons. You thought the Cuban boat lift was bad
[56:54.340 --> 56:57.140]  in the 80s. Criminals from Cuba. That was a few hundred thousand.
[56:57.140 --> 57:00.580]  This is millions folks and this is only the first wave. It's going to get
[57:00.580 --> 57:04.820]  a hundred times worse. And I mean a hundred times. It'll be a million a month.
[57:04.820 --> 57:08.660]  It's already filling up the sports stadiums you name it. And then it'll be
[57:08.660 --> 57:12.100]  this new political class that they control. They exploit.
[57:12.100 --> 57:16.500]  This is the wages of bondage. This is a government that got away with so much.
[57:16.500 --> 57:21.460]  The sky's the limit. Lawlessness. Congressmen can't fly back in the U.S.
[57:21.460 --> 57:25.300]  I can't fly back in. Illegals need no ID. Please don't forget

[57:52.020 --> 57:56.100]  Journal, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on
[57:56.100 --> 58:00.100]  Monday about a potential foretold situation? The police are shoving people,
[58:00.100 --> 58:03.700]  shoving Alex, shoving the crowd. Here we go, folks. I'm being assigned to...
[58:03.700 --> 58:07.140]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the
[58:07.140 --> 58:10.740]  Nightly News, infowars is the tip of the spear. Is this another

[58:13.380 --> 58:16.100]  homelink security by sticking a hands-down on the fence on the streets?
[58:16.100 --> 58:20.100]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[58:20.100 --> 58:23.220]  And that's what Prison Planet.tv is designed to do.
[58:23.220 --> 58:28.580]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical
[58:28.580 --> 58:32.980]  weapons against the so-called rebels. What we see now is a war against
[58:32.980 --> 58:37.540]  reality. It's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever that supporters
[58:37.540 --> 58:41.860]  of freedom become members of Prison Planet.tv and share their membership

[58:52.100 --> 58:56.500]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs. Super male vitality was developed
[58:56.500 --> 59:00.100]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[59:00.100 --> 59:04.980]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs
[59:04.980 --> 59:09.940]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[59:09.940 --> 59:13.780]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was
[59:13.780 --> 59:18.020]  good stuff. After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[59:18.020 --> 59:22.900]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[59:22.900 --> 59:28.260]  super male vitality formula. Super male vitality by Info Wars Life is so
[59:28.260 --> 59:31.620]  powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[59:53.300 --> 59:59.700]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.900]  Network.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:07.940]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:15.860]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.700]  I'll tell you this, these aren't going to be boring times we're living in.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.820]  At the start of the next segment I'm going to make the absolutely key point
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.420]  so just stay tuned for that. Right now let's go right to your phone calls.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:32.180]  Carl, Karen, Frank, Andrew, Joe, Mark, Randy, Rick, CyberBully, IronEd,
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.340]  BB, and somebody else there we haven't had their name yet.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.100]  Carl in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:45.300]  Hey Alex, I got a comment. Can you hear me? Yes, sir.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.220]  I got a comment and then I got something I got to tell you.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.420]  First comment, I don't understand what things
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.220]  as they're going, almost any dummy can see what's going on but I don't
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.860]  understand why I'll say the Tea Party, some of the
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.220]  conservative Republicans, we're going to lose it all and
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.460]  there's nothing to stick around for if this happens.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.540]  Why don't these guys become more vocal and active?
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.300]  I don't understand. I'll tell you why because a bunch of lawyers
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.220]  came on the scene and they taught people how to compromise.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.460]  The problem is though we always compromise the political system doesn't
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.940]  and the globalists want authoritarianism now. They don't want prosperity
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:35.620]  even though it creates incredible wealth, they want control
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.900]  and the decision has been made to end this country and turn us into a third
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.500]  world nation because the elite have put the police state in place
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.020]  so they can live in big armored compounds
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.140]  and I guess the rest of us just are out here outside of it.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.260]  It's a very evil short-sighted outlook but it's the way that every major
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:58.180]  empire is gone and we don't have to repeat history
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.780]  because it's a modern age, things are more compressed
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:05.220]  now, things happen quicker so that means bad things can be worse but they can
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:09.220]  also be better. There's a lot of wild cards involved
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:16.980]  and I mean really at the end of the day the people running things are deviance
[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.260]  and by deviant I don't mean the way the church teaches you know establishment
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.340]  church if you like good-looking women you're a deviant.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:26.100]  No, I mean deviant is creating derivatives that screw the next
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.980]  generation and cheat everybody and destroy the economy.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.060]  Deviance is creating GMO that sterilizes all the rats that he didn't
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.340]  feeding it to humans. I mean there's things on order of
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.540]  scale that are billions of times more evil
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.540]  than what we're taught you know oh not opening the door for a girl that's
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:47.460]  evil but you know creating you know all these
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:54.180]  weapons isn't so I mean you're asking me the question what do you think
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.460]  because you're right I mean we're at the end of an age basically
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:02.580]  at the bottom of a cycle and I think it's because a lot of the people that have
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.740]  money are so compartmentalized in their wealth
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.340]  that they don't see the effects of what they're doing
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.500]  and they have such disdain for their fellow man and woman
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.180]  they kind of like seeing people in bad straits and I think that's what it comes
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.820]  down to I think it's just part of evil growing what do you think
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:29.460]  well I'm I'm positive about the evil uh but I just don't know how people can
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.180]  uh separate themselves from or exclude themselves from what's happening
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.940]  because uh unless you're part of the elite
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.540]  you're going down with everybody else so I don't
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:46.020]  I don't understand that part of it well you just hit the nail on the head
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:51.940]  if you studied history elites never get out of what they're setting up right
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.740]  now and they tend to think with all the high
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:59.460]  tech gadgetry and over the horizon predictive systems
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.340]  that they're going to get out of something but if you go to the higher
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.060]  level elites they go oh no it's going to be a giant
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:08.820]  disastrous black nightmare and that's what we're looking for to
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:13.860]  them it's more of the adventure of the attempted takeover and to
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.700]  dominate good you know when you realize it's a death
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.180]  battle by evil against good then it all makes sense but
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.540]  it's not just choose good or evil you've got to choose the right good
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.540]  you see that's the deception is that it's hard to find
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:34.660]  the real thing and not the counterfeit but it's a good question I appreciate
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.500]  you Carl and hey just be glad you care

[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:45.940]  briefly earlier i said that i would break down the key point of today's
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:50.900]  broadcast and it's this what do you think is
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:54.420]  coming if the establishment's preparing for martial law
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.500]  civil emergency gun confiscation you name it now i've been telling you about
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:02.100]  that for a long time now it's in the news just type into the search
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.660]  engine pentagon prepares for national collapse civil unrest
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.180]  says their enemies the tea party
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:16.500]  that's because the tea party is the only opposition to this takeover
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.420]  you've got big hedge funds and big banks that are trying to shut down all
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.420]  their competition don't want to compare them to local banks
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:31.540]  who openly have created 1500 plus trillion in fake money
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:34.660]  and they want government to enforce the value of that money
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.620]  at our expense
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:44.820]  so understand this is all on record it's not like i'm up here giving you my
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:50.420]  opinion even though it sounds crazy the establishment is crazy not me
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.980]  i've gone a little crazy knowing about it for so long i mean that's just
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.500]  when you know this stuff it's all on record and it's very frustrating
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.500]  when you love a country family's been here for 400 years before it was even a
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.100]  country you've been to the rest of the world you know it's not that good as
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.140]  well and you see america falling apart
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:12.660]  and you see us being merged with latin america for god's sakes
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:16.500]  it's very frustrating randy and oklahoma finishing up your point
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.060]  about seeing the republican establishment run a snot nose greenhorn
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:24.180]  establishment person against you and i guess one
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:28.340]  that they're trying to kill patriots running for office but you took action
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:32.740]  you educated people that's what mattered what's your closing comments
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  well right and and we're going to continue with what the
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:42.020]  solution i proposed i said i said this is david night by the way that electoral
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.180]  politics are not enough and i said my solution
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:50.820]  would require that i needed to have a common law grand jury in three counties
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:54.340]  in order for me to serve if i was going to do it effectively
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:58.180]  and i'm going to if i remember your phone call one time when i was gone
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.500]  david night was sitting in and you talked about how a real state rep
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.820]  or a congressman would work and empower the grand juries
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:13.540]  in tandem to go after the criminals yeah absolutely i'm posting a website on my
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:18.260]  campaign website if i could plug it it's uh randy barnett
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:24.260]  hd10.com and i'll be posting a solution there's two
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.540]  things that were provided in the bill of rights two instrumentalities that are
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:31.380]  provided and i'll leave it to the audience see if they can guess
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.140]  two things are provided to us that can it it's our last best hope of
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:40.180]  civil restoration sure you've got you've got you've got voting in the grand jury
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:44.180]  and other jury systems and then you got the cartridge box i appreciate your
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.380]  call and listen folks here's the bad news
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.260]  the criminals that hijacked the government are bipartisan
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:54.660]  obama of course is the red leader you know driving the whole train
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:59.380]  the most violent form of the cancer but they intend to have a civil war with
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.900]  american gun owners and because they're all
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:06.420]  going to be in switzerland and luxembourg and london
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:13.300]  and and and madrid and paris and berlin while the police and the military try
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:16.100]  to carry this out
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.380]  it's like two guys sitting there and pointing guns at each other and shooting
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.820]  each other in the face for no reason it is and if we're dumb enough to go along
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:28.100]  with this we deserve it that's just it's it's incredible
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.460]  it's a we legalized abortion in this country i mean we deserve it all
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:35.220]  we're just idiots and i don't say that to put us down folks
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.260]  we've got to admit how far we've fallen if we've ever going to turn this
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.060]  around rich in atlanta thanks for holding
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:46.020]  you're on the air rich uh long-time listener
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:50.740]  and prison prime member thank you great product and let me tell you
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:57.700]  we have three branch separation of powers i cannot believe that
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:03.860]  nothing has been done all this time to have stopped obama for what he's doing
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:08.260]  and i'm just really really upset about that exactly we've been saying all along
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:12.100]  the last six years no power grabs ever been like this in us history
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.260]  hands down all the constitutional lawyers
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.660]  totally on the left uh people uh like fine on the right
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.340]  there's no debate this is the greatest executive power grab ever
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:26.100]  it's totally unconstitutional and where's the republican leadership
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:30.340]  baner says he doesn't want to impeach holders criticizing sarah palin for
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.780]  calling for impeachment i get that republicans are gaining
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.900]  political support by obama's out of control behavior
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.340]  but there may not be a country left in two years
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.860]  and if you set a precedent to not prosecute crime
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.980]  what does that make you it makes you a criminal as well
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.420]  exactly for that i think we need to have the uh
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:57.140]  obama care mascot come back again double double dumb ass
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.100]  hey you know we've got that little electronic bunny around here somewhere
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.140]  that you can say stuff to and it repeats it so i promise you this if they
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.420]  remind me tomorrow we will bring back double double
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.860]  dumb ass tomorrow if i'm reminded by the crew it's on you guys
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.260]  okay and i want it but i want him mic'd up with a
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:14.820]  microphone everything and i will do an interview with an
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.060]  obama supporter and whatever you tell the bunny it repeats back so i'll say
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:23.780]  obama care cuts your health cost in half you can keep your doctor
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.380]  eyes pledge and not come after any of your guns not your rival not your hanga
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:31.060]  not your shotgun i pledge to hire no lobbyist i pledge to

[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:41.780]  i mean that's the thing about obama like ron paul said on friday here
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.740]  it's the arrogance there's never been anything like it
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:52.420]  cyberbully in florida you're on the air hey alec um to stay on topic with my
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.860]  comment i think the dreamers are gonna flip out when their dreams comes into
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:59.860]  a nightmare and now when they all get stuck inside america when it collapses
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:03.380]  oh i agree it's just like everybody that goes and gets all these college degrees
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.300]  that 90 plus percent become worthless all they got was brainwashing for
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.900]  political correctness oh no i these are total victims coming into
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:15.620]  the country absolutely they're there to be democratic party groups and to be
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.740]  fed on by the local chicano mafia go ahead
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:22.100]  and they get away with this because of perception management and you do a
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.740]  really good job at calling it out with really good sapphire
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.100]  um i was hoping you could actually bring back at info wars jeopardy because
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.620]  that was a really good way and if you could launch that on the nightly news
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.980]  have a caller's call in possibly win like stickers and stuff
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.900]  you know you could dominate and take over with uh just i know i know i need

[01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:01.060]  more satire that is a winning winning way to take action

[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:09.220]  law review that he shared that he was from kenya

[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:25.700]  you're on the air hey there chemo sabi ever wake up feeling like you've taken a
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:30.580]  bad drug and wound up on the ship of fools i do feel like that that's another
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:34.020]  great robber plant song ship of fuel of fools
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:38.580]  but uh what i mean what where do you think all this is going
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.700]  the madness we're witnessing what'd you call in about
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:45.300]  well to answer your question that's exactly what your question was i'm gonna
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.340]  answer the question with a somewhat rhetorical question but you'll know where
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:53.140]  i'm going when i lay it out what do you do how do we
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.340]  identify when we've reached the bifurcation point the tipping point
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:59.860]  all the times in history where everybody could have done what it done
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:03.380]  should have done didn't do wound up looking in the rearview mirror saying
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:07.860]  this is really ugly what do you do beforehand how to identify it
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:11.700]  and then what is the reaction point at which you
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:15.940]  do something in a very orchestrated manner
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:19.620]  and then i if you want to answer that i'll give you my solution set
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:23.860]  yeah let me give you my take on that ironhead for those that don't travel a
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:27.300]  lot outside the u.s most countries are hellish
[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:30.980]  in asia africa latin america they're just hellish
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:34.740]  the only good places in the world are like japan russia to some extent it's
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:40.020]  pretty bad western europe some of the mediterranean south
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.300]  africa the united states canada australia new zealand
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.180]  and that's only about a billion of the people in the world
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:52.900]  another six billion plus live in hell
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.740]  and the political class has decided to checkmate
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:38:00.100]  the democratic class here in the west by just bringing in people that don't know
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:05.780]  any better and will be political pawns to vote however they're told
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.820]  and we have an insane elite that's why we're in so much trouble it's like it's
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.020]  like hitler attacking all those countries when he had germany and germany
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:15.700]  was doing great it was a power trip why did he do it he was nuts
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:20.580]  why the communists do what they did they were that they were a criminal elite
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:24.900]  the globalists have primed everything where when the violence starts they'll
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:28.180]  blame it on us that's why they always stage it themselves to blame us so
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:31.140]  we don't want violence to break out there does come a plot where they're
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.220]  coming to take you to the reeducation center
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:37.220]  was a democratic party and clinton's and the weathermen openly called for
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.700]  and they're gearing up for that that's how nuts they are but the longer we can
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:45.300]  stay out of that the more we're winning congress has a seven percent approval
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.500]  rating the political class is absolutely hated
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:52.660]  obama is hated republican leadership's teamed up with obama to try to block
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.580]  the libertarian movement in the tea party there's a real battle going on
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:01.620]  we're winning on a bunch of fronts they haven't run a bunch of false flags yet
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:05.140]  because every time they do our people are watching and we blow their operation
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.060]  so we've really got them intimidated they're pretty freaked out right now
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.980]  and most people that work in the fbi cia police department
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:18.100]  bureaucracy are not even bad in fact most of them have decompartmentalized
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.940]  because stuff's gotten so obvious this show has helped others have helped
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.620]  we deserve a lot of the credit which i don't want it's kind of dangerous but
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:31.220]  and in the vein of honesty i'll tell you we've hit the zeitgeist in a very vicious
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:36.100]  way against the elite and the eye of sauron is upon this broadcast
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:41.780]  uh they do not like us so that mere fact shows the power of the people
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:45.140]  because i'm really nothing special at the end of the day except for the fact that
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:47.540]  i don't want to be a slave and i've studied the establishment
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:54.180]  anyone can do that once you start studying reality instead of world cup and dancing with
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:59.300]  the stars and how to act cool you become a member of the elite because it's only
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.940]  been the elite that study that and usually it's corrupt elites the average person
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:06.500]  working for the system doesn't want to destroy their life or future
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:13.460]  but the elite's corruption was so bad people didn't want to believe it because it was over the top
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.100]  they judge the world by how they thought and by what they stood for
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:23.300]  and so there was no way the elite was that bad but now it's admitted now
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:28.020]  now we're kind of the deer in the headlights moment but we're not a deer we're humans
[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:32.900]  if we get out of the headlights adjust to what's happening adapt overcome improvise
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:40.180]  and say no to this system this counterfeit fraudulent con artist system where things are
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:48.020]  based on fraud not on reality if we overthrow intellectually the system tyranny will vanish
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:55.860]  like like evil spirits at dawn to quote thomas geverson so it is an inside job the world changes
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:41:03.140]  individual by individual and the system thinks we're so dumb they openly fund al-qaeda worldwide they
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:09.700]  openly fund tyranny they openly are trying to attack christians worldwide people are already
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:17.540]  rejecting this we're all just atomized individuals we have to realize we are together we have to
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:23.620]  identify with each other we need to stop in fighting with each other about what race we are
[01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:27.460]  need to come together around a bill of rights and constitution and realize the globalists
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:32.500]  are dominating us via balkanization so that's the short answer to your very important question
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:37.940]  and like the row said each man is a late unto himself and if he gives up his own life
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.820]  and we all go blinking out into never neverland and we all come together and bring it forth as one
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:49.860]  unified whole exactly i mean the enemy is taking over right now and is so naked out of weakness
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:55.700]  they're attempting a total finishing act right now because they're on fire we are blowing the
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:01.140]  daylights out of them we need i mean i'm not just saying that we are kicking their ass i'm sorry go
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.100]  ahead and finish up no you got the new you hit the nail in the head there is a collective unified
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.860]  consciousness you know i'm the father the father's in me as i am in you or if you don't like the
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:14.900]  father i am in the field as the field is in me as i am in you there is a unified whole coming

[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:59.620]  uh screened me or scanned me before i called in today nope nobody really screams the calls unless
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:04.100]  we're on a special topic and then we'll say only comment on certain issues so what's on your mind
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:11.460]  um i turned a couple friends of mine on to you because i you and i've spoken before and i really
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:17.300]  believe that you are telling the truth as you may see it it may be the right truth it may be the
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:22.340]  wrong truth but i believe that it is your personal truth that you are giving us here with all
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:27.940]  of your mind so uh i was scrolling through my facebook posted in this friend that i turned
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:33.220]  on to you had a very disparaging article from one of your detractors and i'm going to refrain from
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:37.700]  using his name because i don't want to give him any i don't even know i get attacked by the white
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:43.460]  house for heaven's sakes i got attacked by time magazine i'm not even worried about it uh i mean
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:50.580]  look listen no one has to go off what i say they can go look at what i'm saying at the actual
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:55.540]  information you don't have to trust what i'm saying you can go you know when i say former head
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:02.180]  of al-qaeda says cia runs group that's in major newspapers in the middle east going public admitting
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:07.540]  that ices is western run but i mean i mean that's that i'm just covering that when i say there's
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:12.180]  drones operating i'm just covering it when my reporters go down and show that the board of
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:17.060]  patrol is busting the illegals in three weeks later the board of patrol is admitting it it's not
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:25.700]  about alex show it's much bigger than me but but go ahead um i i agree with that um i uh i i i hate to
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:29.460]  i hate to almost mention this for fear i'm apprehensive that your head is going to blow up
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:33.380]  because i don't even care ma'am it's like i knew what you were going when you said
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:38.660]  no one screamed my call and everyone says the calls are fake to your show who cares what
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:46.580]  detractors say i know who cares totally not um i mean who cares is this is this is this just an
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:52.020]  effort to discredit you do you think i mean because you are yes it's cognitive infiltration cast
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:56.180]  sunstone in the winehouse i don't know specifically what you're talking about but i mean every claim
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:01.860]  you can imagine is made on a daily basis against me and they do this to new media people new people
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:06.820]  start websites all the time or talk shows and then the feds attack them through a provocateur and
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:12.340]  then they respond and fight all day ignore it move on warning the people and we'll change the world
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:16.980]  together i don't care what they say about me quite frankly i love it i don't know what it is you're
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:21.060]  calling about but i'm done talking about it thank you bb dennis in colorado we got to move
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:28.660]  quick through these calls you're on the air dennis hey alex how's it going good good uh just a comment
[01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:35.620]  i want to make is that you know people you know my my mentor taught me that people of america should
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:40.020]  fight for what they believe in and every other country should fight for what they believe in
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:48.020]  really it it it is a it is a factor well i mean we need to fight for basic property rights family
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:55.780]  rights right to defense local control we're a concord nation that's why the system is undermining
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:01.780]  every second balance is why the prosperity is disappearing that's exactly true and uh i mean
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:08.820]  i live in colorado and i watch these cops pull over legals they walk up either legal walk away
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:14.500]  but boy you're that's because exactly no no it's admitted because they want the illegals here
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:20.580]  we are the target we are the chumps that comply stop complying the system is alien the government
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:25.940]  is a fraud i'm not saying the average cop is bad but they work for a power structure that is here
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:32.260]  to destroy this country it's totally illegitimate i get checked by by by the board of patrol illegals
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:40.660]  don't i mean a great point and i tell them what uh whenever i get pulled over i then i got pulled

[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:49.700]  eating them nothing to say yeah the cops back off real quick because they all know it's a fraud
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:53.780]  they're freaked out as well i mean i've talked to the prosecutors and also they've come to my
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:58.180]  studios privately we've talked i'm not going to say names but high-level prosecutors at travis

[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:23.620]  because i had to get this to you but uh we took a camping trip this last week and we were in uh
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:30.420]  what's called the okanagan it runs up into canada it's one of the most sparsely populated areas
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:36.660]  of country sure what happened uh lake bonaparte we were camped there and about a mile and a half
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:45.620]  up the lake is a boy scout camp and i would say there's probably 200 kids up there what happened
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:53.380]  what'd you see uh it's what i heard from there and it was chance and stuff that uh i've been around
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:56:00.420]  boy scout and this has never never been part of the program and it was like socialist or communist
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:07.460]  yes and it was uh they did it three times a day at right after revelry they had a regular
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:13.620]  trumpet that you could hear what would they sound i couldn't couldn't tell because it was so loud
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:20.100]  and blended but it wasn't it wasn't i hear you listen did you search engine boy scouts work
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.580]  for homeland security same thing in canada they've been federalized i'm not saying they're bad but
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:30.180]  it's it's it's everything's been taken over i gotta move quick here uh susan and south dakota go ahead
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:39.300]  yes can you hear me yes i can okay um i have two points to make go ahead go ahead the first point
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:45.460]  is that uh i've only heard ked cruse talk about repealing the 17th amendment i think that's really
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:51.540]  important so the senator should be should be appointed by the legislatures to make him creatures
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:56.100]  the state that's right we don't have states without the senators being appointed by the legislature
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:03.300]  and then we can keep the precedent accountable also you know by extension that absolutely
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:08.260]  senators are their own little imperial criminals and uh the states are supposed to be co-equal great
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:14.820]  point and the second point is that i'd like to send a message to all our elected public
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:21.460]  servants that all the uh u.s senators and representatives and the mayors of large cities
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:27.380]  the governors uh that obama and hillary clinton don't care about you and they will throw you out
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:31.220]  with the trash oh they know that the average person those never been through any type of
[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:35.380]  serious crisis so they're just they're just unconscious they're just a bunch of go along get
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:40.980]  along cowards but but don't worry i mean the main event's coming up their medal will be tested
