[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, corn, and domestic.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's October 31st, 2017.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  And on this All Saints Eve, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  we have real goblins, real vampires, real spooks running around.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  And that, of course, ladies and gentlemen, is the Democratic Party,
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  Hollywood, and Mike Sernovich out trying to give a speech at Columbia.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  They had the Antifa folks there with their pre-made signs all up together,
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  wearing the exact garb, all having the meth head look of Antifa.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  I believe this is real, holding up a giant banner saying no white supremacy,
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  no Pito bashing, no Mike Sernovich with the emblems of Nambla and others on it,
[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  and then the authorization and things by the university to be out there demonstrating.
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  And then the phone number to stop Mike Sernovich from speaking.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  This is what these people are into.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  People say, oh, it must be staged.
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  Really to the New York Times, The Washington Post, Time Magazine, The Associated Press, Salon Magazine.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  Did they all endorse pedophilia the last few years by accident?
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  Did Kevin Spacey just apologize for trying to rape a 14-year-old?
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  Did Harvey Weinstein hire people to run Disney films that had been convicted for raping 12-year-old boys?
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  No, the truth is it's a cult, and they're coming out of their nasty rat hole.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  First, here's a report on Kevin Spacey, and we'll be back for the big transmission.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  The Libra Media is very conflicted right now.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  They're not sure whether or not they should celebrate Kevin Spacey coming out as gay
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  or be horrified at the allegations that he tried to have sex with the 14-year-old boy.
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  Anthony Rapp, an actor on the new Star Trek series, has come out and made some disturbing allegations
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  about Kevin Spacey he says occurred back when he was 14 years old.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  I'm not going to show you what this actor says Kevin Spacey tried to do to him because it's just too disgusting.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  But what I am going to do is I'm going to show you how the Libra Media is trying to spin this
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  to celebrate Kevin Spacey finally coming out of the closet.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  And we'll also ask the question, did Seth MacFarlane know that these kinds of allegations
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  were swirling around Hollywood regarding Kevin Spacey?
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  ABC News originally had this as the headline to their story.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  Oh, Kevin Spacey has come out in an emotional tweet.
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  Only two later change it after the backlash because, well, that's not really the story.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  Reuters currently has the headline, actor Kevin Spacey declares he lives life as a gay man.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  They may change this, of course, just like ABC did.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  But currently, right now, this is what it says.
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.000]  Oh, after years of refusing to address rumors about his sexuality,
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey said on Sunday he has chosen to live life as a gay man.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I'm sorry, Reuters, that isn't the story here.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  You may recall that Seth MacFarlane made a joke a few years ago about actresses having to sleep with Harvey Weinstein
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  in order to get roles in his movies when Seth was announcing the Oscar nominations
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  in what he would later admit was an attempt to try to alert people about Harvey Weinstein's widespread behavior.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  Seth MacFarlane was also well aware of the rumors about Bruce Jenner transitioning to a woman
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  long before he announced that he would start living as Caitlin,
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  and he even included a bit in one of his shows which said that Bruce Jenner is a woman.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  Which leads us to this disturbing clip from the Family Guy from an episode many years ago,
[03:41.000 --> 03:49.000]  where this little boy, Stewie, runs away screaming that he just escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement and he needs help.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  Help! I escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement! Help me!
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  If it's not clear enough what this joke is trying to convey, the boy is not wearing any pants.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  While the mainstream media continues to focus on Harvey Weinstein and frame this issue as if it's just powerful men
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  who are sexually harassing and enticing young actresses, the problems of Hollywood are much bigger and much darker.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  The mainstream media doesn't want to talk about Hollywood's pedophile problem,
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  something that child star Corey Feldman has been warning people about for years,
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  saying that it's the biggest problem in the entire industry.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  I can tell you that the number one problem in Hollywood was and is and always will be pedophilia.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  That's the biggest problem for children in this industry.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  They also don't want to talk about the fact that there are many powerful gay sexual predators in Hollywood
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  who sexually harass men. Actors like Terry Crews, Robyn Schneider, Kevin Sorbo,
[04:42.000 --> 04:50.000]  and others are coming forward to tell their stories of being sexually harassed and assaulted by male Hollywood executives.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  But the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about those stories.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  And now that a once childhood actor is accusing Kevin Spacey of being a sexual predator,
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  the mainstream media, ABC...
[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best selling product, Brainforce.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  that we've been able to get it for less. So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brainforce is for you
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's a good deal at $39. It's $19.96 at InfowarsLife.com
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  or simply call toll-free, triple-eight-two-five-three-three-one-three-nine.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  It's the claim that the August protest was some sort of left-wing plot.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  Who, you might ask, would say something so offensive?
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S. Congress.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  And look at the background. George Soros is one of those people
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  that actually helps, you know, back these individuals. Who is he?
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  who swore that you were, uh, his adopted god son.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  Yes, yes.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.000]  That's right.
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  Was it difficult?
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  Not, not at all.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  Do you think George Soros funded the neo-Nazis who marched in Charleston?
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  Is this lost on anyone? George Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator.
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[07:05.000 --> 07:20.000]  Music
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, or you'll mind.
[07:26.000 --> 07:34.000]  Music
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  October 31st, 2017.
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and I'll be here for the next four hours.
[07:41.000 --> 07:49.000]  And the real evil in this world is a lot scarier than phantasms and folklore
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  of night on bold mountain.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  When the devil rises, the pitch black,
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  the demons rise from the ground and dance in the frostbite fields.
[08:04.000 --> 08:10.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, real evil is upon us,
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  and it's the narcissistic mentally ill, psychopathic, globalist.
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  So arrogant they don't know when they're whipped.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  So arrogant they continue to try to bully us into submission,
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  and the bottom line is this.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  We're not taking it lying down, and we are winning.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  Well, coming up, I've got the video.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  Lindsey Graham throws down the gauntlet and says
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  there'll be holy hell to pay if Mueller's fired.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  He's the swamp king.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  He's not elected.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  He was put in there by the Democrats.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  He covered up decades of crime.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  Took jihadis off the terror list.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  But now Mueller is the savior.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  Mueller is the great hope they have.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  Even though it turns out the Podesta Brothers did way more
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  in not filing some federal paperwork on offshore corporations
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  timely than Manafort or his aide ever did.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  And oh, they got a warning months ago to do it
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.000]  and did file it years later.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  But that's okay because they're above the law,
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  and the swamp king, and all the swamp king's minions
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  think they're above the voters of this country.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  And despite the fact the swamp king,
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  Mueller's up to his eyeballs with the Russians
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  beyond anything Donald Trump could ever imagine,
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  it's all right.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  Because, again, the media and the Republican establishment
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  is imbuing him as if he's a god.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  Meanwhile, the pedophiles have come out in the open
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  in a bigger way than ever before
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  as their empire prepares to implode.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  They're trying to normalize as quickly as possible.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  But they're a day late and a dollar short, aren't they?
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  But first, let's air a powerful piece by Paul Joseph Watson,
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  who's part of it.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  BuzzFeed says skincare is a white supremacist conspiracy.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  Here it is.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  Immoticons are racist. Maths is racist.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Showing up on time is racist.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Having a family is racist.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  You know what else is racist? Skincare products.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  According to BuzzFeed, skin whitening products reinforce
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  the white supremacist ideals of beauty.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  White supremacist ideals of beauty.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  That's so problematic.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  So, Nivea Philippines has a whole line
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  with products like UV whitening body serum,
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  extra white firming body lotion,
[10:24.000 --> 10:27.000]  instant white firming body lotion.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  All right, here we go again.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  People in Asia are obsessed with skin whitening
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  because stretching back to ancient China and Japan,
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  a white complexion was seen as noble and aristocratic.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  Because it proved you weren't a peasant toiling out
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  in the field all day under the hot sun.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  And maybe if you'd listened to the Asian woman
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  in your own frigging video, explain this to your face,
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  you'd know that.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Because where they grew up, like socioeconomically,
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  the farmers were dark-skinned,
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  and farming wasn't a highly paid profession.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  And if you had more money or you were like part of the
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  upper class, you would stay indoors
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  and you would have an office job.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  As far back as 700 BC, Chinese women would use
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  ground-up pearls as a white face powder
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  to give them a lighter complexion.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  White supremacist ideals of beauty.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  What the f*** does that have to do with white supremacy
[11:14.000 --> 11:17.000]  in a contemporary racial context?
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  Nothing. Why do you think Japanese tourists
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  walk around under umbrellas in the blazing sun?
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  It's a cultural and socioeconomic class thing,
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  not a race thing.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  White supremacist.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  It has nothing whatsoever to do with white people as a race
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  or white supremacy.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  It's the same reason white people from Europe
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  and colder areas of America go to tanning salons.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  It has nothing to do with race.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  Having tanned skin doesn't mean you're trying to
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  reinforce black supremacy, does it?
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  Just like Asians, only in reverse,
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  they're deliberately trying to make their skin color darker.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Because culturally and socioeconomically,
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  it broadcasts a message of health and success.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  But wait, if white people are trying to make their skin look darker,
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  does that mean sunbeds are cultural appropriation?
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  And if white people who don't want a tan use sunscreen,
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  does that make them racist?
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  White supremacist.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  Now I'm just giving BuzzFeed ideas for the next video.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  The demand for skin whitening products is all coming from non-white people.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  Companies who cater to this demand are engaging in what's called
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  free market capitalism.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  It has nothing to do with white supremacy.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  The only people who are not knowingly buying skin whitening products
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  are white people.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  They're out of all the different people in the video.
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  Who's awkwardness and shame did BuzzFeed choose to linger on?
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And it's the white girl.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  So you're going to tell me what's wrong?
[12:40.000 --> 12:43.000]  Skin brightening products are sold in different markets very differently.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  So stuff that's sold in North America as like a brightener
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  or something that exfoliates your skin to give you like this glowing complexion
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  in other markets overseas are often sold as whitening products.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  BuzzFeed!
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  White people who do buy what are described as skin brightening products
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  use them to even out skin tone and hide blemishes.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  And so do some black people.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Like the one in your video.
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  They do have issues with acne.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  Are they doing it to jump on that oh so trendy and socially acceptable
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  bandwagon of white supremacism?
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  White supremacism.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Or are they doing it to get rid of their acne?
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  Oh but the companies that sell those products use coded language
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  and don't call them whitening products in America.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  Yeah because they know if they did they'd be descended upon
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  by a mob outrage army of militant BuzzFeed readers accusing them of racism.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  That's why they don't do it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  Not because they're orchestrating a giant global conspiracy to advance white supremacy
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  by turning all the brown people into honky.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  White supremacism.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  That's like saying spray on tan is a black lives matter plot
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  to secretly enact white genocide.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  One of the few times white women try to look whiter
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  is when they're dressing up like Japanese geisha girls.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Cultural appropriation really.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Let's see what Japanese people think about the horror
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  of being culturally appropriated.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  I was told that Japanese people like it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  Foreigners like to do this kind of thing
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  by taking Japanese culture.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  Foreigners like to do this kind of thing.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  I'd like to do more of this kind of thing.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  I'd like to do more of this kind of thing.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  They don't give a s*** because they haven't succumbed
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  to the mass hysteria that everything you can possibly imagine is racist.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  The real reason these products might be sold differently in different markets
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  might actually have to do with what makes white consumers uncomfortable.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  Yeah, you make them uncomfortable by blaming them
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  for a white supremacist conspiracy that doesn't exist.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  Ultimately, white people are uncomfortable with the idea
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.000]  that they might be engaging in white supremacist ideals of beauty,
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  ones that suggest that if your skin is fair,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  you're going to do better in life.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  OK, the example you just used to illustrate that claim,
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  the racist Dove advert, was completely taken out of context.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I don't take my word for it.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  That woman who was the face of the commercial
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  said it was completely taken out of context.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  I was happy with it when I saw the ad itself
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  because I turned into a white model.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  Paul's full report is on infowars.com and newswars.com,
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  and I literally have dozens of these stories every day
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  with them with straight faces saying this.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  It's hysteria in the general public,
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  but from the scientific psychological warfare perspective,
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  it's completely and totally scientific.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  And just to show you what I'm talking about,
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  here's an article today on infowars.com.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Daily Caller also has it.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  Canadian Music Festival apologizes after racist white staffer
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  refuses to go to the back of the crowd.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  They were told, we don't want any white people in the photos
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  being here.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  We don't want your kind here, like the space bar in Star Wars,
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  Episode 4, and she refused, so they threw her out.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  This is beyond telling black people go to the back of the bus
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  and the ignorant masses see no irony
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  to turn what Martin Luther King said and his dream
[15:55.000 --> 16:24.000]  on its head into a nightmare.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  freedom from insurance.
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  to share in each other's medical expenses.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  and $347 for families.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  See guidelines.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  Go to libertyoncall.org.
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.000]  877-886-3653
[17:51.000 --> 18:02.000]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  and flavor?
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  That's right.
[18:08.000 --> 18:11.000]  Now's the time to build your own food storage
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.

[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  that's easy to use.
[18:20.000 --> 18:21.000]  Let me tell you something.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  It is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables,
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation,
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  like canning or dehydrating,
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  there is no comparison.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste,
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  color, and nutritional value
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Harvest Rights is truly the world's best,
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  most affordable freeze dryer.
[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[18:55.000 --> 19:24.000]  Check it out right now at infoorstore.com.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Here's the formula that I personally have been taking
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  for over a year, and now we believe
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  we have come as close to perfection
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  as you can be because we need you,
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  we're changing the world.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield
[19:57.000 --> 20:23.000]  Live.com.
[20:23.000 --> 20:28.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order,
[20:28.000 --> 20:36.000]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  Well, we're ten months into the Trump presidency,
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  and everything's turning around economically.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  And the establishment, the globalists,
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  are just running around like across between a cat,
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  it's had its tail tied to another cat with gasoline poured on it,
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  it's working with its head cut off.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  You'd think it was the end of the world.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  And it is for them.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Their pedophile networks are being exposed.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  Their one-sided trade deals are being exposed.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  They are really scared.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  And coming up in the next segment,
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  we're going to go over pedophile rings being busted all over the world.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  And at the same time, the pedophile groups are coming out
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  in the open saying, hey, this is normal, don't arrest us.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  And we saw an example of this with an anti-foot group
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  in free speech calling for Mike Sernovich to be banned from speaking
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  at Columbia with a sign saying, no white supremacy, no pedos,
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  no Mike Sernovich.
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  And it's an organized group marching behind it.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  It appears to have really happened.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  But, you know, Salon and the New York Times and all these other groups
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  promoting pedophilia as a healthy good thing,
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  they've already come out of the closet.
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  So this seems unreal to us because that's how whacked out they are.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  I mean, antifa is so pirano-like that when no one shows up
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  to a demonstration that they're supposedly going to attack,
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  they just attack the police or themselves.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  They're like a pit bull you've given PCP
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  and a bunch of methamphetamine.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  They're like starving pit bulls on PCP.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  So they're kind of stumbling around.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  Their eyes are pointing different directions.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  But this is what they're into.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  You know, the antifa men like to dress like women
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  and then hold AK-47s and say, we're coming.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  We're going to kill you.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  So that's all coming up next segment.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, we have the Swap King.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  And that really is who Robert Mueller is.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  He's operating as a king.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  He's unelected.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  He's ignoring all the massive crimes of Hillary and himself
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  in real Russia collusion.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  Leftovers from the old Justice Department put him in power
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  as this free agent and even the weak that is a liberal publication
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  says Robert Mueller is running amok.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  And they've got the artist sketches there
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  of Manafort and his business associate,
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  looks just like me strangely enough,
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  being arraigned.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  Richard Gates and Paul Manafort being arraigned.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And even the weak says, this is kangaroo.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  This is crazy.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  This is incredibly dangerous.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  Meanwhile, great again, consumer confidence soars.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  Home prices reach all time high.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Economy beats expectations.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  Get Trump out of there as fast as we can.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  And we've got the Swap King, America born, 1776, July 4th.
[23:27.000 --> 23:35.000]  America dies, 2017, 2018, if Mueller is successful.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  And they're able to have some kangaroo indictment,
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  they're able to have Congress then impeach the president
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  and remove him.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  They intend, and they've said they are,
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  going to then overturn the last election,
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  remove all the Republicans that got elected,
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  put rhinos in and create basically a one-party state
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  where the Republicans are only a southern state area.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.000]  That's been their plan.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Instead, it's been reversed.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  The Republican libertarian movement's taking over
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  and the Democrats are becoming a coastal elite party
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  and even losing those areas.
[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  So a dying authoritarian group, arrogant and used to power,
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  is being removed.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  They've been caught doing what they accused myself,
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  Tucker Carlson, and countless others of,
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  Senator Paul of being Russian agents
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  for pointing out their narratives of fraud.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  Now the Podesta's law firm is threatening to sue
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  Tucker Carlson and Fox News for reporting on
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  their Uranium One deals.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  So it's on.
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  And if Mueller is successful, it will set up,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  like has happened in many third world countries,
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  the federal police as the new dictators.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  Now we saw this in Rome during the decline of the Roman Empire.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  The Praetorian Guard or the federal police,
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  as they were in Rome, began overthrowing Caesars.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  So even the dictators or the hereditary dictators
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  were being overthrown and then whoever was more favorable
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  to the federal police who wore dark blue robes,
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  is where the police blue comes from.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  The Praetorian Guard, whoever was favorable with them
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  and some of the main legions that were obviously exploratory
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  to the Empire, they would overthrow the patricians.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  They would overthrow the gentry class.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  They would throw over the royalty.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then pretty soon things just degenerated
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  and fell into rack and ruin and then outside forces
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  were able to sack the Western Roman Empire
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  in 410 with the Visigoth Chiefs in Alaric.
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  And then it moved to the Eastern Empire,
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  what was Constantinople, that later fell to the Muslims.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's now Istanbul.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  Now that's just some history, but this man would be
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Praetorian Emperor of our Republic
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  and would mark the end of the Republic
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  and a new bureaucratic Praetorian
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  who could commit any crimes they want
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  because they're above the law,
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  judge, jury and executioner, judge dread.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  An arrogant, sickening, evil man
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  delivering uranium on tarmacs,
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  just in 10 companies, completely criminal,
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  investing no money, getting millions back
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  with Russian companies on the payroll.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  And so they've got to put this on us
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  because we're trying to restore the Republic,
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  trying to make the country great again and delivering.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  And they're like werewolves shot by a silver bullet.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  They're like Count Dracula being drugged out of his keep
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  at high noon and his coffin being thrown open.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  The sunshine of freedom and Americana becoming popular again
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.000]  and our will not being broken and being proud
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  and having success and moving forward
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  and rejecting the poison of globalism.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  The psychological warfare of the New World Order,
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  it is bringing the country back like defibrillators,
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  bring back a dying heart, a heart that stopped beating
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  and they don't know what to do.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  They are panicked, they are scared,
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  they are running for the hills
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  and they put everything they can into Robert Mueller
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  who would be the first king of America.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  King George III, when the United States
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  accepted their surrender deal,
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  said that George Washington was the greatest living man
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  in the world.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  And when George Washington a year later
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  refused the kingship of the colonies
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  from the majority of Americans that wanted to make him king,
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  King George put a proclamation in the newspapers
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  saying, I'm glad I said that because it's true,
[27:52.000 --> 27:59.000]  George Washington is the greatest living man
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  because no one ever turned down kingship,
[28:03.000 --> 28:08.000]  no one, no one in the contemporary history
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  and before that and basically since then
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  because he wanted to go back to his farm,
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  he wanted to launch the republic,
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  he wanted to empower the average people
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  and that's why they attacked him for the ideas he had
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  didn't mean he even implemented it at all
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  but because of being such a trailblazer.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  And now we have the sycophant nobodies like Robert Mueller
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  who would be the king.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  He is now the king of the swamp.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  The leader of the Democratic Party was McCain
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  but his brain tumor slowed him down.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  Now all their hopes and dreams are on the swamp king.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  The literal swamp king creature come to kill America.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Robert Mueller.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, pray that the good lord
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  will set him straight.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  Robert Mueller is attempting to kill the republic.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Hey Daniel Bremen, why new manna storeable foods?

[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  Concentrate.
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  Next level compared to whey.
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  It's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  It's incredible.
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  My son is growing like a weed using it.

[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless.
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  We're bold.
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  Because we understand the stakes are too high.
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  The globalists win.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  We're all slaves.
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.

[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  This essential mineral is necessary
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  in order to produce thyroid hormones
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  which influence every cell, tissue,
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  and organ in the body.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones,
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  you may experience slow metabolism,
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.

[33:25.000 --> 33:34.000]  The veil is being lifted.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  We're getting a good look at what was inside our government
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  breeding under the floorboards
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  for a very long time.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  And it is nasty.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  But the new season of awakening,
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  the new season of the truths being revealed
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  is upon us a chance for humanity
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  to really get itself ready
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  for the challenge of AI,
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  the singularity,
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  and so many other big changes.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  We're deciding right now whether we're going to make it.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  We're getting that big gulp of air
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  to steady ourselves
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  before we walk out into the arena
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  and face the next level.
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  But we're going to be awake and conscious at that point.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  And so the challenges are going to be exponentially harder,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  but we're going to be exponentially more ready.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  People obsess themselves with sports and diversions
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  and think that they're enjoying themselves
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  and getting ahead in life
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  by basically being involved
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  with a primitive form of virtual reality
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  with things that don't matter.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  But if you return Americana and the Renaissance
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  and free open ideas,
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  it will empower society so greatly
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  and will empower you so greatly.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  It's unstoppable.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.000]  That's why they try to divert you.
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  The true promise of America is within our grasp.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  Just 10 months in,
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  he's only gotten a few of the things done he wanted.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  And already, great again, consumer confidence sores.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  Home prices reach all-time high.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  Economy beats expectations.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  It is, my friends,
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  an amazing time to be alive.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  But Lindsey Graham comes out,
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  even though Trump has said he's not going to fire Mueller,
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  and he says, if you do, boy, you're in big trouble.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  Well, what is Congress doing, Mr. Graham,
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  for special counsels or special investigations
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  or hearings about Mueller?
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  The uranium one, all the corruption, the 10 companies
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  where he'd make no investment when the bylaws
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  said you had to invest $10 million in one of the companies.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  The others were like five, six, seven million.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  And they just go, oh, you're just on our board now.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  Thank you. Here's money every year.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  Classic payoffs by foreign Russian companies.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  So he did the investigation into uranium one.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  So he covered up real Russian espionage
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  of our strategic weapons grade uranium.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  Doesn't get any more spy thriller than that.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  And that arrogant swamp thing
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  with their matching suits and matching ties,
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  like a bunch of schoolgirls when they walk in
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  to Congress and places,
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  I was scared everybody was like, oh, it's the FBI.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  Because that's the sycophantic government
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  that sees him as king.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  That's the Victorian guard. That's the God.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  That's the man that would bring them to Valhalla
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  and end checks and balances
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  and end anybody being able to block them.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  Those horrible voters, they voted in Trump
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  and the country's coming back
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  and they're getting in trouble
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  and their pedophile rings are getting busted everywhere
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  and they're getting caught selling us out to foreign governments.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  What are they going to do?
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  Mueller, he'll fix it, Mueller.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  Oh, it was going to be McCain.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  The Democrats basically said he was the head of their party,
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  but he got that nasty brain tumor.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  Fast growing type. A little gift from God.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  And then, oh, but Lindsey, the compromised,
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  compromised individual here, let's hear from Fox News
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.000]  and Lindsey Graham threatening the president.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  The president gets in, the leftovers from the Obama administration
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.000]  are there, should have fired all of them, didn't?
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  Only fired 40-something.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  The Clintons fired what, 93 of 100?
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  Should have fired every stinking one of them.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Can't trust any of them from the Bushes, Clinton, Obama.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  Fire them all. Didn't do it.
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  And boy, those swamp creatures launched a special council
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  from day one that is basically a Russian operative.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  So let's hear Lindsey Graham and his threat.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  Do you support this piece of legislation that would protect Mueller, though,
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  that would stop the president?
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  Since I introduced it, yes, I would support it,
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  but I have zero concern that Mr. Mueller is in jeopardy of losing his job.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  I see no reason for him to be dismissed
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  and the only reason you could do it is for cause
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  and for some effort to do it without a good reason,
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  they'd be wholly ill to pay, so I'm not...
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  Okay, so even major liberal publications are having to admit,
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  even CNN admits, Mueller's broke the law,
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  he's broken search warrants, he's swat team with guns,
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  even though all the documents have been given over by Manafort and others.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  He killed criminal investigations that the FBI was doing
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  into uranium-1 when they had them red-handed, on and on and on.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  And then the guy that he basically put in power,
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  Comey, his little minion, lied to Congress repeatedly,
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  lied about classified documents, lied about what was in the memo,
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  the presidential memo, was the person illegally leaking information.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  He goes, oh, I didn't leak it, I gave it to a professor to leak it.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  They'd be lucky if I was a mafia don,
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  and I ordered one of my captains to order a soldier to go kill somebody,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  to shoot him five times that a gas station say,
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  and then they catch me on tape ordering,
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  I want you to go and tell him to take care of that thing right now.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  I don't want him to be breathing air,
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  and within a week, I want him taken care of.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  Is that clear? Kill that SOB.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  A week later, he's dead, they got a recording of me saying it,
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  and I go, oh, listen here, I didn't do the killing.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Some soldier I'd never even met in another city did it.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  And did I give the order to my captain to tell, I did do that.
[39:31.000 --> 39:32.000]  It's the same thing.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  Oh, I just leak the info to professors and people,
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.000]  and then they give it to the press.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  Oh, we see.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  It'd be like if you were running child kidnapping or something,
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  you know, you don't actually have sex with the kids, Comey,
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  you just make money off of it, so it's okay, right?
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  Because you don't actually, you know,
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  get there with the dirty mattresses and rape the kids, right?
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  We understand.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  And as I told all of you months ago,
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  all the pedophile stuff's coming out now, all of it.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  You could have just let Trump arrest all the pedophiles
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  and deal with them, but instead it's going to be political now,
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  and it's all going to come out.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  And let me tell you, by the end of this year,
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  they're going to be 30, 40, 50 top Hollywood stars you're going to learn
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  that haven't just been having sex with 12-year-olds and 14-year-olds,
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  but with five-year-olds, you're going to learn,
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  and then it's going to come out about snuff films,
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  about little girls they killed.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  And I hope you all enjoy it,
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  because you want to fight, you better believe,
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  you got one, we're not taking it lying down,
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  you're going to get it.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  And that's why you're so scared.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  That's good, that's good.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  That's what we're going to get you.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  You understand that? Good, I know you do.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  You're going to burn for what you've done.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  You're going to burn good and burn long.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  So I'm going to tell you again, get out of the way,
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  get out of the way, get out of the way,
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  because you can't turn loose of it.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  You want to run the country in the ground.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  You want to dominate it.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  You've always hated America.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  That's why globalists put people like them in charge,
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  because they hate the country.
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  They will energetically go out of their way to ruin the nation.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  Even though they can make 10 times more money,
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  on average, Wall Street banks have made their biggest profits
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  ever made, but they're unanimously against Trump,
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  even though he's shoveling success at them
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  through their own system to the people,
[41:17.000 --> 41:21.000]  because they don't want you getting nothing.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  That's their policy.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  And they are so angry, because they want you super poor
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  so their money's worth 10 times more.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  They don't want wealth and power.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  They want to rule you and run your life.
[41:30.000 --> 41:35.000]  That's why it's an act of war against them
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  when you buy products at infowarstore.com.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  And when you buy products from globalists,
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  You go to infowarstore.com
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  and get game-changing, amazing products.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's been sold out of DNA force for almost four months,
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  because the ingredients are nutraceutical grade,
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  It's been sold out for almost four months.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  It's 25% off.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  The truck got in this morning.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  It was offloading when I pulled up.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  And it's back, but it is a limited run,
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  It's the highest quality.
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  infowarslife.com.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  It is amazing.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  We also have been sold out for three months
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  on biome defense, super high quality probiotic.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates, back in stock,
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  but for a very limited time.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Because we're held to the very, very highest scrutiny
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  of passing California testing, as everybody knows.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  And even with our test, the big firms show it's passing.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  There's obviously firms out there, some saying it doesn't,
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  even though nobody can basically pass it.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  We're really, really proud of it.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  DNA force and biome defense, probiotic.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  Now back in stock, infowarslife.com.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  It is an act of war.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  It is an act of standing up when you spread the links,
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  the articles and buy products from us.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special
[43:00.000 --> 43:04.000]  we've ever had for our best selling product, Brainforce.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.000]  here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.000]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[43:27.000 --> 43:30.000]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up,
[43:30.000 --> 43:31.000]  they know how great it is.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known,
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  and if you want good, clean, focused energy,
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  then Brainforce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  It's a good deal at $39.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  It's $19.96 at InfowarsLife.com
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  or simply call toll free,
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  three things that will save you a lot of money
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout,
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.000]  we give you 10% off on your order at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  Just go to InfowarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products,
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  and with the new auto ship feature at InfowarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  10% off on auto ship, win, win, win at InfowarsLife.com
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  free shipping on orders above $50.
[44:53.000 --> 45:08.000]  And all auto stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.000]  Natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand selected for their oral health benefits.
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  Super blue, fluoride free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  Xylitol, nano silver and iodine.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  Notice the difference with our super blue fluoride free products.
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  That's InfowarsStore.com.
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  Why is this so good?
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[46:17.000 --> 46:22.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[46:28.000 --> 46:29.000]  These are all parasites.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  You have the neem in there.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose.
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[46:55.000 --> 47:16.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[47:25.000 --> 47:31.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[47:31.000 --> 47:40.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:40.000 --> 47:45.000]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Let me plow into the pedophile news.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  A new giant chapter every single day.
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  Corey Feldman has come out in very powerful testimony with Matt Lauer.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  The clip's coming up later. It's on infowars.com.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  And said, listen, I've gone to the police for years.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  I wrote a book. They blocked it.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  Now I'm trying to make a film.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  And he said, I'm getting ready to name the names.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  They're not going to be able to stop me.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  He got arrested on marijuana charges last week.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  Somebody tried to run him over the car.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  Now a bunch of the women that have said Weinstein raped him,
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  they've all suddenly been arrested in LA.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  So I've got a stack of news on that front.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  So make no mistake, the pedophile empire is striking back.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  You're like, wait a minute, the cops are busting pedophiles,
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  but then cops are also arresting people.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  There's good cops and bad cops. That's how it works.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  There are more good cops and bad cops, obviously.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  That's why you see the record arrest of pedophiles.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  And they're sticking their necks out there to do that.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  And this is what's happening.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  That's Rose McGowan's one of them.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  It's been arrested.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  We're showing the courage. You're showing the courage.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  We're all showing the courage.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  And then everybody knows this is the season to come out against
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  the men raping women, the men raping men,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  the men and women raping children,
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  and the occultism and all of it.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  And so humanity is awakening and finding its courage again.
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.000]  To counter that the last few years, we've seen NAMBLO,
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  we've seen the UN, we've seen the New York Times,
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  we've seen Salon Magazine repeatedly,
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  come out and say pedophilia is not a big deal.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  Because as the left gets more and more decadent
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  and more and more soulless and more and more lost,
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  they need something that's new and bad and exciting.
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  And some new area they want to complain about.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  NAMBLO would like to be able to come to your house,
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  this is what they told the UN officially,
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  and demand your five-year-old son or daughter
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  come out on a date with them.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  And that your son or daughter has the right
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  to accept their advances.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  Now that'd be given them alcohol, drugs, I guess anything.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  I mean California now is saying they can give vaccines
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  to your 11-year-old if they say they want the vaccine,
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  even the parents don't.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  So they're getting rid of the age of consent,
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  they're getting rid of the children being your children,
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  you being their guardian,
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  and they're making the big leftist hordes,
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  basically the guardians.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  And so that's why I believe this is a real video
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  and a real photo on infowars.com.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Mike Cernovich banned from speaking along with many others.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  There at Berkeley he went to Columbia,
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  they said we welcome for a speech.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  The Antifa crowd showed up, they look like meth heads,
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  they're wearing the normal uniforms they wear,
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  the same type of outfits,
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  they have a bunch of stage-managed signs, like they normally do,
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  saying no rape apologists at Columbia,
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  end apartheid at Columbia,
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  drop the investigation of students protesting white supremacy,
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  no rape apologists on campus, because they say,
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  all sex with a man and woman's rape,
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  and it's a woman here,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  but she's holding the sign along with other Antifa
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  that are wearing the normal gear they wear,
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  right down the little backpacks,
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  you know, have the old-fashioned car seatbelt fasteners,
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  I mean, they've got it down,
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  and it says no white supremacy, no pedobashing,
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  no Mike Cernovich,
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  and it is part of the Antifa movement
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  to have sex with children.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  All the members aren't involved,
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  they're into being scummy, they're into being scuzzy,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  so if people want to claim this is fake with no evidence,
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  when they're there marching with it and reading it,
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  knowing what it is,
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  it shows what soulless followers they are,
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  or they did it on purpose,
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  which I believe they did.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  Nambla is a big organization, they're part of the UN,
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  they've been accepted as an official NGO
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  when people like the John Birch Society haven't been,
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  so they can, you know, spy on the UN.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  They throw Lord Monkton out,
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  with it with science and public policy, but Nambla can't.
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  So, when all these big companies sexualize children,
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  Nickelodeon sexualizes children,
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  and Disney and Viacom hire convicted pedophiles
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  to run children's shows and children's movies,
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  and when Harvey Weinstein hires convicted rapists
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  of 12-year-old boys to make movies with children in them,
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  and all this happens,
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  and Kevin Spacey apologizes for trying to rape a 14-year-old.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  I mean, is all that made up too? No.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  And when it turns out the Prime Minister of England
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  liked to kill kids, not just rape them,
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  or that the top royal advisor, Jimmy Savelle,
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  was killing children and delivering them
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  to be sexually raped before they were executed.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  No, it's all real.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  One telegraph reported two years ago that
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.000]  it's now a national security threat controlled by MI6,
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  and it appears that the entire upper echelon of the government,
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  our pedophiles, are know about it and use it to compromise people.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  It is the coming of age, it is the right of passage,
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  it is the initiation ceremony to commit a horrible crime.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  You're like, wait a minute,
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  the mafia makes you kill somebody to be a member,
[52:45.000 --> 52:49.000]  or other gangs make you commit a crime before they trust you.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Rob a liquor store, rob an old lady,
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  the worst the group, the more heinous.
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  This is the ultimate mafia, and it isn't just raping kids.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  You don't get into the deepest levels
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  until you like to murder children.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Murder children.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  So, let's play the video of Columbia where they're protesting,
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  saying no, no, no free speech,
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  with a sign leading their march,
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  no white supremacy, no Pito bashing, no Mike Sernovich.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  And they're there with the sign, they're leading it,
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  and you can see how dead their eyes are and how weird they are.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  This is, this is antitha.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  I mean, this, this, this is them, that they did this.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  And are we surprised?
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  No, quite frankly not.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  Did all of them know?
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  Certainly not.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  But this is who the leaders are
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  and how they want to move the Overton window
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  and how they want to condition you
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  and how they want to break your will.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  Here's the video.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  South Street!
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  Hold up!
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  South Street!
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  Who's street?
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  South Street!
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  Who's street?
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  South Street!
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  Who's street?
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  South Street!
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  Hold up!
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  South Street!
[53:49.000 --> 53:50.000]  Who's street?
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  South Street!
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  Who's street?
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  South Street!
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  Now again, if you know about communist or antitha,
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  or by any means necessary, Black Lives Matter,
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  they're all run by sorrows groups
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  or subsorrow groups, Ford Foundation,
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.720]  and
[54:01.720 --> 54:06.860]  They're all completely programmed. They always have centralized signs. They're not allowed to talk to anybody
[54:06.880 --> 54:08.880]  They have certain chance they do
[54:09.720 --> 54:15.400]  And when you see them leading their group of about 50 with this big sign, there's other videos of it
[54:15.400 --> 54:17.880]  It appears to be the leaders of it with it
[54:18.840 --> 54:23.200]  So this is them organized you try to get in their crowd. They don't know who you are. They kick you out
[54:23.200 --> 54:26.160]  they're a cult this is and it says Nambla and
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  resist and
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.200]  the
[54:31.200 --> 54:36.840]  Antifa and you get into the Antifa's chat rooms you go to their message boards pedophilia is
[54:37.600 --> 54:39.600]  their favorite thing and
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.600]  it's men in dresses
[54:42.200 --> 54:47.280]  with AK-47 saying they're gonna kill you and saying we've got your kids and
[54:48.440 --> 54:51.680]  Again, they're into being the scum of the earth
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.480]  We've gone out and shown Antifa in Austin where they say I kill my kids
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.440]  I love to get pregnant so I can kill more babies and I love Satan and I'm ugly and I stink and I have hair under my
[55:02.440 --> 55:09.320]  Arms and then you go to the Capitol and they catch a prayer group trying to ban partial burnt abortion and suddenly women in business suits go
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.800]  Satan will tell you kill the baby. I love you
[55:17.480 --> 55:24.200]  Satan they're not trying to freak you out. It's real and then you see other women are in the group
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.840]  Suddenly go and like it like grabs them. I mean, this is like the exorcist folks. This is real. Okay
[55:30.440 --> 55:34.040]  That we should probably play those clips. I didn't tell you guys to queue them up
[55:34.040 --> 55:35.600]  but if you can find the
[55:35.600 --> 55:42.320]  The abortion teams the name of one of the videos or communist attack Alex Jones and they came with black tarps
[55:42.960 --> 55:47.960]  To cover our signs just like they didn't in in Columbia University
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.400]  They want to block free speech their anti-free speech and they say I'm ugly. I stink. I love Satan
[55:53.400 --> 55:55.400]  I kill my kids
[55:55.600 --> 56:00.120]  So just whatever is evil communism murder death Satanism
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.360]  This is what they're into and the guys looking his lips going up paid for hundreds of abortions
[56:05.360 --> 56:07.840]  I just love to get women pregnant kill babies
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.880]  Because it's a sacrifice center
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.120]  It's a sacrifice center and so many of these big abortion clinics
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.120]  They keep busting the doctors taking babies home or keeping them alive
[56:20.120 --> 56:26.560]  So they can run in the back room and then have sacrifice drink the blood and have sex on top the baby
[56:26.560 --> 56:30.400]  And I don't want to be so gross here, but law enforcement knows that and they've been caught
[56:30.400 --> 56:36.280]  They've been busted a bunch. I'm not saying this group. These are just Renfield low-level minions, but they've busted major doctors
[56:36.280 --> 56:39.800]  It's been in the news conducting ceremonies keeping the babies alive
[56:39.960 --> 56:46.280]  Hell they keep my life to harvest their body parts and then they also use them to heat the hospitals again any way to
[56:46.280 --> 56:54.200]  Desecrate the human flesh any way to desecrate God's creation anything to target the image of God anything for them to
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.360]  Absolutely engage in abominations the genetic engineering the vaccines to brain damage you it's all to brain damage you
[57:02.440 --> 57:07.200]  So that you can then enter into this yet. They're playing the women saying I love Satan hell Satan there it is
[57:07.200 --> 57:09.560]  It's all in the videos again. You know watch it for yourself
[57:10.120 --> 57:13.920]  This is the reality and you just have to get to the point where you realize
[57:13.920 --> 57:19.560]  You're not a devil worshipper. You're not a satanist. You're not a pedophile. You can't imagine why they're this way
[57:20.280 --> 57:24.160]  Because they love death all those that hate me love death said Christ
[57:25.320 --> 57:27.800]  Kill steal and destroy there is Planned Parenthood
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.480]  Lamborghini lady negotiates harvested baby parts
[57:31.840 --> 57:38.300]  Crises in video and then there's dozens of these videos and they get off on it's always with wine and they talk about the babies
[57:38.300 --> 57:39.800]  They go hold on
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.600]  Goblet I want it's not the money. It's a it's a ritual. Yeah, I've got the baby

[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:36.720]  Antifa sign really was printed by them and that they really do support pito behavior
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:43.320]  They said but who printed the sign saying no pito bashing, you know Walmart won't print Confederate flags
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:46.680]  general Kelly's in trouble for saying that
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:52.040]  Robert E. Lee was an honorable man. They wanted him to be the he was the head of West Point
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.720]  They wanted him to be the head of the Northern Army
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.600]  And he didn't get in the war at the first so the North committed war crimes
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:02.880]  And then he led the South nothing to do with slavery like he said slavery was a horrible thing and tried to get rid of it decades before
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:08.960]  But again reality doesn't matter meanwhile no pito bashing
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:18.640]  Who prints signs for Nambla Nambla is accepted in the UN the John Birch Society and Lord Monkton and other groups aren't
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:26.080]  That's their agenda. We keep telling you that's their agenda and you notice now it keeps coming out the deputy pope has been busted
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:35.440]  It just goes on and on and on and now Harvey Weinstein underage and now Kevin Spacey didn't deny

[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:06.960]  You cannot make this up type into the search engine Kevin Spacey

[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.040]  It's incredible

[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:42.440]  Kevin Spacey's father was Nazi child rapist who hated Jews and sexually abused his own son for years and their mother knew
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:45.400]  Claims actors brother and this is how the pedophiles
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:50.360]  Reproduce they don't have children. They abuse your children wreck them
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:57.960]  Bring them into the child pedocult and then teach them how to lure in children how to control it how to threaten people how to be fake
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:03.320]  How to be a good actor how to get the kids in the ice cream truck?
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:06.360]  Because I think if you investigate
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:13.160]  People's parents and who Hollywood brings in look at that psycho. I've always said Kevin Spacey is a total psychopath. I
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:19.840]  Mean just look at that there is nothing home there except fake confidence just like Hillary Clinton here
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:23.240]  Let me do a fake psychopath face for you. I can do it all day long. I just won't I refuse to do it
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:26.520]  Hey, how's it going?
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  You bet
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:36.600]  Yeah, I'm confident got Kevin Spacey
[1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:46.800]  Yes, I'm killing Spacey. I love the children and I love Hollywood and we're the mark of
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:53.440]  Liberalism and of culture. We're gonna run the arts and Nickelodeon and MTV is gonna teach your children
[1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:57.200]  And because she was gonna teach her children how to worship Satan
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:01.200]  Now to wear teeth around her neck how to cut yourself
[1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:09.600]  Cut yourself for Satan show Satan how much you want to die and how much you hate Jesus and how much you love your mommy
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:18.480]  I'm Kevin Spacey playing a tough guy psychopath when all I've ever done is really been daddy's little boy
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:26.600]  Yeah, he caught me how to do it and I'm gonna do it a lot and there's nothing you're gonna do about it
[1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:34.880]  Cuz I'm Kevin Spacey. Oh, I forgot he's in a new video
[1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:43.160]  Kevin Spacey's in a new video for the Clinton Foundation, which is a known child kidnapping operation
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:49.720]  Oh, they're so liberal though when they get your children in those basements

[1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:58.520]  I don't think so
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  I f**king love Facebook
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  How do you get your abortion speed?
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:10.520]  I pay for this
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:12.520]  I thought you paid for it
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.520]  Upwards of 50
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:16.520]  Really?
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.520]  Oh yeah
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  F**k you you piece of f**king s**t
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.520]  Bunch of misogynistic motherf**ker
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  Take your male privilege somewhere else
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.520]  What about you being aggressive?
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.520]  What about us?
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:30.520]  What about us?
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:34.520]  These stats and guys that attack Alex Jones
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:48.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:54.520]  Shepard Ambelis is our guest for the rest of the hour
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:56.520]  I've known you for good 10 years or so
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  He'll promote some of the films that you and Jason Burmes have put out
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.520]  But I wanted to get him in studio
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.520]  Because he's a fellow Austinite
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  Because he at intelhub.com has laid out just the incredible story of what really happened in Vegas and the cover-up
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:17.520]  I myself have information from sources that I'm not at liberty to talk about
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:19.520]  Unfortunately, I've been involved with lawyers
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:23.520]  I've been involved with witnesses
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:25.520]  I was going to leave it at that
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.520]  I had to sign nondisclosures
[1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:31.520]  So let's just say I know a lot more about Vegas than we even have so far said
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:35.520]  And I'm a journalist, I wear that hat when I'm not being a pundit or ranting
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.520]  And so if I say I'm not going to talk about something when somebody gives me intel
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:41.520]  If I'm not allowed to at a later point, I won't
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.520]  But let me tell you
[1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:45.520]  What happened a month ago, happened on October 1st
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:47.520]  A month ago, exactly
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:53.520]  And it's got all the telltale marks of antifa slash ISIS connections
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:08:55.520]  Gun running, you name it, all the nexus point
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:08:59.520]  Our law enforcement sources told us there were multiple shooters
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:01.520]  And that he had been, had visitors
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:03.520]  And he'd been at the hotel longer
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:05.520]  And all the things that have come out now
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.520]  That there was antifa literature that he traveled to the Middle East
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:09.520]  I said that October 2nd
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:11.520]  And then later it all came out
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:13.520]  There's a huge cover-up
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:15.520]  They admit there's a cover-up
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:17.520]  The timelines are all different
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:19.520]  But Shepard has dug into this
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.520]  At intelhub.com
[1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:25.520]  His stories on infowars.com have been linked by Drudge
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:29.520]  And have really helped expose the fact that we're being lied to
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:31.520]  We know we're being lied to
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:33.520]  Shepard, but up front
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:35.520]  Your best analysis
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:37.520]  Your best theories, we know we're being lied to
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:39.520]  But your best theories on what could be going on
[1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:41.520]  Because this is still open
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:43.520]  To give us any motive
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:45.520]  And then get into some of the other new anomalies
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:47.520]  And things that are just so bombshell
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:49.520]  Thanks for joining us
[1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:51.520]  Absolutely, Alex
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:53.520]  It looks like a
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:55.520]  The same type of operation that we saw
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:57.520]  During 9-11
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:59.520]  We're seeing some anomalies
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:01.520]  In the flight data
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:03.520]  In the radar data
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:05.520]  We also know
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:07.520]  That there was at least
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:09.520]  Some kind of preparedness drill
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:11.520]  Going on at the hospital
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.520]  Over there
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:15.520]  And
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:17.520]  I have not totally confirmed that there was
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:19.520]  A drill going on at the Route
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:21.520]  9-1 Harvest
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:23.520]  Music Festival
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:25.520]  What about ambulances 8-10s of a mile away
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.520]  By the dozens at least 15
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:29.520]  Loading people and stretchers out of Hooters
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:31.520]  Absolutely, multiple shooters
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:33.520]  Multiple locations
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:35.520]  And we've had all the acoustic excel teams
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:37.520]  Six leaders
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:39.520]  Delta Force, acoustics experts
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:41.520]  There's two different types of farms
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:43.520]  Overlapping, it's not echoes
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:45.520]  Absolutely, and what we're looking at now
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:47.520]  Is all the flight records
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:49.520]  We're looking at communications
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.520]  That the local airport tower had
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:53.520]  Where they
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:55.520]  Literally said that there was shooters
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.520]  Plural on the runway
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:10:59.520]  On the airport property
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.520]  That they were trying to round up
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.520]  These flight records are really interesting
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:05.520]  If
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:07.520]  You can
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.520]  Scroll down
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:11.520]  If you can look at all these videos
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:13.520]  If you people out there
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.520]  Looking into these videos
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.520]  You're noticing things, you're seeing things
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.520]  If you really take a look at these flight records
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:21.520]  They're really revealing
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:23.520]  Between 9-40
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:25.520]  And 9-41pm
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:27.520]  That night, October 1st
[1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:29.520]  Three Airbus EC-130 helicopters
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:31.520]  They're owned by
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:33.520]  Musting, Leasing, LLC
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:35.520]  Not
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:37.520]  Saying anyone's involved in anything
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:39.520]  I'm just reporting on what happened
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:41.520]  They took off from their
[1:11:41.520 --> 1:11:43.520]  Location at 6075
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:45.520]  South Las Vegas Boulevard
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:47.520]  Which is also a Maverick
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:49.520]  Helicopters location
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:51.520]  Musting helicopters
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:53.520]  Musting Leasing
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.520]  Maverick Helicopters
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:57.520]  Maverick Aviation Group
[1:11:57.520 --> 1:11:59.520]  They're all connected
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:01.520]  This company owns about
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:03.520]  7 of these EcoStar
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.520]  E-130
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:07.520]  Aircraft
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:09.520]  About 20 of them are in Vegas
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:11.520]  They run tours around
[1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.520]  And you're bringing them up
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:15.520]  We're not saying they're involved
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:17.520]  People did report firing out of helicopters
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:19.520]  Exactly, so it's important
[1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:21.520]  These helicopters took off at 9-40
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  They headed north, they looped around
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.520]  There was a group of three of them
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:27.520]  They cost $3.2 million each
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:29.520]  They employ quiet technology
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:31.520]  Just saying
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:33.520]  Coincidentally, they came into
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:35.520]  A hover just over by the
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:37.520]  Mandalay about
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.520]  9.50pm
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:41.520]  That's 15 minutes before the shooting
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:43.520]  Now, where they went
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:45.520]  Into a hover at is
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:47.520]  Exactly, if you were at the
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:49.520]  Route 91 venue
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.520]  And you were looking over
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:53.520]  Toward the Mandalay Bay
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:55.520]  Toward the Delano Towers
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:57.520]  You were looking in between those towers
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:12:59.520]  You would see
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:01.520]  Just right in between those towers
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:03.520]  These helicopters literally came to
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:05.520]  A hover at 10-10
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:07.520]  Right in that sliver
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:09.520]  And then their transponders went
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:11.520]  Dark
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:13.520]  Now
[1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:15.520]  Coincidentally
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:17.520]  The shooting I've checked into this
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:19.520]  I've grabbed video
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:21.520]  People I have over
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:23.520]  400 hours
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:25.520]  Maybe near 500 hours
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.520]  Into this shooting
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:29.520]  Investigation already
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:31.520]  By the way, that's why you're here
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:33.520]  You've been the most prolific
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:35.520]  You've broken so much of it
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:37.520]  And it just goes on and on
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.520]  The lying saying he didn't check in
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:41.520]  Three days before, then he did
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:43.520]  We broke that
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.520]  Shooting inside the hotel
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:47.520]  Other hotels, dozens of witnesses
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.520]  And now a bunch of witnesses have died
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.520]  Yeah
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:53.520]  28-year-old women, couples
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.520]  Were these helicopters stopped
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:57.520]  These three helicopters stopped in this
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.520]  Very
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:01.520]  Key airspace area
[1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:03.520]  They actually hovered right over the roof
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:05.520]  Of part of the Mandalay
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:07.520]  Over by that aquarium
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.520]  There's this little oval shaped
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:11.520]  Roof section that they were hovering over
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:13.520]  Now their transponders went dark
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:15.520]  Now the shooting did start
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:17.520]  At 10-10-5pm
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:19.520]  Like they said
[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.520]  The helicopters come back later
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:23.520]  Listen now, these helicopters went dark
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:25.520]  I think that they may have stayed there
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:27.520]  In a hover
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:29.520]  Through the duration of the shooting
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.520]  There's actually
[1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:33.520]  You can see this on video
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:35.520]  And I can show you guys where you can find this
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:37.520]  I'm sure they were just watching the concert
[1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:39.520]  But we should talk to them as witnesses
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:41.520]  Whoever was on those
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:43.520]  Helicopters should come forward
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:45.520]  Exactly, people are having trouble
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:47.520]  Getting anything out of this helicopter company
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:49.520]  Now the FAA
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:51.520]  And the company that logs the
[1:14:51.520 --> 1:14:53.520]  Flight data says they have no explanation
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:55.520]  For this next aircraft that I'm going to tell you about
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.520]  So those three aircraft went dark
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:14:59.520]  Now
[1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:01.520]  At 10-22
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:03.520]  An airliner
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:05.520]  Masking itself as Southwest Airlines
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:07.520]  Flight 4119
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:09.520]  We know this is a
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:11.520]  Helicopter
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.520]  Masking itself as an airliner
[1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:15.520]  That's not suspicious
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:17.520]  This radar blip appeared just south of the Mandalay
[1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:19.520]  At
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:21.520]  At
[1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:23.520]  9
[1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:25.520]  Or at 10-22
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.520]  PM
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:29.520]  Stay there, we're going to come back
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:31.520]  And if you're a TV viewer, you can see all these graphs and everything
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:33.520]  Science and technology is amazing
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:35.520]  We have recordings by the FAA of all of this
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:37.520]  And we're just looking at anomalies
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:39.520]  Because this is an open case
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:41.520]  And trying to talk to the witnesses
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.520]  And I wonder why this stuff really never happens
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:45.520]  Unless it's 9-11 or something like this
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.520]  But if you're a big transponder
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:49.520]  These are a lot of times federal crimes
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:51.520]  So we just want to find out exactly why there were so many glitches
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:16:17.520]  And hopefully talk to the folks that were witnesses
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:25.520]  And get your body armor today while you still can
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.520]  This is Michael David from Seattle
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:29.520]  I'm 51 years old and 6 months ago
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:31.520]  I started taking Andro 400
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.520]  To increase my testosterone
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:35.520]  Since then I've lost 35 pounds of fat
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:37.520]  My waist went from size 38 to size 32
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:39.520]  I have more energy
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.520]  And I look and feel 20 years younger
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:43.520]  And now my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:45.520]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:47.520]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:51.520]  I lost 13 pounds and my waist went from 36 to 33
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:53.520]  That was 8 years ago
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:55.520]  I continue to take Andro 400
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:57.520]  And I've maintained my weight at 172
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:59.520]  Gained muscle and energy
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:23.520]  I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years

[3:00:31.520 --> 3:00:35.520]  Kyle Chapman, how did you get that to handle?
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:41.520]  Well, Alex, I didn't choose the name while I was in jail after the first battle of Berkeley.
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  My video of me defending myself and other participants at the March 4th rally went viral.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:01:03.520]  And I became known as Bay Stick Man. I guess some people on 4chan or 8chan coined the term. We really don't know exactly where it came from. It's somewhere out there in the web.
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:17.520]  Well, that's your name now. Again, people should support you. I love the fact that you're selling t-shirts to support yourself. That way you promote freedom, promote free speech, what they hate while help funding yourself. Tell folks how they get the t-shirt.
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:29.520]  Yeah, you can go to GruntWorks, Bay Stick Man store, and you can purchase a whole line of t-shirts, everything from anti-antifa t-shirts to t-shirts with my image on it.
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:37.520]  And you'd be supporting myself and GruntWorks, which is a veteran-owned and run company.
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:40.520]  I like the Texas flag stuff. What's going on there?
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:52.520]  Okay, so both my parents are from Texas. We've been there for multiple generations. They're an evil Texas transplant. So LA and San Francisco are invading Texas. I guess you've invaded them.
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:56.520]  So that's what's wrong with you.
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:13.520]  I consider myself a Tex-a-Fornian. So I lived about a decade in Texas. I summered out there with my cousins and my uncles growing up as a kid in the Dallas and the Houston and the Fort Worth area.
[3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:22.520]  My family helped settle Dallas. My mom's side of the family was fought in the Alamo. And then my great uncles on her side all worked for Willie Nelson.
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:33.520]  I grew up going to the Perdon Alice Country Club as a kid. I met Willie several times. So yeah, I consider myself a Texan first, Californian second.
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:41.520]  Yeah, back in the old days, the old Perdon Alice Country Club. That was hardly anybody at that thing. You say Perdon Alice Country Club. That was just that little place over there.
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:44.520]  Yeah, over there near Beeville. I used to go there.
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:46.520]  Yeah, it's a little inside baseball right there.
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:56.520]  Yeah, my uncle Bobby lived on that. My great uncle Bobby lived on that country club for well over 10 years. Willie took really good care of him when he was old and sick and suffering.
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:02:59.520]  Yeah, that's Willie's little country club over there.
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:03.520]  Yeah. Yeah, good people, man. Love Willie.
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:06.520]  He only built Luck, Texas later. You ever been to Luck, Texas?
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:07.520]  I have not.
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:18.520]  Let's just something on his property, you know, his 400 acre piece probably right there on the country club and on Lake Travis. And then he bought a bunch of old churches and old real western town stuff.
[3:03:18.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  They were, you know, from ghost towns. So he brought ghost towns there by his house.
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:27.520]  Yeah, very nice. Yeah, Willie's a great patriot.
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:37.520]  Yeah, he means well. He's an old fashioned liberal at heart. He means well. But I tell you, I think he's a he's a 84 85 now. Good Lord.
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:44.520]  I haven't had like dinner with him last time. It was like 82 or something. But I tell you, he's getting up there. He can still tear it up on a guitar.
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:48.520]  I just saw him in concert about two years ago. He was amazing.
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:58.520]  All right, Bass Stickman, Kyle Chapman, come back with us sooner and we'll follow your cases out on the foals. But thank you for not plea bargain. Thank you for not backing down, my friend.
[3:03:58.520 --> 3:04:01.520]  You got it, Alex. Thank you so much for having me on. Thank you, brother.
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:14.520]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails. And those who cried appease appease are killed by those they tried to please.
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:23.520]  The author of that's unknown, but it comes from the Revolutionary War. Now 245 years ago.
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails. And those that cried appease appease are killed by those they tried to please.
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:41.520]  I'm not trying to please anybody but God. That's because I know I'm a wicked devil, but I love God. And I'm ready to fight the globalist. What about you?
[3:04:41.520 --> 3:04:52.520]  Paul Watson's Loaded for Bear. Straight ahead. We've got an update on the Antifa and the so-called pedosign. Straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones, newswars.com.
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:05:00.520]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brainforce.
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:10.520]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle. And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:16.520]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off. And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[3:05:16.520 --> 3:05:26.520]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is.
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:39.520]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics. And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brainforce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:52.520]  It's a good deal at $39. It's $19.96 at infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:31.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:07:00.520]  All right, Paul Watson is taking over here in just a few minutes, but he wrote an article this morning for infowars.com where he said whether this was a false flag or not,
[3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:10.520]  Salon, The New York Times, The Left, The U.N., Nambla are all officially trying to legalize sex with children or pushing that it's acceptable.
[3:07:10.520 --> 3:07:22.520]  So Paul said they're either complete idiots for letting people lead their march with this sign or this is what they really believe, but they got their faces covered, so who knows.
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:31.520]  Now, we've all seen Rand Paul with people with KKK signs in his rallies. It turns out they're Democratic Party operatives, and they've done that to me as well.
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:38.520]  So he said it could be a false flag, but here's the deal. I had turned to John earlier. He obviously wasn't behind it. It might have been a fan or something if it wasn't a false flag.
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:43.520]  He's saying, hey, the media says false flags don't exist.
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:58.520]  Well, I've pointed out that Antifa is into a lot of weirdness. They're into being degenerate from my experience. You know, if a cop does something wrong in some other city and thousand miles away, you go shoot five cops and then CNN says, well, cops are bad.
[3:07:58.520 --> 3:08:07.520]  They deserve it. I mean, if my neighbor robs the bank, I don't go to jail. So the cop might do something wrong somewhere. You don't go kill random cops, but that's the attitude of these people.
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:13.520]  So pedophilia, hell, that's part of the course. But what is real is Kevin Spacey saying, I'm sorry, I tried to rape a 14-year-old.
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:20.520]  Harvey Weinstein hiring people that were convicted of raping 12-year-old boys on the set to run other children's movies.
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:28.520]  And all the stuff coming out, that's the big issue. That's the big enchilada. And we told you it's coming down, and it is coming down.
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:43.520]  And here it is, some of the news. Antifa activists carry pro-pedophile sign during Cernovich protests. No Pito bashing, no white supremacy, no Mike Cernovich, who they were calling for to be banned.
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:49.520]  Oh, what about this? Nobody's going to stop me. Corey Feldman sells a release every name of Hollywood Pitos. Is that fake, too?
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:09:00.520]  See, when it's in the JFK files that they're staging false flags, then we have to, if they said somebody in the Gulf threw babies out of incubators and kicked their brains out,
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:07.520]  we'd have to say, hey, they lied about that in 1990 to get us into a war. If it turns out it's real, then it's real.
[3:09:07.520 --> 3:09:16.520]  We're not putting down the families who had babies killed. But before it didn't happen, it was fake. So we have a right and a duty to question known liars.
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:28.520]  Just like known pedophilia using pizza code words. Then the media focuses on some pizza place, makes it all about that. Everybody covers it as a trap and then says we're saying that this is going on when we're not saying it.
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:38.520]  So then they can say, oh, pedophilia doesn't exist. Really? The deputy pope just got arrested. So there's an info war going on.
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:49.520]  Now we've got this Gotham story. Mike Cernovich stole my photo. There's no proof of that. Mike heard about it later. Lied about it on Twitter and sold Trump Jr. on another fake conspiracy.
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:57.520]  Okay, so let's play the video of them with a sign at the front of them. And this is the kind of stuff you see. This is what's going on, the sexualization of children.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:01.520]  So this happens. Here's the original video.
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:09.520]  Street street. Okay so that goes on for a while. No white supremacy.
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:17.520]  Ok. Then there's another video, we've been looking, where they come up and you say, why are you holding this and grab it away?
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:24.520]  So people that are in the March, the day now are carrying it, who gave it to them? Well, why do they have it? They're saying, Why are you carrying it and tear it away?
[3:10:24.520 --> 3:10:30.520]  We can't play the audio because we just got it, it's got cussing. But here's the video of it, and I'll narrate, here it is.
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:35.800]  No, watch the premises, no P.D.O. batches. No, my turn. Watch out. There's some
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:42.480]  cussing here. Oh, you blinked. Yes, they're quick. Start over then. Stop it.
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:45.800]  I was going to narrate because I didn't know that. Sorry. Let's start it again
[3:10:45.800 --> 3:11:09.360]  where I won't talk over here just for you to see. Go ahead. Okay, so there's the
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:13.720]  sign. It goes on and on. And then people say, what is this? Why do you have it?
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:26.080]  And they tear it away. So they're trying to find out where it came from. But
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:29.320]  that's what they do to us. So I think Sharon was just point whether it's real
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:35.920]  or not. That's something the left pushes. That's legitimate. I mean, this is a real
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:39.680]  form of debate here. The media is going to have to report on false flags, Paul.
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:44.560]  And they say that doesn't exist, Paul. Nobody ever sets anybody up, Paul.
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:51.040]  Well, Alex, who cares? The media, this is the interesting thing. They rushed to their
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:55.520]  defense immediately. Once again, the media rushed to Antifa's defense. They
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:58.960]  don't want to talk about Antifa, Alex, when they're literally bragging in
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:04.840]  undercover videos about acquiring AK-47s and shorn off shotguns to massacre
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:09.440]  conservatives. Crowder got the undercover video. The media didn't touch it. They
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:13.840]  don't want to talk about Antifa when they're assaulting wheelchair users. They
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:16.680]  don't want to talk about Antifa when they're pepper spraying women in the
[3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:21.200]  face. Oh, so someone might have carried out a peaceful false flag against
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:26.720]  Antifa to make them look bad. Oh, poor babies. Let's rush to their defense. No,
[3:12:26.720 --> 3:12:31.560]  screw Antifa. That's a bunch of scumbags who assault innocent people on a
[3:12:31.560 --> 3:12:35.400]  regular basis for having a different opinion. Media doesn't want to talk
[3:12:35.400 --> 3:12:40.320]  about it. Oh, so someone made them look bad, potentially. Who cares? It was funny.
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:44.040]  It was hilarious. And by the way, the info was headline says, you know,
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:48.400]  Antifa activists carry sign. It doesn't say who created it. And it doesn't
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:53.560]  really matter. And you say it might be fake. I mean, you say that again, we're
[3:12:53.560 --> 3:12:58.880]  reporting on it. The point is, this is the crap they pull on us all the time. Oh,
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:03.040]  yeah, they will plant people in, I mean, they're calling this an old right. That's
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:06.520]  in the wiki leagues. That's in the wiki leagues where they go to start fights
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:10.720]  and beat people up and say racist stuff. They literally carry around shields
[3:13:10.720 --> 3:13:14.840]  saying, no, hey, while bashing people over the heads with those same shields
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:18.800]  for having a different opinion. And all these mainstream media people defend
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:23.160]  them. Chris Hayes is out tweeting this Gothamist article saying that Mike
[3:13:23.160 --> 3:13:28.400]  Sernovich is alt right. He specifically disavowed the alt right a year ago.
[3:13:28.400 --> 3:13:32.240]  Day one, he said as a control group, like you said, yeah, who coined it? Is it
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:39.040]  you are here? Is it me new? Right? We're the new. Yeah. Because the actual
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.000]  racist back a year ago were given platforms by the mainstream media by
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:48.640]  the Atlantis associated with us. They give nobody's nobody's ever heard of
[3:13:48.640 --> 3:13:52.560]  that don't work jobs out of the blue. They used to be Democrats. They say who
[3:13:52.560 --> 3:13:57.240]  they give them platforms and then wed them to us. No, we are not involved with
[3:13:57.240 --> 3:14:04.600]  the alt right. We are. I'm a liberal. I'm okay to say that. But if we point out
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:08.240]  that somebody's carrying a banner saying that's pro pedophilia, you can't even
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:13.400]  talk about it. I'm a classical Thomas Jefferson liberal. Let's say that we
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:19.080]  are all we're common sense. We're living let live. But we have to protect
[3:14:19.080 --> 3:14:24.440]  Antifa's sacred image. Who cares? They're horrible scumbags. What about Todd
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:28.280]  Nickerson? Are they going to talk about that? The fact that salon.com for over
[3:14:28.280 --> 3:14:33.080]  a year gave an admitted pedophile a platform to tell everyone how normal
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:37.160]  it was. How it was an alternative drooling videos of five year old girls
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:42.680]  dancing so they can all get off on it. Literally, they put out this dream
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:47.880]  dreamlike video of him fantasizing over having sex with a child. They put that
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:52.760]  out on salon.com. Oh, you don't want to talk about that. Do you Chris Hayes? No,
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:57.160]  they only want to talk about some banner because oh, they're precious. But again,
[3:14:57.160 --> 3:15:01.400]  look, their whole pedophile empire is collapsing. They are in full panic mode.
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:04.920]  They have the Soros people and I'm ready for the war with the Soros people. I
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:08.440]  realize now what their game is. I'm ready for the war. I believe our listeners
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:11.320]  are going to support us. I'm going to have more news for people tomorrow. But we
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:15.480]  have the Soros law firms directly at our doorstep threatening us right now.
[3:15:15.480 --> 3:15:19.240]  Just like they're threatening, you know, if you talk about the Podestas and
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:20.760]  their Russia gate stuff, they're threatening.
[3:15:20.760 --> 3:15:24.120]  Pecker Carlson, you know what? I'm saddled up on my horse.
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:28.040]  My sword's drawn. I'm ready. I love it, Paul. Take over my friend.
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:32.040]  All right. Thanks, Alex. We are in the fourth hour of the
[3:15:32.040 --> 3:15:36.120]  coming up. We're going to talk a little bit more about Antifa and about
[3:15:36.120 --> 3:15:39.240]  not just their links with pedophile groups potentially, even though it's
[3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:43.640]  probably a false flag, but even more importantly, their potential links with
[3:15:43.640 --> 3:15:47.480]  Islamic terrorists. We're going to get to that after the break. This is the Alex

[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:28.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the
[3:20:28.600 --> 3:20:34.360]  resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:42.520]  We're live. It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and as Alex was talking
[3:20:42.520 --> 3:20:45.880]  about before the break, all the mainstream media rushed to the
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:50.280]  defense of Antifa rapidly after this incident outside Columbia
[3:20:50.280 --> 3:20:55.560]  University last night, didn't they? When somebody carried a banner,
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:20:59.080]  a protest banner, that said no white supremacy, no Mike
[3:20:59.080 --> 3:21:03.400]  Sernovich, and no PEDO bashing. Marching behind that banner were a
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:07.400]  bunch of Antifa activists. So basically, even if it was a false
[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:11.240]  flag, and again, who cares? Antifa may have been false flagged with the
[3:21:11.240 --> 3:21:15.400]  PEDO banner to make them look bad. And my take on it is
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:21.000]  Boohoo, Crimea, Frigging River. These people attack innocents all the time.
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:25.320]  They pepper spray women in the face. They assault people in wheelchairs.
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:28.440]  You've seen their activity over the course of the past year.
[3:21:28.440 --> 3:21:33.480]  They behave like actual Nazis while claiming to be fighting fascism.
[3:21:33.480 --> 3:21:37.080]  Oh, so somebody may have made them look bad.
[3:21:37.080 --> 3:21:41.960]  Nobody got hurt. Who cares? Again, mainstream media doesn't want to talk
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:45.560]  about it when they're literally scheming in undercover videos to
[3:21:45.560 --> 3:21:49.720]  acquire sawn-off shotguns and AK-47s,
[3:21:49.720 --> 3:21:52.840]  which Steven Crowder exposed in his undercover video.
[3:21:52.840 --> 3:21:55.640]  That didn't get any mainstream media attention.
[3:21:55.640 --> 3:22:01.000]  Yet somebody carries a banner, whether it was a joke, a false flag, or what.
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:05.080]  Oh, and they're all over it. Straight to the defense of Antifa,
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:08.920]  lying, brazenly lying about Mike Sernovich, calling him
[3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:12.520]  alt-right to try and portray him as a white supremacist,
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:16.360]  which is the real alt-right. And they're given that platform by the
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:20.280]  mainstream media on a regular basis because without it, they would be nothing
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:24.440]  because the left needs this mass hysteria, this moral panic
[3:22:24.440 --> 3:22:29.960]  to tie in to try and tie it to Donald Trump and the 2018-2020 elections.
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:34.760]  If you actually look at the alt-right on its own without the aid of mainstream
[3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:37.960]  media, they're pathetic. They don't have any platform.
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:43.080]  They're magnified many times over by this Trump derangement syndrome hysteria
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:48.040]  that's provided to them on a regular basis. Now let's get into some more
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:51.320]  Antifa news, which ties into this. This is a headline out of the Daily Mail,
[3:22:51.320 --> 3:22:54.280]  which has been around for a couple of days now, but we really need to get into it
[3:22:54.280 --> 3:22:57.880]  because it's big. US left-wing groups traveled to Germany
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:23:02.040]  for the G20 summit last July to meet with Al Qaeda,
[3:23:02.040 --> 3:23:05.800]  ISIS leaders, and plot the destruction of President Trump's secret FBI
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:09.640]  investigation reveals. Now this is an FBI document that's
[3:23:09.640 --> 3:23:13.240]  included in a new book, a secret FBI investigation of the violent
[3:23:13.240 --> 3:23:17.080]  resistance movement on college campuses against President Trump,
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:21.080]  otherwise known as Antifa, has led to an alarming discovery, the collusion between
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:23.960]  American anarchists and foreign terrorists in the Islamic State and
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:28.200]  Al Qaeda, according to a confidential informational report by FBI field
[3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:30.600]  officers. You remember, of course, that I think it was a
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:35.480]  homeland security out of New Jersey officially listed Antifa as a domestic
[3:23:35.480 --> 3:23:39.160]  terrorist outfit. Now this document shows there's a
[3:23:39.160 --> 3:23:42.680]  clearly overwhelming evidence that there are growing ties between US radicals
[3:23:42.680 --> 3:23:45.400]  and the Islamic State, as well as several ISIS
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:49.320]  offshoots and splinter groups states the FBI report, which was delivered
[3:23:49.320 --> 3:23:53.080]  to acting director Andrew McCabe on July 11, 2017,
[3:23:53.080 --> 3:23:56.600]  which is being published for the first time in the new book, All Out war the
[3:23:56.600 --> 3:24:01.560]  Plot to Destroy Trump. The FBI report on efforts by Islamic
[3:24:01.560 --> 3:24:04.440]  terrorists to recruit followers amongst violent groups
[3:24:04.440 --> 3:24:08.840]  like Antifa, and it corroborates President Trump's controversial claim
[3:24:08.840 --> 3:24:11.160]  following last summer's protest in Charlottesville,
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:14.760]  that left-wing anarchist groups are just as dangerous as
[3:24:14.760 --> 3:24:19.080]  right-wing white supremacists. This is the greatest challenge to law
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:22.200]  enforcement since the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party, the FBI
[3:24:22.200 --> 3:24:26.440]  report declared. So they've got this connection
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:29.880]  between ISIS groups, between Islamic terrorists and
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:34.280]  Antifa. They've confirmed it, the FBI is releasing reports on it.
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:39.400]  We, of course, reported on this, I think it was back in 2015, actually,
[3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:44.520]  in a story where we focused on an ISIS propaganda manual, and there was a
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:48.280]  section in that manual, I think this is just after the Paris attacks, actually,
[3:24:48.280 --> 3:24:52.440]  the headline was European Muslims Allying with Left-Wing Activists. That was the
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:56.040]  segment out of ISIS's official propaganda magazine,
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:24:59.160]  and it says, a growing population of left-wing activists, people who are
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:02.680]  against human, animal abuse, as Zionism and austerity measures,
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.120]  look up to the Muslims as a force who are strong enough to fight against
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:09.960]  the injustices of the world. It seems that many of these people who are
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:13.080]  sometimes part of anonymous and anarchy movements,
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:16.360]  again, this is ISIS propaganda I'm reading right now,
[3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:19.560]  probably get arrested by the government throwing in jail for 15 years or whatever,
[3:25:19.560 --> 3:25:23.320]  will ally with the Muslims to fight against the neo-Nazis and rich
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:27.320]  politicians. They will give intelligence, share weapons, and do undercover work for
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:30.280]  the Muslims to pave the way for the conquest of Rome.
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:34.680]  It goes on to say there's a connection between Muslims and left-wing activists
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:38.920]  because they broadly share the same goals. So that was ISIS in their own
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:43.160]  manual in 2015, saying we can recruit
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:48.840]  far-left militants because we broadly share the same goals. Now we have
[3:25:48.840 --> 3:25:52.680]  an FBI report saying that that is exactly what's happening,
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:56.520]  and obviously the vast majority of people who protest
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:26:00.840]  Milo-Unopolis and Mike Cernovich events don't have anything to do with ISIS,
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:04.120]  they're not meeting with Islamic terrorists, I'm not saying that. I'm saying
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:07.480]  there's going to be a hardcore, hard-left element
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:11.560]  that will be interested in doing that, and that represents a domestic terrorist
[3:26:11.560 --> 3:26:15.880]  threat given the constant death threats that these kind of
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:19.240]  groups come out with, which happened again last night.
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:23.080]  Mike Cernovich, during his speech at Columbia University,
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:25.960]  amidst all this controversy over the pedo banner,
[3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:31.720]  the Antifa march, it didn't turn out to be a mass riot, there were some skirmishers,
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:35.880]  but it was a protest. And during the speech, they got inside his speech, they
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:39.080]  tried to interrupt him. One of the individuals,
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:43.240]  basically by proxy, made a death threat against Mike Cernovich.
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:27:13.080]  We've got the clip, here it is.
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:19.240]  So there you have it. That was during Mike Cernovich's speech last night.
[3:27:19.240 --> 3:27:23.240]  Someone's going to pop you, you little bitch. That's what one of the Antifa
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:27.880]  activists inside his event said. Obviously saying somebody's going
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:32.920]  to assassinate you because, God forbid, you have a different opinion to us.
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:37.320]  Again, violent rhetoric, we've seen violent action on behalf of Antifa.
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:41.000]  Now we're seeing reports that there could actually be a link
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:44.360]  with Islamic terrorists. And again, the vast majority of people are going to have
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:49.160]  nothing to do with this. But the hard left militant hardcore will.
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:52.600]  We saw what happened with the weather underground in America.
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.520]  In the 1970s, they carried out attacks. They killed police officers.
[3:27:56.520 --> 3:28:01.880]  Antifa is heading the same way. We had photos from the inauguration, if you
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:06.200]  remember this story back in January, where after the riots during the
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:12.040]  inauguration, there was an Antifa activist who showed the Trump supporters
[3:28:12.040 --> 3:28:16.440]  an ISIS flag on his phone, showed them ISIS propaganda beheading videos.
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:19.960]  That story was on infowars.com. I'm going to get into it after the break.
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:24.360]  But again, it shows the alarming connections between Antifa and some of
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:29.160]  these militant Islamic radical groups, which the FBI is now reporting on.
[3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:32.280]  There you see the headline, anti-Trump protest that displays
[3:28:32.280 --> 3:28:36.360]  ISIS flag beheading video. That was during the inauguration. So he's
[3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:39.800]  obviously into it. Whether it means he's going to go and join ISIS or not, or be
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:42.840]  recruited by them, doesn't mean that. But it shows,
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:46.760]  ideologically, there's a connection. And now the FBI is saying, potentially, that
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:49.560]  could be a physical one. We'll be back on the Alice Jones show
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:52.120]  fourth hour after the break. Don't go away.

[3:33:12.200 --> 3:33:19.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:30.120]  We are back on the Alex Jones show. We have an incident in Manhattan where it looks like there's
[3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:36.040]  been a shooting and potentially pedestrians and bicyclists being run down by a vehicle.
[3:33:36.040 --> 3:33:42.120]  Let's read some reports. This is a breaking news story. This is out of breaking 911.com.
[3:33:42.120 --> 3:33:46.040]  Box truck mows down several pedestrians in Manhattan. Here's what we know.
[3:33:46.040 --> 3:33:50.600]  Several pedestrians and bicyclists were run down by a vehicle in lower Manhattan Tuesday.
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:54.840]  According to witnesses, the man in a box truck veered off the road and struck the victims.
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:34:00.680]  The unidentified suspect was later taken into custody. There was multiple reports of gunfire
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:06.520]  in the area following the incident. It's unclear if these reports are related, unclear if it was
[3:34:06.520 --> 3:34:11.480]  an act of terrorism. But we've seen before shootings that follow these kind of events
[3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:17.320]  in terrorist attacks. We've seen it in London where this initial vehicle attack is just the start,
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:22.200]  then potentially other individuals go out and attack people with weapons, with knives or guns
[3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:25.640]  in the aftermath of that. But again, we don't know what's happening.
[3:34:25.640 --> 3:34:31.160]  Daily Mail reports at least five injured in shooting reported in downtown Manhattan.
[3:34:31.160 --> 3:34:35.160]  At least five people are feared to have been injured in a shooting in downtown Manhattan.
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:40.520]  The first report of the incident came over the NYC police scanner radio. Stinger Josh Groban
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:45.480]  also tweeted after hearing gunshots while out walking his dog. He tweeted, oh my God,
[3:34:45.480 --> 3:34:50.280]  I just heard gunshots and ran with my dog. Other reports suggested a car drove into the
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:55.480]  bicycle lane and mowed down cyclists and pedestrians. The NYPD could not confirm the information
[3:34:55.480 --> 3:35:02.360]  and it's spreading on social media. There is a video in the Breaking 911 news article,
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:10.440]  which shows at least from what I can see three or four victims lying prostrate on the ground,
[3:35:10.440 --> 3:35:17.640]  apparently having been hit by this vehicle in lower Manhattan. It doesn't seem to be that,
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:21.320]  obviously it's horrific and tragic, but there doesn't seem to be that much gore. So if you want
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:26.200]  to grab that video, you might want to roll it if you want to make that decision, but at least
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:33.160]  three or four victims down on the pavement, they're talking about injuries. None of these
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:40.040]  victims are even moving by the looks of it, so it looks pretty bad. Couple this with reports of
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:45.000]  gunshots. Again, if it was just the vehicle thing, you might call it an accident, but there are
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:50.920]  reports of gunshots and multiple people being injured by gunshots. So this is a breaking
[3:35:50.920 --> 3:35:55.960]  story right now taking place in lower Manhattan. We don't know if anybody's been apprehended.
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:03.240]  This literally just happened. NBC News now reports that the New York Police Department
[3:36:03.240 --> 3:36:09.640]  is saying one person is in custody following a shooting in lower Manhattan. Multiple people
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:15.080]  have been shot near the West Side Highway and Chamber Street in New York City. That broke
[3:36:15.080 --> 3:36:20.920]  just a few minutes ago. So they've got somebody in custody. The question is, is it connected
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:25.720]  to this vehicle incident where it appears like numerous people have been run over by a vehicle
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:33.080]  in Manhattan? We await full stories on that. The New York Times just reported on it. They say,
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:39.160]  police respond to reports of the shooting in lower Manhattan. That article is behind an ad wall,
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:45.960]  so I can't even read it. So again, this literally just happened. Chamber Street and Greenwich Street
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:53.480]  is the location. Several injuries at least. Somebody's claiming BNO News, again, not verified,
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:37:01.720]  that at least two people are dead in a truck and gun attack in Manhattan. Multiple people apparently
[3:37:01.720 --> 3:37:07.000]  shot. Let's go to Fox News who are reporting. NYPD responding to reports of shots fired in
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:13.160]  Manhattan, so they don't really have anything new on it. But people are talking about casualties,
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:17.080]  they're talking about injuries, talking about potentially two deaths. There is virtually no
[3:37:17.080 --> 3:37:23.880]  other news than that, but it appears from initial reports that it could be a terrorist attack.
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:30.680]  That's all we've got so far. So we're going to flip back to that in a second. There you see a video
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:36.280]  from Fox News of some of the victims. It looks like a tragic incident. It doesn't look like an
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:43.320]  accident. It's equally tragic either way. But again, this could be a terrorist attack in New York
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:50.120]  City, given what's happened, obviously, in Europe over the past few months. We've seen this all
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:37:56.520]  before, haven't we? The combination of the truck attack and then the subsequent gun or knife attack
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:01.960]  specifically called for by ISIS in their own propaganda manuals. Again, we don't know who is
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:06.520]  behind this. There's no information on it and there won't be for a while in terms of the culprit,
[3:38:06.520 --> 3:38:12.680]  but it definitely bears the hallmarks of what we've seen before, unfortunately, throughout Europe.
[3:38:13.400 --> 3:38:17.560]  So we'll wait until there's a little bit more news on that and we'll get back into it. But again,
[3:38:17.560 --> 3:38:22.920]  it ties into what I was talking about, which was terrorism before the break with this FBI report
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:28.840]  saying that left-wing activists could now be becoming radicalized and potentially meeting with
[3:38:28.840 --> 3:38:35.080]  ISIS. Of course, we had the article from the inauguration after the riots when Trump was
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:41.880]  inaugurated, where we had this Antifa activist showing Trump supporters an ISIS flag on his
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:48.120]  phone, showing them ISIS propaganda, showing them beheading videos on his phone. So again,
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:53.720]  the FBI is concerned about this. We've had the New Jersey Homeland Security list Antifa as a
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:39:00.360]  domestic terrorist group. So this is a real concern as this polarization increases that it could turn
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:06.680]  to terror as it did, of course, back in the 70s with the weather underground. So we're going to
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:13.080]  keep an eye on that as well. Maxine Waters has come out with another zinger. She's now blaming
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:19.560]  Russian bots for disrupting a town hall and hanging posters outside a venue. Bearing in mind,
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:24.760]  this is the same Maxine Waters that said she would take out Trump in a speech earlier this month.
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:31.640]  Absolutely insane comment. She also said that evidence of Russian collusion with Trump was
[3:39:31.640 --> 3:39:36.840]  that Putin, remember this one, invented the phrases, lock her up and crooked Hillary. She
[3:39:36.840 --> 3:39:41.720]  actually made that claim and said that Putin inventing those phrases, which there's no evidence
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:47.800]  he ever did, was bombshell evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump administration. Well,
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:53.080]  now the far left Democratic spokeswoman claims Russian bots recently disrupted her town hall
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:58.920]  event and even hung up posters outside her town hall. A Republican challenger, Oman Avaro,
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:04.840]  who's been on the show, tweeted about her latest insanity earlier today. Maxine Waters is so out
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:09.160]  of touch with her constituents that she just blamed Russian bots for disrupting her town hall.
[3:40:10.440 --> 3:40:14.760]  So again, let's go to the quote from Maxine Waters. She said the hashtag appeared,
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:20.840]  she's talking about impeach Maxine Waters hashtag. The hashtag appeared to be coordinated
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:26.520]  with large elaborate posters that were posted outside the town hall venue by disruptors.
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:32.600]  So she accuses Russian bots of creating this hashtag, then says it was followed up by people
[3:40:32.600 --> 3:40:38.520]  or by Russian bots. I guess they just became sentient and became actual humans posting banners
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:44.920]  outside her town hall event. Absolutely incredible. But what do you expect from Maxine Waters,
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:52.680]  given her alarming nonsensical statements which come out on a regular basis? Let's dip back into
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:59.160]  this breaking news story because I'm trying to figure out what's going on. In Manhattan, reports
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:09.640]  of multiple gunshots, NYPD says that they have a suspect in custody. The NYC police scanner now
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:15.480]  reporting at least five people shot in downtown Manhattan. Some victims are likely a car. This
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:19.640]  is out of news executive. Again, none of this is confirmed. It's all breaking. Some of this later
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:23.640]  turns out not to be true, but we're just covering breaking news. A car drove onto the bike lane
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:27.560]  in Lower Manhattan. Multiple people injured, including some in serious condition, driver in
[3:41:27.560 --> 3:41:32.680]  custody. If we can roll that video again, that's what we saw. People in a bike lane. Obviously
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:37.400]  easy targets if you're deliberately trying to carry out some kind of terrorist attack.
[3:41:38.200 --> 3:41:45.480]  NBC says that the NYPD has one person in custody. That's just about all we know so far. Let's see
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:51.480]  if there's anything else. That's about it. Checking on Twitter. The breaking news is apparent.
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:56.760]  One terrorist attack is what it looks like a combined vehicle and shooting. But again,
[3:41:56.760 --> 3:42:03.080]  if they apprehended the guy who was in the vehicle who was responsible for this carnage,
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:08.280]  which you see in the video now, it appears those people don't seem to be just injured.
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:12.600]  They seem to be at least seriously injured, if not unfortunately dead. Some people are saying
[3:42:13.320 --> 3:42:19.400]  two people have died. This is the situation now in Lower Manhattan. Multiple people run
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:26.360]  over by a car. Multiple injuries. Not a night white nationalist or alt-right says Mike Cernovich,
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:31.560]  but he's talking about the event that he had last night. I'm just reading this off Twitter
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:36.360]  because people are covering it. West Monster reports possible major incident in New York
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:42.520]  shots fired suspect arrested. So the question is, is it just one guy? Have they arrested the guy?
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:48.680]  Is the attack over or was the shooting a separate attack carried out by a separate individual
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:54.920]  or individuals? That's what we're waiting to find out. We're running the biggest special

[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:11.080]  Now we're talking about what's going on in Lower Manhattan. We've had a potential terrorist attack
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:16.760]  NBC News reports at least five people have been shot near the September 11 Memorial. A large
[3:49:16.760 --> 3:49:20.440]  number of police vehicles could be seen near the West Street and Chambers Street in Tribeca.
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:26.040]  Students from the top ranked students and high school and other witnesses in the area tweeted
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:31.400]  they'd heard gunshots. They're saying it's not clear if the two scenes are connected. We have
[3:49:31.400 --> 3:49:37.480]  another incident where cyclists in a bicycle lane have been apparently mowed down by a vehicle.
[3:49:37.480 --> 3:49:40.280]  Not clear if the shooting and that are connected but obviously
[3:49:41.400 --> 3:49:46.360]  common sense would suggest that they are. We've seen this report. We've seen these kind of incidents
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:52.360]  throughout Europe. BBC News reports casualties report after New York attack. Suspect has been
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:57.720]  arrested in New York after people were reportedly shot and mown down by the driver of car. So they're
[3:49:57.720 --> 3:50:01.800]  saying that the two events were carried out by the same person. NBC is saying there could be
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:07.800]  different perpetrators. Multiple reports on social media suggested a man had driven a cyclist
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:13.400]  possibly in a cycling lane before opening fire in the Lower Manhattan area. Police said they
[3:50:13.400 --> 3:50:17.880]  made at least one arrest. They've also urged people to avoid Chambers West Street area. So the
[3:50:17.880 --> 3:50:24.840]  BBC seems pretty convinced that it's all one incident. NBC said it could be two separate
[3:50:24.840 --> 3:50:28.840]  incidents but this is happening. This has just happened literally in the last 30 minutes right
[3:50:28.840 --> 3:50:36.360]  now in Lower Manhattan. Another report out of BNL News states the police have shot the
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:41.240]  driver of the truck that mowed people down in Manhattan. So again the suggestion is that
[3:50:41.880 --> 3:50:46.360]  he got out of the truck after mowing these people down and we've seen the carnage on the streets.
[3:50:46.360 --> 3:50:52.360]  We saw at least four or five people lying prostrate not even moving. Presumably he then
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:57.960]  got out of the truck ran to a different area and started shooting at people at least five people
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:03.560]  shot potentially two dead is what the breaking news reports are suggesting. Obviously that's
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:10.360]  all subject to change. The unfortunate reality of these incidents is they almost the casualty
[3:51:10.360 --> 3:51:17.400]  to all both injured and dead almost always rises once the full scale of the horror is known. So
[3:51:17.400 --> 3:51:23.080]  so this has all the hallmarks even though we don't know who carried it out but it's obviously has
[3:51:23.080 --> 3:51:29.320]  the hallmarks of an Islamic terrorist attack. We've seen the same thing in Berlin Germany in
[3:51:29.320 --> 3:51:36.280]  Stockholm Sweden in London England all over the past six eight months where these attacks have
[3:51:36.280 --> 3:51:42.280]  happened. We had one in London Bridge where they mowed down people on the bridge got out ran into
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:48.520]  a nearby area with knives and started knifing people I think 13 dead as a result of that attack.
[3:51:49.320 --> 3:51:56.360]  This looks like it could be on a similar scale so we can only hope that the reported deaths are
[3:51:56.360 --> 3:52:01.720]  in fact just injuries but that is what is happening in Lower Manhattan or what has just happened
[3:52:02.600 --> 3:52:10.280]  as of three twenty p.m. New York time. Driver of the truck is believed to have plowed down a
[3:52:10.280 --> 3:52:15.160]  bicycle lane on the west side highway mowing down cyclists before coming to a stop. It's not clear
[3:52:15.880 --> 3:52:23.080]  if that is the same person who then opened fire. So that is a breaking news story and of course
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:28.680]  war room immediately after this broadcast will be sure to pick that up and bring you the latest on
[3:52:28.680 --> 3:52:34.200]  that. Let's dip into a few final news stories here in the last five minutes of the show.
[3:52:34.200 --> 3:52:41.000]  This is out of fortune. Facebook Twitter and Google reveal how many people saw Russia linked
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:46.600]  posts the activities of Russia's shadowy internet research agency which pumped out divisive social
[3:52:46.600 --> 3:52:51.800]  media content in an attempt to drive Americans apart. You know like the mainstream media does on
[3:52:51.800 --> 3:52:57.160]  a minute by minute basis continue to come to light according to disclosures made to Congress
[3:52:57.160 --> 3:53:03.800]  the troll farms post reach one hundred and twenty six million users in the U.S. on Facebook over the
[3:53:03.800 --> 3:53:11.400]  last couple of years. Now that sounds a lot but it's over two years and by reached I mean what
[3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:16.920]  do they mean by that if you're scrolling through a video for example on Facebook one view counts
[3:53:16.920 --> 3:53:22.280]  after three seconds. You don't even need to watch the video you might even not have noticed it
[3:53:22.280 --> 3:53:27.480]  for that cat to have counted as a view. You took about one hundred and twenty six million on Facebook
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:34.120]  over two years from an entire army of troll box. That is not even that much. And to emphasize that
[3:53:34.120 --> 3:53:39.560]  the article goes on to stay as for Twitter the micro blogging service identified and suspended
[3:53:39.560 --> 3:53:44.680]  over two thousand seven hundred internet research agency linked accounts that posted around one hundred
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:50.200]  thirty one thousand tweets between September and November twenty sixteen. Now they said between
[3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:56.920]  that period that those tweets were viewed or had impressions amounting to around two hundred and
[3:53:56.920 --> 3:54:03.000]  eighty eight million times between September and November twenty sixteen the key election period.
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:10.840]  Again sounds like a lot but I was getting sometimes above that for a one month period
[3:54:10.840 --> 3:54:15.640]  during the election. In fact one of the election months I got over three hundred million impressions
[3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:23.320]  on Twitter just from my one account on Twitter. They're talking about an entire troll bot Russian
[3:54:23.320 --> 3:54:29.640]  army this feared army that can influence and swing elections didn't even get the same amount of
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:34.360]  impressions on Twitter that I did and they had double the amount of time to do it.
[3:54:34.920 --> 3:54:39.080]  So again this plays into the ignorance of people who don't really know how Twitter and Facebook
[3:54:39.080 --> 3:54:44.680]  work and how getting yeah two hundred if you got two hundred eighty eight million impressions over the
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:50.200]  course of two months as an individual that would be quite impressive for somebody who's not you
[3:54:50.200 --> 3:54:55.080]  know a massive user who hasn't got twenty thirty million followers on Twitter. I mean I was getting
[3:54:55.080 --> 3:54:59.960]  that back a year ago with probably about three to four hundred thousand followers on Twitter. So
[3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:07.720]  that took about the whole feared legendary Russian troll bot army didn't even get the same amount
[3:55:07.720 --> 3:55:12.440]  of impressions on Twitter that I got over a two month period that I got in a one month period.
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:18.040]  Yeah I'm not saying oh look at me how great I am I'm saying they've exaggerated the reach of it
[3:55:18.040 --> 3:55:23.560]  because it all ties into this Russian collusion hysteria which they need to keep fanning the
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:29.880]  flames off. Now of course Keith Alderman came out a few days ago and attacked homie Lauren for
[3:55:29.880 --> 3:55:35.880]  wearing a US flag. This is out of the American Mirror. Keith Alderman violates US flag code three
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:41.000]  times to attack Trump. Keith Alderman must have graduated from the Hillary Clinton School of Projection
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:46.920]  and Hypocrisy. So of course Alderman came out with this tweet who by the way Alderman's put out a
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:54.680]  book called Trump is Effing Crazy and on the cover of that book Keith Alderman is wrapped in an
[3:55:54.680 --> 3:56:00.520]  American flag. He's basically wearing an American flag. There you see the image there. But of course
[3:56:00.520 --> 3:56:05.160]  Alderman got his high horse once again with his Trump derangement syndrome and tweeted
[3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:13.720]  it told me Lauren for wearing a US flag uniform outfit costume. He said patriotic BS. She's in
[3:56:13.720 --> 3:56:19.800]  violation of the US flag code. The flag should never be used as wearing apparel. Well people dug
[3:56:19.800 --> 3:56:24.280]  up the actual US flag code and it says well won the flag should never touch anything beneath it
[3:56:24.280 --> 3:56:29.800]  such as the ground the floor. Go back to that Keith Alderman picture the cover of his book.
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:35.960]  The flag is touching the floor. And secondly the flag should never be used as wearing apparel.
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:42.120]  And Keith Alderman is wearing the flag in that picture just as Tommy Lauren is wearing the
[3:56:42.120 --> 3:56:50.120]  flag. So again Keith Alderman the ultimate hypocrite caught again tripped up by his own BS.
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:56.600]  German police arrest 19 year old Syrian suspected of plotting high profile attack. Of course we
[3:56:56.600 --> 3:57:01.480]  have events unfolding in Manhattan. German cancer is in place of arrested 19 year old Syrian
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:06.200]  suspect nurtured concrete plans to carry out an attack by detonating an explosive device with the
[3:57:06.200 --> 3:57:13.080]  aim of killing as many people as possible. That is in Germany where Syrian refugees have previously
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:18.200]  blown themselves up at music events. They got a massive problem in fact they've got lucky.
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:23.400]  They've managed to stop many of these plots. This was another one that was potentially massive
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:29.800]  that they just managed to stop in time. Unfortunately it looks like in Manhattan
[3:57:29.800 --> 3:57:34.280]  they didn't get the chance to stop what looks like a terrorist carrying out an attack and
[3:57:34.280 --> 3:57:38.600]  Owen Shroyer will be back on the war room to cover all that breaking news.
[3:57:38.600 --> 3:57:54.520]  This is the Alex Jones show info wars.com
