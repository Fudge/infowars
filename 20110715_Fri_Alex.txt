[00:00.000 --> 00:17.400]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday edition the 15th day of July 2011 and today is going
[00:17.400 --> 00:23.300]  to be something well we've never really done before. We're not just going to air a best
[00:23.300 --> 00:30.320]  of that was two or three previous interviews that I think are particularly informative.
[00:30.320 --> 00:37.760]  No we have gone into the archives of mega rants that I've done on very very serious
[00:37.760 --> 00:49.360]  subjects also special reports we've done on GMO food and the police state and media brainwashing.
[00:49.360 --> 00:55.160]  This is some of the most dynamic and informative material that we've covered in the last three
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.800]  years. Most of these clips are more timely and are from just the last few months of last
[00:59.800 --> 01:06.560]  year but some of them go back two or three years and we cover the entire waterfront.
[01:06.560 --> 01:14.800]  Also there's some clips of other media appearances I've made namely on talk sport over in the
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.120]  United Kingdom where I got particularly angry while I was talking to the host and some of
[01:22.120 --> 01:28.480]  the callers on Ian Collins show so that's coming up as well. I want to thank Mike Adams
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.320]  and the crew for doing a great job yesterday. I am in California now of course I recorded
[01:34.320 --> 01:41.860]  this on Wednesday before I left Thursday to go to California and it's not really a secret
[01:41.860 --> 01:47.480]  mission and no I'm not going to cover Bohemian Grove though we might go up there who knows
[01:47.480 --> 01:54.240]  since that's kicking off today as this first airs on July 15th. No I was invited to a media
[01:54.240 --> 01:59.280]  personality who's a good friend of mine's a 60th birthday party and I'm going to have
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.480]  a good chance to mix some important context and probably do some interviews with folks
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.640]  that could certainly wake some people up so I am going to that event this evening Friday
[02:09.640 --> 02:16.800]  night and so that's why I am in California. I normally unfortunately refuse such invitations
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.840]  but I am out of town for that. But again coming up here in just a few minutes we have this
[02:21.840 --> 02:27.120]  special transmission that Rob Jacobson and others have spent the last few days putting
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.520]  together and it's going to be extremely informative and dynamic so please spread the word this
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.840]  is a special broadcast. I'm looking at a London Guardian article in front of me the age of
[02:36.840 --> 02:42.800]  austerity to come for decades and that's what the government and others are warning about
[02:42.800 --> 02:49.920]  yes the post industrial world where they decided to destroy the uppity middle clash and they're
[02:49.920 --> 02:53.320]  telling you they're going to raise your taxes cut your benefits and all the money is going
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.800]  to go to your bankster owners. Meanwhile a few days ago Ben Bernanke was questioned in
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.640]  the banking committee by Congressman Ron Paul about the fact that they're devaluing the
[03:03.640 --> 03:10.040]  dollar with their now QE3 they're announcing and is he proud of the dollar losing half
[03:10.040 --> 03:16.520]  of its value recently and Bernanke has some arrogant answers to that so here is that clip.
[03:16.520 --> 03:21.800]  You know the price of gold today is $1,580 the dollar during these last three years
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.800]  was devalued almost 50%. When you wake up in the morning do you care about the price
[03:25.800 --> 03:29.560]  of gold? Well I pay attention to the price of gold but I think it reflects a lot of
[03:29.560 --> 03:34.880]  things it reflects global uncertainties I think people are the reason people hold gold
[03:34.880 --> 03:39.080]  is there's a protection against what we call tail risk really really bad outcomes and to
[03:39.080 --> 03:43.080]  the extent that the last few years have made people more worried about potential of a major
[03:43.080 --> 03:52.000]  crisis than they have gold as a protection. Do you think gold is money? No. Even if it
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.800]  is money for 6,000 years somebody reversed that and eliminated that economic law. Well
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.560]  it's you know it's an asset I mean it's the same would you say treasury bills are money
[04:03.560 --> 04:08.200]  I don't think they're money. That's right only their debt instruments are money and
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.200]  when the dollars created the private banks that he fronts for make money and that's why
[04:12.200 --> 04:17.200]  they've created a debt black hole that's impossible to get out of until we wake up to this fraud.
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.880]  The globalists haven't screwed things up they're not inept this has all been done by design
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.480]  they're premeditated criminals the big six megabanks on record launder hundreds of billions
[04:26.480 --> 04:31.200]  of dollars of drug money every year they're above the law they're exempt from the taxes
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.360]  they're the ones that want to raise our taxes and socially engineer things they are the control
[04:35.360 --> 04:42.800]  freak enemies of free humanity and society. Alright coming up a detailed transmission
[04:42.800 --> 04:50.240]  across the board on so many issues special news reports mixed with grants and confrontational
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.600]  interviews this is going to be one hell of a broadcast I want to thank you all for joining
[04:54.600 --> 05:04.640]  us we'll be right back. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[05:04.640 --> 05:10.840]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.120]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[05:21.120 --> 05:27.040]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the republic identifies the
[05:27.040 --> 05:32.680]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[05:32.680 --> 05:37.600]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.760]  asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today
[05:41.760 --> 05:47.880]  seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[05:47.880 --> 05:54.280]  republic. Get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching

[07:10.800 --> 07:15.760]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.760 --> 07:20.800]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:20.800 --> 07:25.600]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[07:30.360 --> 07:34.400]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[08:10.520 --> 08:20.240]  Friday the 15th day of July 2011 and we have three hours spanning out before us and you
[08:20.240 --> 08:26.840]  have joined us today on a maiden voyage yes I've been on the radio for 16 years but I
[08:26.840 --> 08:34.760]  have never done a clip show we have a big favorite with millions of views online that's
[08:34.760 --> 08:44.360]  the Justin Bieber rant and also the LeBron James rant LeBron James rant got linked
[08:44.360 --> 08:49.960]  on drudge and the clips of it actually got played on CNN and the reason I get so angry
[08:49.960 --> 08:58.120]  during these rants is that you will see the public obsessed with every tiny nuance hyper
[08:58.120 --> 09:05.680]  ventilating over what Justin Bieber is doing or where LeBron James is going to go bounce
[09:05.680 --> 09:11.720]  a basketball and throw it into a little hoop but they don't care about the dollar being
[09:11.720 --> 09:16.960]  devalued which is destroying their spending power in their future they they don't care
[09:16.960 --> 09:23.400]  about the executive branch grabbing and seizing power and launching wars without congressional
[09:23.400 --> 09:29.520]  approval they don't care about the CIA caught over and over again shipping in narcotics
[09:29.520 --> 09:35.320]  and in the police putting people in jail who are caught using drugs they don't get upset
[09:35.320 --> 09:41.080]  about the attorney general caught red-handed lying to Congress about directing the FBI
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.960]  Justice Department APF to ship tens of thousands of high-powered firearms into Mexico so they
[09:46.960 --> 09:52.920]  could then blame the ensuing crime wave because they gave them the drug cartels on our second
[09:52.920 --> 09:56.880]  amendment and they think you're so stupid now the attorney general's come out and is
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.320]  announcing all this new gun control because of the violence and the guns they shipped
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.880]  in that's how over the top they are because they think you're stupid because people have
[10:05.880 --> 10:11.120]  been raised from birth to be obsessed with issues of little or no significance and the
[10:11.120 --> 10:16.520]  father of modern propaganda and advertising Edward Bernays to be specific wrote several
[10:16.520 --> 10:22.160]  books and bragged going back more than 80 years ago that they were by design dumbing
[10:22.160 --> 10:27.560]  down the media and training people to obsess on issues of little or no significance so
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.880]  that you wouldn't be concerned with the real world so the social engineers could go on
[10:33.880 --> 10:39.820]  controlling our planet and changing our planet in a way that they saw fit they are the map
[10:39.820 --> 10:47.160]  makers of our mind they are controlling our destinies they are misdirecting us and so much
[10:47.160 --> 10:54.200]  of what people think of as daily life in this world today is nothing but a false Madison
[10:54.200 --> 11:00.880]  Avenue scripted fake identity and that's why people are so depressed that's why the IQs
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.720]  are dropping that's why the test scores are dropping that's why physically the sperm
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.600]  counts are dropping and cancer is exploding because we live in a scientific dictatorship
[11:12.600 --> 11:20.600]  we live in a false construct of total manipulation and I'm calling the system out the first
[11:20.600 --> 11:26.840]  clip again is the ridiculous LeBron James piece and then we're going to get into my
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.600]  Justin Bieber I know his name's Bieber that's the joke Bieber rant then we're going to go
[11:32.600 --> 11:38.800]  out to break and come back with something even more powerful stay with us I give you
[11:38.800 --> 11:46.600]  the LeBron James worship fest societies don't change whether it was the Roman Empire or
[11:46.600 --> 11:54.000]  Nazi Germany the population is obsessed with sports and petty celebrities and the United
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.680]  States is no different MSNBC the New York Times they're all reporting that we are going
[11:59.680 --> 12:06.400]  into a depression one of the greatest depressions in world history and our decadent slob like
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.400]  public and that's not everyone but large percentages of the public could care less
[12:11.400 --> 12:17.360]  they're not involved in their communities we've got 46 states on the verge of bankruptcy
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.760]  the government's raising taxes on every level the border with Mexico is collapsing Mexico
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.880]  has collapsed and the public doesn't care because the media has set the agenda and they
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.360]  tell you to care about LeBron James and his decision and he's playing into it and is
[12:33.360 --> 12:38.640]  going to announce his stupid decision it doesn't matter what basketball team he goes to this
[12:38.640 --> 12:45.200]  is a distraction by design we have the governor of the state he's currently living in in a
[12:45.200 --> 12:51.680]  bizarre we are LeBron we are the world literal worship fest with hundreds of celebrities
[12:51.680 --> 13:08.280]  this is sickening imagine the Ohio government begging and pleading on television and serenading
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.440]  LeBron James with hundreds of other celebrities when Ohio is one of the states slated to go
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.760]  completely bankrupt we're going into a depression they're about to watch world war three with
[13:18.760 --> 13:25.640]  Iran openly Fox News is reporting as if it's a good thing in New York state in Illinois
[13:25.640 --> 13:30.760]  that troops have helped arrest thousands of citizens and are doing gun sweeps in people's
[13:30.760 --> 13:37.480]  homes and searching people's cars we're going in to martial law offshore banks have overthrown
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.640]  the US they've stolen tens of trillions of dollars like we're some third world country
[13:41.640 --> 13:45.440]  they're looting everything's going to hell in a handbasket so if you want to know why
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.720]  your children have no future you want to know why you're bankrupt if you want to know why
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.720]  you're in debt if you want to know why you have no future and have lost your job or getting
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.680]  your pay cut it's because your priorities are wrong it's because you let that idiot box
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.120]  the television program you since the days that your mother and father set you in front
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.920]  of the TV for 12 hours a day in your crap filled diapers it's not too late to admit
[14:08.920 --> 14:16.960]  we're a sick decadent degenerate society crumbling we are Rome it's 410 we're about to collapse
[14:16.960 --> 14:20.880]  ladies and gentlemen I know you won't know you know about LeBron James you don't know
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.220]  410 is when Rome completely fell to Alaric the Visigoth leader you better learn history
[14:25.220 --> 14:30.800]  this is dangerous don't say you weren't warned the globalist engineers the globalist social
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.800]  engineers look at you and how pathetic you are and how the whole world is waiting to
[14:35.800 --> 14:41.760]  see where LeBron James goes the social controllers look at you and see how you're obsessed with
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.960]  LeBron James and they decide we got a bunch of schmucks we've got a bunch of idiots we
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.360]  got a bunch of morons right where we want them let's destroy their society let's loot
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.320]  it let's pass carbon taxes let's expand NAFTA and GATT let's announce an end to the dollar
[14:55.320 --> 14:58.920]  as the global reserve currency you know what that means we've already lost almost all our
[14:58.920 --> 15:02.920]  industry we're already in a depression when they get rid of the dollar as the world reserve
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.000]  currency your life as you know it is officially over you're going to be a third world slave
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.040]  like they are in Mexico or Nigeria and you know what those people down there at least
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.600]  know why they're slaves you are so stupid and so focused on crap you'll probably still
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.960]  be talking about Lindsay Lohan when you're living as a homeless person on the street
[15:20.960 --> 15:25.960]  my friends we've got to set our priorities and set them now liberty or tyranny you've
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.880]  got to wake up and decide what is important to you saving our republic stopping the globalist
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.240]  takeover or knowing all the mindless trivia about LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan there
[15:36.240 --> 15:42.240]  isn't much more time I'm begging you to ask yourselves to look in the mirror and really
[15:42.240 --> 15:47.120]  realize how sick this is it's not bad like a basketball game but it is mentally ill
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.120]  and sick to buy into this manufactured hype and to have government officials that should
[15:52.120 --> 15:57.280]  be working for the people sitting there in these disgusting media spectacles worshiping
[15:57.280 --> 16:04.640]  somebody our role models our icons the people that our children look up to and model themselves
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.280]  after are not inventors and scientists and trailblazers anymore that's why America's gone
[16:09.280 --> 16:14.200]  from the greatest to the most pathetic in every statistical analysis you look at and
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.600]  it's only getting worse we still got a lot of great people in this country but with Pete
[16:17.600 --> 16:25.720]  Rose and LeBron James and Michael Vick being our heroes we're a joke we're clowns they've
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.400]  taken our heroes in our role models away ladies and gentlemen you have been warned and this
[16:30.400 --> 16:36.280]  whole LeBron James decision means absolutely nothing this obsession with petty issues
[16:36.280 --> 16:41.360]  of little or no significance is the modern version of bread and circus it is the opium
[16:41.360 --> 16:47.040]  of the masses and it's why we are dumbed down slaves with no future if we don't wake up
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.560]  look when you realize how fake it all is the football the basketball the the Lady Gaga
[16:52.560 --> 16:58.360]  the Justin Bieber you know who gives you these carbon tax messages they tell your kids they
[16:58.360 --> 17:03.720]  got to love Justin Bieber and then Bieber says hand in your guns pass the cyber security
[17:03.720 --> 17:09.240]  act and you know the police state's good and then and then your children are turned into
[17:09.240 --> 17:15.000]  mindless vassals who who now they they look up to some twit instead of looking up to Thomas
[17:15.000 --> 17:22.560]  Jefferson or or looking up to Nicola Tesla or looking up to Magellan I mean kids Magellan's
[17:22.560 --> 17:31.120]  a lot cooler than Justin Bieber he circumnavigated with one ship the entire planet he was killed
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.960]  by wild natives before they got back to Portugal and when they got back there was only like
[17:35.960 --> 17:41.360]  eleven people alive of the two hundred and something crew and the entire ship was rotting
[17:41.360 --> 17:48.400]  down to the water line that's destiny that's will that's striving that's being a trailblazer
[17:48.400 --> 17:54.400]  and explore going into space mathematics quantum mechanics the secrets of the universe it's
[17:54.400 --> 18:00.520]  all there life is fiery with its beauty it's incredible detail tuning into it they want

[19:23.080 --> 19:29.000]  to unlock minds once you unlock a mind once you unlock somebody then they can unlock their
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.400]  soul we can't unlock a soul only God can do that but we can unlock minds and once the
[19:34.400 --> 19:39.320]  mind is unlocked once the intellect is turned on then comes the discernment then comes the
[19:39.320 --> 19:46.880]  awakening of the soul then comes true enlightenment and empowerment so the globalists make you

[24:37.080 --> 24:43.560]  order and this short little rant from the past is where i tell the globalist what i think of them
[24:43.560 --> 24:52.440]  and i have trouble finding the word to describe just how venomous and sickening and rotten these
[24:52.440 --> 24:57.880]  control freaks are the global is to organize they're corrupt they're a bunch of thieving parasites
[24:57.880 --> 25:07.720]  they use our money against us and it's um people are waking up though a lot of good things are
[25:07.720 --> 25:13.880]  happening and so i should be more positive i just have trouble looking at obama and trouble looking
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.440]  at bush and then looking at all these local criminals and looking at all the stuff they do
[25:18.440 --> 25:25.560]  i'm sick of them i have more than a hatred for them i have a disgust a disdain a uh
[25:25.560 --> 25:38.920]  um a tectonic tightness explosive anathema they are anathema i tell you that i hate them or
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.760]  disgusted i want to be away from them i don't like them i don't like looking at them i don't
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.960]  like hearing them i don't like all their tics and all their enjoyment of petty power i hate their
[25:49.960 --> 25:57.480]  worldliness i hate their pettiness i hate the fact that they don't enjoy beauty or decency or honor or
[25:57.480 --> 26:04.040]  or see i start thinking about them and they just it just the image of them starts going into my
[26:04.040 --> 26:10.040]  mind and that's something i can't allow i know these people i know what makes them tick i've
[26:10.040 --> 26:15.880]  looked into their minds i've studied them i know who they are and i just can't believe we are this
[26:15.880 --> 26:24.680]  low to let this type of worthless trash run things this type of innocence destroying decency
[26:24.680 --> 26:35.240]  destroying uh i just uh it hurts my soul folks and my spirit just rises up against them to just a
[26:35.240 --> 26:41.320]  level i just want to get my hands around the throats you want to get down to the bottom line
[26:41.320 --> 26:49.320]  and you know they feel the same they don't like us they want to get their hands around our throats
[26:49.320 --> 26:55.400]  too and they are every day you drink that damn tap water every day you shoot your kids up and eat
[26:55.400 --> 27:02.440]  the gmo food and they're just going to go on hurting us and killing us and screwing us and lying to
[27:02.440 --> 27:09.400]  us and i'm sick of it and they take our normal instincts of manhood and valor and honor and
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.720]  they twist it and use it for their own aims they got the best of us working for them it's a load of
[27:15.720 --> 27:25.320]  crap i just swear on the altar of god that we're going to beat you i swear i'm going to do whatever
[27:25.320 --> 27:33.160]  it takes to beat you and the people out there are making that oath as well all right we're back
[27:33.160 --> 27:38.360]  there was my new world order rant describing what i really think of the globalist now i want to
[27:38.360 --> 27:44.280]  describe what i think and when i envision humanity good people in humanity the vast majority of us
[27:44.280 --> 27:52.040]  to be this long 30 minute piece will go into the next hour it's titled what we really are i've had
[27:52.040 --> 27:58.360]  so many requests by listeners and people on the street including media folks nationally tell me to
[27:58.360 --> 28:06.440]  do more pieces like this you know discuss the positive nature of humanity versus the more nasty
[28:06.440 --> 28:15.720]  uh environs that the globalists are attempting to expand against free humanity but at the end of the
[28:15.720 --> 28:22.760]  day humans are dynamic powerful creatures that need to be challenged and that's why the social
[28:22.760 --> 28:31.640]  engineers have really built a artificial environment for us they have built a artificial uh domain
[28:31.640 --> 28:37.400]  it's a box or a map uh that they have basically created and then they use the peer pressure
[28:37.400 --> 28:44.120]  messages in the mind rotting dinosaur media and so what i beg listeners to do especially new
[28:44.120 --> 28:51.320]  listeners is to not believe a word i say but to simply recognize the inherent truth that on this
[28:51.320 --> 28:57.400]  planet there are things going on that we're not aware of that there are scientific discoveries
[28:57.400 --> 29:03.080]  that haven't been made yet and that there are criminal groups doing things behind the scenes
[29:03.080 --> 29:07.720]  to manipulate and control our environment and that we're not getting the whole story and that
[29:07.720 --> 29:13.720]  the system has been caught lying over and over again even when the truth suits them they have
[29:13.720 --> 29:19.960]  created an artificial environment for us to try to uh claim that they're keeping us safe but but
[29:19.960 --> 29:24.280]  really what they're doing is creating a nanny state to enslave us they don't want us to be
[29:24.280 --> 29:29.560]  adventurous they don't want us to be individualistic they want to sell us tyranny in the name of
[29:30.280 --> 29:37.640]  giving us some type of utopia when all they're delivering is a kill system masquerading as
[29:37.640 --> 29:43.080]  humanitarianism so we're going to come back with this special breakdown of what we really are
[29:43.080 --> 29:57.160]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:05.400 --> 33:14.600]  you take them all the man what is it to be a human being homo sapiens sapiens that's the scientific
[33:14.600 --> 33:22.520]  name of our species for tens of thousands of years our ancestors struggled fought and died
[33:22.520 --> 33:28.600]  against other tribes of humans against saber-tooth cats and woolly mammoths bingle tigers
[33:30.360 --> 33:39.640]  to simply survive the main mission of our species has been to survive on a hostile planet
[33:40.440 --> 33:46.760]  that we developed on and now you have people in the lap of luxury with all the entertainment
[33:46.760 --> 33:52.360]  more food than they can eat even the poorest of our society in the western world is much
[33:52.360 --> 33:59.800]  better off than our ancestors living like kings and we don't appreciate it and this is the big
[33:59.800 --> 34:09.240]  secret we don't appreciate it because we're not designed to thrive in a society of milk and honey
[34:09.240 --> 34:22.360]  of plenty we are designed to thrive in an atmosphere of incredible danger and of amazing pressures we
[34:22.360 --> 34:31.080]  are an incredible species that has brought you Beethoven and minds like albert einstein human
[34:31.080 --> 34:42.440]  minds more than 110 years ago developed the theory of atomics max plank the human mind created
[34:42.440 --> 34:51.400]  equations that can destroy entire cities we can do incredible things positive things and
[34:51.400 --> 35:00.280]  destructive things humanity is magic humanity can literally reach to the stars and beyond
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.600]  the development of our species at this point is only the larval stage and we're now going
[35:08.600 --> 35:15.160]  into a phase where we're literally in a cocoon and about to metamorphosize into something else
[35:15.160 --> 35:25.240]  and during this time of flux our species all the genetic and racial memories all of the inherited
[35:25.240 --> 35:35.800]  memories aren't integrating with this modern society of convenience and all the food we can eat
[35:35.800 --> 35:43.560]  and the entertainment and the decadence because the pleasure centers of the mind and the things
[35:43.560 --> 35:50.840]  that the controlled corporate media force feeds are only a limited spectrum of our intellect and
[35:50.840 --> 35:59.560]  what we are our ancestors struggled and fought and died against the elements against wild animals
[35:59.560 --> 36:11.400]  against barbarous tribes of fellow humans to succeed and success was to simply survive and
[36:11.400 --> 36:17.640]  now we see these giant decadent masses of people who aren't appreciating life who are becoming
[36:17.640 --> 36:24.440]  nihilistic who have a death wish who hate everything that's good and wholesome you see on the internet
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.440]  all these videos the last few years where it shows beautiful women abusing animals this is the new
[36:30.440 --> 36:39.160]  pornography people are becoming psychopathic they're degenerating psychologically i want you to
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.280]  look yourself in the mirror and really ask yourself a question meditate on it think about it
[36:45.080 --> 36:52.200]  what is it to be a human being who are we as a species we're creatures that live on a beautiful
[36:52.200 --> 36:59.400]  planet orbiting a sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the milky way galaxy
[37:00.200 --> 37:07.240]  our species developed on this planet over hundreds of thousands of years our ancestors
[37:07.240 --> 37:12.920]  fought to survive against the elements against wild animals and against tribes
[37:15.080 --> 37:21.720]  survival was success for our species it was the french philosopher victor hugo that said
[37:22.280 --> 37:29.000]  adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters and in that simple statement you understand the
[37:29.000 --> 37:38.040]  human experience and who we are people that have plenty of food and housing and clothing they
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.800]  are depressed they're unhappy they feel like they're missing something in their life because
[37:43.800 --> 37:51.000]  fundamentally they don't understand what it is to be human survival and raising your children to be
[37:51.000 --> 37:59.800]  happy and successful and healthy is victory every generation making the world a better place in the
[37:59.800 --> 38:06.520]  previous one is victory people have been taught by the corporate brainwashing machine to be
[38:07.320 --> 38:13.160]  self-centered to not care about others and in that they've lost their very humanity they don't
[38:13.160 --> 38:19.480]  understand that life is transitory we're just like the flowers that come up every year in the spring
[38:19.480 --> 38:26.200]  and blossom throughout the summer and then die in the fall and winter but through the species
[38:26.200 --> 38:34.520]  through humankind we live on and everything we do to each other affects the species itself
[38:35.320 --> 38:40.520]  madison avenue tries to make you feel inadequate so that you'll buy into their products so that
[38:40.520 --> 38:47.960]  you'll feel like you need to accept their mode of control if you're going to be fulfilled and the
[38:47.960 --> 38:54.840]  more people buy into that the more nihilistic and destructive they get we have a society that is
[38:54.840 --> 39:05.400]  collapsing that is crumbling because we build up the drug addicts sports icons and hollywood people
[39:05.400 --> 39:13.640]  and all of these rock stars who are the worst expression of humanity because they become so
[39:13.640 --> 39:20.360]  wealthy that they're unhappy they're not appreciative of the basic things they have they've lost sight
[39:20.360 --> 39:28.680]  of that secret that humanity was forged under incredible degradation on the edge of extinction
[39:29.720 --> 39:37.800]  if you go back more than a hundred years ago in 1900 max plank developed the theory of atomics
[39:37.800 --> 39:46.280]  the equations that sprung from his mind created nuclear power and yes the atom bomb that can
[39:46.280 --> 39:54.280]  destroy entire cities humanity is made in the image of god we are an incredible species with a
[39:54.280 --> 40:02.600]  destiny to populate the stars to go beyond the stars we can't even imagine our full potential
[40:02.600 --> 40:08.600]  just like somebody six thousand years ago in mesopotamia or egypt couldn't imagine a cell
[40:08.600 --> 40:17.720]  phone or a 747 couldn't imagine an MRI or a firearm we take it for granted like it's nothing
[40:19.080 --> 40:25.240]  we don't appreciate the good things in life the simple things in life and so people are
[40:25.240 --> 40:30.680]  becoming more and more decanted more and more self-destructive suicide is off the charts
[40:30.680 --> 40:38.520]  upwards of 20 of the population is on psychotropic mind-numbing drugs people don't feel fulfilled
[40:38.520 --> 40:46.280]  they complain that life is boring life is boring you are on a planet with all of this incredible
[40:46.280 --> 40:53.640]  biodiversity and all of this beauty and creativity you need to realize that just being conscious
[40:53.640 --> 41:00.840]  just simply being alive and being able to struggle in whatever your pursuit is whether
[41:00.840 --> 41:06.360]  it's art or literature or whether you're an auto mechanic or a doctor or a lawyer or a filmmaker
[41:06.360 --> 41:11.800]  it doesn't matter it's all about that human experience and what you add to the species
[41:11.800 --> 41:20.680]  what you add to the society individuals die and selfish individuals die before they physically
[41:20.680 --> 41:29.400]  perish and they don't realize that it is an experience of humanity of homo sapiens sapiens
[41:29.400 --> 41:36.200]  of our species to add to humanity's wealth their intellectual wealth our physical wealth
[41:36.920 --> 41:42.280]  and that when you truly join with the human spirit and everything that is decent and wholesome
[41:42.280 --> 41:48.440]  and good everything that your conscience your compass tells you is good that you will bloom
[41:48.440 --> 41:54.680]  and that you will literally accelerate towards a higher level of enlightenment but the minute that
[41:54.680 --> 42:03.160]  you buy into this corporate culture of death you are destroyed learn to recognize and appreciate
[42:03.160 --> 42:12.120]  and defend and protect beauty don't give in to that sociopathic or even psychopathic
[42:12.120 --> 42:20.920]  uh desire to get into the dark side and destructiveness become conscious of the fact that you individually
[42:20.920 --> 42:30.280]  are only alive one time in this earth suit that are intellect inhabits but that through a love of
[42:30.280 --> 42:38.440]  humanity and a love of creativity and investigation and the love of exploration that you will live
[42:38.440 --> 42:45.880]  forever and that the human experience has always been about a struggle against things that are good
[42:45.880 --> 42:53.240]  and uplifting and things that are destructive destruction is easier it's quicker it's very
[42:53.240 --> 43:00.920]  seductive but when you begin to try to literally tune in to the essence that is our species and
[43:00.920 --> 43:07.320]  our true potential you will be able to have a glimpse of wider horizons that open up into a
[43:07.320 --> 43:17.480]  wide universe of possibilities and you will be on your knees at a spiritual level realizing
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.920]  the incredible blessing and honor it is to be a human being who has been given the gift of consciousness
[43:27.560 --> 43:35.000]  i'm going to say it again your body will fail you will die but the ideas the inventions
[43:35.000 --> 43:42.360]  the works that you commit while you are alive and conscious will have reverberations throughout time
[43:42.360 --> 43:49.320]  and space for eternity you will live forever through your children and through other humans
[43:49.320 --> 43:56.040]  children this is the great secret and the great evil of the new world order engineers is that
[43:56.040 --> 44:05.240]  they fully understand this primal rule and they have made the greedy selfish decision to keep
[44:05.240 --> 44:12.840]  these great truths from humanity that would fulfill and empower our species they are afraid
[44:12.840 --> 44:19.320]  of you finding your true potential and power because when you become enlightened and awakened
[44:19.320 --> 44:27.480]  and expand your horizons you threaten their monopoly of power and control the solution
[44:28.680 --> 44:36.920]  is looking at you in the mirror and you won't develop yourself overnight no one does life
[44:36.920 --> 44:44.440]  is a process you have to make that decision you have to access those racial memories that all
[44:44.440 --> 44:52.600]  humans have your instincts you have to understand that the scientific controllers that manipulate
[44:52.600 --> 44:59.000]  this technological dictatorship of the mind are afraid of the human species they know the truth
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.840]  they understand the wider possibilities of humanity they know that our species is
[45:08.360 --> 45:12.920]  stronger when it's under adversity they understand that we need to be challenged
[45:12.920 --> 45:19.880]  and instead they create a bed of decadence and evil and sell it to you like it's risky and cool
[45:19.880 --> 45:25.960]  and risque and avant-garde to be decadent and destructive to not care about your fellow humans
[45:25.960 --> 45:31.720]  because they want to isolate you so they can control you and dominate every facet of your life
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.960]  but at the end of your time on this planet you need to be proud of what you've done you need to
[45:39.960 --> 45:47.960]  be proud of how you've lived this is a message to the future a message to free humanity
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.400]  that we don't let our species be destroyed that we don't let ourselves become dehumanized
[45:55.400 --> 46:01.800]  it is the greatest crime in history that the establishment that the social engineers are
[46:01.800 --> 46:09.320]  dumbing us down by design that they are nurturing and funding and activating and promoting all of
[46:09.320 --> 46:15.560]  the most base instincts and things that are destructive so that we can be basically damaged
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.680]  goods that they can control and use as their biological androids as their slaves we have
[46:22.680 --> 46:29.240]  been destroyed by our own prosperity we have become anesthetized by all the entertainment
[46:29.240 --> 46:35.560]  and the food and the drugs we have to rediscover the fact that this is a human experience a struggle
[46:35.560 --> 46:44.360]  by our species to survive and to grow and to become even greater that's what it is to be
[46:44.360 --> 46:49.960]  a human and when you look at the beauty around you when you realize just how good and special
[46:49.960 --> 46:57.320]  life is when you appreciate it then you will be fulfilled the western world is crumbling
[46:57.880 --> 47:04.200]  because we are individually crumbling on the inside because we've bought in to the propaganda
[47:04.200 --> 47:13.000]  of Madison Avenue because we have let the controllers of our society misdirect our basic
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.880]  human drive and instinct to love and to fight and to be passionate and real and the global
[47:19.880 --> 47:26.200]  controllers quest to domesticate and dumb us down so they can control and dominate the future
[47:26.200 --> 47:36.520]  they have damaged the human species they have misdirected our prime directive to grow and to
[47:36.520 --> 47:44.680]  build and to search and to trailblaze and explore but the minute you start exploring and creating
[47:44.680 --> 47:51.560]  and loving life is the minute that the pendulum begins to swing from tyranny and dehumanization
[47:51.560 --> 47:59.960]  towards liberty and a literal valhalla for future generations and it's that quest
[48:01.240 --> 48:07.320]  that quest towards being a better species that we will truly find our destiny you have become
[48:07.320 --> 48:13.640]  compartmentalized we all have of course you know about the pyramidal power structure where only the
[48:13.640 --> 48:18.920]  very tip top understands all the secrets knows how it all fits together it's similar to legos
[48:18.920 --> 48:24.760]  individually it doesn't make anything but together it makes it greater whole and it's how the military
[48:24.760 --> 48:31.160]  and intelligence agencies operate it's a need to know basis and if you look at this as a ship
[48:31.160 --> 48:37.400]  as nation states as countries as ships you've got people in catering people in food people in
[48:38.200 --> 48:43.160]  laundry in cleaning you've got the security force you've got the people down in the engine room
[48:43.160 --> 48:50.200]  and the engine room is basically the bureaucracy and the courts but who is the captain the captain
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.960]  knows everything going on that ship the captain is commanding all those different separate parts
[48:55.960 --> 49:02.360]  and that's a perfect example of globalism and how they use compartmentalization to keep the
[49:02.360 --> 49:07.800]  mass of people on the ship unaware of the larger picture they're not outside the box
[49:08.440 --> 49:12.200]  so you've got the captain of the ship he's in control of all the different aspects all the
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.480]  different pieces that come together the subgroups on the ship they only know their specific duty
[49:17.480 --> 49:24.280]  but the captain he has the big picture over the ship over the nation well what is globalization
[49:25.240 --> 49:30.040]  globalization is where there's an international company bigger than the nations bigger than all
[49:30.040 --> 49:37.560]  the ships that controls and dominates and finances all those ships and that's international banking
[49:37.560 --> 49:43.800]  cartels they create endless trillions of fiat currency and they buy the whole world with it
[49:43.800 --> 49:50.520]  it's a hat trick it's a fraud it's a magician's parlor scam and that's what's happening so not
[49:50.520 --> 49:55.160]  only do we have an evil captain the rest of the ship isn't aware of what's going on but they know
[49:55.160 --> 50:01.320]  the direction they're going in is bad but the captain himself is just an agent to the globalist
[50:01.320 --> 50:08.440]  that control all the ships the new world order are truly the captains and the shipping magnet
[50:08.440 --> 50:15.800]  owners of this global dehumanization system the globalists don't care about you and your family
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.560]  they've got all this slick propaganda about how they want to take your rights to keep you safe
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.120]  they want to naked body scan you in the airports and have surveillance blimps and face scanning
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.160]  and license plate scanning cameras to keep you safe they claim it's for little men in caves in
[50:29.160 --> 50:34.440]  central asia that want to come and kill you but when you research you find out those men in caves
[50:34.440 --> 50:40.360]  are financed by the intelligence agencies to stage the crises to scare you into running into the
[50:40.360 --> 50:50.600]  arms of the globalist conservatively hundreds of thousands of iraqis died during the war of 2003
[50:50.600 --> 50:58.120]  through 2011 we will continue with the special report what we really are after these important

[54:15.640 --> 54:22.280]  people 20 years ago our government would criticize china and it's authoritarian policy of taking
[54:22.280 --> 54:28.760]  buddhist and fallen gong and others and executing them and harvesting their organs but now our media
[54:28.760 --> 54:33.560]  our state department our government says nothing we all know the nazis tortured people and they were
[54:33.560 --> 54:37.800]  the bad guys we all know that the northern vietnamese tortured our troops so the north koreans
[54:37.800 --> 54:44.440]  they were the bad guys but now we're told torture is good torture is moral the heroes on television
[54:44.440 --> 54:51.800]  in the dramas and the cop shows torture people you are being bathed i am being bathed and conditioned
[54:51.800 --> 54:57.800]  to accept classical oppression classical evil it's happened over and over and over again in
[54:57.800 --> 55:02.680]  history and when the population becomes decadent and stops caring and stops getting involved
[55:02.680 --> 55:09.240]  and turns loose of any responsibility evil floods in to all the major systems of power
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.920]  in the government and in the corporations and society implodes like we've seen in mexico
[55:14.920 --> 55:21.640]  and north korea and so many other places the globalists see you as a product they see you as a
[55:21.640 --> 55:29.320]  dumbed-down sheep a biological android to be used to serve them they are arrogant they are hateful
[55:29.320 --> 55:37.240]  and free humanity needs to find its guts again and stand up and say i am not your property i am
[55:37.240 --> 55:43.560]  not your slave i'm a human being i have value and i am not going to submit to your tyranny
[55:43.560 --> 55:49.720]  we need to find our humanity we need to find our will to resist they have all these gladiatorial
[55:49.720 --> 55:54.760]  diversions all these vestigial sports games were men are supposed to put all their tribal energies
[55:54.760 --> 56:02.920]  into the simulated gladiatorial wars the energy of resistance and war and of standing up against
[56:02.920 --> 56:08.440]  oppression is engineered into you because our species wouldn't have survived and you wouldn't
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.680]  be here if your ancestors hadn't stood up for themselves and we all need to find that tectonic
[56:14.680 --> 56:20.680]  energy of liberty and turn it loose and set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[56:20.680 --> 56:25.880]  we live in a country and a world where world government is openly being established and
[56:25.880 --> 56:31.080]  where trillions in tax money is being paid to shadowy offshore banks and when congress asked
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.960]  the federal reserve where did the money go they tell congress we're not going to tell you this
[56:35.960 --> 56:42.120]  is an outrageous affront in our face we're being trained to accept police tasering us for no reason
[56:42.120 --> 56:47.320]  we're being trained to accept naked body scanners we're being domesticated and having our will broken
[56:47.320 --> 56:54.840]  so that as individuals and as a society our women our children and all of us can be conditioned
[56:54.840 --> 57:00.440]  to become nothing but cattle to this ruling elite and so many of you that serve the system
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.120]  believe that you're on a power trip and that you're part of the control mechanism and that
[57:04.120 --> 57:09.160]  you're on the winning team if you'd actually studied history and sociology and anthropology
[57:09.160 --> 57:14.040]  you'd know that the first group that gets exterminated are those that help bring the
[57:14.040 --> 57:21.160]  tyranny to power you have been warned our society is crumbling and degenerating they're filling the
[57:21.160 --> 57:27.480]  vaccines full of eugenic chemicals to sterilize us to brain damage us and to make us more
[57:27.480 --> 57:32.840]  servile and more submissive and we've got all the major foundation documents and government
[57:32.840 --> 57:38.520]  documents that admit it you have been warned there is no way you can deny this information all you
[57:38.520 --> 57:44.360]  need to do is go look at what i'm covering here to find out that it's true for yourself you notice
[57:44.360 --> 57:48.840]  that all these private mercenaries are now operating all over the world but also in the united states
[57:48.840 --> 57:52.840]  against the american people and the police are becoming more and more armed and they're now
[57:52.840 --> 57:57.720]  starting to station military in our major cities the balance of power is shifting towards the state
[57:57.720 --> 58:02.600]  with physical force because they know that you're waking up they know you're becoming aware they
[58:02.600 --> 58:07.800]  know that you're peacefully starting to take your communities back one mind at a time and so they're
[58:07.800 --> 58:13.400]  moving in to demonize individuals being armed and they're moving into demonize the second amendment
[58:13.400 --> 58:17.800]  that is not only the individual right to keep their arms but the fact that the main police force
[58:17.800 --> 58:22.520]  for security is the american people every time there's a hurricane every time there's an emergency
[58:22.520 --> 58:27.560]  when people really need guns government comes in in new orleans in north carolina and says you
[58:27.560 --> 58:33.960]  can't own guns you've got to turn them in okay folks we'll be right back to start the second hour

[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:09.720]  two on this special broadcast where we cover a full spectrum of information and we're going to
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:16.440]  conclude the special report what we really are and they demonize the militia that's part of our
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:22.040]  second amendment and to bring down the militia the government has been caught creating racist
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.160]  and out of control groups that are cartoonish in their camouflage to make the idea of an armed
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:35.080]  citizenry look stupid realize what they're doing to you we are the people we are the government
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.240]  we created this government of course the people in a free nation are armed only slaves are disarmed
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.960]  the first people to have their rights taken to own guns were african americans in this country
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:52.760]  after the civil war gun control is a tool of enslavement only freemen and women have the right
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.880]  to keep and bear weapons you get a democrat in office and everybody gets angry at them because
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.960]  they're carrying out the globalist agenda then they put a republican in office and the people
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.600]  get angry because they carry out the same agenda then they put another democrat in and it goes on
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:12.040]  and on and on and the office of the presidency has been given all this unconstitutional power
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.240]  with executive orders and all this warrant was wiretapping and all the police state control
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.240]  the last time our congress declared war was world war two the congress represents the people
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.560]  it declares the war then the president executes it but we have the office of the presidency
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.960]  being turned into this demigod position but it's a hollow position they're not even really a dictator
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.800]  they are a spokesperson for the national security council and the private corporate dictatorship
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.360]  that's been created think about sodium fluoride in the water the majority of fda scientists have
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.440]  come out in the last decade and said take it out of the water it increases cancer it causes
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.680]  reductions in fertility it causes all these other serious problems but the government says we're
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:59.480]  going to force medicate you supposedly for your teeth and then they say oh we're going to force
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.920]  you to take vaccines and every year hundreds of new vaccines get approved and the big pharma companies
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.920]  come in and lobby the government to try to mandate that you take those shots as a free human you
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.360]  have no responsibility to take their vaccines stand up and say no you're not going to put things in
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:24.520]  my body more than a decade ago i received secret documents from a nurse in san antonio detailing
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.800]  that for more than three decades blood was taken not just in the united states but in every industrialized
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:35.160]  country from newborn babies parents were told it was going for a blood test but it was really going
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:41.640]  to a secret global bio weapons database so they have your genetic number and can even make a specific
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:49.160]  bio weapon for you individually in the last three years they've now declassified this information
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.120]  in your face this government is so secretive so creepy that they've been taking your blood
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.200]  worldwide we're already under a world government ladies and gentlemen we need to discover and realize
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.720]  the magic that is all around us how wonderful life is we also have to learn to recognize corruption
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:11.480]  and evil and routed out and stand up against it we need to stop being so passive and realize
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.600]  that there are all these different agendas going on and become conscious of that fact and wake up
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.440]  and save this species in 1913 the private banks took over the country and set up the federal reserve
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.920]  they've run up our national credit card they've used us to build their empire we've taken the
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.360]  blame for all of these imperial wars launched by these private robber barons and now the globalists
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:38.680]  are just going to move on the united states is being destroyed by design the empire that we've
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.600]  become is being destroyed by design and everyone instinctively knows it so instead of having a
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.400]  fatalistic i don't care about the world screw everybody attitude decide that you're going to
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.320]  wake up and stand up and get involved with others to defeat this dehumanization think about your
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:02.440]  ancestors they didn't give up under adversity under starvation under warring tribes attacking
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:09.640]  them cannibals wild animals earth changes they struggled a lot of people didn't make it but
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.520]  your ancestors struggled and went through hell regardless of what color you are whether you're
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.960]  german jewish chinese mexican it doesn't matter and worked their fingers to the bone and many of
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:26.440]  them died so you could be here today and have what you've got let's not let a bunch of control freaks
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.240]  take control of our society they've learned how humans operate they know the secrets i know
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.480]  now you know these secrets stand up reclaim your humanity we could smash these parasites
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.000]  and stand up for liberty does that mean we're going to find some utopia that everything's
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.040]  going to be fine no but if we give into corruption if we give up we know we're going to hell in a
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.640]  handbasket it's only when we stand up for something good and pure and strong that we've got a chance
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.880]  all right my friends we'll be right back after this quick break stay with us
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.160]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.800]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.920]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.760]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:40.120]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.600]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.520]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:56.600]  my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup.com or call
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:05.960]  1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:12.120]  last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:17.800]  underneath the americans at home i have turned the members influence on our president and congress
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.960]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:29.560]  to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:35.080]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.200]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.240]  who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.400]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:27.240]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:32.600]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.440]  the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:43.880]  the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making

[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:10.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:29.800]  me it's alex jones on the gcm radio network this next piece that we're about to play
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:39.080]  is where i'm in a particularly nasty and dark mood and i tend to spontaneously behave like this
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:50.360]  on the radio when i'm particularly disgusted by how over the top the corruption is how cartoonishly
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:58.360]  ridiculous it is that the establishment thinks that they can sell us pure tyranny
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:08.600]  oppression and despotism as if it's mother's milk and i think it really illustrates the
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:17.960]  complete and abject uh intellectual bankruptcy of the psychopaths and sociopaths and sadomasochists
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.840]  that have created this new world order system i think it really illustrates it uh to just go
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:29.480]  through it and talk about how wonderful it is and how good it is oh it's so great that the
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:36.680]  congress is becoming ceremonial it's so good that the diabetes is doubled it's so good that
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:42.040]  government admittedly puts cancer viruses and vaccines and injects children on record
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:49.160]  with polio shots with live polio in them knowingly because the sicky sweet globalist
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:57.240]  sit up there with this facade of lovingness uh while the hapless uh well-meaning really
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.920]  childlike public is run over so i guess at a subconscious level what i'm attempting to do
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:09.480]  when i get really nasty is break people out of their status quo shake them out of their mind
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:18.040]  numbed stupor uh or trance that they're in that's what i'm attempting to do and that's why i uh get
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:25.080]  on the air and uh you know sometimes just really let it all hang out because no matter how crazy
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.000]  the topics are that i talk about reality is so much more worse than i could even describe it
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.240]  and so really you know it gets old just sitting here saying i'm against all this evil you know why
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.520]  not sometimes play the devil's advocate and come at it from the perspective of the social engineers
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.760]  that see us as a stake on the table that see us as animals as cattle and so that's what i do uh in
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:59.080]  this next very dark piece and so without further ado i give you the dark side they've been trained
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:07.480]  to hate you and they're ready ha ha ha see that's tyranny the cops may be poor and they may have their
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:12.600]  pension funds taken but at least they got that battle gear at least people gotta give them respect
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.560]  at least they can strut around and all the foreigners pouring in making up the police force
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:24.680]  they got real power over americans they hated when they moved here ha ha it's gonna be a lot of fun
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:30.520]  for every tyrant and every control freak and every dim-witted loser who couldn't produce anything
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:36.520]  no the globalist have got jobs for them they got jobs and they're gonna hate they want your daughter
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.840]  they're gonna take her they want your wife they're gonna take her they want your business they're
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:46.440]  gonna take it you speak up to them you talk back to them they'll beat you within an inch of your life
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:52.440]  they'll gun you down and the news will call you a terrorist that's what tyranny's about is losers
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.680]  and criminals and scum and filth just dominating everyone and getting away with whatever they want
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.680]  they're turning the planet into a giant carnal house for control freaks and sadists
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.200]  plunge in state revenue dashes hopes of an easy budget fix legislators were hoping revenue would
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:21.960]  continue to expand projections for stalling deeper cuts and further tax acts but april's total was
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:31.320]  30 below what was expected leaving them with few options state tax collections plummeted unexpectedly
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:39.560]  unexpectedly you raised taxes on every level and everything implodes you knew exactly what you
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.440]  were doing that's right siege of the american people siege of state and local government
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:53.160]  it build them up get them all bloated and then knock them down state tax collections plummet
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:00.200]  unexpectedly in april wiping out months of steady gains that legislators hoped would ease their
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:07.480]  budget troubles and restore california's economic system faster than experts predicted such hope
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:15.560]  is now fading fast what was the other article we gave the 146 plus billion to the bankers in
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:22.760]  greece and now it's getting worse now the other now they need more give them more money give them

[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:34.040]  towns they're firing most the cops because all we need state police and federal swat teams we don't
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.360]  need cops that respond to crime anymore we don't have cops that respond to car wrecks anymore
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.520]  they're announcing all over the country no police are to raise revenue and to have riot police when

[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  oh government's so wonderful the private central central banks are so sweet and loving and they
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.480]  help us so much and we're just so thankful and how dare the states fight back as the borders
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:19.880]  implode and mexico collapses and say they might actually arrest illegal aliens oh that's so terrible
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:27.080]  this is how disgusting it is and how sick of it i am of course every state's going to collapse
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.560]  of course they're going to take everything you've got and the government bureaucrats and bankers
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.200]  are going to move into your houses move into your farms they're going to raise taxes on every level
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.680]  they're going to have their way with you until you go into the county commission's courts and the
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:45.720]  city councils and the state houses until you realize the solution is looking you in the mirror
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.040]  and you're going to have to stand up on the front line against this tyranny because it's coming in
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:56.440]  like a flood here to me and be met in only one way head on
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:02.920]  one to put the pedal to the metal
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:13.720]  this isn't a game of chicken because we're not going to turn we are going to go straightforward
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.040]  i mean when you turn television on radio on it is almost 100 percent
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:31.080]  blanket absurdist brainwashing of how the government loves you and provides everything
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:37.320]  how the bankers love you how the economy is getting better when every indicator shows it
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:42.840]  is completely imploding i mean it's like dr paul craig robert said he's the father of ergonomics
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.520]  they are willfully destroying the economy by design but we have the u in we have morey strong
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.520]  we have ted turner we have all these globalists we have the goldman sacks internal documents
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.240]  they're the ones finding the carbon tax saying they want to destroy our economy you have the
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:02.840]  head of the imf saying the good times are over for europe and america we're going to take your
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:10.280]  pension funds that you paid into and guess what we got a bunch of people with low iqs with automatic
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.240]  weapons that are going to work for us and do what we tell them now despite the fact that they've
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.920]  tried to only hire dumb cops every time i mention this i get emails saying it is a true just google
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:27.720]  uh police department does not hire officers with over 100 iq and the internal documents show they
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:35.400]  want cops with about 85 iqs let me tell you 85 is is pretty stupid they can tie their shoe laces
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:43.240]  they can you know they can do basic things like that but you're an 85 iq you're you're talking
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.960]  about somebody almost at moron level 100 there have been lawsuits all over the country in dallas
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:56.200]  in philadelphia and new york and la that's been a policy in place for at least 20 years
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.600]  because you know the average cop listening to me right now can't even understand what i'm saying
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:06.680]  they just say terrorists terrorists you know the government made your son come up the government
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.320]  made the grass grow the government made and and and and they've been trained that the tea party
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.080]  people are terrorist and that the gun owners are terrorist and and they'll do whatever they're
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.160]  told you know don't make fun of the communist chinese you know if they got suckered into going
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:31.160]  along with it don't make fun of the nazis they got suckered in i studied the uh europe at that time
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:37.880]  and the germans were much more moral people than we are today and they bought the the live they
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.800]  they drank the kool-aid and let me tell you something we drank it we drank more than any modern
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.720]  society's ever guzzled down and this country is cursed and is going to hell okay you understand
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:57.320]  that we are on a burning ship crashing into icebergs right now we are on fire shields are down

[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.840]  oh it makes me so sad and look i know there are a lot of really smart police
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:20.040]  but the point is the government doesn't want smart ones and the smart people end up maybe maybe making
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:28.280]  sergeant after 25 30 years but the thuggish roid had nuts with devil tattoos all over them
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.880]  they're going to the top and you've heard the military call in who's trained with the police
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.320]  and it's the military over and over again that's actually shocked by the cops how they talk about
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.560]  us like we're scum we're trash how they can't wait to wage war on us and that doesn't mean every

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:19.480]  food the ultimate secret exposed you can see the two-part report we're going to air it in its entirety
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:25.640]  here in a moment but remember this is the essence of the social engineers the essence of the eugenicist
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:33.960]  who admit that it is their religion to covertly kill you with soft kill weapons they are cowards
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.840]  they don't meet you on the open battlefield no they impregnate your food your water the bisphenol
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:46.600]  a that coats the plastic bottles and tin cans with chemicals that kill you and that's why cancer
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.880]  is doubling that's why diabetes is doubling we are now reaping the whirlwind as these
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:58.440]  murderers soft kill us and here's just some of the proof my friends the information that you
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:05.640]  are about to witness from all of my years of research is the most important it's been hidden
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:14.440]  in plain view the entire time this is the ultimate secret and it's about to be exposed
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:26.680]  i have hundreds of government documents textbooks white papers where for over 80 years the elite
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:35.080]  of the western world have talked about adulterating food and water to sicken and sterilize the
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:41.480]  population for the purpose of eugenics it's all covered in the book eco science written by the
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:47.240]  white house science are john p haldron where they talk about a planetary police state to carry out
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:52.360]  the forced sterilization they also talk about covert systems in the water and food to sterilize
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.480]  the population now this was written decades ago before he was white house science are now suddenly
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.760]  the stuff in this book is all over the news they're selling it to the public as if it's a good thing
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:10.280]  you see here before you what an average person would buy when they went shopping at the store
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:17.240]  not everything here is bad for you but much of it has compounds and artificial chemicals that
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:23.160]  have been added that are extremely toxic and bad for your health and they have known this the entire
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:36.120]  time and they have approved them for use let's start with aspartame you cannot go to the grocery
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:43.080]  store now and buy any type of even regular sugar gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it in the
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.680]  1970s searl tried to get it approved and they couldn't it took them three separate times
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:54.760]  because in their own studies with monkeys large portions of them that were fed it died and contracted
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:00.120]  cancer now we have mainstream news articles in the e u has done a major study finding lower
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:08.280]  birth weights early birth and yes miscarriages from women that drink aspartame laden soft drinks
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:15.880]  like coke zero what is aspartame it is the fecal matter of the e coli bacteria they took it
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.320]  and genetically engineered it they can feed it toxic waste and then it defecates aspartame and
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:27.160]  it has so many bad health effects it's just unspeakable this is being done by design it's also
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:33.800]  very very addictive but let's just go ahead and move away from aspartame and talk about mcdonald's
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:41.800]  and chicken mcnuggets now i remember a decade ago or so reading health advisories claiming
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:48.360]  that a form of plastic that's using silly putty basically a type of silicone was in the chicken
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  mcnuggets but also in many other tv dinners and other foods it is illegal in every other nation
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.640]  in the world to add these chemicals to the food but it's not in the united states the big secret
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:05.560]  is all of this was done by design by the fda look at all the drugs they've approved and then it
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.280]  comes out later that they knowingly approve them when these drugs are causing heart attacks and
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.200]  cancer in the nurenberg trials it came out that the nazis were adding sodium fluoride to the
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:23.000]  water supply in the labor camps and death camps to make the population more docile and controllable
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.960]  there had been hundreds of university studies before hitler even came to power this is a form
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:34.440]  of forced medication they admit that one part per million of sodium fluoride more than doubles the
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:41.080]  chance of bone cancer in boys and men as the public became educated in the last few decades the
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.640]  government industry's response was to not just put it in water but to start adding it to thousands
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.880]  of products like children's water that's mixed with their formula or with their cereal they started
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:29:00.600]  adding as much as 900 parts per million in things like powdered eggs it causes reductions in iq it
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:08.200]  increases sterility or lack of fertility and it's being added to so many of the daily staples
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:14.840]  that we consume we'll get back to food additives in a moment but first i wanted to look at genetically
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.960]  modified organisms did you know for many years the american people have been eating clone beef
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:25.560]  and pork and now they're expanding out into other forms of meat let's look at sam and first
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:32.440]  major university studies conclusively have proven that the type of genetically modified salmon that
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:38.040]  is actually a cross species they've mixed other animal genes in with it that when this fish is
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:45.800]  introduced with wild natural salmon within 40 generations all the natural salmon are extinct
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:53.560]  the transmission will continue right after this quick break we're on the march the empires on the
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:30:04.600]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011

[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:22.840]  cross species chimera it is a mixture like something out of the island of dr maru something out of
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:29.080]  the nightmare more than 85 percent of the corn now consumed in the united states and it's also
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.000]  starting to trend that way in europe and canada is genetically engineered it grows its own
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  pesticide within the corn kernels so that insects won't eat it if the insects can't eat this and live
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.680]  what do you think's going to happen when lab rats or humans eat it we have literally hundreds of
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:55.320]  studies showing that not just monsanto's but other major gmo companies corn that's the majority of
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:01.960]  corn we're now eating today in the united states has been linked to organ failure in lab animals
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:08.520]  the studies also show massive increases in sterility in rats and guinea pigs that are fed
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:15.800]  not just gmo corn but gmo cotton seeds studies in india germany and the united states have
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:22.520]  conclusively shown that when they feed the cotton seeds left over from the cotton crop
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:28.200]  from these genetically modified varieties that the cows are having miscarriages they are having
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:35.320]  low birth weights or in many cases they're simply dying and what is in most processed foods genetically
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:41.640]  modified cotton seed oil major studies are also showing that genetically engineered crops are
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.040]  killing honey bees and monarch butterflies but they don't stop there now they claim they're
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:50.120]  coming out with a genetically engineered mosquito that's malaria proof that they're going to release
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:57.000]  in the open biosphere the very genetic code of the planet is being butchered in a hostile
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.760]  corporate takeover many years ago an executive from monsanto was quoted a national geographic
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:08.600]  is saying that that is their program that they want to basically have their crops and their
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:14.360]  organisms take over the entire biosphere of this planet and the major genetic engineer companies
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.920]  have focused mainly on eight major food crops now they're expanding out into hundreds and
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:25.160]  hundreds and hundreds of other plants literally changing the genetic code of the planet this is
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:31.480]  a genetic dictatorship this is genetic vandalism and that's why the Rockefellers the United Nations
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.680]  and others have built these giant armored seed vaults all over the world not just at the Arctic
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.640]  Circle and they admit they're doing it in case all of this gets out of hand that they'll have a type
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.600]  of Noah's Ark so all these fake environmental groups they never complain about this they never
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.960]  talk about true environmental degradation they want to put a tax on carbon dioxide that humans
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:58.920]  exhale that plants respirate from and carry out photosynthesis with as a way to shut down industrial
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:05.880]  society and control every facet of our lives that's the big secret this is a population reduction
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:16.760]  program it is an epidemic the sperm count has dropped in the western world exponentially even
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.720]  the government has been predicting within another generation almost everyone is going to be sterile
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:28.600]  this is the globalist religion this is their philosophy they want the planet for themselves
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.200]  the UN has said that their stated plan is an 80 population reduction you've heard Ted Turner
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.240]  call us useless eaters and feeders and say that 80 of us need to be killed you've heard Prince
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.480]  Phillips say he wants to come back as a virus to kill the majority of the world population Dr
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:48.760]  Eric Pionka Peter Singer it's all over the news where they tell us that we should only have one
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.160]  child because more than one is bad for the environment and that the recession is good
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:59.160]  for lowering our carbon footprint this is the big secret we live in a scientific dictatorship
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.200]  and the United States and England are the epicenter of this and it's expanding worldwide
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.760]  remember all the secret testing all the secret sterilization that went on in the United States
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.880]  in Europe remember what Hitler did he learned all of that from the eugenicist and the Rockefeller
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:20.680]  family in the United States this is a culture of death being pushed on you and your family and
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.320]  even if you think the world is overpopulated you need to understand that you're being targeted
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:34.760]  by this as well targeted by design recombinant bovine growth hormone in your milk making eight
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:41.480]  year old girls go into puberty and they should be going into puberty at 12 or 13 silicone
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.920]  in chicken mcnuggets and hundreds and hundreds of other processed foods aspartame that is the
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:53.800]  feces of genetically engineered bacteria that has incredible health problems that have been proven
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:59.880]  think for yourself it goes on and on abc news this goes back four years ago viral meat spray
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:07.160]  advancing food safety they spray a live virus on the meat to supposedly kill the bacteria
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.120]  this is a live vaccine they spray on most the meat you're consuming that you're buying from the
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:18.760]  store it gets even worse the petroleum distillates or toxic waste that's left over from petroleum
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:24.520]  refineries that refine oil into gasoline they take these tens of millions of pounds of toxic
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.840]  waste that's left over the fluoride the mercury the lead and they dump it on crops as supposed
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.480]  fertilizer and what a crops like tomatoes and corn and potatoes do they pull in all of those
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.640]  toxins out of the ground in fact scientists for many years have used plants to actually detoxify
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.240]  areas that have been contaminated and those plants are pulling all of this up and then you
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:55.240]  are eating it that's why the washington post reported in january of 2008 that a major study
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:01.400]  found that nearly a third of the 55 popular brand-name foods and beverage products were filled
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.600]  with mercury despite the fact that the people of europe for over 20 years have fought off
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.160]  all the genetically modified wheat and corn and other crops being planted in their nation
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:16.920]  now the EU is buckled and is accepting it the united states is literally a testing ground for
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.280]  all of this it's just automatically approved and the people that work for these corporations
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.440]  they're compartmentalized they don't know what's going on the people that work at these stores
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:31.320]  they have no idea what's happening this is affecting all of us this is hurting everyone
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:38.280]  many different forms of cancer are growing by thousands of percentage points diabetes
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:43.560]  all these different diseases and in major studies it's all been linked to the toxic
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.840]  additives that are in our food our water and i haven't even had time to get into msg i mean i've
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:54.440]  interviewed brain surgeons neurologists scientists i mean it just devastates the brain it's an
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:00.840]  excitotoxin it destroys the liver and it is in tens of thousands of products we can say no
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:05.720]  we can stand up but if you've got a neighbor given fluoride water to their baby please go over and
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:11.160]  warn them if you got a neighbor that's sitting there eating msg filled chips one after the other
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.920]  warn them you've got a responsibility if you know people that are feeding processed foods
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:22.840]  filled with gmo warn them and for god's sakes don't give it to your own children if you want to kill
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:29.480]  yourself that's your own business but don't hurt your children don't do this ladies and gentlemen
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.640]  in closing i want to talk about some positive things just 15 years ago or so you couldn't
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:41.880]  find organic food anywhere on store shelves and now about half of what you see is organic
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:49.560]  food just a few years ago all the milk had the growth hormone in it now it's hard to find milk
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:54.920]  that has the growth hormone in it because the consumers have spoken and said no a few years
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.360]  ago you couldn't find toothpaste that didn't have sodium fluoride in it now toms of main is starting
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:06.440]  to you know take over the aisle space and displace the other mainline toothpaste makers where it says
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.280]  on the back if you swallow this call poison control immediately even colgate is now putting out
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.880]  fluoride free toothpaste people are demanding that they not be poisoned and they're finding out
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:25.080]  about what's going on and so industry is starting to respond and at least give people who want a
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:33.160]  choice an option to not be forcibly medicated through the food and the water you know cigarettes
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:38.440]  are bad for you but just 20 years ago the cigarette makers were getting up before congress and saying
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.760]  it was a conspiracy theory that it was killing people and then later it came out in their internal
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.160]  documents they knew it was deadly ladies and gentlemen i've seen the studies much of what
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:51.720]  they're putting in our food and water is far worse than even cigarettes as bad as they are one of the
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:57.320]  biggest killers in this country this is a covert soft kill operation we'll put a lot of links
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:02.200]  beneath this video so you can check out the facts for yourself and i'm just begging you to do your
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.400]  own research and find out that one of the most dangerous places in the world is your grocery
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:15.160]  store and the tap water in your house well you think that's bad you think what's happening with
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:21.000]  the gmo and the toxins and the food and water is bad with food the ultimate secret exposed well
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.720]  unfortunately that's nothing that's the old-fashioned low-tech ways that the establishments playing god
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:34.760]  with their little slaves you know this next piece got a lot of attention a lot of big
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:40.680]  newspapers and magazines reported on this they got very upset by it because for big brother
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:48.520]  and big pharma this is the new frontier and of course i'm talking about brain eating vaccines
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:55.160]  oh when they promote them they call them ah a vaccine where you'll never be addicted to drugs
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:01.240]  again or a vaccine we'll never be depressed again or a vaccine for memories but when you study this
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:09.240]  class of vaccines they go in and actually destroy different receptor sites that is different cell
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:15.880]  ganglia in the brain and yeah once you take these different vaccines you'll never want to use cocaine
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:23.000]  or drink jack daniels again but you see cocaine and jack daniels already mimic receptors in the
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.480]  brain that take up endorphins of when you get the date with that beautiful woman you got the
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.080]  crush on her when you score the touchdown or you get the business deal or you help the old lady
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:40.120]  across the street or when you jam your car down in second gear and drive around on the shoulder
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:46.200]  around somebody who wouldn't get out of your way and you roar past them in victory yeah that you
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.760]  take these vaccines you're never going to feel that again but don't worry they've got a pill
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:56.360]  that'll take care of what the vaccines do to your brain so here it is the brain eating vaccines
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:03.080]  oh yeah it's buck rogers my friends please pay attention to the information i'm about to cover
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.880]  and research the links that will post below this video so that you understand none of this is my
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:14.840]  opinion it is fact this issue is the most important issue going on in the world it is scientific
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:20.520]  tyranny i've read literally hundreds of government white papers and documents and books like eco science
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.920]  with a white house science are talks about forcibly drugging the water to dumb you down and sterilize
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:31.960]  you but now they're in the new york times and time magazine and everywhere and all the major
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:37.160]  medical journals promoting not only drugging the water with lithium which by the way they're
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:42.840]  already doing but now they're announcing it to make you servile but now they are admitting that
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:49.560]  they plan to deploy something i learned about a decade ago hundreds of different vaccines
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:57.400]  they're really biological re-engineering live viruses that they inject into your body
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:05.880]  and the live viruses go in and attack your brain and they claim oh it's to stop drug addiction
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:13.000]  those same receptor sites that pick up opiates and nicotine and alcohol pick up your normal
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.760]  endorphins it's part of being a normal human being those drugs mimic that and the viruses
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:27.320]  attack those receptor sites and kill them and create dead tissue it is a vaccine induced live
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.160]  virus lobotomy now they're coming out and saying the american people and the people of the world
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.520]  are sick and major medical journals are saying we need to give everybody these shots to make them
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:46.760]  feel better to stop having anxiety to stop being angry in other words to take away your instinct
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:53.640]  for self-preservation your will to survive to make you accept all the bad things that are happening
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:46:01.880]  to turn you into a biological android a type of zombie you cannot make this up please send this
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.560]  video to everyone you know for god's sakes understand how serious this is this is a global
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:13.320]  scientific corporate takeover of life itself the globalists aren't just re-engineering corn and
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:19.480]  wheat and every other major crop and engineering sterilants into them suddenly all over the news
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:26.760]  they're promoting lithium and prozac and other drugs in the water head bioethicist at cambridge
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:31.880]  they're the people that advise and set medical policy for doctors are announcing they want to
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:38.120]  force drug you and they're calling it cognitive enhancement i've got a cbs news piece where they
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.400]  say that mercury helps your intelligence what everyone knows it causes brain damage mercury
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.200]  containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:56.040]  pediatrics so when they say cognitive enhancement they mean cognitive brain damage they mean taking
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:02.760]  your essence literally your psyche who you are away and they sit up there saying well if we put
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:07.880]  prozac in the water it'll cut suicide when it's admitted that prozac on its insert can cause
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:12.440]  suicide i have mainstream news articles that have just come out in the last few days in england
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:19.240]  where people have a tenfold increase in convulsions and they develop epilepsy after the flu shot
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:26.680]  i talked to top scientists who studied the flu shot last year and found bizarre viral RNA in it
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:32.040]  that deals with the brain i've had top brain surgeons on like dr rustle blalock to talk about
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.920]  this and the government documents that he's read how this is part of the eugenics population control
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:43.960]  program i mean here it is london telegraph flew jab linked to fits and under fives and it goes on
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.600]  to say they've been told not to give children 110 000 in england under five the shot because
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:56.040]  they had convulsions at ten times the regular rate lindsay lohan isn't what matters mel gibson
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:01.720]  isn't what matters the depression doesn't even matter war with iran is not even that important
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.160]  compared to a medical dictatorship and under the national health service in england and now
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.680]  national health care in the us they're slashing regular health care like cancer surgery or having
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:18.920]  a broken leg fixed and converting it over to psychiatry and this biological warfare or bio
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.720]  psychiatry where they say don't worry about drugs anymore for your depression we're going to give
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:31.240]  you a shot that alters your brain by viruses literally attacking your brain and they're rolling
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:38.520]  it out in public trials over a hundred of these vaccines right now and they're clearly spiking
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:43.640]  other vaccines with it if you love your children if you love your family you've got to realize this
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:50.040]  is a creeping scientific incremental soft kill system let's go over some of these articles
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:57.080]  jab that could put a stop to stress without slowing us down and it says they're going to make humans
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:03.640]  better they've re-engineered potatoes and corn why not just re-engineered humans and they quote
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:11.080]  all these major medical journals saying how great it is and they say this could change society the
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:18.440]  professor said and they have a government funded stanford team with these neuro protective viruses
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:26.920]  and this particular vaccine one of hundreds is a live herpes virus engineered to only eat certain
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:33.160]  key brain tissue they're just rolling it out and this isn't like some uh drug that they give people
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.880]  for a decade that causes hundreds of thousands of women to have deformed children this isn't some
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:42.920]  drug that just makes one person you know have a heart attack all these other recall drugs these
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:50.280]  aren't even drugs these are genetically engineered nanotech viruses that go in and turn you into
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:59.240]  a servile biological android do you understand the vaccines that they're rolling out are live virus

[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:17.800]  slavery for more than 13 years author jose calazo has been trying to prove that the us government
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:24.280]  has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fmri
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:30.520]  functional magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof that it exists america's new slavery
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:36.760]  explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security who has access
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:43.240]  to it how is it being used does america's salvation rest in this technology these and many other
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:51.480]  questions are answered in america's new slavery the new books by jose calazo available on bn.com
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:58.840]  amazon.com and borders.com america's new slavery all americans should be concerned
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.120]  there's new drug discovery going on our foundation is back to vaccine that's going into phase three
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:11.880]  trial it starts in a couple months and that should save over two-thirds of lives if it's effective
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.240]  and most secondly over and over again they claim oh it's to make you not depressed anymore all of
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:21.480]  you have problems you shouldn't be upset about things and we're meant to get upset at a biological
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.520]  level and say no to this tyranny and so they're coming out saying oh we're going to re-engineer
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:32.600]  your brain cognitive enhancements we're going to help you the mercury's helping your brain
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:39.640]  on newscasts all over the country oh the convulsions are helping you oh lithium a toxic
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:44.920]  metal that they want to put in the water it's helping you you're going to feel much better
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:55.320]  after all of this is done what's wrong they're not coming for us they're already here we're in
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:01.240]  danger many of you who have a child who seems to be dumbed down it isn't as smart as anybody
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:06.760]  else in your family and something's wrong with them it's the vaccines it's the gmo food many of you
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.000]  who had an 18 month old baby who was healthy and happy they take that third round of shots they have
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.920]  a convulsion that night and they never talk again they're turning you into servile minions who will
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:22.200]  do whatever you're told and who can't get angry and can't resist why do they want lithium in the
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.320]  water they admit to make you submit what does sodium fluoride all the studies do make you submit
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.760]  and what do these vaccines do they make you passive they make you unable to get angry
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:38.040]  anger is a propulsion system to make you stand up for your species this is a hostile corporate
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.640]  takeover the very genetic code of not just the plants and animals but humanity itself it is the
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:52.920]  most diabolical covert operation ever seen and now these people are out in the open it's admitted
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:58.760]  do you understand it's admitted they want to make these shots mandatory in public schools
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.040]  to make you servile oh but you don't want to become addicted to drugs what do you think drugs
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:11.480]  mimic they mimic natural chemicals in the brain that stir creativity and anger and love and everything
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:19.080]  else it's those key receptors they're literally going for the soul of man that is in the beautiful
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:26.360]  detailed complex computer that is the human mind this is a hack against the human mind a hack
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:31.720]  against the human soul and we must stand up and resist it they realize there's a worldwide
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:37.880]  revolt against this technocracy against dehumanization you need to become educated on these facts
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:44.920]  and join the resistance against this scientific dictatorship now is the time to realize that
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:51.080]  history is taking place right now that we're living in the 21st century and a scientific
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:58.600]  tyranny has taken over if we are successful in defeating these people historians will look back
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.200]  on this time as the greatest covert genocide in history they will look back on it as the
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:11.800]  ultimate example of pure evil and corruption this creeping death now i've warned the public
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:16.440]  and i will continue to detail what's happening in areas where lithium and trace amounts is in
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:22.280]  the drinking water there seems to be a lower level of suicidality and in the texas counties that
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.120]  were studied there's actually lower crime rate and how these enemies come out and talk and they're
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:33.720]  simpering lisping tones real softly to to coax you and and and and to advertise all this death
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.920]  and dehumanization as if it's good the theory is that very low or trace amounts of lithium
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:44.200]  enhanced connectivity between neurons and doing that over the course of a lifetime a lifetime
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:51.800]  exposure makes the brain more healthy now i want to talk to the social engineers whose religion
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:58.440]  is a control freak system of dehumanization you are like cancer you're racing through the
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:04.200]  body politic you think you're invincible and you may kill the host you may destroy our species
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:10.600]  but not without a fight you are disgusting wicked people who love ruling over others
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:16.200]  everything you do creates death and destruction in its path you sold prozac as a way to stop
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:20.920]  depression when in your own trials you knew it massively increased suicide now you're telling
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:27.560]  us how great lithium and toxic metal an anti psychotic is going to be put in the water mandatory
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:31.640]  and we've got the studies it's already in most the water supplies we know you're adding it you

[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:29.160]  transmitting worldwide it's alex jones if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:37.000]  thanks for riding shotgun with us today as we look back over the last few years at some of the most
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.240]  hard-hitting media reports we've put out some of the most hardcore information we're going to finish
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:49.960]  up with this special report looking at the brain eating vaccines which is a headline to basically
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.600]  capture folks's attention because that's what these vaccines do is they go in and kill brain tissue
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.280]  but at the end of the day what they're really doing is reengineering the brain
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:07.240]  and these are really biological mutation weapons that they call vaccines and all it is is really
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:12.280]  something they inject into your body to re-engineer your brain and personally i'm very upset by it
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:16.280]  because bill gates and others are talking about how and we're just going to release mosquitoes
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:21.400]  that when they suck your blood basically give you this virus and we're just going to engineer it
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.600]  into the squash into the tomatoes so there's no escape from their new world order that's one reason
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.920]  they're so arrogant so here's the conclusion of the brain eating vaccines and we're going to rally
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:38.680]  the world population against you and we're going to bring you to justice and i pray god that humanity
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.400]  makes it through what you've attempted to do how you've saddled up next to us like a spider in the
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:49.800]  dark and tried to spin your webs of control around us while we were asleep but the sleeping giant that
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.160]  is humanity is waking up to who you are and what you are and i pray to the creator of the universe
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:02.040]  and i beg for just the average person out there as well to research just who you are and how you're
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:08.280]  involved in a scorched earth takeover of society to secure your ill-gotten games and i want you to
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.880]  know that i'm going to do everything i can to rally free humanity against you and that we are going
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:21.480]  to defeat you but whether we win or not whether you lose or fail at least we were real humans we
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:26.920]  were good decent people that saw the truth and we stood up against you and no matter what happens in
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:35.960]  this you are still degenerate dehumanizing filth you are aberrant malfunctioning trash and you look
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.200]  at everything good and wholesome and tell us that we are malfunctioning so i pray that you be defeated
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:49.080]  but either way in this time and space on this planet good people stood up against what you are
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:54.120]  and did everything they could to help the innocence when i look at all the children that you've brain
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:59.400]  damaged and all the children dying of cancer and i look at all the things that you've done to humanity
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:05.320]  it makes me want to vomit you are doing this because this is only the next wave to first
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:11.400]  neutralize us so we're calm and sedate and can't resist so you can roll in with the hard kill weapons
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:17.000]  i know that and i want to tell you something else a lot of you that think that you're part of the
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.920]  winning team you're going to find out that your masters hate you more than they even hate for
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:24.760]  humanity because they know that you know where the bodies are buried and they know you're a
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.720]  bunch of wicked control freaks that they need to kill first once they take over or you'll start
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:34.680]  trying to overthrow them they understand your nature they use their propaganda to manipulate
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:40.840]  good men throughout history to serve their evil aims so understand this you're going to fail one
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:46.200]  way or another you've decided to put your soul on the side of darkness for all eternity for what
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:52.760]  you're doing to humanity and butchering our dna and literally mutating the human spirit and your
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:59.640]  control freak lust for power and so all of you one way or another will fail so all that matters
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:05.800]  is in this time and space i stood up for what's right i saw you clearly for what you are and i
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:10.520]  know in my heart there's a very good chance we're going to beat you but that's up to all the people

[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.640]  pervays what do you want to say good evening sir i'm so proud of alec the guy takes the gentleman
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:37.080]  speaks so loudly and speaks so truthfully i was coming back from i'm from kenya originally and i
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:42.520]  came to him as a 12 year old child and i was in the british territory army and my younger brother
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:47.320]  was in royal air force for seven and a half years a nautical engineer so we have played the part with
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:52.920]  the four c's and i was in kenya coming back from kenya 1999 i met another asian gentleman who's flying
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:58.760]  out to Uzbekistan and we just took people sitting at the airport in reception having a chat and i
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:02.360]  asked him where he was off to and he said i'm going to Uzbekistan i said why he says because
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:07.960]  they found oil and i'm an engineer i take oil and he told me that three countries have found oil
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.480]  and the oil pipeline was supposed to go from Afghanistan into karachi in pakistan this conspiracy
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.040]  911 was it's totally planned to stop the pipeline going into those two countries but you don't know
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:22.840]  that you're just guessing no no no i'm telling the truth you're telling me that rochdale are
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.000]  announcing the official version this evening well let me comment on this let me comment on this
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:37.560]  actually it was a trifecta of issues and we actually have the now two books written by
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:43.080]  zabignan brzezinski who was the architect of the original afghan war against the soviets he
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:49.400]  really kicked it off with the planning in 79 80 he's written two books specifically on the subject
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:56.920]  he wrote one in 97 called the grand chess board and he basically said you cannot allow the stands
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.040]  to bring their oil out to the sea and you've got to take over pakistan and afghanistan or at least
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.920]  he stabilized them and have an excuse to get us troops in there or the chinese are going to dominate
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:13.800]  the region and get the fuel and energy supplies that they need so the trifecta is this in afghanistan
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:20.520]  alone not mentioning the other seven stands around it in 2000 numbers uh this was released by the world
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.880]  bank there's four trillion that number's a lot higher now because the prices have gone up uh
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:31.960]  in discovered oil fields oil supplies four trillion conservatively in us dollars that was back then
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:37.480]  obviously they're devalued now so it's more uh also there's 500 billion a year in opium 93
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:41.640]  percent of opium production for heroin the precursor to heroin comes out of there only
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:46.520]  10 came out until the liberation and i have fox news where they admit the us trips and
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.680]  british trips help grow the opium and supply on the fertilizer that's shipped into our country
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:57.080]  and if you're doubting me just type herald riverum us marines helping grow opium and then
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.960]  they now just admit it the fact that uh here you have one of the best fighting forces in the
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:08.040]  world ever mounted uh and in a sense uh you're watching as uh this opium is being grown i know
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.400]  it grinds at your gut uh how do you deal with it what are you doing about it oh uh frankly this is
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:19.480]  a part of the culture so uh while it might grind in my gut it's what they do i also heard bbc
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.640]  ones on the radio on my x7 admit it that you they're now just throwing it in our face like we're
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:27.640]  dumb oh by the way we're growing it but we're fighting drugs so if you catch you whether you're
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:32.200]  going to prison but side issue they got to keep the drugs illegal to keep the price up so it's
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.920]  about the 500 let me just come in there isn't that also about the fact that the opium has been
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:42.520]  rightly or wrongly the only crop in that region for people to make a living is that why production
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:47.000]  went up the allies are kind of stuck what do they do here are they meant to be starving out the
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.640]  entire place they're not there as a prince force for the average law-abiding afghani they are there
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:56.680]  for other reasons what are they the northern alliance northern hard place uh muhammad karzai's
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:02.520]  brother is the largest narcotics trafficker that's the new york times um the northern alliance uh
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:07.960]  were the people that control the opium before the real taliban the real muslim uh people that
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:13.560]  were running it shut down almost all opium production the west went in took it over to shut
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:19.000]  down the pipeline of unicale being built and they went in to get control of the 500 billion a year
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:27.720]  and production went up 13 fold it's now 93 of world production and they give them the fertilizer
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:34.840]  and guard it and then it's loaded on aircraft and flown in to europe russia and the united
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.880]  states and the rest of the world the only opium dealers and heroin dealers that are busted
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:46.360]  are people buying it from southeast asian golden triangle suppliers now not controlled by the
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:53.880]  anglo-american power axis the british empire financed itself in 16 and 1700 with the opium
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.680]  ma'am long while ago well let's listen we'll take another call here thank you pervasive
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:05.560]  this is elizabeth in lincoln it's about menacing china controlling the area it's about drug money

[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:33.560]  say because um just recently there was um a lady who happened to be an american soldier and she
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.960]  worked for the un and she stumbled across something and she was saying that actually the un are behind
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:45.560]  the sex trafficking and uh i thought the more i've looked at it it sounds ridiculous oh yeah that's

[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:10.520]  version his white house press secretary j carney there are sensitivities here in terms of the
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:17.720]  appropriateness of releasing photographs of isama bin laden and in the aftermath of this
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:22.200]  fire fight and and we're making an evaluation about the need to do that it could be inflammatory
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.000]  they're making it could be inflammatory alex jones they don't want to scare folk with a dead corpse
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.440]  with its head shot out yeah that's totally ridiculous uh they're just busy getting everybody's
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:38.040]  appetite wet and fawning after they've already destroyed the body uh for all of their new fake
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:40.840]  video to be rolled up but i want to respond to something because my guys were listening in the

[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:47.240]  rabble from the lone star state the filth of the world alex jones the united states was founded on
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:56.120]  july 4th 1776 in resistance to the hegemonic despotic tyrannical rule of king george the third
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:02.920]  and the abuse against the colonies and most of the british parliament was against going to war
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:09.800]  with their fellow englishmen because the king was unpopular there as well it was known that he was
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:16.680]  a german king his father being brought over to rule england these people could barely speak
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:22.440]  english i think against germans but you don't see me going over to germany to rule them the very
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:30.760]  essence of july 4th and 1776 his resistance to the disgusting house of wednesday they didn't get
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:35.480]  that name until around world war one because before that they were known as the sacks coberg
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:40.760]  gothis notice that we hear their names prince william you never hear his last name do you
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:45.560]  the slave public many other than england who support these people don't even know their last
[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:51.800]  names because they don't want you knowing their last names three times the last three years the
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:58.120]  parliament in canada hasn't done what the queen of england wants so she suspended them shut down
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:05.240]  the parliament happened in the late 70s in australia this is a tyrannical group pushing eugenics
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:11.640]  population reduction all the carbon taxes prince philip the queen's husband another german royal
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:18.920]  prince is a supporter of eugenics his cousin who was the prince married to the queen of the netherlands
[02:35:18.920 --> 02:35:26.120]  unadmitted nazi unadmitted eugenicist the point is these are the most filthy degenerate people
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:30.520]  you can imagine she owns more than half of canada more than half the land in england
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:36.120]  and then she's paid by the government for her palaces and all the rest of it it's disgusting
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:43.480]  and to watch us television fawning fox cnn cbs all of them oh it's so wonderful no one in american
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:52.200]  wait until next week the way they're hyping it one week until the royal wedding this is an exciting
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:57.080]  stuff i mean it's it's hard i mean the energy is just palpable don't couples get married they're
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:00.760]  just hoping that some bank will be nice enough to give them a mortgage yeah these folks have a
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.800]  number of palaces to pick from nbc's is launching a free royal wedding app for the ipad gotta this
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:13.800]  is truly a love story that captures everybody's attention this goes back to edward bernay's
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:19.400]  a hundred years ago saying look to make politicians and royalty popular we'll have hollywood stars come
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.040]  to banquets and events with them we'll have music stars we'll have other people go there
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:30.360]  to basically make these elites be seen as celebrities themselves you know why america was
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:35.960]  founded because under the imperial royal system in europe and england if you weren't part of the
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:43.800]  inside group who had basically the patronage of the crown where they gave you land houses jobs you
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.440]  couldn't even get a license to be a carpenter a license to be a blacksmith a license to brew beer
[02:36:48.440 --> 02:36:54.280]  unless their local lords gave you the authorization so it wasn't just that you had to pay outrageous
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:37:03.400]  taxes you had to get their permission to even have a job to have a profession ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:08.760]  that's the essence of globalism is big mega corporations many of which are owned and controlled
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:15.480]  by the german royal family that runs england and of course other netherlands the whole system
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:20.680]  they've set up and they promote is about this new global corporate system worldwide that through
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:25.880]  government power shuts down their competition and transfers the people's wealth through taxes
[02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:33.560]  to the offshore cartels these people are parasites they're disgusting they're filthy and if we want
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:40.680]  to reclaim the spirit of 1776 we should realize how abhorrent monarchy is in all of its forms
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:48.600]  and that includes the un and the new royalty under the unelected eu bureaucratic system
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:54.600]  where over 80 of england's laws even though they're not part of the eu are made by eu bureaucrats
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:59.640]  please everyone remember the spirit of 1776 and a lot of folks in england are saying they're gonna
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.200]  go out and protest it first the government said you've got the day off slaves you don't have to
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.080]  go to work on the you know big royal wedding coming up next week and then the republicans
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:12.840]  that's a group that want to get rid of the monarchy in england said we're gonna protest
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.480]  in the streets and the government said you're not allowed to protest meanwhile they criticize
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:23.240]  syria for banning protest so anytime you see some mind-numb zombie talking about how exciting the
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:28.920]  wedding is or how they watched it you're watching a bunch of twitly inbred idiots that can't even
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.520]  dress themselves and have valets and until just a few decades ago they try to keep it quiet they
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:39.960]  have people that wipe their butts for them groom of the stool do you know the history of america
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:47.080]  do you know it started in resistance to this very usurping german family who aren't even british
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:52.120]  do you know that most the english hate the royal family do you know they have a secret police system
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:56.440]  that basically threatens people that talk about getting rid of the monarchy do you know that
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.400]  princess diana on record told her butler and others i made a videotape saying prince charles
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:07.960]  has threatened me he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident these people are absolutely
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:13.400]  anathema and the servile folks that have been raised to worship these people and all the little
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:17.960]  old ladies that think it's cute well that's why we're enslaved that's why our country's bankrupt
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:22.360]  that's why we're going to hell in a handbasket because you've forgotten what it is to be an american
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:26.920]  or perhaps you were never even taught but now you're going to learn what it's like to be a subject
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:37.400]  a slave what is royalty royalty is kim jung il in north korea his father took over and then gave
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:43.000]  him power and now he's giving power to his son why don't they just put gold crowns on their heads
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:49.080]  and dress up with long flowing robes maybe then americans would celebrate the royal wedding of kim
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:56.040]  jung il's son oh but they wear little military uniforms and we know how clownish it is but somehow
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:01.960]  we've been tricked at wearing big gold crowns and flowing robes isn't more ridiculous and stupid
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:07.560]  america has been great because it's not about what race you are what family pedigree or how
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:12.520]  murderous your great granddaddy was it's about what you individually can do it's about what you
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.640]  individually have to offer being an inventor a trailblazer and explore someone who's brave
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:24.280]  an artist someone who has incredible literature in their soul these royal crony capitalist
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:29.800]  non-free market systems always wage war against the individual they always wage war against the
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:35.400]  productive and the british world family are at the head of pushing world population reduction
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:41.800]  they are at the head of one child policies they are at the head of eugenics they taught the
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:48.040]  nazis everything they knew about eugenics do you understand this is mainline history the
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:52.280]  king of england had to advocate at the beginning of world war two because he wanted to merge with
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:58.680]  hitler the british world family come from a long line of dictators they're oppressive
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:04.280]  they're anti-liberty and freedom and here it is all over the british and world news today
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:11.160]  the outrage that dictators from oppressive middle eastern and african countries are coming a whole
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:17.000]  gaggle of them to the royal wedding it's disgusting it's a bunch of hereditary gangsters
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  meeting laughing at how they've tricked the public to worship their tyranny and think it's cute and
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.680]  funny and fashionable so down with the royals down with the sax cobra gothers and their fake
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.880]  house name winsor and their new world order trying to retake north america the planet's
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:40.760]  waking up and the corporate barons the unbearance the unelected bureaucracy the new royalty backed
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:47.720]  up by the old royalty are going down we redeclare the spirit of 1776 against you and your ilk
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:54.760]  you're on notice there's nothing better than watching inbred people and everyone worshiping them
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:01.800]  ah as they kick pensioners off of their pensions they paid for and as they cut the gas allotments
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:07.240]  in the middle of winter in england there's literally dozens of giant palaces being paid
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:14.440]  for with the slaves money it's wonderful the world is learning to worship the british empire
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:26.440]  wait oh no not more of that rabble alex jones imitating us not his lordship alex jones no no no
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:33.800]  we have a hardware store and we make screens and we sell alex jones videos and do a little bit
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:40.520]  of locksmith and then do all kinds of things you know we even uh oh god and a rabble slave with a
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:48.520]  weapon disarm him get the gods disarm him immediately but as one of the slaves has a weapon raise the
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:54.040]  alarm raise it oh good lord the problem with the selling of guns right now alex is this they're
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:43:02.920]  awful hard to get right now but the rabble you can't have the slaves because barack the quack has
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:08.680]  made everyone want to buy guns he's been riddle really good for the gun industry is a sensible
[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:16.440]  individual total disarmament of the civilian population under the unity 2001 july 7th agreement
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:23.320]  to disarm all civilians for a power monopoly of the state under un law is the only sensible system
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:29.320]  if we're going to carry out eugenics against these slaves and their rabble scar they need to be
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:34.600]  authorized immediate net and how dare they're not want to be slaves how dare they're not to
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:40.040]  want to be in inner city reservations how dare they're not submit to us and our divine will
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:47.080]  we're geniuses and what alex just said is actually factual it was christoph carlin patricio lewis
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:54.200]  unidire 2000 in a paper they put out called disarming taking this military style weapons
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:44:00.440]  away from civilians everything he just joked about right now is actually documented in fact
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:05.880]  of course we must take all your firearms including the semi-automatic how are we going to reeducate
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:14.120]  you to accept being euthanized according to according to obama and his people the right
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.400]  of the people to keep him bare flintlocks shall not be in print then the founding fathers that
[02:44:19.400 --> 02:44:25.160]  you've seen in our femur training videos the police in kansas city were terrorist against the
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:34.760]  crowd the second amendment is a vicious crime absolutely how dare you i will disarm you immediately
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:42.120]  that man that man they're laughing sees him sees him here's he has been rude to a lordship well you
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:47.000]  know the supreme court back in 39 said that uh if these the weapons that were really protected by the
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.480]  second amendment were the type in common use at the time by the military and it just so happens
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:56.440]  that during the time of the revolution that these civilians that militiamen had better rifles than
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:01.160]  the regular army they had rifles and the regular i had the long rifles smoothbore muskets yeah now
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:07.960]  there you'll speak badly of the gracious imperial forces of king george the third as he put down
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:13.640]  that disgusting that disgusting rebellion by these oppity slaves pardon me i'm just trying to do a
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:18.600]  little historical context here alex that's all that the the militiamen had better rifles than
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:27.080]  the regular army so they were disgusting wild savage heathens and we went forward to confiscate
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:33.160]  their firearms and they dare fire back at us yes is what's that the movie said was it in the uh in
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:41.000]  the patriot these rustics are so inept the warrant error is a fraud and it's being used
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.440]  in a manner to take away your rights for whatever reason in addition to the core al-qaeda group
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:51.720]  which still represents a threat to the united states despite its diminished capabilities
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:57.400]  we now face threats from a number of al-qaeda associates that share its violent extremist
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:04.040]  ideology among these groups we are also seeing an increased emphasis on recruiting americans
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:13.800]  and westerners to carry out the tax they are also encouraging individuals in the west to
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:19.640]  carry out their own small-scale attacks which require less of the coordination and planning
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:23.080]  that could raise red flags and lead to an attacks disruption
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:38.200]  in my 16 years of deep research it has become clear the number one threat to any sovereign
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:43.720]  free nation is its military look at nazi germany look at latin america look at asia look at
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:51.000]  africa look at eastern europe when you build up a giant paramilitary police force it almost
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:58.600]  always tries to take over the society in the last 12 years we've watched an acceleration
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:04.120]  of militarization of police we've watched threat fusion centers the ten fema regions expand the
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:09.720]  governor's council i've been to urban warfare drills where our own military is training to
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:16.120]  lock down and barricade and blockade us cities and confiscate our firearms this whole program
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:23.640]  accelerated after 1999 when congress got rid of the glass steagle act it allowed private central
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:31.720]  banks to issue unlimited counterfeit financial instruments known as derivatives and we've
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:38.600]  heard that oh the military and the police state the tsa it's for al-qaeda but now we see checkpoints
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:45.400]  in tennessee run by the army shutting down highway searching citizens we see them in new york state
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:51.240]  with x-ray machines we see it all over the nation we see marines running illegal checkpoints for dui
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:57.000]  in california and when the governors and others complain they're told sit down and shut up it's
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:04.520]  under homeland security it's under continuity of government and now as the world implodes as
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:12.440]  the derivatives dollar devaluation crisis expands we're seeing the police and military being called
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:18.600]  out against the general population all over the world as people go under austerity as their pension
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:24.520]  funds are cut as their benefits are cut their taxes go up and here domestically in the u.s.
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:31.480]  this huge apparatus of oppression is openly being set up and deployed against the people and i saw
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:37.720]  an amazing blurb from business insider that linked to an article and the audio of the governor of
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:44.280]  wisconsin on the mpr saying hey we're cutting all these state employees and we're gonna make you
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:49.800]  pay more your paycheck into a pension fund which they loot out the back door and if you don't like
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:57.080]  it we're going to use the national guard on you and on the heels of the governor's speech and just
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:02.040]  in case there are problems the governor went on to say that he has called the wisconsin national
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:09.480]  guard and other agencies to make sure they would be ready just in case that's what this whole
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:14.840]  homeland security systems for you know they distract you over here with men living in caves in
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:19.880]  central asia you think you're giving your rights up to protect you from the dangerous ankle biting
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:25.960]  al-qaeda but then meanwhile the whole system is rolled out against the american people and this
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:32.840]  is just another signpost on the road to tyranny on the road to serfdom illustrating how the paramilitary
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:41.480]  control grid has been set up and deployed against the american people bottom line al-qaeda is a cover
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:47.480]  story we've given you the myac report and all the other internal documents that prove this apparatus
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:54.120]  is designed for the american people and it's being rolled out nationwide with the tsa on the streets
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:59.480]  of america it's being rolled out with governor shooting their mouths off saying you got a problem
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:05.560]  with me armed force is standing by the globalists know the american people are awakening they know
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:10.440]  people are becoming aware of what's happening and if they can sell the military and police on going
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:17.800]  along with this brazen attack on our liberty and to be this homeland brigade to suppress us here at
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:23.800]  home they're going to get away with it it's only going to get worse from here on out unless we get
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.840]  the word out and take our states back legally and lawfully through the tenth amendment you have been

[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:10.280]  bona fide tyranny is coming to our shores if you look at egypt you've witnessed how the
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:14.760]  government has seized control of the tv and radio stations but in the united states the federal
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:20.440]  government doesn't need to do that because under changes and FCC regulations over television
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:31.320]  and radio in 1996 eas emergency systems are put in at the radio or tv towers they're also put in
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:37.720]  at the national and local cable systems where the federal government puts a box in at the transmission
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:45.400]  tower where they can flip a switch and shortwave towers nationwide take over those computers
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:53.880]  and put out an audio signal of whatever message they want i am a radio broadcaster and i remember
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:59.480]  15 years ago when this change was made watching the engineer at the radio station where i worked
[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:04.680]  and the station manager literally freaking out they were sent documents that the FCC said
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:08.680]  were restricted but i was allowed to look at them and i was allowed to videotape them and
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:17.000]  i put it in my 1999 film police state 2000 well my friends you're looking at a fema control box
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:24.840]  that's right at 98 9 k j f k f m where i work in austin texas that my friends can take over
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:31.400]  the radio station it is radio controlled by a fema tower that's right a fema tower in new
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:40.040]  bronville's texas it covers almost all of the central part of the state of texas little teletypes
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:45.880]  come printing out of the side of the machine weekly and update us in the past it was voluntary
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:52.520]  now it's mandatory and they can remote control take over the station and in those they told them
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:58.760]  that in the near future the federal government would routinely seize control their broadcast system
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:05.160]  not during a plague or a nuclear attack or a war but that they would seize control for routine
[02:56:05.160 --> 02:56:12.680]  announcements so it was put in place but it wasn't implemented now president barack obama through the
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:20.600]  FCC has announced today that they are going to begin testing and implementing national announcements
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  with the president giving messages to the public everybody has heard the national emergency alert
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.960]  system radio and tv stations regularly test it to make sure the public is notified in times of
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:37.560]  peril well that system is overseen by the FCC and now the agency wants to upgrade it by having
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:42.920]  presidential announcements feed into the alert system it's also looking at how wireless broadband
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:49.400]  could also enhance eas but it gets worse eight years ago i was not doing my radio show out of
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.400]  the studio i was doing it out of a local talk station i didn't have my own studio them they
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:59.000]  got new communicates from the FCC telling them that they should prepare in the near future
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:08.680]  for multiple hours per day of federal break-ins over the local am station and the same systems
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:14.920]  in the cable systems broadcast tv talk radio you name it and i went to the station manager
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:21.560]  and i said please come on my show talk about this and he said no i showed you this stuff in
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:25.880]  confidence you're not allowed to talk about it you can say you heard about it but not where
[02:57:25.880 --> 02:57:31.720]  now since then i've done shows out of another big talk station here in town i've been a guest

[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:43.400]  in the last week i have talked to station owners and managers who are now getting internal
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:48.520]  communicates from the FCC and they're told it's national security that they're not allowed to
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:53.480]  talk about it but that they're going to be more and more government break-ins over radio and tv
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:58:01.000]  now i got that news but was trying to figure out what to do with it when today the big announcement
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:07.320]  comes out and the FCC obama spokes lady says oh this is no big deal we've always had this in place
