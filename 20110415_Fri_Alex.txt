[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:28.080]  well we knew we had him coming on a couple days ago but I like to surprise the listeners
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.760]  so out of the gates for the first 30 minutes of the live transmission today
[00:32.760 --> 00:40.040]  Lou Dobbs of course syndicated radio host former CNN host host of Lou Dobbs
[00:40.040 --> 00:44.520]  tonight on Fox Business Channel one of their number one programs over there is
[00:44.520 --> 00:49.000]  our guest for the next 30 minutes and I can't wait to pick his brain and get his
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.520]  take on the economy the new war in Libya the inflation who is Glenn Beck's
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.600]  replacement gonna be could it be Lou Dobbs or Andrew Napolitano I hear they're
[00:58.600 --> 01:02.920]  certainly being looked at right now from some of the Fox insiders but we're
[01:02.920 --> 01:06.680]  gonna discuss it all but in this short few minutes we have in this opening
[01:06.680 --> 01:11.280]  segment Lou of all the things going on what do you think is most important in
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.160]  the world today what's number one on your radar screen well number one first of
[01:17.160 --> 01:21.160]  all I'll great to be with you again and have an opportunity to talk about these
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.800]  issues but the number one issue as far as I'm concerned right now is restoring
[01:25.800 --> 01:30.320]  the rule of the majority to our government and making certain that's
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.480]  great constitutional republic is led and conduct itself in concert with our
[01:37.480 --> 01:41.960]  national values and ideals whether we're talking about foreign policy whether
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.600]  we're talking about the wars that are underway in Iraq Afghanistan and
[01:46.600 --> 01:51.480]  Libya or whether we're talking about how to restore prosperity to this country
[01:51.480 --> 01:57.000]  and to create jobs at wealth and to get this great country moving well when you
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.400]  talk about the Constitution under assault undoubtedly I mean out of the
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.680]  gates going back now four weeks ago the UN comes out and says we have a
[02:05.680 --> 02:11.360]  resolution to stop to start bombing Libya and Obama didn't even the
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.920]  president didn't even consult with Congress at least Bush went and got a
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.200]  resolution for force exactly and by the way that the man who this president is
[02:20.200 --> 02:25.960]  a candidate accused of being a unilateralist went before the United
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.360]  Nations and got their approval support that cooperation as well as the United
[02:31.360 --> 02:37.760]  States Congress and he did it twice both in Afghanistan and Iraq the if you
[02:37.760 --> 02:44.600]  will the the contradiction is stunning on the part of mr. Obama and now it's a
[02:44.600 --> 02:48.640]  stalemate and they say it's not going well so there's more and more discussions
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.520]  by top generals of putting ground troops in not just CIA advisors
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.480]  unfortunately that's exactly right and the military analysts with them I've
[02:57.480 --> 03:04.600]  spoken to and a number of former generals who are very close to to obviously
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.480]  the general staff of the Pentagon same point blank that they cautioned this
[03:09.480 --> 03:15.840]  administration against taking on Omar Gaddafi and opening up hostilities
[03:15.840 --> 03:20.880]  against Olivia and now they are cautioning against the ground troops
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.720]  because they have said from the outset that nothing can be assured without our
[03:24.720 --> 03:31.560]  forces on the ground and as we know whether particularly the instance of
[03:31.560 --> 03:39.000]  Afghanistan Alex we know that doesn't assure a timely outcome either now it
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.640]  certainly does it and that's four different major conflicts Pakistan
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.640]  Afghanistan Iraq and now Libya right and we have the French pouring into the
[03:47.640 --> 03:53.760]  Ivory Coast removing one thug and now openly installing the other rebel
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.480]  leader who they admits been running around with his people with machetes
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.880]  chopping up men women and children yeah the involvement of the French and the
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.120]  Ivory Coast wherever the French have gone over history as you well know they
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.120]  have left independent nations that were former French colonies in horrible
[04:12.120 --> 04:16.600]  shape the Ivory Coast to being exploited by the West for its natural resources
[04:16.600 --> 04:24.160]  most perfect most prominently oil this is a mess and the other one styles that
[04:24.160 --> 04:28.800]  is NATO or the French at the United Kingdom or the United States and NATO
[04:28.800 --> 04:32.960]  or just the United States but somebody needs to take a very deep breath and say
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.560]  wait a minute is this who America is is this who Americans are is this the
[04:39.560 --> 04:45.240]  nation that we want to be and I think most Americans would say absolutely not
[04:45.240 --> 04:50.280]  absolutely the polls show that Lou Dobbs host Lou Dobbs night on Fox Business
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.960]  Network Lou Dobbs.com will be right back with him to continue along this
[04:53.960 --> 05:01.400]  important line of discussion these UN wars stay with us over the last year

[09:17.240 --> 09:21.000]  we're gonna cover it all with Lou Dobbs here today but out of the gates Lou
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.040]  going back a decade or more I remember watching you on CNN you're the real
[09:27.040 --> 09:32.120]  trailblazer on mainline cable television you were just going off their own
[09:32.120 --> 09:35.920]  statements the UN's own statements the council on foreign relations own
[09:35.920 --> 09:40.720]  statements about a supernational private corporate banking world government
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.960]  a rotting national sovereignty media matters George Soros others really
[09:46.960 --> 09:52.160]  targeted you when you did it in a very level headed well documented way you
[09:52.160 --> 09:55.400]  know really you're the precursor on mainline TV of some of the things Beck
[09:55.400 --> 10:02.720]  did in a little bit more I guess you know carnival type way and and I mean I
[10:02.720 --> 10:05.680]  don't mean that meanly it's just I understand and so here you are
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.520]  completely vindicated you were always vindicated because you were just going
[10:09.520 --> 10:14.000]  off the documents and the elitist own statements but now open announcements
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.040]  every day in the Washington Post financial times of London global
[10:18.040 --> 10:25.120]  government private banking system end of the dollar just Obama following the
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.400]  orders of the UN not even consulting Congress to start this new war now
[10:29.400 --> 10:34.120]  they're talking about ground troops what is it like a decade after you began to
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.120]  be the first to expose this on mainline TV to be demonized to be attacked to
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.080]  have somebody shoot at your house to go through all of this to expose the North
[10:42.080 --> 10:47.920]  American Union and now it's it's almost past say but but you were demonized for
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.320]  it and and of course as you know that's the reflect of the left in this
[10:53.320 --> 11:00.320]  country and I expect to you know to be attacked or you know take positions that
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.720]  are popular with with the left and that's and that's fine because what my
[11:04.720 --> 11:11.400]  interest is America and America and you know that is just where I you know that's
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.080]  where I happen to reside intellectually emotionally or physically and I make no
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.080]  apology for being an American who was concerned most about America and
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.560]  America it's that straightforward and to see whether it and what my great
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.080]  concern in all of us over the years has been you know aside from a position on
[11:31.080 --> 11:36.480]  any one of these developments so that our audience understand that when we make
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.080]  a deal with the United Nations when we sign on to the World Trade Organization
[11:42.080 --> 11:48.120]  when we for that matter when we're part of NATO we are at some margin at some
[11:48.120 --> 11:54.680]  level in some cases at a extreme level consigning away this nation's sovereignty
[11:54.680 --> 11:59.520]  and we are deferring national interest to a broader interest whether it be a
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.920]  European interest whether it be a global interest or whether it be an Asian
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.000]  it doesn't matter but our leaders our elites have on too many occasions sought
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.680]  to obfuscate that reality and and to act to pretend as though there's no
[12:16.680 --> 12:23.320]  consequence or implication for the well-being of the American people or the
[12:23.320 --> 12:28.280]  national interest and and I find that to be not only hypocrisy but frankly
[12:28.280 --> 12:34.080]  unameric. Lou Dobbs is our guest Lou when you over the last decade talk about
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.400]  globalist talk about elitist you would put up quotes from the Council on Foreign
[12:38.400 --> 12:43.880]  Relations from Robert Pasture from the internal SPP documents that judicial
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.960]  watch suit and got and then judicial you'll watch in others you had on your
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.040]  show had the documents but but still media matters and others would imply it
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.000]  was a conspiracy theory but but from your research who are these
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.120]  international interest who are these elitist and what is their overall goal
[13:03.120 --> 13:09.480]  and from your research why is that basically in direct opposition to the
[13:09.480 --> 13:15.440]  interest of our free republic? Well let me answer the latter part first of
[13:15.440 --> 13:20.600]  I'm a Alec and that is this free free republic this great constitutional
[13:20.600 --> 13:26.800]  republic is utterly dependent on an informed citizenry and an engaged in
[13:26.800 --> 13:34.040]  participatory sentences and what is occurring now is that is a constraint of
[13:34.040 --> 13:39.280]  information one would think that given the internet all of the variants of
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.640]  media that all of the vehicles of communication that American citizens
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.560]  would be better informed than ever no far more about the public policy choices
[13:50.560 --> 13:53.880]  that are being made whether that Congress whether to the bureaucracy of the
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.320]  executive or the civil judiciary but in point of fact we know less today than we
[13:59.320 --> 14:03.200]  did 50 years ago about what our government is doing and the and the
[14:03.200 --> 14:08.240]  reasons for it are many but among them I it's been a decision among elites and
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.040]  by the way I'm talking about frankly both political parties in one way or
[14:13.040 --> 14:19.440]  another being involved in an effort to simply preside rather than to
[14:19.440 --> 14:26.320]  represent and to do so with a view that they somehow are ordained to lead rather
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.280]  than dependent upon the consent of the government so when we start talking
[14:31.280 --> 14:37.040]  about the elites that are if you will not necessarily conspiring but certainly
[14:37.040 --> 14:44.440]  acting as if they were in a collusion and concert to create the North American
[14:44.440 --> 14:50.160]  Union it's an empirical statement it's based on fact it's not a question of
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.920]  ideology it's not a question of philosophy or partisanship the reality is
[14:54.920 --> 14:59.440]  the security and prosperity partnership is the foundation and was attended as a
[14:59.440 --> 15:02.400]  foundation to bring three countries together
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.560]  Mexico the United States and Canada and that harmonization as they like to
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.120]  call it but I'm talking about the elites of the United States military and
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.080]  that of the Canadians at the at Mexico our business elites our political
[15:17.080 --> 15:22.920]  elites and frankly they're represented again by both political parties are
[15:22.920 --> 15:29.920]  working to bring about not only a custom union but not only a common currency
[15:29.920 --> 15:38.560]  but an actual consolidation of three nations in the one well that's what's
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.960]  so frustrating is that you are covering real information like if you were a
[15:42.960 --> 15:49.240]  weatherman and a thunderstorm blew through and the and the water a measuring
[15:49.240 --> 15:52.160]  meter set an inch and a half a rain fell and you're sitting there with the
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.720]  rain gauge showing the rain everybody knows this is happening and then they're
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.880]  moving forward these elites with these programs but then they have no respect
[16:00.880 --> 16:05.560]  for the general public and play this deceptive game of saying Lou Dobbs is
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.280]  lying to you when we have this ruling political international class that as
[16:10.280 --> 16:17.080]  you said tries to rule by deception and doesn't want the people involved in
[16:17.080 --> 16:22.280]  governing through their representatives you use the word rule I would use the
[16:22.280 --> 16:28.960]  word in attempt to end plot and you know the effect in some instances may be the
[16:28.960 --> 16:35.280]  same Alex but what we are truly watching is an effort on the part of a group of
[16:35.280 --> 16:44.000]  elites worldwide who wish to bring about a one world order it may not be
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.920]  particularly a new world order since the effort has been underway for some time
[16:47.920 --> 16:53.840]  but but that is one of the tensions that obviously at work in our global
[16:53.840 --> 16:59.440]  society and you look at this global order they're trying to establish it's
[16:59.440 --> 17:05.400]  very undemocratic it it is against sovereignty it is always openly
[17:05.400 --> 17:10.400]  anti-family anything that is independent anything that they can't control they
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.920]  they want us dependent that's what these elites want these mega corporations that
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.080]  aren't free market that's their goal I want to read to you a headline if we
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.000]  put it back on screen and I first saw this in the news in 2002 and when I
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.920]  would cover it even in the Washington Post as a footnote people couldn't
[17:26.920 --> 17:31.560]  believe it but here is the Ottawa citizen one of the big papers in Canada for
[17:31.560 --> 17:37.360]  those that don't know February 22nd 2008 this is three years ago and there's new
[17:37.360 --> 17:40.680]  articles on this as well as part of the continental security perimeter and it
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.440]  says Canada US agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies and if you
[17:45.440 --> 17:50.280]  read the Pentagon agreement with Canada and Mexico it says we will aid each other
[17:50.280 --> 17:55.400]  during civil unrest so and I've had generals on who are retired that say
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.840]  yes this has been the works for a long time to use foreign troops in America
[17:59.840 --> 18:04.440]  and vice versa I mean it doesn't get any more crazy or new world order than
[18:04.440 --> 18:11.600]  that and and it is again for the very reason to state it it is not a matter of
[18:11.600 --> 18:16.800]  public knowledge it is not a part of the consciousness of the American society
[18:16.800 --> 18:23.360]  and the voting public and this this reflect that has grown up over the course
[18:23.360 --> 18:27.280]  of the last particularly the last 30 years in this country speaking only
[18:27.280 --> 18:34.200]  about America then that either political party leaders elected the leaders of
[18:34.200 --> 18:40.760]  this country would in any way seek to deny a larger body of public knowledge
[18:40.760 --> 18:49.400]  of it is is to be contemptible and the national media has too often worked as
[18:49.400 --> 18:54.880]  a not only a willing but an eager accomplice particularly to the laughter
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.520]  and and the Democratic Party itself I mean when you look at the Washington
[18:59.520 --> 19:07.240]  Post the New York Times ABC CBS NBC even news I mean these are effectively you
[19:07.240 --> 19:11.760]  know house organs for the Democratic Party and that's unfortunate because we
[19:11.760 --> 19:17.200]  need watchdogs on our fourth estate not lap dogs and unfortunately most of the
[19:17.200 --> 19:22.720]  national liberal media focus is actually focused on performing that role
[19:22.720 --> 19:28.960]  role of lap dog and help and helper rather than watchdog well that was my
[19:28.960 --> 19:34.920]  next issue as the establishment media kind of circles the wagons with the
[19:34.920 --> 19:40.720]  political class we're seeing J. Rockefeller we're seeing Lieberman we're
[19:40.720 --> 19:45.320]  seeing all these statements Cass Sunstein about restricting the free
[19:45.320 --> 19:50.080]  press fairness doctrine taxes on what they call conspiracy theories things
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.600]  that they and Cass Sunstein of course the regulations are listed not believing
[19:54.600 --> 19:59.240]  in man-made global warming well we see Arianna Huffington saying how do we shut
[19:59.240 --> 20:03.880]  down Fox News how do we shut down Glenn Beck we see two weeks ago in Politico I
[20:03.880 --> 20:07.880]  don't know if you saw it the chilling memos from the head of media matters
[20:07.880 --> 20:12.720]  saying we are gonna gorilla infiltrate with spies and organizations we're gonna
[20:12.720 --> 20:17.640]  destroy not just Fox News but this list of conservative sites you go there
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.480]  you're being demonized I'm being demonized Judge Napolitano I mean
[20:21.480 --> 20:26.920]  these people aren't what even you'd call liberal I mean they're more like Joe
[20:26.920 --> 20:31.040]  Stalin or something I mean I mean they really are authoritarian and scary they
[20:31.040 --> 20:37.600]  are authoritarian in an outlook and and I think in value structure which makes
[20:37.600 --> 20:44.720]  them extraordinarily dangerous not necessarily to Fox News but to the
[20:44.720 --> 20:51.680]  country when when media takes on a role that is utterly destructive in intent
[20:51.680 --> 20:57.560]  and purpose and and that is precisely what many of these advocacy
[20:57.560 --> 21:04.440]  organizations do and they pretend to be some sort of watchdog organization but
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.000]  they they pretend to be forming that role when they are back advocacy and
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.480]  activist organizations but the great thing Alex is that the American people
[21:13.480 --> 21:18.040]  are getting a very clear look at who would what they are and what their
[21:18.040 --> 21:23.520]  designs are that's healthy for the for the nation and I'm delighted to see that
[21:23.520 --> 21:28.920]  light shine very brightly on who they are and what they're up to well I don't
[21:28.920 --> 21:34.000]  want to spend all our time on that group but I mean they are 501c3 and I know
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.880]  mild libertarian groups who have their 501c3 jerked for just getting
[21:39.880 --> 21:44.600]  involved you know in stating their opinion how can they be a pure house
[21:44.600 --> 21:49.240]  organ of George Soros openly calling for the end of free speech in America and
[21:49.240 --> 21:55.600]  then be given 501c3 I mean that that that is very discriminatory it is it's
[21:55.600 --> 22:02.760]  at the very least curious and the use of 501c3 in our society is something I
[22:02.760 --> 22:07.000]  think that ought to be looked at irrespective of the ideology or the
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.520]  the intent and we have become a nation of non-profits that are starting to
[22:14.520 --> 22:19.440]  supplant in many ways to be Alex traditionally the functions of
[22:19.440 --> 22:26.240]  government particularly at the local or county and state level I worry less
[22:26.240 --> 22:30.360]  about the federal level honestly the national level but we need we need to
[22:30.360 --> 22:33.720]  understand what the implications are for all of these non-profits that have
[22:33.720 --> 22:36.600]  grown up over the years that they've grown up by the way they number in the
[22:36.600 --> 22:41.960]  billion some of them with the very best of purposes but the fact is we have we
[22:41.960 --> 22:46.760]  are diluting our system of government through those through those non-profits
[22:46.760 --> 22:53.720]  NGOs and other entities that have been created I'd much prefer people turn to
[22:53.720 --> 22:58.320]  government for the services that should well isn't that an unfair playing field
[22:58.320 --> 23:01.760]  too and the UN model is these NGOs I mean I mean here's an example I want your
[23:01.760 --> 23:06.720]  take on this thousands of waivers handed out to fortune 500 but even smaller
[23:06.720 --> 23:09.840]  groups that have given campaign contributions to the Democrats and
[23:09.840 --> 23:13.760]  Obama with its hundreds of thousands of employees McDonald's gets a waiver on
[23:13.760 --> 23:17.800]  buying insurance for its employees but I'm if this stuff you know gets
[23:17.800 --> 23:21.640]  implemented I've got to get insurance for all of my employees and I will take
[23:21.640 --> 23:25.680]  part of their check to do it so is it that an unfair trade advantage that a
[23:25.680 --> 23:29.280]  hamburger place right next to McDonald's the mom and pop they've got to get
[23:29.280 --> 23:33.240]  insurance but McDonald's doesn't so if you go you know pay money to the Emperor
[23:33.240 --> 23:37.680]  he then waves his wand and gives you an unfair trade advantage I don't think
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.960]  there's any question about it whatsoever it's it is not only unfair but so
[23:42.960 --> 23:48.240]  transparently patronage that it's nauseating when you look at the
[23:48.240 --> 23:53.920]  principle beneficiary of these waivers the United Auto United Auto
[23:53.920 --> 24:00.480]  Workers Union what is the principle beneficiary of these waivers you go
[24:00.480 --> 24:06.200]  beyond that it the supporters of this administration who received the greatest
[24:06.200 --> 24:10.120]  amount of money which by the way wasn't even revealed publicly by the
[24:10.120 --> 24:14.360]  administration of the Democratic leadership but in Obamacare the
[24:14.360 --> 24:18.520]  principle beneficiary of the early retirement support program which amounts
[24:18.520 --> 24:23.200]  to five billion dollars goes to the United Auto Workers Union so I mean it
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.360]  just goes on and on incredible a lot of other questions in a limited time we've
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.920]  got left for you what do you see coming up in this next election we see the
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.640]  $40 billion cut Ron Paul has come out and said that it was all basically stuff
[24:37.640 --> 24:40.480]  that had already been agreed to cut and what was left over from highway fines
[24:40.480 --> 24:46.000]  he's even saying Ryan's budget isn't going to fix things if we don't stop the
[24:46.000 --> 24:50.200]  banker bailouts and deal with what the Federal Reserve's doing monetizing the
[24:50.200 --> 24:55.240]  debt and devaluing the currency that all of this is window dressing Lou Dobbs is
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.760]  a real financial expert decades in the trenches what's your view on what's
[24:59.760 --> 25:02.680]  happening with the budget well I had the opportunity to talk with the
[25:02.680 --> 25:08.200]  congressman two days ago and we discussed exactly these issues Alex and
[25:08.200 --> 25:14.600]  and the congressman does question whether or not any of this is is
[25:14.600 --> 25:18.280]  sufficient given that there are larger issues than his views that of course
[25:18.280 --> 25:22.960]  principle among those the Federal Reserve and the banking system and the
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.280]  reforms that are necessary it's unquestionable that we need to reform
[25:26.280 --> 25:32.920]  our bank system that we need to take a very strong look and reorganize in my
[25:32.920 --> 25:38.120]  judgment the Federal Reserve but that is a long that is a long-term effort it's
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.720]  going to take years to accomplish what I am so pleased with is that
[25:42.720 --> 25:48.040]  congressman Paul Ryan has come forward with the boldest most effective in my
[25:48.040 --> 25:57.400]  opinion budget plan to deal with deficit not the national debt but deficit in
[25:57.400 --> 26:01.280]  history unfortunately that's the kind of plan that is necessary because we've
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.400]  got as you know the the greatest debt of that and those tremendous deficits in
[26:05.400 --> 26:13.040]  our history but he has with a I think an opening with an opening stake set the
[26:13.040 --> 26:17.240]  bar very high and as we watched the president couldn't come close to it with
[26:17.240 --> 26:23.360]  with a rather evil fiscal policy speech that he gave the George Washington
[26:23.360 --> 26:29.560]  University Wednesday well Lou as you know Kennedy in the one bracket cut taxes
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.840]  about 50% and 61 the other bracket 30 something percent I forget the exact
[26:33.840 --> 26:38.280]  number and tax receipts doubled California's increased taxes and their tax
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.960]  receipts are going down they're not stupid obviously Obama and these
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.760]  collectivist want to wreck the economy so they can come in as the saviors and get
[26:46.760 --> 26:50.920]  more people to basically beat themselves you know on their system by wrecking it
[26:50.920 --> 26:56.520]  and now we have this chilling statement by Geithner today at CNBC it's also CNN
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.720]  Fox is reporting saying that if they don't basically increase the budget and
[27:00.720 --> 27:07.240]  raise the taxes that Republicans will be to blame for the US defaulting right is
[27:07.240 --> 27:11.800]  70% of the of the treasuries are now being monetized I mean this is an
[27:11.800 --> 27:17.760]  I mean this scares me that they're now positioning the Tea Party IE Republicans
[27:17.760 --> 27:22.880]  and others as being to blame for this this is amazing and this shows me they
[27:22.880 --> 27:27.880]  think the default could be close yeah here's here's what it shows me Alex one
[27:27.880 --> 27:32.520]  it shows me that our Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is somewhat limited
[27:32.520 --> 27:38.760]  both in his outlook toward the consequences of a decision that would
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.720]  be taken not to raise the debt one to it suggests to me that he has a
[27:43.720 --> 27:50.560]  relatively either limited knowledge of banking itself or the role of the federal
[27:50.560 --> 27:57.080]  government when it comes to the Treasury Department if there is no no default is
[27:57.080 --> 28:03.440]  requisite or a logical conclusion to not raising the debt ceiling let me be very
[28:03.440 --> 28:07.800]  clear about that there are choices to be made by the administration should the
[28:07.800 --> 28:13.840]  Congress elect not to raise the debt ceiling none of those decisions require
[28:13.840 --> 28:21.320]  default and I and anyone anyone who says that it does is utterly and completely
[28:21.320 --> 28:26.720]  mistaken and I would be delighted to have you know step forward and explain
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.120]  themselves because not a single person I respect for the knowledge of a finance
[28:32.120 --> 28:37.960]  public or corporate finance with will support that view well is it not being
[28:37.960 --> 28:44.120]  spread by the media mr. Dobbs is it not a replay of what the central bankers
[28:44.120 --> 28:48.080]  did in October 2008 when they said give us unlimited money or there'll be a
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.280]  depression I mean is this not a form of economic terrorism to threaten default
[28:52.280 --> 28:57.640]  which itself will hurt the dollar to get their way Alex I think that your point
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.640]  is a terrific one I think anytime a public official and a servant of the
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.560]  American people stands up at Washington DC and says that Armageddon is the
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.680]  result of a public policy choice that is not the one they desire I every every
[29:12.680 --> 29:17.200]  one of the national media should be skeptical and point out that position
[29:17.200 --> 29:20.840]  that where it stands historically that isn't what's happening with this
[29:20.840 --> 29:25.400]  national media our national media the liberal media tends to think it's
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.680]  responsible somehow to act as an instrument of the state and that's
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.600]  unfortunate well our time went quick let me say bye to you during this break Lou

[31:17.760 --> 31:22.040]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[31:22.040 --> 31:26.000]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.120]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[31:34.120 --> 31:38.280]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[31:38.280 --> 31:42.080]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[33:17.600 --> 33:22.680]  o'clock Eastern Fox Business Channel with his program as well now
[33:22.680 --> 33:29.080]  unbridled from CNN Lou in closing I wanted to ask you about inflation and
[33:29.080 --> 33:33.080]  then your view on Donald Trump I thought he was just joking around and getting
[33:33.080 --> 33:36.360]  some attention and injecting some of his ideas but more and more listening to
[33:36.360 --> 33:40.720]  him I was listening to him last night he really sounds like he's probably gonna
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.240]  run what's your take on that first and then inflation I think that Donald is
[33:45.240 --> 33:52.680]  having a Donald is having a lot of fun Alex he is and he is very entertaining
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.240]  no question about it I cannot just straightforward as I could be about this
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.320]  I mean I can't read the math at first but like you I thought the Donald you
[34:03.320 --> 34:09.400]  know he's kind of kidding around here but the more time goes by he he seems to
[34:09.400 --> 34:15.800]  be digging deeper into the possibility of running I I do think that when he
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.520]  makes it clear he's gonna announce on the last installment of the apprentice
[34:19.520 --> 34:25.480]  that I'm a little suspicious about what the outcome may be absolutely well if he
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.000]  did run what's your overall view he doesn't like naftan gatton things what
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.520]  do you think about him you know first of all he's a smart he's an accomplished
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.520]  guy you know I'm I'm leery forgive me for saying this but I'm leery of
[34:38.520 --> 34:44.400]  billionaires who want to be in politics it's not to say that I would support him
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.120]  but if it turned out he was the candidate I'm just simply saying I am to
[34:49.120 --> 34:54.800]  me billionaires I've got a higher bar because you know I'm just a little
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.240]  suspicious of it and I'm the power that they already have level on what they
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.000]  would bring to the office so I mean that's just yeah it's just me very
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.160]  briefly what's your view on him saying show the original birth certificate not
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.920]  just the receipt of the birth certificate well you know it's interesting I
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.120]  mean I believe there's no question that the Barack Obama's the citizen of the
[35:18.120 --> 35:23.280]  United States what I do what I'm curious about is obviously Donald Trump's
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.280]  expressed why not just get rid of this nonsense and present a birth certificate
[35:28.280 --> 35:33.040]  be done with I mean that's the that's the intriguing political question for me
[35:33.040 --> 35:39.720]  but you know I think that frankly like we're looking at 14 trillion dollars
[35:39.720 --> 35:45.480]  and national debt I think about this 1.7 trillion in deficits when we've got a
[35:45.480 --> 35:49.400]  government that is dysfunctional when we have our troops deployed all around the
[35:49.400 --> 35:55.280]  world engaged in a global fight against terror when we've got men and women
[35:55.280 --> 36:01.920]  dying I think we've got you know bigger issues to take on lastly the head of
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.360]  Walmart CEOs come out and said inflation is going to be quote serious we're
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.040]  already seeing it in oil gold silver other commodities and then the federal
[36:10.040 --> 36:13.000]  government's telling us there's no inflation problem at all what's your
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.680]  take on that in closing very quickly inflation is as big a problem as we
[36:18.680 --> 36:22.880]  permitted to be the fact that this president comes out with an energy plan
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.000]  five weeks ago doesn't even mention the current high prices of gasoline and crude
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.080]  oil it doesn't indicate any willingness to confront OPEC which is a cartel to make
[36:32.080 --> 36:35.440]  certain these prices don't move higher get it off and get them off the back of
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.240]  the American working man or woman is unconscionable so I think inflation
[36:40.240 --> 36:43.840]  could be a problem but it'll be a failure of leadership not an economic
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.160]  result sure as Obama moves to also block more discovery and production of
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.160]  oil and domestically lewdobbs lewdobbs.com thank you for spending so much
[36:53.160 --> 36:56.760]  time with us and we'll be listening to you on the radio tonight always good to
[36:56.760 --> 37:00.720]  talk with the Alex bank all right thank you there goes lewdobbs very interesting
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.160]  37-minute interview with him today that's why we skipped that network break to
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.480]  have more time with him you know a lot of times it's kind of a treasure hunt here
[37:10.480 --> 37:13.840]  on this show a lot of you notice we don't announce a lot of the big guests
[37:13.840 --> 37:17.320]  that are coming on ahead of time it's just a surprise and we have big guests
[37:17.320 --> 37:20.640]  every day except every once in a while when I just have open phones and cover
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.320]  the news and we do have some more informative guests coming up later
[37:24.320 --> 37:29.800]  obviously we have Lloyd Chapman of the American Small Business League to break
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.840]  down his view of Obama's speech two nights ago and what's happening in the
[37:33.840 --> 37:40.000]  economy he'll be joining us coming up at the start of the next hour for 30
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  minutes and then we'll take some phone calls and then Bob Chapman with his
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.400]  once a week visit now Bob in the last months had a really bad phone line from
[37:47.400 --> 37:53.160]  his undisclosed third world location and so we hope it's good today if not we're
[37:53.160 --> 37:56.360]  gonna have to us not have him on for a while until that problem is corrected
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.880]  which is painful because I always enjoy having Bob Chapman on with us but
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.600]  technology is technology so that is coming I forgot to ask John Harmon today
[38:06.600 --> 38:14.440]  did we do that test with Bob Chapman yesterday it was a good okay so you
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.520]  helped him troubleshoot that fantastic so Bob Chapman we got Lloyd Chapman and
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.840]  Bob Chapman coming today so that's Chapman and Chapman sounds like a law
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.800]  firm or something they're gonna be joining us today as Bob Chapman does
[38:27.800 --> 38:34.360]  every Friday okay I looked over the news last night and this morning and it's
[38:34.360 --> 38:40.640]  it's it's all pretty wild and we are gonna be breaking it all down today I
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.640]  mentioned this with Lou Dobbs earlier Republicans will be to blame if US
[38:45.640 --> 38:52.400]  defaults so what an amazing act of financial terrorism give us what we want
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.960]  raise taxes raise spending across the board or we'll have a default but it's
[38:58.960 --> 39:02.880]  the increased spending and the very banking institutions that we've given
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.840]  trillions of dollars secretly to a lot of it now forced to be public paying off
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.560]  media foreign governments money to Gaddafi hundreds of billions to Germany
[39:12.560 --> 39:21.880]  100 plus billion to England the list goes on and on billions to GE going
[39:21.880 --> 39:27.120]  right to MSNBC and you notice what all these big banker funded organs are
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.680]  saying we need to raise taxes we you know why cuz most the taxes go to these
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.240]  bankers so they tell the poor the disappearing middle class the working
[39:36.240 --> 39:41.040]  class blue collar folks hey there's these big rich people that have got you
[39:41.040 --> 39:45.040]  know 30 40% of the wealth let's get them and then they come out with
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.840]  legislation it'll shake down people making 125,000 a year individually 250,000
[39:50.840 --> 39:56.760]  collectively a husband and wife per couple and that's the only group still
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.880]  buying hamburgers still buying clothes still paying for private school still
[40:00.880 --> 40:06.960]  buying cars buying TV sets buying vacation packages I mean I've studied the
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.600]  economics folks it's those people making 125,000 and up it's those folks making a
[40:12.600 --> 40:17.920]  couple million a year that pay to have the lawn service come or pay to have the
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.600]  real estate you know group come to keep the housing prices up I mean just
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.120]  everything they pay for everything they pay for the boat slips they pay for the
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.600]  beauty salons they go to your Mexican food restaurant they go to your
[40:31.600 --> 40:38.360]  Italian restaurant they make it all go around and you look at California raising
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.280]  taxes on them year after year the income taxes at the state level all the
[40:42.280 --> 40:45.880]  carbon taxes and where are all those middle-class people most of them
[40:45.880 --> 40:49.920]  liberals they don't know why they're leaving California they supported all
[40:49.920 --> 40:54.160]  these policies they're all coming to Austin driving up housing prices buying
[40:54.160 --> 40:58.040]  up all the farmland and then they're down at the city council calling
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.560]  for raising taxes here you idiots you've been run out of California it's
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.600]  basically like a dog going to the bathroom all over your house and the
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.120]  dog doesn't want to be in the room it's been in where it's soiled the carpet for
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.440]  six months and now you want to come into our house and go to the bathroom all
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.480]  over the floor and then you're too stupid to know why it stinks to high
[41:19.480 --> 41:25.080]  heaven listen I love Californians in beautiful state a lot of great people I
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.600]  don't like to oversimplify but look at how you vote on average you vote for
[41:29.600 --> 41:35.160]  Schwarzenegger a gun grabbing open border promoting tax-raising corporate
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.560]  bailout stooge who tells Rolling Stone he wanted to be a dictator and loves
[41:40.560 --> 41:47.160]  Hitler and so he gets ADL endorsements I mean that's in Rolling Stone that's
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.520]  what he told the pumping iron people they were gonna release a new DVD with
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.120]  the stuff they cut out of the film back in the 70s he bought the whole film so
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.240]  wouldn't be released but but Rolling Stone saw those clips back in the 70s
[41:58.240 --> 42:01.440]  with I like Hitler and I want to be a dictator look I'm already digressing the
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.640]  point is people are moving here from New York they're moving here from Michigan
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.240]  they're moving here from Illinois they're from Chicago they're moving from
[42:10.240 --> 42:17.400]  California you people are running from the states that you have ruined going
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.040]  along with this big government model and when you get here on average you do
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.280]  the same thing you're ruining my state you make me want to throw up you're
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.280]  ruining the town I live in you people don't know your head from a hole in the
[42:30.280 --> 42:36.920]  ground and look Texas was the fastest growing most prosperous state but
[42:36.920 --> 42:41.720]  statistically it's not gonna be with you people moving here okay and I'm sorry I
[42:41.720 --> 42:46.280]  just can't handle it you've already ruined your state almost completely maybe
[42:46.280 --> 42:50.960]  if you all leave maybe California get back up on his feet alright I'm sorry
[42:50.960 --> 42:56.200]  I'm I'm ranting here but I mean we've got these California people trying to get
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.440]  carbon taxes through in Texas trying to get carbon taxes they have in Austin and
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.880]  these idiots don't know why in the last three years on average their power bill
[43:04.880 --> 43:11.000]  their gas bills as well have doubled you know I hear mainline idiot liberals
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.240]  you're not even liberals you're just conned by the globalist you think you're
[43:14.240 --> 43:18.640]  liberal with your bumper stickers about carbon taxes and how great they are and
[43:18.640 --> 43:21.520]  pushing forward at the city council and you're doing this all over the country as
[43:21.520 --> 43:27.080]  well and then you wonder you complain why your power bill went up it isn't a
[43:27.080 --> 43:32.280]  carbon tax it's a ripoff for insider power companies to gouge us and you
[43:32.280 --> 43:36.680]  think it's cute I go to Whole Foods and they got all these magazines on the rack
[43:36.680 --> 43:41.560]  about how cool it is to be in austerity and to have nothing I don't think it's
[43:41.560 --> 43:45.160]  cute all right and you know what I said I was gonna get to a bunch of news and now
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.800]  I'm ranting I apologize it's just and and and here's the other big problem Ron
[43:50.800 --> 43:57.480]  Paul and Rand Paul have got it a hundred percent right you can cut the welfare you
[43:57.480 --> 44:02.040]  can cut and freeze first it's frozen now they want to cut Social Security people
[44:02.040 --> 44:05.920]  paid into that you can do all that all day long if you don't abolish the
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.240]  Federal Reserve now if you don't say no to these thousand plus trillion and fake
[44:10.240 --> 44:13.800]  debts that have been made if you don't realize that the big Republican
[44:13.800 --> 44:17.560]  leadership is saying nothing about banker bailouts nothing about the
[44:17.560 --> 44:23.200]  trillion stolen nothing about dollar devaluation and Geithner is going oh
[44:23.200 --> 44:27.160]  it's your fault oh no they're all involved I mean if you got a pin it on
[44:27.160 --> 44:32.600]  somebody who gets the main blame it's Bill Clinton 1999 and the head of the
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.200]  Federal Reserve at the time Alan Greenspan and some Democrats did criticize
[44:38.200 --> 44:42.520]  it some Republicans criticized it but but the ruling political class rammed
[44:42.520 --> 44:47.000]  that through to allow the banksters to create over a thousand trillion dollars
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.280]  in fake counterfeit garbage as made off as admitted he says why am I in trouble
[44:51.280 --> 44:58.280]  this is what everybody does and it's true it's true I mean it was Ken lay in
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.720]  1995 96 on record in the meetings with Al Gore setting up the carbon tax model
[45:03.720 --> 45:09.160]  then Gore set up Gore and blood there's no pun there that's the other the other
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.120]  guy's name is is blood and they set up this carbon trading system and Obama's
[45:14.120 --> 45:20.760]  heavily invested in it and it's a scam and I try to explain this to people I
[45:20.760 --> 45:23.840]  go okay let's just for the sake of argument say carbon dioxide is deadly
[45:23.840 --> 45:29.240]  it kills plants it kills humans it's killing the earth it doesn't it's what
[45:29.240 --> 45:33.200]  plants operate off of they put off more oxygen the studies show that it's been
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.960]  40 something times 14 times I mean it's been much higher in history plants
[45:37.960 --> 45:42.720]  grow faster live longer produces more oxygen the trick is the planet is in a
[45:42.720 --> 45:48.880]  low-oxygen carbon dioxide state they've studied the ice cores the mud samples the
[45:48.880 --> 45:54.840]  the rock samples it's confirmed it's pretty creepy actually that that we're
[45:54.840 --> 45:59.200]  so level the oxygen is low carbon dioxide slow but let's just say it's deadly
[45:59.200 --> 46:04.600]  okay you know you can go out they've done this on TV at multiple events we've
[46:04.600 --> 46:09.760]  done it you go out to mainline liberals at an environmental meeting at a city
[46:09.760 --> 46:13.400]  park in some of the cases we've done it here that entail her did it you can go
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.720]  to him and say listen we're getting the petition signed a band of hydrogen
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.320]  monoxide it's in our legs it's in our rivers if you drink too much of it it
[46:21.320 --> 46:28.640]  can make you urinate and over 95% of the people will and these are people with
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.400]  degrees most these mainline liberals are not stupid they're just a part of a
[46:32.400 --> 46:36.400]  cult they suspend their thinking process and they say yes I want to band a
[46:36.400 --> 46:41.960]  hydrogen monoxide ladies and gentlemen the hydrogen monoxide is H2O it's
[46:41.960 --> 46:47.760]  water four things on this planet create life sunlight water carbon dioxide and
[46:47.760 --> 46:52.760]  oxygen you don't have those you don't have anything okay well the government
[46:52.760 --> 46:56.880]  can't really tell you that the Sun's evil though cast Sunstein tries they
[46:56.880 --> 47:03.720]  can't really tell you that oxygens back people know they breathe that they
[47:03.720 --> 47:09.920]  can't tell you waters evil and so carbon dioxide sounds like monoxide so
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.640]  they do it but but for the sake of argument let's just agree carbon dioxide
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.240]  is evil and bad and deadly and terrible will kill your children kill plants and
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.480]  animals and bunny rabbits and Easter bunnies and everything else and it's
[47:22.480 --> 47:27.600]  horrible it'll kill Chinese jet pilots it it'll kill just anything it's the most
[47:27.600 --> 47:33.720]  deadly thing on earth if you put taxes on it because nothing else is coming out
[47:33.720 --> 47:36.680]  of these cold powered plants the new ones now so you gotta tax something so oh
[47:36.680 --> 47:40.720]  my gosh the carbon pollution if you shut those down here which they're doing
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.040]  head of energy department said it a month ago yeah we're gonna shut hundreds
[47:44.040 --> 47:47.000]  more down we've blocked hundreds just the last two years from being opened
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.440]  built completed plants have not been allowed to open in Corpus Christi Texas
[47:52.440 --> 47:55.880]  and that's just the way it is you just type in energy department shuts down
[47:55.880 --> 47:58.960]  coal plant you'll just get articles every day it's going on all over the
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.000]  country let's just say it's deadly they shut them down China is building three
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.640]  a week has no carbon scrubbers on them at all and spews pure toxic waste mercury
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.720]  lead arsenic into the air no scrubbers no nothing and it drifts over to the
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.400]  United States directly in the trade winds you know China Japan Pacific
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.560]  Ocean United States boom comes right over it's constantly being picked up in
[48:23.560 --> 48:27.520]  incredibly high levels at every metering station in the country local
[48:27.520 --> 48:30.760]  environmental groups will use that to go blame on a local coal plants and time
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.800]  and time again fall lawsuits and it comes out it's China now if we're one
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.760]  world and by shutting down our coal plants it just makes the industry move
[48:38.760 --> 48:43.600]  their words dirty how does that fix the economy how does that fix the
[48:43.600 --> 48:49.360]  environment it doesn't it increases the output in the devil good gas known as
[48:49.360 --> 48:55.120]  Satan itself the LZ Bob the ninth circle of hell absolute demonic vortex of
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.160]  Armageddon carbon dioxide the absolute demonic vortex of hell itself is
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.040]  increasing in levels I'm not worried about the demonic vortex of hell carbon
[49:05.040 --> 49:07.840]  dioxide because I know it's not the demonic vortex of hell as you say it is
[49:07.840 --> 49:10.640]  but I am worried about that lead arsenic and the rest of it and it's cold
[49:10.640 --> 49:13.640]  perfect no they still got to do something with that toxic waste from our
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.160]  coal power plants but let me tell you something it's a lot better than Fukushima
[49:19.160 --> 49:23.200]  you see I'm not a liberal I'm not a conservative I get emails going Alex
[49:23.200 --> 49:26.600]  you're not a conservative conservatives are for nuclear power really who said
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.720]  so Alex you're against the Patriot Act you must be a liberal try a
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.200]  constitutionalist I don't sit here and go well I'm a Democrat so I'm for this or
[49:36.200 --> 49:41.200]  I'm a Republican so I'm for that I research issues I research topics and I
[49:41.200 --> 49:44.680]  come up with my view and understanding and I interview experts every day as you
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.240]  hear them and I literally immerse myself in this to try to be the most
[49:48.240 --> 49:53.600]  informed I can doesn't mean I have all the answers but compared to someone out
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.480]  there in the general public 90 plus percent at the average event that you
[49:58.480 --> 50:01.480]  can get to ban not just a hydrogen monoxide they'll sign a petition for

[54:26.920 --> 54:32.560]  interview with him I wanted to get Ted Anderson 30 plus years in gold and
[54:32.560 --> 54:36.040]  silver brokerage to get on the air with us just for three or four minutes here
[54:36.040 --> 54:39.760]  in fact we'll put on screen for present planet dot TV viewers we had a Google
[54:39.760 --> 54:46.560]  search of a golden silver gold silver hit historic peaks on gold surge it goes
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.800]  on reports silvers way up I mean there's literally hundreds of articles
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.080]  they're breaking down the fact that the euros falling at the same time the
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.560]  dollars falling because George Soros basically told the truth last week he
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.320]  said silver and gold and oil are becoming the new global currency as all
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.400]  currencies are basically devalued Ted yeah sure as it's like a game of Russian
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.080]  roulette Alex except for the bullets pointing at the heads of the people of
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.280]  the nation I'm not not not I'm not talking about the government I'm talking
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.520]  about individuals out of savings accounts it's just gonna be a really sad
[55:22.520 --> 55:27.400]  thing because there's so many people that are trying to live on retirement you
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.720]  know income and that that's gonna just turn into nothing you know they're not
[55:31.720 --> 55:34.520]  gonna be able to buy what they need and it's just gonna be it's gonna be
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.200]  terrible Ted I'll tell you what's creepy is that Geithner's now involved in
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.600]  financial terrorism again saying that if there's a default it's it's people's
[55:42.600 --> 55:47.480]  fault who wanted to cut taxes and cut spending which is the opposite of reality
[55:47.480 --> 55:52.920]  meanwhile AP reports China is trimming its holdings of US securities even more
[55:52.920 --> 55:56.920]  we just got a numbers from February we always get them a few months after and
[55:56.920 --> 56:02.520]  now that'll up the fact that that'll mean over 70% of treasuries are now not
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.680]  being bought by governments or investors they're being bought by the
[56:06.680 --> 56:10.480]  Federal Reserve itself that's what started to happen in Weimar Republic or
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.480]  Argentina yeah that's right that's what causes hyperinflation and we're looking
[56:14.480 --> 56:17.400]  at it right in the face right now the United States is seeing the very
[56:17.400 --> 56:22.080]  consequences of hyperinflation look at silver it's reflecting it right now
[56:22.080 --> 56:30.200]  silver is at $42.88 on the market peak today and presently trading at $42.63
[56:30.200 --> 56:39.880]  gold 1485 70 seeing a high of 1488 70 I mean I can just say Alex right we are
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.200]  sitting in the position now where there really isn't a whole lot of turning back
[56:43.200 --> 56:48.320]  I don't think that even the Republican or even the Tea Party people can stop
[56:48.320 --> 56:51.920]  this thing from happening the US treasuries are going to be sold by
[56:51.920 --> 56:56.240]  the Fed and they're going to do what it takes to keep the government in check
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.800]  paying its bills and not only that all their buddies their central bank
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.680]  branches that they have as members they're going to be bailing them out to
[57:03.680 --> 57:07.960]  it and and it's not going to be pretty and they try to make this a left-right
[57:07.960 --> 57:13.400]  issue I heard Fox this morning driving in on XM Fox TV saying it's the two-year
[57:13.400 --> 57:19.480]  birthday of the Tea Party the Tea Party started back in 2007 four years ago by
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.240]  Ron Paul by this radio show by other true constitutionalist and I don't really
[57:25.240 --> 57:28.560]  hear the Republican leadership going after the banksters they're just talking
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.680]  about cutting some smaller things as Ron Paul has said that isn't gonna fix it
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.440]  and so they're making an issue that if you're a Democrat you've got to be for
[57:36.440 --> 57:40.440]  bigger government folks we're bankrupt the federal government spends double a
[57:40.440 --> 57:46.200]  year what it did 11 years ago we cannot continue to do this and the lion's share
[57:46.200 --> 57:51.200]  of it is bailouts to the central banks that are holding us hostage Ted I mean
[57:51.200 --> 57:54.720]  this is serious business now briefly here after we cover that financial news
[57:54.720 --> 57:59.680]  tell folks over the weekend you've got brokers there the three silver dollar

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.080]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.720]  there is a spinoff group basically inspired by we are change federal jack
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.120]  that's been around for a few years a website successful YouTube channels they
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.920]  go out and confront Al Gore peaceably on global warming fraud and things like
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.040]  that Popeye and we're we're that's his handle we're gonna reveal his real name
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.040]  today one of the heads of federal jack got an FBI visit this morning and they
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.000]  didn't really give him their names but he's going to their office now is three
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.680]  miles away to demand it they came and asked you know any terrorist and then
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.560]  they asked by other members of federal jack and this is the type of stuff that
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.960]  goes on right before we were gonna release the Obama deception the FBI came
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.080]  here and said they were concerned about some comments of the hundreds of
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.680]  thousands of comments or more on info wars calm on the on the articles and but
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.360]  then they were asking about via telephone after they left about the
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.640]  Obama deception and I got a little you know spooked by that and so I decided
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.920]  to release the film two days early and then because of the subpoena I wasn't
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.600]  allowed to say why they were here people said oh he made that up the FBI wasn't
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.080]  there and then a six months later was AP Reuters wired magazine you know the
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.800]  cover story of why they were here for the IP addresses with a subpoena of the
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.280]  commenters but while they were here they didn't follow it up and said we want to
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.960]  know about Obama we'll know about your new film and I'm like what does that have
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.560]  to do with any of this no well where do you plan in with Obama you know this is
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.840]  the type of stuff that goes on in America and it's very creepy it's very
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.680]  spooky it's very melancholy and it's all about intimidation because federal
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.840]  Jack Luke Luke Redals he's gotten threats at his home and threats to his
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.240]  family it's just so have I and sometimes when the government calls you or its
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.040]  private contractors we don't know they you know that they will tell you
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.920]  conversations you just had on the phone let you know hey we're we got power pal
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.280]  try to scare you this isn't just Joe Schmo calling you and we're gonna get
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.640]  him on the show the last 20 minutes or so when Bob Chapman joins us but but
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.560]  finishing up with Ted Anderson Ted getting back to these golden silver
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.480]  offers I mean these are great deals and you you're able to offer it because
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.960]  gold and silver keeps going up so much you buy a bunch of it when they do these
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.920]  dips it's overall going straight up but there's little dips before it goes back
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.800]  up you buy when it dips and then pass on the savings and that's how you're so
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.400]  successful and you make a tiny because I see the the actual markup sheets two
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.520]  three four percent max but after shipping handling your cost I know I was
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.720]  actually talking to some of the brokers yesterday they're kind of irritated by
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.360]  because all they do is take these orders and then they can never even make a
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.320]  little markup to even make a little money for themselves but this is your
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.720]  loss leader briefly in the minute and a half we have left mentioned some of the
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.240]  Frank's some of the silver half dollars that what are the specials you've got
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.120]  right now for folks that are running through the weekend and again it will go
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.640]  up next week as it did this week a little bit because you're running out of
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.880]  the stuff you bought earlier yeah sure are I tell you what the Frank right now
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.840]  is presently at 319 dollars and the British sovereign currently right now
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.000]  is at 399 I mean Alex I can't say it enough people need your videos in your
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.520]  films a hundred and fifteen dollars for that deal it's just out of this world
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.240]  smoking in addition to this I mean the material that you're putting out is
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.320]  probably the most important part of this but people are gonna have silver
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.080]  instead of Federal Reserve notes and by the way we're risking our life I mean
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.840]  Wayne Madsen's having to leave the country now yeah I know what I and that's
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.280]  the kind of thing that's going I mean that you you've you put all this money
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.720]  and all this effort into these videos and of course people want to watch them
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.600]  for free that's there on the internet but man these are the original in the
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600]  plastic holders you can give them to somebody and have them watch them I mean
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.120]  if they want to know what's really going on Alex just that that that explanation
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.360]  that you had on carbon taxes right before you had me come up after the break
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.600]  was is so invaluable I mean everybody thinks that it's Democrat Republican and
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.880]  all this you know right left-wing thing and it's not it's about paying a tax to
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.320]  a world organization so they can have a world currency collect interest on the
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.360]  debt by this carbon tax absolutely Tim we're out of time great points
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:50.600]  brothers will be there throughout the weekend call today 800 6h 6 2 2 3 7
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.600]  we've got the head of the American Small Business League joining us straight ahead
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.600]  thank you to Anderson
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.280]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.880]  that the state is God the United States is now recognized globally is one of the
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.600]  most impressive police states on earth this film conclusively proves the

[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.600]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.600]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.600]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.600]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:32.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.600]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages

[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.600]  well for the next 30 minutes Lloyd Chapman president and founder of the
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:28.600]  American Small Business League ASBL dot com is our guest if you missed it it
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.600]  will be in the podcast and rebroadcast on stations all over the country this
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.600]  weekend we had Lou Dobbs on for 37 minutes in the first hour very informative
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.600]  interview and Lloyd Chapman's put out a press release analyzing we're going to
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.600]  get this posted up on info wars dot com for immediate release dealing with
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.600]  Obama's budget plan hire taxes on small businesses and federal small business
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.600]  contracts for Fortune 500 firms of course a few months ago Obama proposed
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.600]  having the bidding process secret so they can put small businesses on a
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.600]  blacklist and only give it to big mega companies which violates federal law
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.600]  but the first thing before we even get into the speech and what Obama said
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:14.600]  two nights ago and where this economy is going I wanted to discuss corporate
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.600]  welfare with the Fortune 100 mainly some of the other 500 aren't as bad and
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.600]  the Obama waivers over a thousand of them to McDonald's and the Auto Workers
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.600]  Union and you don't have to get the insurance everybody else does even though
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.600]  those groups then lobbied you know previously for it so it's like going to
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.600]  the Queen of England to get a special license and nobody else can it shuts
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.600]  down all the competition they can hand out favors for their cronies but now we
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.600]  learn why the private Federal Reserve in the last three years and all these
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.600]  bailouts and stimulus packages didn't want anybody to know where the trillions
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.600]  went because most of it went to overseas banks Muammar Gaddafi General Electric
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  MSNBC mainstream newspapers I mean the federal government now with taxpayer
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  money is directly not just giving contracts to mega corporations and
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.600]  cutting out the little guy and killing small business that's the real stimulus
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.600]  if you're going to have this system but it's going directly to the mainline
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.600]  corporate media that is calling for more taxes on the middle class which is
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.600]  then paid to the mega corporations I mean this is very simple but for the general
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.600]  public they still haven't figured it out and they're in this big left right
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.600]  argument about what how much to cut social security one of you look at the
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.600]  actuaries that won't do anything to stop this corporate welfare situation so
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.600]  Lloyd Chapman president of the American Small Business League break it down for
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.600]  us well you know basically large corporations control our government
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.600]  and you know that the lobbyists on K Street that there were these large
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.600]  corporations they call the shots and they get the legislation they want passed
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.600]  the policies and the middle class and small businesses you know are getting
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:59.600]  cheated out of you know billions of dollars we estimate that a hundred
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.600]  million dollars an hour in federal small business contracts are going to
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.600]  fortune 500 firms and it's just you know when I hear you talk about it I always
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.600]  talk about it but to hear you talk about it it's just almost unbelievable when
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.600]  people hear this it's just almost unbelievable but to think that you
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:24.600]  know if you're a retired fireman in you know in Houston you paid more taxes
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  than General Electric did last year it's just unbelievable that there the
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  government's allowing these large corporations to get away with you know
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.600]  paying no taxes and they're going to raise the taxes on small businesses and
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.600]  talk about cutting you know Medicare and Social Security is just so unbelievable
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.600]  well you just said it that's the incredible fraud of Obama and the Democrats
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.600]  the big mega banks that openly and the head of his economic board the former
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.600]  head of GE Obama just three months ago gave him waivers on all of their new
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600]  coal power plants but isn't giving the waivers to everybody else and actually
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600]  shutting down their competition I mean this is pure racketeering and then
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.600]  Obama points the big you know blue collar mass of people who are going under
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.600]  with the inflation that's happening they point them at the middle class and
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.600]  Obama says I'm going to raise taxes on the rich but he's not doing it on the
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.600]  real ultra rich who are getting the corporate welfare they're pointing it
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.600]  at the small businesses in America I mean this and the Republicans aren't
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.600]  even pointing that out I mean they're they're they're saying corporations are
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.600]  perfect they're fine not pointing out the difference between a mega
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.600]  corporation and a mom and pop yeah absolutely it's just it's really
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  really sad fact I'm really concerned that Obama may actually try to end
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.600]  federal contracting programs for small businesses by combining the SB with the
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.600]  Commerce Department the Commerce Department is really run by the US
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.600]  Chamber of Commerce and my fortune 500 firms and I would characterize the
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.600]  Commerce Department is almost anti small business so to think about
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.600]  combining the SBA which is supposed to promote the interest of small businesses
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.600]  with the agency that they're to promote the interest of fortune 500 firms it's
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.600]  just absurd but I'm very concerned that he might try to do that but
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:18.600]  yeah it's just so just so so I call it economic sabotage
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600]  people need to realize that 98% of all US firms have less than 100
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.600]  employees small businesses employ over 56% of private sector workforce
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.600]  they're responsible for over half the gross domestic product 90% of all US
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.600]  exports come to small businesses and I believe over 90% of all inventions and
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.600]  patents and innovation yes all businesses Obama and Bush have given small
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.600]  businesses less than 3% of the stem response think about that we're trying
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.600]  to create jobs and small businesses according to the US Census Bureau this
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.600]  is not you know me the Census Bureau small businesses are responsible for
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  over 90% of all net new jobs have been that way for decades and they've
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.600]  given 3% of stimulus funds and you know while we're talking the government's
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.600]  giving small business contracts to companies and England and Holland
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.600]  France you know just it's crazy and it's and that's why that's why you
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.600]  don't see unemployment dropping you know how can unemployment drop when
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.600]  small businesses are responsible for over 90% of all net new jobs they've
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.600]  given no stimulus funds and the federal program to direct 23% of all
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.600]  government contracts to small businesses that money's all being diverted to
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.600]  fortune-fiving firms well let me give listeners a microcosm and folks can
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:35.600]  pull up the specific numbers on this but generally animal ID premises ID the
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.600]  agriculture department stated policy because you said you know that the
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.600]  Department of Commerce you might as well publicly say they have an anti
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:49.600]  small business view but but but with the the agriculture department they
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.600]  openly say get big or get out and the vast majority of the farm subsidies go
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.600]  to big agribusiness because they're designed even be able to take it the
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.600]  little guys can't get it and now the big guys publicly in the last year gave
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.600]  hundreds of millions of dollars to try to pass the animal ID premises ID and
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:18.600]  other laws to and the in the safe food act and all that to openly shut down
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.600]  the little guys when almost all the violations are big are by big mega
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  agribusiness and it turns out big mega agribusiness wrote those regulations and
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.600]  admitted it was to shut down their competition I mean that this is the
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  name of the game absolutely you know if it's people you know if you talk to
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.600]  you know people in street it's hard for them to understand that the government
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.600]  is as corrupt as it is it's just you know when you look at any congressional
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.600]  committee you'll see that the majority of the political contributions to the
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  members of Congress on that committee come from the industry they're supposed
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.600]  to regulate it's that way across the board in fact I was thinking about this
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.600]  small business issue and I'm going to Supreme Court to try to get the phone
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.600]  records of an SBA executive I filed my 14th freedom of information loss against
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.600]  the Obama administration yesterday I think I'll probably file as many as 50
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.600]  before the years over and this is from a guy who said he's done the most
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:22.600]  transparent administration history but people just don't realize how corrupt
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.600]  the government is because the big corporations control all the committees
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.600]  in the small business committee for example Boeing is a major contributor to
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:35.600]  both the house and Senate small business committee and whenever there's a
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.600]  hearing on small business policy the American small business league it's
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.600]  never called it Boeing you know it's called to testify but it's that way in
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:50.600]  every every government I was watching Terrestar on there again and that's
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.600]  by the way that's a fantastic movie when I had seen that should watch that's
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.600]  really I love it but it really just shows to me that in every area of
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.600]  government you know this corruption is just just rampant it's just so upsetting
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:12.600]  well it is looking at Obama's speech he's talking about getting rid of the
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.600]  tax write-offs that are there or reducing them I mean here in my office we even
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.600]  though we know the income taxes pay to the Federal Reserve and it's a fraud the
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.600]  point is if we don't pay at all dot the I's cross the T's they're going to come
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.600]  in here and shut me down I'm under a magnifying glass but I look at it my
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.600]  employees pay taxes they've written the laws now the CPAs have explained and
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.600]  showed me where we can't even write off computers or building a wall in the
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:44.600]  office or expanding and now they're going to get rid of even more of the
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.600]  write-offs and then meanwhile the big international corporations like GE and
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.600]  others they write the laws themselves through the lobbyist and where they're
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.600]  exempt from everything and it's just incredible that small businesses can
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.600]  even stay afloat anywhere the way this has been set up I mean it's so incredible
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.600]  that I pay so much more money than General Electric does people that make
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.600]  hundreds of billions of dollars a year and that's just domestically and they
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.600]  have all their offshore tax-free operations and then my taxes don't
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.600]  even go to the country it goes to the private Federal Reserve yeah it's
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.600]  shocking to think that with it with an Exxon mobile that paid no taxes last
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.600]  year yes yeah and now GE's paying no taxes and small businesses are going to
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.600]  have their taxes raised it's just unbelievable and Obama calls that liberal
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.600]  I mean what do all these blue collar supporters of Obama think there's a free
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:45.600]  lunch somewhere what are they going to do as more businesses shut down and they
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.600]  lose their jobs I guess we'll go above 44 million on food stamps yeah I'd say
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.600]  something it's hard in fact I'll say it's almost impossible to get this in the
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  media we're talking about GE you know GE owns NBC and you know you can't get

[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  national news channels to control the media so they won't run any major

[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.600]  I know most of you the audience of the syndicated broadcast totally get it
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.600]  but for new listeners I want to simplify this as much as I can
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.600]  and then get Lloyd Chapman president of the American Small Business League take on it
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.600]  it's very simple the Republicans are saying all corporations are wonderful perfect
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.600]  they made the sunrise this morning the Democrats are saying government is
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.600]  wonderful they made the sunrise this morning and corporations are bad
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.600]  the truth is the mega corporations are above the law wrote the law with loopholes
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:46.600]  they're offshore and they are globalist they are bad they've created a rigged playing field
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:52.600]  with it tilted against the little guys and they are coming in
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.600]  and now lobbying to raise taxes on the middle class when most of it gets paid to them
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.600]  in corporate welfare and the Republicans won't tell you that I see these videos circulating
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  like eat the rich and it says even if you took all the rich people's money the 1.5 trillion
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.600]  it'd be gone within three months of the first year's budget and that's true
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  but they don't tell you that there's three to four to five depending on how you break it down
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.600]  that money offshore they take offshore that's the difference
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:26.600]  going over Obama's speech and where this is going this is pretty scary Lloyd
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:31.600]  and now they're saying if we try to cut the budget or anything it's going to cause a default on the dollar
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  what's your what's your view on Obama's speech I thought it was pretty horrifying
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:43.600]  oh yeah well it's it you know it's just horrifying is the work that's that's the work it's horrifying
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  did you notice how we what he called raising taxes I was actually watching Comedy Central
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.600]  and they're making fun of them when Obama was elected Stephen Colbert actually kind of teared up
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.600]  now Comedy Central John Stuart they're making fun of him
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.600]  he called raising taxes on small businesses spending cuts in the tax code did you catch that one
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  yes spending cuts in the tax code yeah he's raising taxes on small businesses
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.600]  I to tell you the most amazing thing to me about his speech was how nonspecific it was
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.600]  you can sit there and watch it and I was actually watching taking notes because I had to talk about this
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:27.600]  and it was really it was just very vague and also the thing that amazed me was how he goes out 12 years
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.600]  to make it sound like it's a lot of money you know you're not going to be in office in 12 years
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  you're probably in office and you know in 24 months and it's just really a bizarre how he says yes
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  can I save X number dollars over the next 12 years well your policies won't be in place 12 years now
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.600]  no matter no matter what policy they pass now that won't be in place
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.600]  well they always say we're going to leave Iraq in two years and two years later they don't
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.600]  yeah you know they're calling the war a kinetic action and they're saying ground troops are just advisors
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:03.600]  I mean this is and now tax increases are cleaning up tax exemptions I mean they I mean this really is Orwellian
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:09.600]  yeah I'll take something funny you can't believe anything that Obama says
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.600]  remember I'm embarrassed to say and remind you that I campaigned for Obama
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:19.600]  I would do radio shows campaigning for him I met him I talked to him I thought he was going to be great
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.600]  and he's gone back on every single campaign promise he made I literally can't think
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.600]  of anything that he said he was going to do that he's done I really am not aware
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.600]  and he's taken every Bush corrupt policy because these guys are just frontmen and put it in high gear
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  and Democrats are like we like torture we like war now we like GE robbing us it's fun
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:48.600]  well I take something that amazes me I think I saw a poll that he has something like 95% approval rating
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.600]  with African Americans and minorities don't understand that he is dismantling
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:00.600]  all federal contracting programs for minorities there's a federal law that says 5% of all government contracts
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  should go to minorities and within I think within 90 days of being elected he sent a memo out to the Pentagon
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  to start dismantling that program and there's no publicity there's no press
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:20.600]  so the first black president and the first African American Attorney General are dismantling
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.600]  the federal programs to help minorities to give them contracts and and no one seems to know about it
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:31.600]  but you have to remember when you see Obama on television he's reading every word he's saying
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.600]  he's reading it and he looks left and right like he's you know looking at the crowd he's reading off the teleprompters
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.600]  you know one of one of my staff you know back when we were campaigning for him went to a campaign speech
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:50.600]  and step behind him and he said he's looking at these two clear plastic you know teleprompters reading speech
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.600]  but when you see it on television and he's looking to the left and looking to the right and looking
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.600]  at the center looks like he's you know looking everybody eye he's reading everything and the news for over a year and a half
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  would never pull back and show the teleprompters and that's what I told Republicans when I saw his real policies
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.600]  even before he got into office I said you Republicans it's all about the surface
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:17.600]  well he's a Democrat so he must be bad well he actually expanded all the Bush policies just different rhetoric
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  all of you Republicans if you're actually about the real actions wars torture big government soaking us to corporations
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:32.600]  you should love Obama mainline Republicans should fall down on their knees and worship him
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:39.600]  and hey black Americans taking your small business contracts you like being poor you like not having a shot at those contracts
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.600]  good and you do Republicans hating because of surface issues even though they should love him and Democrats loving
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:50.600]  even though they should hate him if they follow their real policies let's do a few more minutes stay there

[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:03.600]  woke him up early this morning didn't offer who they were when they left he called the FBI tried to go down there
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:11.600]  now they won't give them their names just incredible that and we've had the FBI come here too
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  and then ask us about the Obama deception and what are we doing well they came here and then left and I got phone
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:23.600]  calls from the agent that sent them here in California asking me questions and I said what does this have to do with
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:32.600]  with with with you know all this show this is this intimidation going on against the American people and it's very
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:40.600]  very creepy and very very dangerous when you've got the White House regulations are coming out saying we should infiltrate
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:46.600]  Liberty groups we should discredit them we should try to pass laws to arrest people that question government
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:53.600]  I mean these are quotes and then you have the New York magazine two weeks ago with a front cover profile on
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:59.600]  myself basically saying yes I could cause violence even though I'm not for violence offensively and I am for
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:06.600]  defending yourself against here any of you have to like Hitler what happened we should lay down to that and
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:13.600]  he he went on to quote Cass Sunstein and say basically maybe Cass Sunstein's right I mean we just saw media
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  matters in internal memos that came out in political two weeks ago saying infiltrate destroy alternative media I
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.600]  mean this is getting scary Wayne Madsen who's a liberal but then exposing Obama he's directly from the State
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:35.600]  Department source and a major media source the government source is leaving the country because he's been told they've
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.600]  got the government has a hit out on him and by the way he's the guy that got me Deborah Jean Palfrey the D.C.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  Madamon and I said you're not going to kill yourself are you and she said no in a month or so later they murdered
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  her and she told her the manager of the condo complex she lived in for years in Florida in between D.C.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  that okay I'm going to prison now I'm going to deliver these boxes to my mom I got people following me she told
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.600]  us she wouldn't commit suicide and they just killed her and hung her in the shed at her mommy's her elderly
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:13.600]  mother who found her and they told us it was a suicide I mean this is scary scary stuff ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:21.600]  and this is we have a tyranny on our hands I didn't mean to digress Lloyd Chapman off into that but but I mean this
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  is the real world we live in I take something something else to tell you what's happened to me I've got some
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.600]  stories to tell you know go ahead people need to hear what goes on in America you had up a group with
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  hundreds of thousands of members very prominent you're suing the government you're getting documents tell us
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:43.600]  people need to know who who run and I don't do this to scare people I do this so folks know just the type of
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.600]  criminals were dealing because I believe in America the American people and I believe that we're going to stand
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.600]  up against these bullies just like an old Western where the bad guys come into town and people are finally
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.600]  sick of it I mean briefly tell folks what's happened to you oh I came to work one day and there was a truck
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:11.600]  in the in the front of our building and they said they were running phone lines for AT&T and about two hours later
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:20.600]  a metal rod the size of your finger came up to the floor in our phone room and we went outside and you know
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:27.600]  confronted them and then about a week later AT&T called us they weren't our provider and said we need to come
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.600]  in your building and work on your phone system so you're on our provider you know go away and then our
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:39.600]  phone system went down and AT&T guys called and said oh you know your phone system down you know we need to come
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:45.600]  and fix it I was out of town they'll let them in and then about a week after that was when Bush left
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  office and a guy from the NSA was on the Keith Oldman show and said the NSA was marketing people's phones
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.600]  and then a few days after that a guy from San Francisco the work for AT&T said AT&T was giving the government
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:06.600]  information on people you know in Northern California and you know gosh I've had people follow me and I've had
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  guys walk up to me while I'm talking to people and take my picture and get in the car and drive away and just
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.600]  all kinds of bizarre stuff. Now that's the exact kind of thing I get. Oh yeah. Have you had and you're in
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  Northern California. Yeah I live in Sonoma County outside San Francisco but they've been I've had death threats
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:31.600]  when people when I had a guy call me when I was suing the Pentagon back 20 years ago and he said
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.600]  you're gonna get hurt you're interfering with the largest defense contract in history you're gonna get hurt
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.600]  and I was kind of puzzled I thought that a Korean kid what was that I got two or three phone calls like that
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.600]  and finally the guy called me so you're gonna get hurt I said tell you what I'm from Texas I've got a
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  57-meg revolver tell me where to meet you and you can try to hurt me and that's the last one I got
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  but I've had guys follow me in the freeway I've had people you know I had a guy following me one time
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:09.600]  I went on the on the highway I went down to 20 he stayed behind me went to 120 stay behind me right
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  but they're just trying to intimidate you know what I'm talking about right you've had this oh I've had that
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  and a lot more I've had I've had I've had the special forces guys three times once they didn't threaten me
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.600]  but the other two times and you tell these are not regular army people in plain clothes and they get around
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.600]  to you when you're coming out of Target getting baby diapers or you know in one case at 10 o'clock at night
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:40.600]  11 at night or when I came out of the TV station by myself for and they'll just say look don't plan anything violent
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.600]  and I go you just say that so you can morally in your mind pretend that I'm a combatant and an enemy
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.600]  and I said I'm a media person you guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves and then you know then they'll basically
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  tell them they got poked me and they said oh you think you can I just and I don't want to get into tough guy stuff
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.600]  but I just said look I just said come on you're about your cowards go ahead and try something right now
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  because at a certain point you can't live in fear from this we're not going to be men we're going to be mice
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:13.600]  if we give into it and folks if you give in they're going to take everything and it's just like in no way out
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:17.600]  with Kevin Costner once I had those experiences where he's being followed around at the Pentagon
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.600]  and and and his boss knows that he's on to something so he says these men are now assigned to you
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.600]  and he says who are these men these men are formally associated with special forces and it's literally
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.600]  but they were younger all three cases just like that you can tell they've been overseas killing people
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  they think they're tough and I'm just like looking at them and and now it came out last year in Bloomberg
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  that the big insurance companies 11 years ago now 12 signed a deal secretly to take all the death benefits
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  of world war two vets through current vets and they just steal their death benefits they've been paying into
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:56.600]  their insurance money and it's like you want to talk to these guys and go use your head moron
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  this isn't what America's about you threatening me in a parking lot it came out four months ago in Tennessee
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:09.600]  that campaign for liberty is being spied on that the army is going to Ron Paul rallies I mean it came out
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:15.600]  three years ago and are in the Fed protest in Houston they had the army spine on Ron Paul on me up in Dallas
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  they had the army there and the army memo leaked us by good people in the army by the way because again
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  most of the donations were to Ron Paul that year that's what's so incredible about this is that they've got
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:34.600]  the bad guys and they're the minority but they're the ones that'll do this saying don't let the Ron Paul rally
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:40.600]  people know you're with the army in plain clothes they may try to kill you so they're giving the troops memos
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  that we're going to the so so maybe these guys they send to try to intimidate me maybe they're believing
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.600]  what they've been told about us man I mean it's just this is like the Soviet Union this isn't America
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  you know I wrote a press release about that one time saying that cheating America is a patriotic and people
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:03.600]  military you don't need to realize that when you're when you're spying on the American people and trying to
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.600]  intimidate people like you that's not patriotic that's not what this country's founded on and I had one of those guys
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:15.600]  outside my office he was clearly a military guy in plain clothes chain smoking you could you could tell a
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  military guy in plain clothes you can just tell you can tell special forces operators from regular army
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.600]  I mean they're like wolves just looking at you and they think it's real funny yeah it's it's it's interesting but
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.600]  it I'm you know I don't care anymore and I like you I don't care there's nothing they can do I don't care
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.600]  these photos you know they're around the office I don't care I think it's funny now in fact I'm proud that I can
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.600]  cause that much trouble well let's talk about what you discussed because they try to keep these numbers secret
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:50.600]  but you've got links to this in your document link in your press release this April 13th report you just put
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  out a few days ago and it says the most recent information released by the Obama administration shows large
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:01.600]  receipts of small business contracts such as Boeing Lockheed Martin Northard Grumman Raytheon Dell
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:09.600]  computers EROX SAIC that's that big that's one of the really sneaky ones general dynamics Bechtel and John Deere
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:15.600]  moreover federal data indicates that corporate giants are receiving as much as 200 billion a year from
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.600]  federal small business contracts and correct me if I'm wrong under that program they're not supposed to be getting
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  that money absolutely not in fact federal law defines a small business of being independently owned
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:33.600]  so a publicly traded company doesn't qualify as a small business no matter what they do but yeah this is
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:39.600]  a story I've been trying to get the mainstream media for a decade it's really hard small business are supposed
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.600]  to get around 230 billion a year in federal contracts that would be the most powerful economic stimulus that
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:50.600]  he was ever proposed to create more jobs do you think President Bush or President Obama ever thought about
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:57.600]  it's a wonderful program you know started back in 1953 with Eisenhower and it's been completely you know
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.600]  what subverted or all the money's going to the fortune 500 firms and of course as we talked earlier
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:07.600]  they're the ones control all these committees so and it's hard to get this in the press because those
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:12.600]  institutional ads that you and I see all the time from these big you know fortune 500 defense contractors
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:19.600]  but I think that if the government would do one thing President Obama do one thing he said in February of
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.600]  2008 it's time to end the diversion of federal small business contracts to corporate giants if it would
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:30.600]  simply do that it would create more jobs put more existing federal infrastructure spending into the
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.600]  middle class anything they've ever talked about but the big mega corporations want to consolidate power
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:42.600]  their own stated goal is to create an economic system where you have to work for them absolute and here
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:47.600]  they are getting the small business money and so of course you're getting threats of course I'm getting
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:53.600]  threats I mean it's there 200 billion in their eyes they want the taxpayer money and I'm sick of it I
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:59.600]  mean our economy is falling apart I'm an American I'm a patriot so are you I want to have a future for my
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:06.600]  children and to these I mean they're here's the deal they know they're consolidating the economy and power
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  but at a certain point they're going to destroy their own nest when they wreck things so bad where is the
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.600]  tax base going to be for them to continue to suck off of us they're they're too good at what they're doing
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:22.600]  they're killing the golden goose they've done it already I think quite frankly I think they've done it already
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:29.600]  and I think that these big corporations have have just gone too far and I'm not sure we can we can get the
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.600]  economy back on track quite frankly in fact the things that Obama's proposing simply will not work
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  there's just no way it's going to work you know raising taxes on small businesses economic sabotage so I
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:46.600]  think it may be too late and I just don't I'm not confident that they're going to get the economy back
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  the way it was before I think these large corporations have just gone too far and you know what Alex I think
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.600]  secrets all this is campaign finance reform if these big corporations couldn't funnel money into these
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.600]  politicians pockets like they do they wouldn't have this kind of power I agree with you but every time they
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:09.600]  give us a McCain fine gold it doubles what the big guys can give and restricts an individual right so no
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.600]  matter because people aren't sophisticated enough whatever reform they give will be the opposite of what
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.600]  you know that's that's it that's the Washington DC two-step in it so you know come out with a piece of
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.600]  legislation with one title that does exactly the opposite but if the American people I guess I was
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.600]  thinking about this earlier we're not communicating the American people are not communicating their
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  government they're not getting it so if you're sitting at home looking this and you're you're upset you
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  need to do something you know do something get on the phone you know call you know call your
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:44.600]  Congress we call your senator well that's what's frustrating you're risking your name your treasure your
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:50.600]  your body I'm doing it and I want the general public all these so-called tough guys out there that
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.600]  wouldn't let their neighbors dog do something in their yard but they'll let the system rob them I want to
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:00.600]  see all you tough guys all you John Wayne's out there I want to see you do what we're doing so you can
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:07.600]  face the intimidation and really learn how real this is I want you to step into the fire step on to
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:13.600]  get in the arena because I know a lot of you are tough guys and once they come after you you're going
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.600]  to get your backup and then we're going to have a larger army and that's starting to happen and we
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:23.600]  cannot give into this intimidation we have to start engaging our government at every level and get our
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.600]  liberty muscles back in place the systems trying to intimidate us because they're scared and they know
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.600]  they've gone one you know bridge too far and I want to thank Lloyd Chapman of ASBL.com for joining us
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.600]  we've got your press release posted at info wars.com I'd hope that drudge or somebody would pick this up
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:48.600]  but Obama budget plan hire taxes on small businesses and it is very important to get this information out
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.600]  we'll talk to you again Lloyd Chapman thank you for joining us thank you Alex you know I hardly ever talk
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  about the intimidation here because it doesn't intimidate me and that's why I don't do it that much anymore
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:07.600]  I mean it makes me mad and it's spooky sometimes but I just kind of like whatever then you know at a
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  certain point you just got to stop caring I mean you got to I go back to being 10, 11, 12, 13 years old
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.600]  and getting beat up almost every week by kids that were three four years older and and I didn't go call
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.600]  the ADL or the Southern Poverty Law Center trying to push all these bullying laws to take everybody's free
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.600]  speech they don't want to stop the bullying they want to stop free speech and they're not saying
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.600]  kids talking bad they should go to jail but the point is bullying is an issue but it only made me stronger
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:39.600]  that my dad said well tough luck better fight back you know that was the kind of the old fashioned view
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:44.600]  of things so when I finally found out how to fight back I not only started kicking their hind ends
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.600]  I started enjoying it and then that can become another problem when you go too far to the other side
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  but at a certain point you just can't let people stomp and kick on you and be scared of them
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.600]  and at a certain point you got to just say you know what I don't know how this fight's gonna end
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.600]  this is a political info war but you started it and now I'm gonna finish it
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.600]  in fact you may even beat me in the end and let me tell you a few times I got myself beat leg broken
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.600]  concussion you name it but you know what they still when they were walking away they were bleeding
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.600]  and they were hurt bad too at a certain point you got to go you know what you're not coming out of this unscathed
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:22.600]  I'm not here as your format I'm not here to be raped by you it's over you understand
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:26.600]  and let me tell you it feels a lot better fighting somebody than it does getting on the ground
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:31.600]  and balling up so they can sit there and kick you in the head and you got all these goose eggs on the top of your head
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:37.600]  okay I am never gonna get on my knees again and have people stomp on me and kick me in the head
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:44.600]  you understand I am not gonna do it the globalist are cowards they like to bomb people from 50,000 feet in the air
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.600]  they like to snatch in put a taser in put a bag over your head and torture you for months
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.600]  you're a bunch of scumbag serial killer cowards that go and get jobs for the globalist
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.600]  and that's what's sick our average military man and woman are the salt of the earth good people
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.600]  evidenced by the polls evidenced by their supporter Ron Paul
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  the problem is they sift through the military and law enforcement and find psychopaths
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:15.600]  and they got an army of psychopaths and it's time for the military and the police and the FBI listing to side
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  what side are you on if you serve this system if you go along with this evil
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:27.600]  if you rationalize and make excuses and just try to do your 25 30 and get out
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.600]  school teachers bureaucrats any of you corporate people
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:38.600]  if you turn your eyes away from reality and walk on you're gonna destroy our entire society
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.600]  and that goes for the general public too if you don't resist this you're part of the problem
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.600]  and I'm not on some moralizing high horse here this is about survival

[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.600]  and that doesn't mean you got to save the world by yourself but you got to have courage to at
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.600]  least speak the truth you got to have courage to knock on your neighbor's door you got to
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.600]  have courage to go to the city council the school board you got to have the courage to
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:32.600]  spend time to get informed folks you know we're going into tyranny no one can deny that you
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:37.600]  got to have the courage to go to the city council and the government lies even when the truth
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:46.600]  would serve them because they want to break your will and train you to accept lies and I
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]  just beg you if you've been on the fence out there to research history and reality and to
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.600]  come in and join the good guys because we're going to win this thing it's going to be hard
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  for those of us on the tip of the spear but things would be a lot easier and go a lot
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.600]  harder I'm done ranting it's just hearing about all the people getting harassed and stuff
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  it really upsets me it doesn't scare me it upsets me it makes me mad Jason in California
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.600]  you're on the air go ahead. How's it going? Good. It's about time for all these goons to
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:23.600]  realize that they're not on the big side here it's going to be before too long they realize
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:28.600]  they're on the small team and whatnot there's also a judge over everything and these people
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:35.600]  don't believe in God they will. Yeah exactly and the problem with going to the city council
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.600]  and all that stuff here is like you don't know if you're really talking with corrupt people
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:43.600]  or good people or not you have the time you know. Well you're going to draw them out though.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:49.600]  Yeah this is true over time. What's on your mind Jason? Comments one thing is they're not
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.600]  I'm wondering what's going on no one's bringing up talking about the offsite nuclear plants
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.600]  especially one offsite that was supposedly already starting to go into Meltdown or whatever
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.600]  I'm not really sure where it's at but no one's talking about the offsite plants the smaller ones
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:07.600]  and then that's right there's a bunch of other plants reportedly having trouble in Japan
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:14.600]  and at least four of the six reactors have had partial meltdowns two of them they report
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:21.600]  have gone through complete meltdown. Yeah I mean but that's what I mean I mean why do
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.600]  they build these unstable dangerous reactors their own General Electric engineers decades
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.600]  ago resigned over it why they build them on fault lines why they store the reactor rods
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  on top of the I mean it's crazy these people are nuts. Chris really it's part of a big
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.600]  plan I would imagine the only thing that seems to make any kind of sense. Well the plan is
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  they don't care these people are just nuts. Sickening really and you're trying to protect
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  my family and thinking of things they're doing here about guys chopping up men and women
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  with machetes and things it just blows your mind. And the UN backing them? Yeah exactly
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.600]  you don't even know what's going on. Rwanda Ivory Coast every time the UN goes in somewhere
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  it's just absolute mass murder and I got to hear all these idiot fake liberals telling me
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:10.600]  how loving the UN is you're a bunch of morons mainline conservatives to have no idea what's
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:16.600]  going on it just makes me sick Jason I appreciate your call good points. Greg in New Jersey
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:22.600]  you're on the air. Hey there Alex we've been getting a bunch of these reporters coming
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.600]  around to some of our local meetings from a company called patch.com and a lot of people
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:31.600]  that know what patch.com was are you familiar with this? It rings the bell tell me. Well
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.600]  it looks like patch.com is owned by AOL and that's yeah Ariana Huffington so they're
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.600]  sending operatives to the meetings to do what? Basically to report slanted news is basically
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:49.600]  it. I mean we've had a recent meeting in our local town. No I did see a report a few months
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:53.600]  ago about this we need to do more on this. Yeah I'm sorry go ahead. Yeah so they came
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.600]  and they said that we had this like big contentious meeting and things like that and it never
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.600]  happened. The only contention part that happened was at the end of the meeting. Well that's
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.600]  like snopes in all these groups they just say it's like media matters that we are a
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:11.600]  nonpartisan total authority on facts and meanwhile their internal memos are we will destroy them
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  and get the alternative media total power gorilla warfare. I'm sorry go ahead. And they're
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.600]  isolated in specific states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Connecticut.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:28.600]  Yeah they're in blue states I'm looking at a map. No I've read about stay there I'm going
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  to come back to you and other callers even though Bob Chapman's coming up in about five
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.600]  six minutes we'll get to you while he's on with us. We've got federal jack under FBI
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:46.600]  infiltration it's incredible it's all coming up stay there. You are listening to GCN. Visit
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:55.600]  GCNLive.com today. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:01.600]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda they'll
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:06.600]  be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:12.600]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:18.600]  as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:24.600]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:29.600]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists they're asking for more matches and
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:33.600]  the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:40.600]  and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:47.600]  Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality

[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:26.600]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.600]  Greg in New Jersey called in and asked me about patch.com and I'd seen a few news articles
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.600]  the last six months about it. But in the last month I saw Arianna Huffington admit they're
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:42.600]  going to take basically their Huffington Post George Soros people, Media Matters, and they
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:48.600]  got people at Rolling Stone, you know all these major publications and a lot of times
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.600]  you don't even know that they're really working for them and then they have local reporters
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:57.600]  that go in and then basically slant the news they want and now Arianna Huffington heads up AOL
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  News and she's openly talked about trying to shut down people she disagrees with and that's
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.600]  why the FBI has visited Federal Jack and that's why Luke's been harassed and we are
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:13.600]  changed. These are patriot, libertarian, transpartisan groups that understand the New World Order,
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.600]  they're doing local reporting, they're confronting politicians, they're getting real news out
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:22.600]  and they're getting millions of views and reads a month just like in Fall Wars gets tens
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:26.600]  of millions and the system is panicking. That's why I could sleep good at night knowing all
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.600]  these new grassroots truly independently led patriots that have basically spun out of
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:38.600]  everything I've done and others have done are scaring the system and so yes sir I was
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.600]  aware of that and I did notice Arianna Huffington involved in this but tell us in New Jersey
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:46.600]  you guys had a meeting, what were you talking about and then what did Patch say about you
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:50.600]  that wasn't true? Well basically we were having our borough council meeting and there was
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.600]  just questions about the local budget and we were trying to clarify things on the budget
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:02:00.600]  and basically they reported the story wrong, make a long story short. We tried to clarify
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:05.600]  it with them and they wouldn't basically correct it. They finally got it right but the damages
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.600]  are already done and then when we tried to ask them, you know, we've tried to get them
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:14.600]  to admit that Arianna Huffington's behind the patches and they wouldn't owe up to it.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.600]  Listen, I had one of the top guys at Media Matters want to interview me three months ago
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.600]  and I had him on the phone and I said you know George Soros is your biggest contributor
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  and he said no he's not and I pulled up mainstream news and I said here's his filings, million
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.600]  here, million there and the guy just laughed at me because I was talking to a military
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:35.600]  operative of the system. I mean of course, to me I was a guy in an enemy uniform, of
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  course it was nothing, it was funny to him and these people are total mercenaries.
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.600]  That's exactly it and the scary thing is that they're designed to kill the true local
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:47.600]  newspapers, the little, you know, the news packet readers, the little local community
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.600]  papers that you see in your mail. And the mainstream big media will then report on them
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:54.600]  like they're accurate just like they say no one's more accurate than Media Matters,
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  totally nonpartisan, internal memos will destroy the enemy, will take over everything
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:04.600]  shut down freedom, just get everybody and then they want, oh loving you know elevator
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.600]  music, we're here to give you the real truth, I mean these people aren't sick.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.600]  That's exactly it and I'm not even going to tell you the name of the patch here because
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.600]  I don't want to give them any more publicity than they have coming to them but at the next
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:18.600]  our next borough council meeting we're going to out them for the basically the agent provocation.
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  Well that's why they're having to like when Media Matters gets exposed they start another
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:25.600]  group and then they start another group and then they start another group and now, oh
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:30.600]  my gosh, we better bring in Ariana and George Soros to run AOL, attack them, the people
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  are waging up, get in there and do what you need to deal with them, we've got a problem here.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.600]  All I can say is I thank you for getting me those glasses like the movie you do well,
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  like those glasses that the guy put on that movie they lived because once I put on my
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:46.600]  Alex Jones glasses I finally saw what the truth really was.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.600]  Listen man, if I ever tell the story it's incredible, all these people they had moved
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:54.600]  into Austin to act friendly and infiltrate and then to do weird camera angle stuff and
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.600]  manipulate things and try to create infighting and I'm not even involved in Austin because
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.600]  I'm all over the country but it's just constant, they work around the clock to attack me,
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.600]  around the clock to create division, around the clock just and there's no way it's just
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  envy and jealousy and I mean you just see this stuff for yourself and this isn't even
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:18.600]  patch, it's a gaggle of other people and it's just like whoa, I mean it's like the wolves are
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:24.600]  on and just like the fake left always plays the victim, oh they're the victim, they're the victim,
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:30.600]  you know, I mean it's just incredible my friend, I appreciate your call and Wayne Madsen's
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:34.600]  leaving the country after direct State Department, mainstream media and another
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  foreign government warning that they are, do have a head out on him, he's leaving.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.600]  It was like Chapman said, he had to leave years ago to the US, he said Alex he'll make you
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  leave someday, I don't know, I don't think I'll just go down, you know, whatever.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:54.600]  I mean I just can't but I do have a family who knows, if I run though and live to fight
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:05:00.600]  another day, I mean then everybody else will do it and now they visited Federal Jack, the FBI.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:09.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:13.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:17.600]  allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:24.600]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:32.600]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:36.600]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:41.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.600]  Number six, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.600]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:06.600]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.600]  in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.600]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.600]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.600]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:19.600]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:21.600]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.600]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:27.600]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:31.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:34.600]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:38.600]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:42.600]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:46.600]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:51.600]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:57.600]  That's End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.

[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:32.600]  You'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:35.600]  You need a 5-day extreme emergency kit.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.600]  With serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for 5 days,
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:47.600]  this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:59.600]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633. That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.600]  Outrage and disgusted.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:24.600]  Congressman introduces legislation to bar TSA from groping children.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:28.600]  That's Representative Jason Shafitz of Utah.
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.600]  That's at GCNLive.com.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:34.600]  Why are Republicans so silent on the falling dollar from Forbes?
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.600]  We got that linked up at GCNLive.com.
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:40.600]  Another one, Rand Paul, Pentagon thinks it's too big to be audited.
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:45.600]  No serious budget cuts proposed in Washington.
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.600]  Meanwhile, scientists warn future drugs will be designed to control human mind
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:52.600]  out of natural news at GCNLive.com.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:58.600]  Truth Shocked by Rachel Woodhouse, how Alex Jones and GCN have revitalized the talk radio industry,
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:00.600]  and talkers are saying that as well.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.600]  Banksters cook up economic snake oil for Egypt.
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.600]  That's just some of what we're going to cover for the last 20 minutes with Bob Chapman riding shotgun
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:09.600]  because he's an expert who's experienced this.
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:16.600]  We've got one of the founders of Federal Jack, a kind of a We Are Change type affiliated liberty organization
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:21.600]  that reports original news, asks politicians serious questions at events.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  Al Gore, you name it.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.600]  I mean, they've confronted everybody all over the country.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.600]  We Are Change has it.
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  Federal Jack popping up everywhere as well.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  I got an FBI visit today asking if they knew any terrorists or anything about terrorism.
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  So it's on.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:35.600]  A good way to intimidate people.
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600]  He'll be popping in.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.600]  Also, Obama's approval rating again continues at all time low for any president this far into their first term,
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.600]  but he doesn't care.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:50.600]  His mission is to get his job done and be politically destroyed and take the blame
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.600]  so a new row of shark teeth, a new public can come in.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:10:00.600]  Meanwhile, talking about the TSA, TSA secretly looks at people who complain about TSA security.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:03.600]  They're telling him if somebody complains, they're probably just a terrorist.
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:10.600]  Oh, there's this little doctor doesn't like his six-year-old having you stick their hands down your pants after body scanning them.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.600]  Must be a terrorist.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.600]  What did they, what did the feds say about and what did Southern Parvy Law Center say about
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:24.600]  Bernard Von Nuthouse, 13 years selling silver coins, openly criticizing the Fed.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:25.600]  Wasn't counterfeiting.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600]  He was issuing coins like thousands of groups do over a dozen private independent men.
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.600]  I could go, you could go and order one coin or a thousand, get them printed up.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:39.600]  They said, well, this is a unique type of terrorist.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.600]  Now, Bob Chapman, we've talked a lot about this today and I had the head of the American Small Business League,
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.600]  hundreds of thousands of members on.
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:49.600]  He's been threatened, he's been harassed, I've been threatened, I've been harassed.
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.600]  You had him try to plant hand grenades on you, harass you legally.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.600]  You had to leave the country after decades of this.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:58.600]  I don't blame you, you know, you live to fight another day on all these talk shows and your newsletter.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:04.600]  The International Forecaster, you helped publish and did put out as the co-author of the Gary Allen Report.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  His son now, of course, found a Politico, another journalist.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.600]  You helped put out an undare call, conspiracy, you helped fund, you have regrippant.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.600]  You've done so much and they ran you out of the country.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:20.600]  Now they're trying to harass other grassroots media groups that do a great job sending the FBI out to them.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  And we were just talking about AOL and Ariana Huffington, who says she wants to get rid of the alternative media
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.600]  and, you know, shut down anybody that she disagrees with.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:30.600]  And these are tyrannical statements.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:31.600]  They're not liberals at all.
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.600]  They just fill that vacuum for liberals that looking for the alternative.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.600]  They've got this patch website AOL runs with reporters and I've seen this in the news,
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  not just an earlier caller going out and trying to, like, spin things against the Tea Party.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:48.600]  You got the Republicans from the right-hand flank trying to take over the Ron Paul Tea Party.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.600]  Started almost four years ago in 2007.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:55.600]  Fox announcing this is the two-year anniversary of the Republican Tea Party.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.600]  So they're really trying to take over the grassroots and steer it.
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.600]  And they're accelerating their intimidation right now.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:04.600]  Is that because they're weak and scared?
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.600]  Well, as you said last week, we're breathing down their neck.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.600]  And they don't know what to do about it.
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:16.600]  And they're trying to find ways to shut down effective talk radio and things on the internet.
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:19.600]  And they're not going to stop. They're going to keep it up.
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:26.600]  And they're going to keep right on threatening people, hoping to scare them into silent submission.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:28.600]  And that's the way they do it.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:35.600]  And, you know, you comment about the person you talked to at that media company.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.600]  And when you confronted them, they just laughed.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.600]  They don't care.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.600]  They think that they can do anything that they want.
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:51.600]  Yeah, these cowards get off on feeling like the power structures behind them.
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:53.600]  They feel powerful through it.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  They should feel like dirty rats.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.600]  And they should know the system's going to crush them as well.
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:02.600]  Well, unfortunately, they don't realize that.
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.600]  And we've seen that happen over and over again in other societies and situations.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  But they're doing what they get paid for.
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:14.600]  And they don't care what the fallout is.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.600]  And they just want to do what they want to do.
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:18.600]  And they do like that power trip.
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:20.600]  That's for sure.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.600]  What do you think about Wayne Madsen, a very credible guy?
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  I mean, over the years, he's just proven to be so bona fide,
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  written for some of the biggest publications in the country,
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:33.600]  contributor to RT, you know, was the guy that got us the DC Madame on.
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.600]  And he got from the State Department, a major international media outlet,
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.600]  and via a foreign, quote, allied U.S. government.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.600]  He wouldn't tell me which one.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:48.600]  And that quote, they are going to kill you or try to kill you.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  And he said, well, you mean, is that a threat or they're joking?
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.600]  No, they're coming after you.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:55.600]  He's leaving the country, Bob.
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.600]  And I mean, he was a guy who I was watching him on video Skype when he said it.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.600]  I asked him repeatedly.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  I could tell when he said he was almost gulping.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.600]  This is a guy who just a year ago was like, yeah, I get threats.
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:04.600]  So what?
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  I'm going to, you know, I'll take care of myself now from these.
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.600]  He's leaving.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  I guess to live to fight another day.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:14.600]  But I mean, this is really serious.
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  It certainly is.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:23.600]  And I get the same kind of call from a friendly nine years ago and same sort of thing.
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:26.600]  And but I had gotten used to it because over the years,
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  I had heard that sort of thing a number of times.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.600]  And you know, all the things I went through without repeating them.
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:35.600]  But the important thing is they're not going to give up.
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:38.600]  They're going after everybody because they don't know what else to do.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:40.600]  They can't shut us down.
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  And the truth is permeating the world.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  I just got off a radio terrain press TV.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  They, they call me all the time.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:52.600]  They never asked me what I think of what's going on in Iran.
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  But anyway, they call me frequently and that goes all over the Middle East.
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:00.600]  Yeah, I'm so busy.
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:01.600]  I don't, I'm not able to do it.
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.600]  And they call me, they call me every week and they always call what I'm on the air.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:07.600]  But, you know, I do the Japanese, the Russian, the British.
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:08.600]  I do it all when I can.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.600]  And it's good that you're getting the word out there.
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.600]  I don't think the globalists and their minions understand the genies out of the bottle.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.600]  I mean, that's not me just hoping and that's clear historical evidence.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.600]  They, they've been discredited and they could get rid of us today.
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:23.600]  It's not going away.
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  People now get it.
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  And I think this is a very good sign that they're getting so threatening.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:31.600]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  And now the next step for us is to reach an even greater audience throughout the world.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  And overwhelm them with people who know what's going on.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:46.600]  And that's so very, very important because that's really what we're doing here.
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:48.600]  And yes, we're going to get harassed.
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:50.600]  And so what?
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:52.600]  I mean, you've got a family you're young.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.600]  It's different from you sticking your neck out.
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:59.600]  Me, I get several years left and that's probably the end of it.
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:08.600]  But that makes me go forward and be more cute in what I do and more effective,
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:12.600]  hopefully, and take some of the heat off other people.
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:17.600]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose, Bob.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:20.600]  That's exactly right.
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.600]  And what song was that?
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.600]  I forget which one it was.
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.600]  Bobby McGee.
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:30.600]  I believe that's the name of the song, isn't it?
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:33.600]  Bob, I wanted to get into some of the incredible developments.
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:37.600]  I see this and Lou Dobbs tended to agree when he was on for 37 minutes.
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:40.600]  Well, this is the first hour that retransmissions coming up in about 45 minutes.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:45.600]  Folks, if you missed it on the audio streams and the free podcast for your local stations that re-air it.
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:54.600]  But remember three years ago, 2008, October, the Republican and Democratic banker leaders came out and said,
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:57.600]  if you don't give us unlimited money, we're going to destroy the economy.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.600]  It'll be a depression.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  Well, now Geithner, as publicly stated, this is CNBC.
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:04.600]  Republicans will be to blame if U.S. defaults.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:08.600]  Geithner, and he says, if we don't increase taxes and keep the spending going,
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:10.600]  there'll be a default of the dollar.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:13.600]  But every economist I talked to says that's what's already causing the default.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:18.600]  China announcing they're going to cut even more of the treasuries they buy.
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.600]  Over 70% of the treasuries now being bought by the Federal Reserve itself, monetization.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  So what does this signify for him saying we're, quote, at the edge,
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:30.600]  and they will own responsibility for the miscalculation?
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:36.600]  So they're saying dollar default, total depression, if we don't just do whatever they say.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:37.600]  Exactly.
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:40.600]  And that's what Hank Paulson said, what you were referring to.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:44.600]  If you don't do what we want, we'll bring the whole system down.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:51.600]  And at the time, we were on the radio and I said, take your best shot because you're going down with us.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.600]  Yeah, it's time to call them. We can't give in anymore.
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.600]  It's time to say, OK, let's just do it. Come on.
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:02.600]  No, we got to stand our ground.
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.600]  And it's going to be painful for a lot of people, people like me and you.
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.600]  But I'm not going to back off.
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:16.600]  But it does, again, show the desperation now, the flouncing around.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:21.600]  And they are telegraphing the fact that we're breathing down their neck to quote Alex.
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.600]  And that's exactly what's happening. And they're terrified, but they're not going to let you know that.
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:33.600]  And, you know, we saw Brzezninski three years ago and then about a year and a half ago say,
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:36.600]  these people know what we're up to, they're getting the word out.
[02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.600]  You got to find a way to stop them or something to that effect.
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:44.600]  Well, the State Department came out two months ago and said the alternative media is killing us in the Info War.
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:48.600]  They said the Internet and other foreign news is destroying us.
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:55.600]  We have no credibility and a bunch of other top globalists came out and they are ringing the alarm in their inner councils.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:03.600]  Well, you're right. And, you know, unless they pick us all up and incarcerate us, they're not going to stop us.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:10.600]  But wouldn't that now that we've already gotten our message out, wouldn't that only supercharge our message?
[02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:17.600]  Yes, it would, but I would rather reach as many people as possible without the supercharge.
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:20.600]  Not a lot of people can handle jail.
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:26.600]  Yeah, I certainly don't want to be there, but, you know, some things are worth anything.
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:32.600]  And it's a good feeling, actually, to be so committed and so far down the rat hole that there's no getting out of it.
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:35.600]  Bob, you know, that is a really good feeling, isn't it?
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:39.600]  It certainly is. We've done what we've done and we're in it.
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.600]  We're trapped, we're trapped, and it's a challenge all the way.
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:49.600]  Toe to toe with the globalist. Make no mistake, folks, and hey, it's a dangerous proposition.
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:55.600]  I welcome you to join us in destiny and honor because you're already in the system whether you decide to fight it or not.
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:59.600]  So why not go down swinging, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:10.600]  We'll be right back with Bob Chambers.

[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:20.600]  By the way, we did a Google search term earlier in the week just to test it.
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:24.600]  Alex Jones and it went to number one, the power of this audience.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:32.600]  But we did two TSA search terms, and the first one was a little complex, six-year-old groped.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:36.600]  That didn't even show up on the charts in the top 100.
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:39.600]  So we did TSA lies.
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:41.600]  Didn't show up anywhere yesterday.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:49.600]  No doubt they're censoring that being on the top trends because we had, I don't know, more than 10 TSA top trends back in November and December.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  And now we've noticed we cannot put out a term against the TSA that will then become number one and everybody goes to our articles and reads about what they're doing.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:00.600]  We got them on the ropes.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:08.600]  So go get the article the old-fashioned way, outrage and disgusted congressman introduces legislation to bar TSA from groping children.
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.600]  It's by Steve Watson at prisonplanet.com.
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.600]  It just went up a few minutes ago, 30 minutes ago or so.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:22.600]  I don't know if it's on infowars.com yet, but if it isn't, we will get it up there on the site.
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:23.600]  Yes, it's up there.
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:28.600]  Outrage and disgusted congressman introduces legislation to bar TSA from groping children.
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:36.600]  Bob Chapman, I want to take a few calls with you when we come back and then get, I want you to stay with us, one of the founders of Federal Jack Alternative Media,
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:41.600]  Patriot Organization, Liberty Organization on with us, Gorilla Media really.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.600]  I got the FBI visit today.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  But before we do that, other areas in the economy, I haven't touched on or I haven't discussed.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:54.600]  Is this a big deal to have China further trimming holdings of US securities?
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:57.600]  Now we learned two months ago in February.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  Well, the problem here is that if they trim and the Japanese have to be sellers because of their financial problems to address their earthquake damage,
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:11.600]  then who is going to buy US Treasuries?
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  They're buying about 83% of the Federal Reserve right now.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  They might have to buy them all and that would be devastating.
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:24.600]  But how can they do that if they don't have QE3 or something like it?
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:31.600]  So that tells you that they must have QE3 and that's what little Timmy Geithner is talking about.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.600]  We must have it.
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  You must let us do what we want.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:47.600]  And that causes a devaluation of the currency and will cause the hyperinflation that is a de facto slow kill default.
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.600]  So they're saying if you don't let us default, then we will default.
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:59.600]  Precisely. And you know, a gold and silver course will go up very, very large.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:05.600]  But one of the big holders in gold is a fellow named George Soros.
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:07.600]  Oh.
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  In fact, I'm watching Sky out of London right now and they just had that on there.
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:16.600]  I was rather surprised.
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:21.600]  No, I had seen that he's got untold horror just like Gaddafi.
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:25.600]  So he'll do quite nicely.
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  Well, that's if he is not brought to trial.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:32.600]  And that's a whole other story because we're going to win.
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.600]  And once we get there, we'll have to decide who the criminals are.
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:44.600]  I mean, you saw Congress, the Senate, Senate 11 said, hey, you know, why doesn't anybody go to jail?
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:49.600]  Well, after being in Congress as long as he has, he knows why.
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  The anointed ones and the Illuminati, they don't go to jail.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.600]  And all the fines are paid by the companies to the FCC that goes in.
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.600]  And that money is used to work against the American people.
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.600]  Yeah, the FCC shuts down all the legitimate mom and pops.
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:16.600]  I was looking at the 376 billion laundered in two years by Wacovia and Wells Fargo of drug money running the aircraft, everything through Wacovia.
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  And they paid $101 million fine.
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:20.600]  We did the math.
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  That's 3.0% or 0.3%.
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:40.600]  So that'd be like if I robbed a million dollars and was coming out of the bank loading it to van and the cops pull up and they say, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, you got to pay $3,000 of that million as a fine to us.
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  But you can take the other $997,000 with you.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  I mean, that's what we're talking about here.
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:59.600]  And you know, I saw a fine of $550 million that was paid by Goldman Sachs for cheating and defrauding people during the mortgage problem.
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:01.600]  We'll just put it that way.
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:04.600]  And they stole $5 billion.
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:09.600]  So they get to keep almost $4.5 billion for being a thief.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:20.600]  And this Warren Buffett, his firm defrauded the United States government of $300 million about a year ago.
[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:25.600]  The piece with the SEC was done.
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.600]  They paid $100 million fine and kept $200 million.
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.600]  Now, I think crime pays in America.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:41.600]  And by the way, when they get those billions, they leverage them through fractional reserve banking and derivatives, so a billion is more like $50 billion, right, Bob?
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.600]  That's right.
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:44.600]  We'll be back with some near phone calls.
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:46.600]  Then we've got one of the founders of Federal Jack on.
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:50.600]  He got a visit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:52.600]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:54.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:30:00.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:04.600]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:30:04.600 --> 02:30:05.600]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:09.600]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:12.600]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:17.600]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:24.600]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:30.600]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:34.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:38.600]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:44.600]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:48.600]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:50.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:51.600]  It's here.

[02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:07.600]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:12.600]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:21.600]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:29.600]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you the way they fit.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:34.600]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:39.600]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:46.600]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:31:55.600 --> 02:32:20.600]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:25.600]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:29.600]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:32.600]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:41.600]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:46.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:51.600]  To get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:33:00.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:20.600]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind, there was something so pleasant about that place, even your emotions haven't echoed in so much space.
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:29.600]  And when you're out there, without fear, yeah, I was out of time, but it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:34.600]  I knew too much.
[02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:43.600]  And if we start to know too much, the fraud of the globalist will crumble into dust.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  Just like when sunlight at high noon hits the mythical vampire, they explode into flame.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:55.600]  Knowledge is power.
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:34:01.600]  The people perish for lack of knowledge, and we are here bringing historical facts and knowledge.
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:08.600]  I want to take a few phone calls for Bob Chapman from Justin, Nick, Bill, Wayne, Aaron. We'll get to everybody.
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:20.600]  But we also have coming on the broadcast, Shane Justice here in five, six minutes, who goes by Popeye, one of the hardest working founders of Federal Jack.
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:25.600]  They're basically inspired by We Are Changed, My Work, and they're patriots.
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:28.600]  They confront Al Gore, they confront Republicans as well.
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.600]  They expose the fraud of global warming.
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:35.600]  They've gotten the FBI visit, so we're going to be discussing that.
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.600]  And the FBI is asking if they know any terrorists in Miami.
[02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:45.600]  An intimidation of the free press, just brazen, COINTELPRO type activity.
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:53.600]  Bob Chapman is our guest right now. Also, we have an article at infowars.com with the federal government, state department, and others.
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:35:02.600]  It's official Arab Spring Subversion, U.S. funded by great researcher and writer, Tony Cartolucci.
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:05.600]  This whole thing we told you months ago was staged, but now they're just admitting it.
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:10.600]  Unbelievable. Justin in Missouri, you're on the air with Bob Chapman. Go ahead.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:12.600]  Hey, how you doing? It's good to talk to you again.
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  Good. Welcome, sir. What's on your mind?
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:23.600]  Well, I called with a question for Bob originally, but you drew me off, of course, and so I have other things to talk about.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:35.600]  But the thing for Bob is, I was wondering how he feels about junior minors, particularly the silver sector, and where's he going?
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:51.600]  What you have to look at here, and there's not being much talked about it, and that is the United States government is using hedge funds to naked short all of the gold and silver stocks.
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:57.600]  And just like that's part of what they're doing to gold and silver itself and other things.
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:07.600]  And that's why they haven't performed as well as they should. You'll see a very good quality company move up and bang, it goes right back down again.
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:13.600]  And that's them doing that on behalf of the government, and that's what's going on.
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:30.600]  Okay, and my other point was, you were talking about getting involved. I just want to say that recently I started making a series, a little series on YouTube called Alex Jones and the Truth Tellers, because I just, you know, I figured I need to start putting something out there, too, because it's, you know, it's just getting to that point.
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:31.600]  Everybody needs to start.
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:38.600]  Everybody needs to. Thank you, Justin. Your phone's breaking up. A few more calls, and we're going to get our guests in back to calls. Nick in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:40.600]  Alex, this is Nick from Chicago. How are you doing?
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:41.600]  Hey, buddy.
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:51.600]  Hey, I have an idea that might work. It's kind of crazy, but I've heard Donald Trump wanted to run as an independent if he doesn't win the GOP.
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:37:01.600]  Now, if that's the case, if he doesn't win, I think Ron Paul and Jesse Ventura should reach out to him, and they all three should work together and put their egos aside and work together.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:13.600]  Well, here's the deal. I've been trying to study Trump now that he looks like he may actually, I may be wrong, he may actually run, listening to him. I'm a pretty good judge, and I think he's considering it. He is against Naft and Gatt, but he's also involved in that corruption in New York.
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:25.600]  I'm not saying he's corrupt. I'm saying he's involved in that corrupt cesspool. He's a donor to Chuck E. Schumer and others. I think a lot of this is Bloomberg's going to run, probably.
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:38.600]  He's total anti-gun, bad news, and Trump could pull off conservative votes and then throw it over to Bloomberg. Let's ask a real expert on this. What's your take, Bob Chapman, on Donald Trump?
[02:37:38.600 --> 02:37:53.600]  He has made his fortune in the belly of the beast, and when you're in that kind of a situation with the bankers, the Wall Street types, you're with them, you're in with them.
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:38:11.600]  I can't trust him. That's really the bottom line to me. I know what he said on issues, and we still don't know whether he's front-running for somebody else, as you pointed out, Bloomberg.
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:27.600]  I'd much rather see an independent ticket with Ron Paul and a warrior, which is Jesse. The facts aren't all in yet, number one. And number two, I'm frightened by his background.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:45.600]  Well, that's my gut, so I spent like an hour last night just doing more research. I'm going to try to do an hour every day now so we can get a clearer research on him. I'm not really ready to completely give my view on him, but obviously you can't trust him just because of the pedigree.
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:39:04.600]  And we did just lose our guest. We're going to try to get him back on and go to Sean Justice, again, known as Popeye on their YouTube channel, and federaljack.com. We post a lot of their videos on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:11.600]  They work with VR Change. They've confronted Al Gore. The list just goes on and on, and we do have him now.
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:23.600]  Okay, great. We're going to go ahead and bring him up on air now, then we'll go back to your calls. Sean Justice, again, early this morning when he was asleep, gets the FBI visit.
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:32.600]  They weren't forthcoming with their names. I talked to him this morning. I said, you got to call the FBI that's three miles away there in Miami. He called him. They wouldn't give him the names.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:42.600]  He's followed a complaint saying, I need to know where these FBI agents that came. But it's the standard procedure. They come and they say, do you know any terrorist? Is there any terrorist in your group?
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:50.600]  What about this guy? What about that guy? Don't tell anybody about this meeting. We just want to, you know, because sometimes they can go talk to somebody. They get intimidated.
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:40:02.600]  And then they'll be like a minion of the FBI and then basically go in and start reporting on people. But Federal Jack is completely nonviolent media outlet that goes out and asks politicians real questions.
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:11.600]  And so breaking this down, Sean is still trying to learn their names because in the flustered moment, in the 10 minutes or so they were there, he didn't ask it.
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:21.600]  And I asked him what he said. It was a standard deal. Of course, I don't know any terrorists. We wouldn't hurt a fly. We're just regular folks. My response would be, you're here to intimidate me.
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:30.600]  And you know full well, we're a nonviolent organization. You know full well, we're getting millions of YouTube views and we're out asking politicians real questions and you don't like that.
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:42.600]  And I want your card. I want your information right now because this is, there have been congressional hearings on this decades ago about what you're doing right now. Who sent you here? Why were you sent here?
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:48.600]  The interrogation would have flipped around, but I'm not blaming people. This has got to happen to you once or twice before you know how to respond to it.
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  He did a great job trying to go down there. He did a great job trying to talk to him later and find out who they are.
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:41:01.600]  Sean Justice known as Popeye and Bob Chapman's riding shotgun with us. He's been through all this before so he can comment from his expertise.
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:07.600]  Break down. You're in Miami. What they said, what they did. You've got the floor. Describe what happened.
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:19.600]  Well, first off I'd like to thank you all for having me on the show. And pretty much I was asleep this morning because if anybody knows me, it's not a secret. My wife is disabled.
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:25.600]  So I had a different sleep schedule and I was up late taking care of her. And they kind of called me off guard this morning.
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:36.600]  And they said, at first they said, when I opened the door, they were like, do you mind if we come in? And he started to step in the door. I put my hand up and I said, yeah, I do mind. We'll do this outside.
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:47.600]  And then like I had the presence of mind to at least not let him in my house, in my apartment. So we went outside and then I asked him, why are you here? What's the, you know, can I help you?
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:58.600]  What's the reason for your visit? And they said, well, we'd like to ask you a few questions. I said, okay, go ahead. Ask me and, you know, if I'm going to answer, I'll answer and I'll do as best as I can to answer the truth for you.
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:06.600]  What do you want to know? Because I have nothing to hide. You know, I'm not affiliated with any radical group, you know, so we're nonviolent.
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.600]  So I don't have anything to hide or anything to worry about. I was just a little caught off guard because I just woke up.
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:20.600]  I did after I replayed the conversation in my head after talking to you on the phone earlier, you know, I did ask them for a card.
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:30.600]  And I asked them if I could have a card contact them because they said, well, if you know of any terrorist organization that has any radical organization contact you.
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:41.600]  And I kind of laughed at it. And I was like, no, like, I wasn't mean or rude to them, but I kind of acted like almost a little insulted towards it.
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  And I was like, we don't know any terrorist organization. And he goes, well, I know you've been active in your local city council meetings because we go and re-educate them about fluoride.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.600]  And I constantly go every time and educate them about nonviolent.
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:59.600]  Yeah, so the message is we're here. You might be a terrorist because you don't like poison being put in your water.
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:05.600]  So the idea is people that go to city council meetings, you know, they could be terrorists, which is basically what the Homeland Security documents say.
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.600]  If you make frequent references in the U.S. Constitution, they need to surveil you.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:12.600]  So we have their training manuals going back at least 15 years.
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:18.600]  That's what's going on. And I just told the guys to try to pull up a YouTube video from Austin.
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:28.600]  I think the search term was Austin woman, FBI visits, visits mother or woman for attending anti-war rally.
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:34.600]  And the FBI comes to a door, man and woman, they want to come in. She says, no, it's all on YouTube. She videotaped it.
[02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:37.600]  And they say, well, we just want to know why you're protesting the war.
[02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:41.600]  I mean, it was very bizarre. But I mean, this is what they do now in America.
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:44.600]  But I just remembered that video. This is ongoing.
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:48.600]  So you did a great job because I know they caught you off guard. Please continue so.
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:55.600]  So they say, well, we know you go to city council meetings, which is a big no-no in America. That's un-American. Please continue with what happened next.
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:44:01.600]  They even made the comments to me saying that, you know, oh, we know you've found a city council meeting, so you sign in when you go.
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:07.600]  And we don't sign in. The only thing you fill out is the form so that you can speak.
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:09.600]  You know, so they say your name.
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:11.600]  Speak up a little bit for me, Popeye.
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  Sorry about that. When you go to the council meetings, you have to fill out the form.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:22.600]  Yeah, they're using that now to send the FBI out of your house. That's FBI now going over city council, sign-ins.
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:24.600]  Boy, that's useful info. Go ahead.
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:32.600]  And that's the only way that they could have gotten my info here, because there's no, through federal, Jack, I've always tried to kind of remain a little bit somewhat anonymous.
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:37.600]  Just protect my wife. Not for me, but to protect my wife because she can't protect herself.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:43.600]  And I know that they pray and go after the weak, and they go after the weak people and the family members.
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:52.600]  And that's why I called back to the FBI and I complained to them and I said, look, you know, how do I know that these aren't fake FBI agents?
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:55.600]  Because the lady I spoke to on the phone said, well, they should have given you a card.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  And I said, well, you know, I did ask for one and they told me just to call the hotline number if I had any tip.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:06.600]  I said, and, you know, how do I know these guys are FBI? How do I know they're not going to break into my house and hurt my wife?
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.600]  I said, so I'm going to, you know, I filed a complaint and of course they haven't called me back.
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:15.600]  You know, I don't expect the call back to be honest with you.
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:22.600]  I honestly, looking back at this, I think this is more of a look you're opening your mouth. You don't like what you're doing.
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:30.600]  Shut up. And I won't tolerate that. The more you threaten me, anybody that knows me, the more you threaten me, the harder I fight.
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:38.600]  So, you know, that's why I was willing to let you guys use my real name because obviously the Fed know who I am now, but there's no point in hiding.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  But I will say to any Fed that are listening, if you threaten my family, you threaten my wife and you hurt my wife, then there will be no stopping what I will do to end the NWO.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:59.600]  Nonviolently, of course, but I will not stop at all. So, don't threaten my wife. Don't come here because they knew she was disabled.
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:03.600]  And that was the real creepy part, Alex, is that they knew certain things about my life.
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:13.600]  And I don't care again about me, but you threaten my wife. As you know, you've had the phone calls. You threaten my wife. I have a real problem with that.
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:16.600]  What else did they say to you while they were there?
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:24.600]  You know, they acted friendly, but they were, you know, I could see the guy was eyeing me up and down.
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:33.600]  I have tattoos, so he goes, oh, you were in the Coast Guard, huh? What was your job in the Coast Guard? And I looked at him and I was like, I was a firefighter.
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:44.600]  I wouldn't go into any other details because I didn't even need to give him that information, you know, but since he was obviously digging, I figured I would just give him a brief date and that's all.
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:55.600]  And then they tried, I had a bandage on my arm because I recently had surgery to fix some nerve damage from when I was in the military because I'm a 100% disabled veteran.
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:03.600]  And they knew that, too. You know, they knew that I didn't work. They knew I was disabled. They knew my wife was disabled.
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:07.600]  So obviously, you know, obviously I struck a nerve.
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:18.600]  Well, you do work. You're up 24 hours a day sometimes, literally putting on hundreds of videos. You're on fire. We have an article from the activist post, Mother of Five gets FBI visit for exercising First Amendment.
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:25.600]  It's also up on infowars.com. You can just type that in and put infowars.com into the end of it and find it.
[02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:32.600]  And we're going to skip ahead in the video for prisonplanet.tv viewers here and actually show people the FBI at the Austin Mother's door.
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:37.600]  And they said, you went to a anti-war rally. Why are you doing that? Are you a terrorist?
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:49.600]  So in America, in Austin, Texas, you do not exercise your First Amendment or you get an FBI visit. I mean, what does it come to in this country?
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:48:03.600]  We're just a police state now. You know, the country I remember growing up in and the country I took in oath to defend, it's dead. It died a long time ago and it's got a huge sword in its heart.
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:15.600]  It says, New World Order, Rothschild. You know, it's horrible. And the people are so dumbed down through mind control and, you know, they use so many different forms of it now.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:23.600]  People are still, they don't care. You know, you had Bob come on on Friday to tell people, look, this is the future of the economy.
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:30.600]  Pay attention. And yet you still have morons that are more worried about Lady Gaga or MCB than their future.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  Oh, Barack Obama will take care of it. You know, the fact that there's still Obama zombies out there just blows my mind.
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:52.600]  Well, you're absolutely right. Bob Chapman, what's your take on what's happened to this individual who's one of the founding members, Sean Justice, known as Popeye?
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:49:14.600]  Well, I think it's far from the course. And the information that they've gleaned from your records is to be able to make them be a familiar figure to you, somebody that you can trust, which is them, and so they can get more information out of you.
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:30.600]  And that's why they do that. But they've had, you know, they've gone over your dossier, which I'm sure the government has. And that's why they're doing, asking those kinds of questions about your military service and so on.
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  They know the answers, but they have to bring it up to you so you'll trust them.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  Well, also, they have federal laws that are unconstitutional, but they still do it. They'll say lying to the FBI, they could charge you and put you in prison if you had been in the Coast Guard and then lied to them about it.
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:59.600]  So that's another thing that they do. It's just incredible. But hey, don't worry, FBI agents, the banks have stolen all the money, the government's poisoned in your children's water supply, and you think you're part of the winning team.
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:07.600]  So good job. Good job. I did tell them about that. I gave them a lecture about fluoride, actually, when they brought us the city council meeting.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:09.600]  Was it real funny to them? Was it real funny?
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:19.600]  He, you know, he was smirking throughout. Like, he didn't laugh, but he had that little smirk that, you know, that government agent smirk that they get.
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:30.600]  Like, hey, I'm a government agent. Radiation doesn't hurt me. DU doesn't hurt me. Fluoride in my kids' water doesn't hurt me. He's God. You're not. You're a little piece of trash.
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:32.600]  That's basically...
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:40.600]  You're just a disabled veteran piece of trash to him. Remember, the government hates veterans more than anybody in their own internal documents, correct, Bob?
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:51.600]  He took note of that, not to interrupt you, Alex, but he did take note of that, too, because I had two cigarettes in my window that said, uh, Afghanistan veteran and Iraq veteran, because I served during both conflicts.
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:54.600]  And he, that kind of piqued his interest.
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:51:00.600]  Well, yeah, because you're an evil terrorist. I mean, in their internal documents, they say veterans are the number one threat. They hate you.
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:12.600]  Do you have a low or malfunctioning thyroid gland? Did you know that fluoride from toothpaste or water can damage your thyroid? Did you know that your thyroid controls your intelligence, mood, metabolism, energy, and body heat levels?
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:22.600]  You can support a return to normal thyroid function by stopping your exposure to the toxic elements, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, and mercury, and by detoxifying the same.
[02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:31.600]  The body's number one detoxifier of these elements is glutathione. Unheated whey protein from grass-fed cows is the number one superfood for raising glutathione.
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:42.600]  One World Way is the first ever truly cold processed whey protein from grass-fed cows. One World Way is undenatured and has the highest bioactivity of any whey protein on the market.
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:58.600]  The health benefits are real and the taste is amazing. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldwhey.com.
[02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:22.600]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S. bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the U.S. antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators,
[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:29.600]  the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S. Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S. Treasuries.
[02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:38.600]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S. Dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:46.600]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:53:09.600]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:25.600]  That's the lifetime when used as design for home canning. Tadler lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact and contain no BPA.
[02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:31.600]  Tadler lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion,
[02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:36.600]  fit standard mason jars, are indefinitely reusable and are proudly made in the USA.

[02:53:52.600 --> 02:54:02.600]  That's reusablecanninglids.com for Tadler reusable canning lids, the original since 1976.
[02:54:02.600 --> 02:54:10.600]  See what the FBI, the TSA, all the rest of them can't get is, when a government goes corrupt, they now are agents of that corrupt system.
[02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:15.600]  So no matter what the corrupt system tells them to do, they keep following it because they're the good guys.
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:19.600]  Now, we couldn't find the original video. It was online, but it was taken down, unedited.
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:24.600]  I have one somebody else grabbed and put images into, but I'm going to play them 30 seconds or so.
[02:54:24.600 --> 02:54:32.600]  This FBI agent's there saying, well, we know you went to this anti-war rally, and we just want to ask if you know about any plans for violence.
[02:54:32.600 --> 02:54:39.600]  And this is a mother, a whole nine yards, a professional, I remember her bio, and she just says, well, I'm going to take the fifth on that.
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:42.600]  I wouldn't even have done that because I mean self-incrimination.
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:44.600]  I says, no, you're business, pal, First Amendment.
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:47.600]  I mean, what do you know about Amor all the lock? He's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:49.600]  What do you know about the FBI running all this stuff?
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  Just leave, you know, you're not dealing with somebody here that doesn't know your bosses are the terrorists.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.600]  I mean, let's just get down to brass tacks here. You know, the game's over. Let's play part of this clip.
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:03.600]  Here's the video audio, the FBI here in Austin.
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:04.600]  Nothing.
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:05.600]  You'll just leave.
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:08.600]  Okay, but I'm still curious. Go ahead and ask away.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.600]  Well, I've asked the question, do you know of any plans to destroy any property?
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:17.600]  Um, I'm going to plead silence on that. Next question.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:24.600]  Okay. That's it. I mean, we just want to make sure everybody stays safe.
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:27.600]  Stay safe. Okay, great. Great.
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:31.600]  Do you know of any concerns that you would have concerning us being here?
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:37.600]  Yes, I'm very concerned that I get a knock on my door from the FBI. Very concerned about it.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  And I think a lot of people will want to hear about this.
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:41.600]  Do you have any questions for us?
[02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:46.600]  Oh, well, who's your next person that you're going to stop to here in Austin or in Texas?
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:47.600]  I can't tell you that.
[02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:48.600]  You can't tell me that.
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.600]  If you want our card.
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:52.600]  That's enough. It goes on and on.
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:56:00.600]  The point here is, is that it's been confirmed that Obama has ordered the Board of Patrol not to arrest illegals, only to do a few for a small public quota.
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:06.600]  Total war, crime, mass murder going on, mass graves every few days being found. Nobody cares.
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:09.600]  You wonder how people don't have more anti-war protests.
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:15.600]  Folks, my guys had the police in Pittsburgh come because they tried to go talk to the military.
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:18.600]  And we put it all out in police state for rise of FEMA.
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:21.600]  Politely, hey, can we talk to your, you know, your press person?
[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:22.600]  We were given this number.
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:24.600]  We want to talk about the military being involved in this.
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  And they said, no, just get out of here.
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:34.600]  Then the police called my office, called the guys at the hotel, knew where they were and said, we are investigating you for a plan to blow us up.
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:36.600]  And that you guys were running around sneaking around.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:37.600]  It was all lies.
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:42.600]  I mean, it's like the message is you're bad because you speak out.
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:46.600]  We're closing talking to Sean Justice, who got this FBI visit.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:48.600]  More people need to start their own.
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  We are changed.
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Federal Jack, info warriors, attorney response team.
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:55.600]  More people need to get involved, start blogs, encounter George Soros and the feds.
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:56:56.600]  They are scared.
[02:56:56.600 --> 02:57:00.600]  You guys have confronted Sean, a lot of globalist with serious questions.
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:05.600]  Name some of the folks that you guys have gone and been real journalists and asked questions of.
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  We got three Zikaria when he was down here at FIU, giving the speech about globalism.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  We tagged him in with we are changed Tampa and we did the same thing at an Al Gore event.
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:30.600]  And the two of them, when just like the rest of these globalists, when you confront them, we like three Zikaria, for example, we did it in a week.
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:35.600]  We had one person stand up videotaping and a couple others hidden videotaping.
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:42.600]  And then while he confronted, got thrown out, the next person would stand up so that the topic would not be able to go away.
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:43.600]  Yeah, they know you're not violent.
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:44.600]  They've assessed you.
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:48.600]  They're scared of you confronting globalist kingpins.
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:49.600]  Bob Chapman, we're on the march.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:52.600]  The globalist empire is on the run.
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:54.600]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:56.600]  What a great program.
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:59.600]  Well, it's we got to stand together and hang separate.
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:01.600]  I know there are good people in the FBI.
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  Choose which side you're on now.
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:06.600]  Don't rationalize and play games anymore.
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  People confront now Gore over lies about climate change.
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:11.600]  You don't deserve an FBI visit for that.
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:14.600]  America is being taken over by the globalist.
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:17.600]  You know what Sean Justice, known as Popeye, federaljack.com.
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:19.600]  I want to commend you for what you're doing.
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:22.600]  Let's see more people get involved in federal Jack across the country.
[02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:27.600]  Just as Luke got intimidated and attacked, you know, four or five years ago and I supported him.
[02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:29.600]  Look where he's at our listeners.
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:32.600]  The answer is more people standing up and we'll be in contact with you.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:34.600]  Popeye and YouTube Bob Chapman.
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:35.600]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:36.600]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:37.600]  Thank you.
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  Lou Dobbs is coming up in one minute in fourwars.com.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:58.600]  It was powerful.
