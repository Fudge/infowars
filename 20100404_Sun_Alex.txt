[00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:09.029]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.150]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.991]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.512]  Alan's one of those few guests we can get on to talk about basically any subject.
[00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.693]  I have read hundreds and hundreds of books written by The Globalist.
[00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:26.634]  I have read thousands of their own documents, tens of thousands of news articles.
[00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.275]  They're white papers.
[00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.676]  And so that's why when I get Alan Watt on, I know he knows what he's talking about.
[00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:38.298]  Because he knows the exact same info I know, but from sometimes a different perspective, and his own way of delivering it.
[00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:40.539]  And so I've been asking some of the questions here.
[00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:54.245]  I want him to get into whatever he thinks is most important, and news that's happened lately, and things that are developing, and where he sees the world, what he thinks of these shootings, and at the Pentagon, and the kamikaze attack, and the calls for censoring the web.
[00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.446]  But you were getting into anti-social behavior.
[00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.411]  They now call taking a photo of your child in the U.S.
[00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.453]  or in England at a park anti-social pedophilia.
[00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:10.094]  They're arresting people who take photos of their daughters in bikinis in their own pool.
[00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:11.875]  That's now illegal, though there's not a law.
[00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:20.174]  They're now demonizing, I mean, it's political correctness into every level, where they're just coming after the citizenry.
[00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:22.675]  So, Alan, continue along those lines.
[00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:37.621]  Yeah, this is the Fabian technique that was also used in the Soviet system, where they believe that through scientific alteration of the mind itself, through different techniques, they can create the type of person they want.
[00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.522]  And it's a form of political correctness.
[00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.123]  Now, they're trying it out extensively,
[00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:56.713]  In China, China was the prototype model after the Soviet Union for this more advanced form of collectivism, where everyone thinks the same, says the same things, behaves the same way, even sometimes dresses the same way, depends on the era.
[00:01:57.313 --> 00:02:08.065]  But they had two men working at the United Nations who dreamed up the idea to test out on China using social approval and social disapproval.
[00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:15.614]  And what they did, they studied the cultural history of the Chinese and they found out that traditionally
[00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:20.067]  With certain objectives in mind, depopulation was one.
[00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:31.193]  And traditionally, China had often, very often as a matter of its culture, had killed off newborn children, especially females, if they didn't need so many, type of thing.
[00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:35.975]  And they thought, how can we bring this into the new system where we want to drastically reduce their population?
[00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:41.538]  They actually encouraged that, as you know, and they brought in the one child per family policy.
[00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:54.340]  Uh, initially, and the guys at the UN said this in one of their own statements recently, they said, initially, the militia had to come to drag women to the abortion clinics if they had a second pregnancy.
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.603]  Now they've trained the public, the neighbours themselves.
[00:02:58.334 --> 00:02:58.995]  We're good to go.
[00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:36.154]  What the environmental movement is all about is teaching us the pie doesn't grow, rising tides don't raise all ships, anyone doing well is your enemy, and so you need to get into the collectivist model, and once we have collectivist healthcare, then we've got to tax what you eat and do, because we're all paying for it, and this is the nasty trick that the collectivist paradigm uses.
[00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:38.616]  Yeah, it's called social approval and disapproval.
[00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:54.971]  In China, the two guys, there was such a success, these guys dreamed up, these two neuroscientists, they dreamed up this idea, they said it was such a success that they then turned, they were the guys who brought in the United Nations war on smoking.
[00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:02.822]  And they train the children at school to have Pavlovian responses if they saw anyone light up a cigarette 20 feet away.
[00:04:02.822 --> 00:04:03.964]  And I've witnessed that myself.
[00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:09.510]  They go into a sort of paroxysm, a spasm of coughing and waving their hands at 20 feet away.
[00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.711]  That's Pavlovian response.
[00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:13.013]  Oh yeah, Alan, I have trouble with smoking.
[00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:14.134]  I start it, I stop it.
[00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:15.716]  I've got a real problem with tobacco.
[00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:17.818]  And I was down at Port Aransas
[00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.999]  My wife and kids are inside eating.
[00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:34.503]  I don't smoke anywhere near them a few weeks ago and I fell off the wagon and was smoking cigarettes and I went out on the back deck and fired up a cigarette and a woman in the parking lot, no exaggeration, had to be 40 feet away.
[00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:42.425]  I just lit the cigarette and she starts waving her hands, coughing and freaking out and runs over and says, your cigarette is hurting me.
[00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.645]  I mean, this is a control freak.
[00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:46.426]  And I said, hey lady, you know,
[00:04:47.506 --> 00:04:49.447]  Don't worry, your police state's taking over.
[00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:50.108]  Don't worry.
[00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:52.329]  But I said enjoy the fluoride they put in your water.
[00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:53.991]  Enjoy the mercury in your shots.
[00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:55.652]  I bet you don't have a problem with that.
[00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:03.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.881]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:16.502]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:05:16.502 --> 00:05:27.324]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:37.473]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:42.918]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:50.404]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:53.147]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:05.769]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:23.078]  There's hundreds of different ways that the establishment conditions us to be tattletales, to hate our fellow man, the torture porn in the movies, all the violence, the conditioning, the dividing us into all these different groups along race, religion, sex,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.700]  But look at Europe.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.401]  They say, we're going to ban Nazi websites.
[00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:30.981]  Oh, sounds reasonable to some.
[00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.522]  You know, Nazis are bad.
[00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.562]  Then they've got the precedent set.
[00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:37.183]  And now, oh, you can't criticize the EU.
[00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:39.724]  You can't criticize GMO food.
[00:06:39.724 --> 00:06:42.544]  You can't criticize the town council.
[00:06:42.544 --> 00:06:45.265]  Now the White House says you can't criticize groups.
[00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:49.787]  And so once they set the precedent there, they expand it.
[00:06:49.787 --> 00:06:59.453]  They create the perception that guns are illegal with TV ads and billboards showing a picture of a revolver or a shotgun, legal almost everywhere but a few cities like D.C.
[00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.074]  and Chicago.
[00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:03.435]  And they say, report illegal guns.
[00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:05.276]  And then your neighbor's ignorant.
[00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:09.719]  I see every few days articles where some old guy comes out with his rifle to go to the shooting range.
[00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:12.381]  Neighbors call the cops, they pull him over, they go ahead and arrest him.
[00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:21.467]  So it's all this perception with this dumbed-down population and now they're going into the next phase.
[00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:36.758]  Alan's talked a lot about this and we're gonna get more into how they're conditioning us but then I want to get into contestants turn torturers in French TV experiment and how they're duplicating, give me a document cam shot please, the Stanford prison experiment
[00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:39.198]  And we're gonna go over that experiment.
[00:07:39.198 --> 00:07:54.642]  In 71, a team of researchers led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University, 24 undergraduates were selected out of 70 to play the roles of both guards and prisoners in a mock prison in the basement.
[00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:57.902]  And they told them that we're gonna randomly torture them.
[00:07:57.902 --> 00:07:59.123]  They were told it was real.
[00:07:59.123 --> 00:08:00.503]  They hired actors.
[00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:05.804]  And they found that the vast majority would murder people and believe they were murdering.
[00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:09.688]  Well, now there's all these new Hollywood movies coming out about torture.
[00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:10.529]  I saw another one.
[00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:12.191]  I think I sent you the trailer.
[00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.193]  I think it's called The Final.
[00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:15.655]  In fact, pull up that.
[00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:16.276]  It's on YouTube.
[00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:18.378]  It's the top video right now.
[00:08:18.378 --> 00:08:20.280]  Add The Final.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.783]  And, oh, the kids that aren't cool.
[00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:29.846]  They capture 50 of the other cool kids and they torture them and murder them, and it's a great good thing.
[00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:39.769]  So, this is the massive conditioning, so when our neighbor's being drug away, we don't care if we're being drug away later, and our neighbor won't care when we're drug away, because we're all being conditioned to it.
[00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:40.229]  Allen what?
[00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:54.931]  Yes, in fact there's a movie, a very good movie came out in Germany called The Experiment and that was based on that particular experiment because we're doing it in other countries too and it works the same way wherever they do it.
[00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:57.955]  People really who don't know themselves, and that's the old Maxim
[00:08:58.616 --> 00:09:00.317]  from thousands of years ago.
[00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:00.977]  Know thyself.
[00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:07.379]  If you don't know yourself, you immediately get submerged into role-playing and you adapt into the role.
[00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:14.241]  And sadomasochism takes over actually in prison guard society between the prisoners and the wardens.
[00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:24.848]  And once the actors themselves, people who take on these roles as prisoners, once you start talking back to the wardens, the wardens literally react with anger.
[00:09:45.562 --> 00:09:47.423]  Well, it's classic cult brainwashing.
[00:09:47.423 --> 00:09:53.549]  They shave your head, sleep deprivation, they torture you, and then you're no longer a maggot.
[00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:59.053]  Then you're now a human because you're part of our group, and that's your only identity.
[00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:04.218]  And now in the public schools, the terror attack drills where they tell the kids it's real.
[00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:10.383]  They tell them it's the gun owners that are doing this, it's the conservatives, it's the libertarians, it's the homeschoolers that are going to do this.
[00:10:10.723 --> 00:10:12.585]  That's why we had to torture you.
[00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:15.368]  That's why we've got to watch you with cameras in the bathroom.
[00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:16.729]  It's their fault.
[00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:25.017]  And it's like all these different syndromes, the Stockholm Syndrome, they start loving their abuser and take all the FEMA drills and police training and government.
[00:10:25.017 --> 00:10:27.079]  It's like in your role.
[00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:30.743]  And when they run terror attacks, they do it through a script.
[00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:32.264]  And so everything becomes role playing.
[00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:35.147]  If you don't have your own identity, you don't have your own moral compass that was
[00:10:35.507 --> 00:10:40.371]  Talk to you, you know, through your culture, don't trust the government, never snitch, stick together.
[00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:44.675]  Those were truly passed on ancient human attributes against tyranny.
[00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:51.500]  As they remove that, yuppies, you know, trendies, liberals, they're all in a role and they play a role.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.285]  And it's like a three-year-old playing princess or playing cowboys and Indians.
[00:10:57.285 --> 00:10:59.166]  And I remember when I was three years old,
[00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:07.571]  Having a giant paradigm shift in my backyard, when me and my friends were playing Batman and Robin, and I, and I, it clicked.
[00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:09.332]  I said, I'm playing a role.
[00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:16.275]  I'm not really Batman, and I have this paradigm understanding that everybody was playing roles, and then I never basically did it again.
[00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.796]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:11:17.796 --> 00:11:18.296]  Exactly.
[00:11:18.296 --> 00:11:21.638]  And people really do become the, the, the, the role.
[00:11:21.638 --> 00:11:23.619]  When they get a job, they become their job.
[00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:25.340]  They tend to lose themselves as well.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.661]  Mr. Postman actually becomes Mr. Postman.
[00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:28.994]  I don't
[00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:47.254]  We're good to go.
[00:12:04.608 --> 00:12:13.455]  Which were intended to desensitize the military from killing or turning on anyone they're told to turn on, including their own people if need be.
[00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:15.097]  And they've raised them with this.
[00:12:15.097 --> 00:12:16.117]  It's very addictive.
[00:12:16.117 --> 00:12:17.439]  They know what they're doing.
[00:12:17.439 --> 00:12:20.661]  And these guys now are the real Johnny with a gun.
[00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:24.925]  They're wearing the uniforms, and when they're told to turn on their own people, they will do so.
[00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:39.272]  Well, they found in World War I, soldiers would shoot people a thousand yards away, but over half of folks, unless they were fighting for their lives, wouldn't shoot somebody 20 feet away.
[00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:48.199]  By Vietnam, with pop-up paper targets to habitualize instinctual shooting, they got it to where about 90% would pull the trigger up close.
[00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:51.782]  You know, you must heighten your killer instinct or you will be dead marine.
[00:12:52.142 --> 00:12:52.863]  We're good to go.
[00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:31.685]  Former, he's actually a Hollywood producer who for five years worked at the highest levels of Microsoft and it's all basically a Pentagon program to precondition and it was like what 20 years ago they had the last Starfighter put in a science fiction thing where where they put out these video games
[00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:37.489]  To find out who can beat the game, then they land and say you're now going to be part of the Intergalactic Starfighters.
[00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:59.305]  But instead of really working for aliens off-world that put these video games in, the Pentagon now admits they are literally getting the best robot pilots to now be in these trailers in Arizona or Nevada or New Mexico with drones 10,000 miles away, and they've been habitualized on very games designed to pre-program them.
[00:14:00.347 --> 00:14:04.576]  Yeah, they also go through a very specialized testing for the ones who do that.
[00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:11.370]  And this was disclosed in a documentary in Britain, where the US nuclear subs are based at the Holy Lock.
[00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:34.228]  and uh the commander of the base was asked how they select the two men aboard every sub who put the keys in together they look at the little computers and so on everything's computerized so the little figures and so on aren't just continents and aren't just people uh they're just like cartoons to them but he said we select the psychopathic types because they will do what they're told
[00:14:34.828 --> 00:14:41.555]  And they will turn those keys and they will press those buttons when they're told to do so because they can't empathize with other people.
[00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:52.727]  So they actually have selective courses and tests to get the right people to sit behind, as you see in these trailers, while they kill hundreds of people thousands of miles away that they never even see.
[00:14:53.067 --> 00:14:55.269]  And they have drill after drill after drill.
[00:14:55.269 --> 00:15:01.933]  Now, people are asking, well, how do they know who is the best drone pilot?
[00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:05.556]  Well, now almost all the games are interactive.
[00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.417]  And so it's all on a database.
[00:15:07.417 --> 00:15:16.504]  And now the Microsoft Xbox, the PlayStation with Sony, all these companies admit it's got voice identification, infrared face scan.
[00:15:16.504 --> 00:15:19.846]  They're now going to add pain sensors to the games.
[00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:27.770]  Remember, what, 20 plus years ago, that James Bond movie, where they're global domination, and they're playing the game, and they're getting pain.
[00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.532]  Pain, uh, when they get hit.
[00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:33.534]  This is, again, it's all pre-programming, and they admit it!
[00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:35.715]  This is not our opinion!
[00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:36.555]  That's right.
[00:15:36.555 --> 00:15:43.920]  People don't realize that the biggest corporations out there are all funded by the government agencies.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.483]  Oppression, you prey on us when we sleep.
[00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:02.717]  Tyranny is here.
[00:16:02.717 --> 00:16:06.641]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:08.884]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:13.990]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:21.393]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:16:21.393 --> 00:16:27.395]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:31.176]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:16:31.176 --> 00:16:35.838]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:16:35.838 --> 00:16:38.639]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:41.800]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.341]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:47.322]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:48.442]  It's here.

[00:17:57.711 --> 00:18:00.712]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:06.034]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:18:06.034 --> 00:18:08.094]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:18:08.094 --> 00:18:13.096]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:18:13.096 --> 00:18:14.276]  How much do you want?
[00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:15.397]  When do you want it?
[00:18:15.397 --> 00:18:17.277]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:18:17.277 --> 00:18:18.357]  When will you need it?
[00:18:18.357 --> 00:18:20.558]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:21.899]  Will there be any food?
[00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:23.199]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:28.683]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:32.266]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:36.088]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:18:36.088 --> 00:18:37.329]  How much will you need?
[00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:38.230]  We don't know.
[00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.331]  How much do you want?
[00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:40.251]  All you can get.
[00:18:40.251 --> 00:18:40.652]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:18:41.432 --> 00:18:42.213]  We're good to go.
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:58.154]  What's your home worth?
[00:18:58.154 --> 00:19:00.275]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:19:00.275 --> 00:19:03.296]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:05.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:16.403 --> 00:20:23.446]  And now Bill Gates is giving free shots to the people in Africa but then he gave a speech and it's double speak to his people.
[00:20:23.446 --> 00:20:25.247]  That's why the audience laughed.
[00:20:25.247 --> 00:20:26.147]  The sickos laughed.
[00:20:26.147 --> 00:20:35.252]  We played the audio and video here just a month ago and he says we've got to get everybody's vaccine so we can cut the population by half and everyone laughed and clapped.
[00:20:35.252 --> 00:20:37.633]  It was a it was a sick psycho enjoyment.
[00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:40.654]  We're saying we're killing them out in the open and they don't even see it.
[00:20:40.854 --> 00:20:41.795]  And it's a-ha-ha!
[00:20:41.795 --> 00:20:42.395]  It's a-ha-ha!
[00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:43.336]  We're murdering!
[00:20:43.336 --> 00:20:44.497]  We have power!
[00:20:44.497 --> 00:20:46.179]  Trampling and being trampled!
[00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:47.560]  We're priests of power!
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.923]  We're pressing on the nerve, Watt!
[00:20:50.923 --> 00:20:51.684]  We count!
[00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:52.865]  We're mega-deathing!
[00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:53.646]  We're killing!
[00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:54.367]  We count!
[00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:56.576]  Yeah.
[00:20:56.576 --> 00:21:09.191]  And the thing is too, they are super confident now because the public have never been so dumbed down, the general public, as they are today with scientific means through media, all media, entertainment.
[00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:13.216]  There's not a thing you can watch in entertainment that isn't full of predictive programming.
[00:21:14.176 --> 00:21:15.457]  Absolutely, and
[00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:50.412]  Why do you think some individuals are predisposed to be resistant to this versus others that fall right into it?
[00:21:50.412 --> 00:22:00.424]  A lot of it's upbringing, genetics, but obviously the most aggressive anti-government, anti-tyranny group in the world were North Americans.
[00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:06.829]  Just because of the selection of who came here, the rebels, the criminals, the trailblazers.
[00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:08.970]  And so that's why we were the first to be fluoridated.
[00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.411]  We're the first to be targeted.
[00:22:10.411 --> 00:22:12.132]  And then we're the beta test.
[00:22:12.132 --> 00:22:14.653]  If they can do it to us, they can do it to anybody.
[00:22:14.653 --> 00:22:21.137]  And they really hate the Muslims, because they've got their own, in those countries, kind of old world oppressive system in some ways.
[00:22:21.137 --> 00:22:27.961]  But that's, they say, one of their biggest threats, because they won't allow in any of the Western control.
[00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:29.182]  And the Muslims too.
[00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:30.303]  You see, the whole world,
[00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:32.875]  It's almost standardized.
[00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:34.680]  The whole world is almost standardized.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.626]  The Muslims have held out.
[00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:38.030]  They have an intact culture.
[00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:41.832]  And they're autonomous to an extent, too.
[00:22:41.832 --> 00:22:44.334]  They've traditionally never joined the World Bankers.
[00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:49.519]  Traditionally, they've never used usury, so they can't get put into massive debt.
[00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:53.923]  That's been changing since the late 1800s, but still, there are holdouts there.
[00:22:53.923 --> 00:22:58.447]  They don't fit in with the globalized, standardized system.
[00:22:58.447 --> 00:23:02.491]  And that's what it's all about, the standardization of a world system across the entire globe.
[00:23:03.369 --> 00:23:09.594]  So anyone who won't go under will be bombed under and forced under or simply eradicated altogether.
[00:23:09.594 --> 00:23:13.898]  Continue.
[00:23:13.898 --> 00:23:19.622]  Well, it's the same thing too with the oil and all the rest of it.
[00:23:19.622 --> 00:23:23.926]  We know it's just land grabs, it's mineral grabs, it's oil grabs.
[00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:27.589]  Not for our countries because we don't have countries anymore, to be honest.
[00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:30.491]  We're run by internationalists and we have been for a long, long time.
[00:23:31.468 --> 00:23:37.671]  But they're making sure that they have all these resources for themselves for 100 years, 200 years in the future.
[00:23:37.671 --> 00:23:43.494]  And I've read the Department of Defense's own projections for the next 50 years.
[00:23:43.494 --> 00:23:55.280]  They know, and they published it before the dollar bombed out and the crash came, they said there would be financial crashes, they said there would be food shortages, there would be riots as they bring down the Western world.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.122]  Let's talk more about that, but let's go back.
[00:23:59.122 --> 00:24:00.582]  You made a big deal out of this in 2007.
[00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:16.746]  We realized it was a big deal.
[00:24:16.746 --> 00:24:19.907]  We wrote articles about it at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:19.907 --> 00:24:21.188]  You did it at CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:23.709]  The London Guardian reported on it.
[00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:34.473]  We got the whole hundred-page report, the British Ministry of Defense program, and they said we're going to financially collapse it into 2010.
[00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:39.856]  We're going to have flash mobs, riots, and they talk about how we are the enemy.
[00:24:39.856 --> 00:24:41.896]  They talk about using nuclear weapons or
[00:24:43.757 --> 00:24:54.444]  The neutron bombs, if the people were to ever try to take back London or Ottawa or DC, they will neutron bomb the population and they just admit it.
[00:24:54.444 --> 00:24:56.385]  We're standing by with neutron bombs.
[00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:57.025]  They're public.
[00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:58.266]  We will kill you.
[00:24:58.266 --> 00:24:59.667]  And they say there's nothing you can do.
[00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:00.847]  We're going to poison you.
[00:25:00.847 --> 00:25:02.388]  We're going to sterilize you.
[00:25:02.388 --> 00:25:05.190]  And if you ever try to take a Capitol, we're going to neutron bomb you.
[00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:23.414]  I mean, this is, and then, so the cops, the military that serve this, and the bureaucrats, you're drinking deadly poison, you're being poisoned with GMO, your sperm count's dropped 85%, you're becoming sterile, you're dying of cancer, and you will salute the government and take your five-year-old that died of cancer and bury him, and then just salute the government?
[00:25:23.414 --> 00:25:25.275]  Thank you for killing my child!
[00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:26.495]  Thank you, New World Order!
[00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:30.841]  I like my petty psycho power, so I'm gonna serve you straight to hell!
[00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:31.582]  Thank you!
[00:25:31.582 --> 00:25:32.222]  Yes, sir!
[00:25:32.222 --> 00:25:34.245]  I'm not strong enough to break my conditioning!
[00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:37.149]  I'm not strong enough to read where they say they'll neutron bomb us!
[00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:40.413]  I'm not strong enough to admit this is a psycho kill grid we're in!
[00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:41.535]  I'm gonna submit!
[00:25:41.535 --> 00:25:44.279]  I love being a tyrant, so you go ahead and smash me!
[00:25:46.045 --> 00:26:01.042]  And also that was followed, remember, from the Guardian and the Department of Defense for the UK and NATO, all NATO countries, followed immediately a month later by the United States military one, which was pretty well identical to the British one.
[00:26:01.042 --> 00:26:05.047]  So this is the world agenda, and it's the same thing will happen in the United States.
[00:26:05.968 --> 00:26:14.554]  This all falls in again with Agenda 21, the agenda for the 21st century, which is the century for change, planned change, of course.
[00:26:14.554 --> 00:26:21.238]  And they're already starting to smash down a lot of the suburbs around the urban areas.
[00:26:21.997 --> 00:26:25.200]  And Detroit and places like that, that's all part of the planning.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.022]  Everyone's to get forced into the already overcrowded cities.
[00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:29.543]  And they said that 20 years ago.
[00:26:29.543 --> 00:26:37.050]  They said, we'll get everybody dependent through the trilateral banking system, and then we're going to destroy half of the homes in the cities.
[00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:43.035]  And Detroit is announcing they're going to destroy a third, and they're announcing massive new energy taxes, all designed to bankrupt us.
[00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:48.939]  Uh, they say you're going to have a brain chip to have a job, that people will have to accept it just to have a job.
[00:26:48.939 --> 00:26:49.940]  It's like, oh, it's free market.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.502]  You don't have to be here, but you'll starve to death.
[00:26:52.502 --> 00:26:56.985]  Um, they talk about flash mobs, how they're going to control us, their new world order, their world government.
[00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:59.347]  And you can read the hundred plus page report.
[00:26:59.347 --> 00:27:00.208]  They have a link to it.
[00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:04.272]  In this article and if it's not linked to now, ask Watson.
[00:27:04.272 --> 00:27:07.757]  He can pull up the actual British Ministry of Defense report, US government report.
[00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:12.703]  I mean, folks, I at a primitive level get excited and try to warn you.
[00:27:12.703 --> 00:27:14.204]  I mean, I'm a fellow human.
[00:27:14.204 --> 00:27:15.025]  I want freedom.
[00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:15.786]  I want to be happy.
[00:27:15.786 --> 00:27:16.587]  I want a good future.
[00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:19.669]  I want to build and work together and go to space.
[00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:21.169]  These control freaks don't.
[00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:23.089]  So Alan can calmly talk about it.
[00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:23.949]  He's a great guy.
[00:27:23.949 --> 00:27:27.950]  Me, I mean, it's like we know these are mastermind criminals.
[00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.170]  We know what they're doing.
[00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.131]  We're not lying to you.
[00:27:31.131 --> 00:27:32.871]  And you need to check out what we're saying.
[00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:37.252]  And then no one in the government or the military, the police should serve these people.
[00:27:37.252 --> 00:27:40.693]  You're with us, the people, even if you think you're part of the system.
[00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:42.953]  Alan, isn't that the biggest trick?
[00:27:42.953 --> 00:27:46.054]  Is that people that serve the system feel like they're on the winning team?
[00:27:48.054 --> 00:27:48.795]  It's a fact.
[00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:52.680]  It's also a technique and a science in and of itself.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.322]  It's called obedience to authority.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.941]  The same technique they use in the military.
[00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:57.942]  You're part of the team.
[00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:00.903]  I'm too important to be discarded.
[00:28:00.903 --> 00:28:02.184]  That kind of stuff.
[00:28:02.184 --> 00:28:05.226]  And it's worked through the Soviet system.
[00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:06.467]  Well-tested, tried.
[00:28:06.467 --> 00:28:07.827]  Lots of books written on it.
[00:28:07.827 --> 00:28:08.928]  Obedience to authority.
[00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:16.372]  But what they don't realize is once... For instance, look at all the bureaucrats you have to take care of millions or billions of people.
[00:28:16.372 --> 00:28:19.394]  Once they've reduced the population, they won't need the bureaucrats.
[00:28:19.394 --> 00:28:20.715]  So they're next to go as well.
[00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:26.037]  You won't need all the cops out there, or the military, if you wipe out most of the planet.
[00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.058]  So what's the point of going?
[00:28:27.058 --> 00:28:29.839]  They won't keep you around as a pet, believe you me.
[00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:35.542]  These guys are all about economics, and what seems to be appropriate at the time.
[00:28:35.542 --> 00:28:46.787]  And if you, if they claim that you are eating up the resources that their future offspring, the least future offspring, will have for the next thousand years, they're going to get rid of you very quickly.
[00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:47.467]  But they don't need you.
[00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:59.836]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:28:59.836 --> 00:29:02.137]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:29:02.137 --> 00:29:05.358]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:29:05.358 --> 00:29:10.459]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:14.641]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:29:14.961 --> 00:29:17.322]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:19.863]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:29:19.863 --> 00:29:23.105]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:30.688]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:29:31.048 --> 00:29:36.389]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:39.290]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.971]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:44.051]  And I got news for you.
[00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.392]  You're everyone else.
[00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:46.872]  Invisible Empire.

[00:29:57.332 --> 00:29:58.633]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:29:58.633 --> 00:30:04.216]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:04.216 --> 00:30:09.238]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:09.238 --> 00:30:14.281]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:14.821 --> 00:30:20.046]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:20.046 --> 00:30:27.152]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:27.152 --> 00:30:28.272]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:28.272 --> 00:30:34.638]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:34.958 --> 00:30:38.141]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:40.363]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:41.304]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:41.304 --> 00:30:41.504]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:41.504 --> 00:30:44.947]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:44.947 --> 00:30:46.708]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:57.171 --> 00:31:02.494]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:05.236]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:10.579]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:15.061]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[00:31:15.061 --> 00:31:16.162]  We also have some specials.
[00:31:16.162 --> 00:31:19.564]  You can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:31.213]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:31:31.213 --> 00:31:33.074]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:31:33.074 --> 00:31:34.215]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:31:57.662 --> 00:32:00.663]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:00.663 --> 00:32:06.005]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:08.046]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:08.046 --> 00:32:13.049]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:13.049 --> 00:32:13.969]  How much do you want?
[00:32:14.229 --> 00:32:15.350]  When do you want it?
[00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.232]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:17.232 --> 00:32:18.312]  When will you need it?
[00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:20.514]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:20.514 --> 00:32:21.855]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:21.855 --> 00:32:23.377]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:28.641]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:32.244]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:32.244 --> 00:32:35.707]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:36.047 --> 00:32:37.268]  How much will you need?
[00:32:37.268 --> 00:32:38.169]  We don't know.
[00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:39.270]  How much do you want?
[00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.211]  All you can get.
[00:32:40.211 --> 00:32:41.312]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:41.312 --> 00:32:44.355]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:44.355 --> 00:32:46.137]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:46.137 --> 00:32:47.058]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:58.263 --> 00:32:59.784]  Coast to Coast.
[00:32:59.784 --> 00:33:01.866]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:01.866 --> 00:33:09.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:09.492 --> 00:33:16.118]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:16.118 --> 00:33:20.301]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:24.184]  Okay, I've got a really good memory, but it's not perfect.
[00:33:24.184 --> 00:33:24.845]  No one sees.
[00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:32.161]  Unless it's the Borg mind of the computer system, and that's full of mistakes.
[00:33:32.161 --> 00:33:44.709]  But it's like yesterday, I was up on air talking about Pentagon technology to get the heat resonance biometric print of your body, or even your shoulders and the top of your head, and I got an email saying, Alex, they can't brain scan you from orbit.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.361]  People got confused by that.
[00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:54.703]  I was reading a BBC article from, what, five years ago, about 25 meters away, they can brain scan you and they're putting these up.
[00:33:54.703 --> 00:33:56.903]  It was also CBS News.
[00:33:56.903 --> 00:34:08.007]  Then I went into identification, biometric systems of how you walk from the ground, satellites that can identify you once they have your heat resonance print of your shoulders and the top of your head.
[00:34:08.587 --> 00:34:09.428]  From orbit.
[00:34:09.428 --> 00:34:10.628]  Okay, that is admitted.
[00:34:10.628 --> 00:34:12.209]  So people get confused by that.
[00:34:12.209 --> 00:34:19.974]  Now, I was going from memory on this DCDC Global Strategic Trends Program, 2007-2036.
[00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:21.755]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:25.317]  Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[00:34:25.317 --> 00:34:36.144]  I need to get Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, somebody, one of my great writers, researchers, to go through this report three years later and show how much of what they talked about that would start happening by 2010 has now begun.
[00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:40.644]  Okay.
[00:34:40.644 --> 00:34:47.010]  But in here, I had them search in the PDF files, 100-something pages, the term neutron weapons.
[00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.034]  And they did find it, but it talks about how they may be used to end war.
[00:34:51.034 --> 00:34:56.099]  Kind of what Bertrand Russell was saying of, we'll use nuclear war to knock out all our enemies and then have an age of peace.
[00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:57.500]  So it must be the U.S.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.104]  version of this, or perhaps even a PNAC, because I know I've read it and did a story about it.
[00:35:01.604 --> 00:35:07.287]  Where they talk about we'll use neutron bombs against populations and they try to take over the government.
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:12.490]  So we need to ferret that out because again these things all mimic each other and are very similar.
[00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:20.115]  We're going to go to calls here but Alan Watt, you were getting into the narcissism, how they train people to not care.
[00:35:20.115 --> 00:35:21.556]  I've read Roman historians.
[00:35:22.913 --> 00:35:23.514]  I don't
[00:35:45.057 --> 00:35:49.299]  That dehumanized everyone and made them enjoy seeing their fellow humans killed.
[00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:51.020]  Next week it would probably be them.
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.922]  And that things got worse and worse as the empire declined.
[00:35:53.922 --> 00:36:03.287]  They did this consciously 2,000 plus years ago, right through their fall in 410 to the Visigoth chieftain Alaric.
[00:36:03.287 --> 00:36:06.769]  And so this is a much more, I mean, they had scientific control 2,000 years ago.
[00:36:06.769 --> 00:36:07.830]  The Greeks had it 2,500 years ago.
[00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.650]  Continue.
[00:36:12.819 --> 00:36:29.846]  Yes, and what you find too is that the big authors who worked for the Fabian Society, which is just an arm, a specialized arm to control left-wing for the socialized world of the brain, on behalf of the elite, in fact it was all started up by the elite themselves,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.341]  I don't think so.
[00:36:51.517 --> 00:36:51.777]  I don't
[00:37:08.135 --> 00:37:10.157]  They bring homosexuality to the fore.
[00:37:10.157 --> 00:37:11.237]  Lesbianism.
[00:37:11.237 --> 00:37:13.779]  Party, party, party for the wealthy elites.
[00:37:13.779 --> 00:37:15.660]  And then the rest emulate that too.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.402]  They have fewer and fewer children.
[00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:18.322]  They have infanticide.
[00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:20.084]  It becomes very common.
[00:37:20.084 --> 00:37:22.625]  And so they know the techniques of bringing down society.
[00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:24.587]  Everybody's partying, having fun.
[00:37:24.587 --> 00:37:28.129]  Entertainment, drama, plays staged as never before.
[00:37:28.129 --> 00:37:33.213]  And it seems that this can be re-implemented at any time, in any culture, in any empire.
[00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:34.494]  And it's not always
[00:37:34.514 --> 00:37:42.321]  If you bring in the same formula and sequence, you can recreate that and bring the people down to basically a slave level.
[00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:51.208]  And that was also said by Carl Quigley, Professor Carl Quigley, who was a historian for the Council on Foreign Relations, and he taught at the US State Department.
[00:37:51.208 --> 00:37:55.172]  He taught the diplomats, and he also taught the guys in the Pentagon.
[00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:58.194]  So they used knowledge for weapons.
[00:37:58.194 --> 00:37:58.935]  Knowledge is power.
[00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:00.866]  And it can be weaponized.
[00:38:00.866 --> 00:38:08.893]  If you understand the techniques and the formulas to reintroduce the same sequences, you can bring people down as you control them.
[00:38:08.893 --> 00:38:10.634]  At every stage of the way.
[00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:12.336]  And today we have nothing.
[00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:15.158]  Today we're living, it's like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:38:15.158 --> 00:38:17.580]  Regular television now is basically pornography.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:24.526]  They're bringing up live simulated sex shows on British morning TV.
[00:38:24.526 --> 00:38:25.787]  This kind of stuff.
[00:38:25.787 --> 00:38:26.467]  It's hard.
[00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:27.308]  This is the key too.
[00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:34.765]  Uh, to break all natural bonding rules that creates a strong cultural society.
[00:38:34.765 --> 00:38:37.987]  And it starts really with the man and the woman as a first target.
[00:38:37.987 --> 00:38:46.572]  You divide them, you conquer them, you then separate the children, the state we have the children with new values which are all politically correct.
[00:38:46.572 --> 00:38:49.294]  Every intake in kindergarten is taught
[00:38:50.208 --> 00:39:05.336]  To a scientific formula so that the intake in the previous year are given a little upgrade from the previous year before them for what they will expect to happen culturally in society in their lifetime so that when it happens, they think it's normal.
[00:39:05.336 --> 00:39:13.460]  And Beria, who was a KGB or NKVD head of the Soviet Union in 1934 at the International Communist Meeting,
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:14.920]  Talked about this.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:20.822]  He said it used to take 70 years to alter society in a cultural way to our advantage.
[00:39:20.822 --> 00:39:27.303]  Now he said in 1934 it takes five years through indoctrination of the intakes of children.
[00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:31.804]  Today is down to year by year by year through kindergarten.
[00:39:31.804 --> 00:39:37.786]  It's a scientific indoctrination so that they'll get brought up in a world where yet brain chipping will be normal.
[00:39:38.507 --> 00:39:41.729]  You're now a blank slate that they can program anything they want into.
[00:39:41.729 --> 00:39:42.510]  You're an empty hard drive.
[00:40:08.902 --> 00:40:11.125]  Now I want to go over this and then we're going to calls.
[00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:13.067]  I mentioned this last hour.
[00:40:13.067 --> 00:40:18.494]  Contestants turned torturers in French TV game show experiment.
[00:40:18.494 --> 00:40:24.422]  And here's the Stanford experiment from 71 where the professors themselves went crazy.
[00:40:25.563 --> 00:40:26.044]  We're good.
[00:40:45.723 --> 00:40:49.969]  Ladies and gentlemen, this was 39 years ago.
[00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:52.332]  Think of how far they've taken us now.
[00:40:52.332 --> 00:40:59.743]  I want to play a Fox News clip of this torture show where we're all being taught it's beautiful and wonder.
[00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:07.111]  Roses aren't beautiful, beautiful green fields, beautiful oceans, love, innocence, honor.
[00:41:07.111 --> 00:41:08.252]  It's not good.
[00:41:08.252 --> 00:41:10.695]  Death, destruction, blood, torture.
[00:41:10.695 --> 00:41:11.776]  This is what's beautiful.
[00:41:11.776 --> 00:41:12.917]  This is what's good.
[00:41:12.917 --> 00:41:14.118]  This is your power.
[00:41:14.118 --> 00:41:17.922]  Your power to hate and kill and to give support to killing.
[00:41:17.922 --> 00:41:21.866]  An evil culture by design so we're defenseless.
[00:41:21.866 --> 00:41:22.406]  Virtue,
[00:41:23.368 --> 00:41:42.550]  Sovereignty is the antidote, states' rights, cutting the size of government, not putting your children in government training camps, warning everyone you know, getting upset, getting through the comfort zone, breaking out of your bubbles, realizing how serious and real this is and that everything else you're being programmed with is fake.
[00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.650]  What's real is the government think tanks.
[00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:45.831]  What's real is the documents.
[00:41:45.831 --> 00:42:03.415]  What's real is what's really happening, not the false spectrum analysis projected on you that is literally a matrix-like system that we're now digitally, television all going now to 3D, which they admit is total mind control, makes you mentally ill, just total programming, drugging the water supply.
[00:42:03.415 --> 00:42:06.496]  We're deep into this technological dictatorship right now.
[00:42:06.496 --> 00:42:07.196]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:42:07.915 --> 00:42:08.535]  He shows.
[00:42:08.535 --> 00:42:10.877]  Well, it is that and then some.
[00:42:10.877 --> 00:42:13.878]  French producers actually mocked up a game show.
[00:42:13.878 --> 00:42:16.000]  Contestants were posed questions.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.204]  If they got them wrong, they're commanded to throw a switch and zap a fellow on, literally, on the hot seat.
[00:42:23.204 --> 00:42:30.348]  Now, it appears that he gets hit with electricity upwards of, oh, 420 volts worth.
[00:42:30.348 --> 00:42:33.830]  All the while, the audience of this game show shouting, punish him!
[00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.710]  Punish him!
[00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.751]  Take a look and listen.
[00:42:40.848 --> 00:42:41.169]  Let me go!
[00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:41.490]  Let me go!
[00:42:57.554 --> 00:42:58.855]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:42:58.855 --> 00:43:04.438]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:04.438 --> 00:43:09.460]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.503]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:43:15.043 --> 00:43:20.265]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:43:20.265 --> 00:43:27.368]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:43:27.368 --> 00:43:28.488]  And here's the best part.
[00:43:28.488 --> 00:43:34.851]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:38.374]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:43:38.374 --> 00:43:40.576]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:41.677]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:43:41.677 --> 00:43:45.179]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:43:45.179 --> 00:43:46.901]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:03.020]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:11.881]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:16.502]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:44:16.502 --> 00:44:27.324]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:44:27.964 --> 00:44:37.467]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:37.467 --> 00:44:42.889]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:45:01.147 --> 00:45:02.407]  Tyranny is here.
[00:45:02.407 --> 00:45:06.348]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:45:06.348 --> 00:45:08.729]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:45:08.729 --> 00:45:14.431]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:21.092]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:45:21.092 --> 00:45:27.094]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:45:27.094 --> 00:45:30.835]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:45:31.255 --> 00:45:35.536]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:45:35.536 --> 00:45:41.497]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:45:41.497 --> 00:45:45.038]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:45:45.038 --> 00:45:47.018]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:45:47.018 --> 00:45:48.138]  It's here.

[00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:17.847]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:46:17.847 --> 00:46:21.930]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[00:46:28.628 --> 00:46:38.155]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:46:52.145 --> 00:46:53.726]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:54.527]  Got it.
[00:46:54.527 --> 00:46:55.388]  Others don't.
[00:46:58.382 --> 00:46:59.923]  Coast to Coast.
[00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:01.984]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:01.984 --> 00:47:11.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:11.431 --> 00:47:16.674]  Last week, a Georgian state-controlled TV broadcast that the Russians had invaded again.
[00:47:16.674 --> 00:47:17.775]  They never invaded to begin with.
[00:47:19.093 --> 00:47:21.754]  They have simulated cyber attacks, simulated terror attacks.
[00:47:21.754 --> 00:47:25.455]  They announced on US TV it's fake only at the beginning.
[00:47:25.455 --> 00:47:28.476]  All of this war of the world psychological brainwashing.
[00:47:28.476 --> 00:47:33.998]  This is done so people associate torture as fun.
[00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:38.139]  That's why they brought out the Abu Ghraib torture, was to get you ready to accept it.
[00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:47.983]  Now police all over the world are taught pain compliance and a federal court and a state court have ruled police can now break arms and taser you to answer questions without a warrant.
[00:47:47.983 --> 00:47:48.403]  Alan, what?
[00:47:49.591 --> 00:48:02.481]  Yes, in fact, as it's come out in different court hearings, I don't think he even goes to court when they taser people and kill them, that the police were now using tasers for compliance.
[00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:04.462]  Compliance, that's what it's all about now.
[00:48:04.462 --> 00:48:06.344]  Compliance, you comply, you do what you're told.
[00:48:06.344 --> 00:48:08.325]  There's no such thing as rights anymore.
[00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:10.607]  You're taught to simply obey or else.
[00:48:10.607 --> 00:48:18.473]  Alan, I see a blurring of reality and fiction with all these fake drills or Russia attacked
[00:48:19.093 --> 00:48:22.475]  Georgia, it was a lie two years ago.
[00:48:22.475 --> 00:48:25.316]  It's a lie now when they ran the newscast nationwide.
[00:48:25.316 --> 00:48:27.517]  The people are very angry in Georgia.
[00:48:27.517 --> 00:48:31.339]  They have all these TV shows where they don't tell you it's real or not.
[00:48:31.339 --> 00:48:37.262]  They announce they've captured an Al-Qaeda leader sometimes 14, 15 times, never retract the last time.
[00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:41.384]  They're scientifically setting the precedent where they just lie and deceive all the time.
[00:48:43.104 --> 00:48:48.468]  Yeah, it's a technique too, because you see, this is the, um, it's a war of terror.
[00:48:48.468 --> 00:48:50.410]  Not on terror, it's a war of terror.
[00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:58.296]  You always use terroristic techniques on the vast population when you're drastically changing quickly into a new system.
[00:48:58.296 --> 00:49:01.379]  And you want that, again, for obedience and compliance.
[00:49:01.379 --> 00:49:03.060]  And that's what we're seeing happening now.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:10.185]  But when you see, there's so many television series out now on terrorism, terrorism and government agencies dealing with it all.
[00:49:10.185 --> 00:49:11.867]  It's all so far-fetched and crazy.
[00:49:12.407 --> 00:49:14.688]  Scenarios, but people are wrapping that stuff up.
[00:49:14.688 --> 00:49:38.622]  They can't tell fact from fiction anymore They see the guys in the streets with the combat boots the cops and all the rest of it It's all quite normal to them and what happens is you get into a state of flux They call it flux at the top where you can't rationalize reality and separate it from fiction and use your own perceptions is to say am I really under attack right now or is it mainly in my head and
[00:49:39.122 --> 00:49:41.664]  But all the symbols are giving you is that they're under attack.
[00:49:41.664 --> 00:49:42.464]  You're under attack.
[00:49:42.464 --> 00:49:43.084]  Comply.
[00:49:43.084 --> 00:49:43.465]  Obey.
[00:49:43.465 --> 00:49:44.105]  Obey.
[00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:53.310]  And they can rush forward a whole agenda with rationing, fuel rationing, which will come to, as it is off the roads gradually, into the new system.
[00:49:53.310 --> 00:50:05.997]  And as they're doing it, yes, they will step up the decadence within society, because in the feudal systems, they knew that when they brought out someone who'd fought against them, a hero like Michael, like William Wallace, for instance,
[00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:23.042]  The peasantry would turn up, living in their own misery, and they would actually hate someone who tried and failed, and they'd watch them being drawn and quartered and sliced up in a ritualistic killing on behalf of the king, and they'd cheer because they hate the losers.
[00:50:23.042 --> 00:50:24.222]  The public hate the losers.
[00:50:24.222 --> 00:50:30.924]  They know within themselves they're losers themselves, and they transfer it onto the victim who stood up and had the guts to stand up.
[00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:32.971]  But actually lost.
[00:50:32.971 --> 00:50:34.672]  This is the same technique they're showing you now.
[00:50:34.672 --> 00:50:38.234]  They're telling you you're nobody, you're weak.
[00:50:38.234 --> 00:50:40.775]  Obey and maybe survive.
[00:50:40.775 --> 00:50:44.457]  If you don't obey, you definitely will not survive because we'll get you.
[00:50:44.457 --> 00:50:45.298]  That's the message now.
[00:50:46.178 --> 00:50:54.905]  And they've borrowed all the terms that they used to use in the Soviet Union, like political correctness is a direct translation from them.
[00:50:54.905 --> 00:50:59.009]  So is anti-government.
[00:50:59.009 --> 00:51:05.394]  Any statement, any criticism of any policy at all is called now your anti-government.
[00:51:05.394 --> 00:51:09.137]  The opposition party is the most anti-government party around.
[00:51:10.748 --> 00:51:14.659]  Well, we love our country, we fear and don't like our government, and we have common sense.
[00:51:14.659 --> 00:51:15.682]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:51:15.682 --> 00:51:17.628]  Kucinich kisses the ring as Obama
[00:51:18.715 --> 00:51:21.797]  Deceptively sells totalitarian care in Ohio.
[00:51:21.797 --> 00:51:26.360]  Kucinich sells out on healthcare after riding Air Force One.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.584]  When I saw that photo yesterday, I knew Kucinich had sold out, with Obama smiling triumphantly.
[00:51:32.584 --> 00:51:36.447]  He's the type of psycho that hates America, hates good people.
[00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:38.608]  They enjoy destroying you.
[00:51:38.608 --> 00:51:40.650]  They enjoy making you poor.
[00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:48.195]  And now this medical tyranny that does have the ration care, does have the death panels, it's all coming in now, Alan.
[00:51:49.015 --> 00:52:07.908]  Yes, you also get compulsory sterilisation, that will be on the books, because look who's up there, Mr Holdren that wrote the book with Paul Ehrlich, Paul Ehrlich's wife is a high member of the Trilateral Commission on Cancer and Foreign Relations, and they wrote about that years ago, that they would bring in mandatory sterilisation for the unfit, and that's coming now.
[00:52:09.522 --> 00:52:13.324]  Yeah, they're saying now, look at this mother that had a genetic problem and she had a kid.
[00:52:13.324 --> 00:52:16.585]  We need pre-screening to license you to have kids.
[00:52:16.585 --> 00:52:21.148]  And then, oh, we have been taking your blood at birth for the Pentagon for 37 years.
[00:52:21.148 --> 00:52:23.229]  Globally, it started 37 years ago.
[00:52:23.229 --> 00:52:24.609]  We were in a world government 37 years ago.
[00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.230]  Yeah, we were.
[00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.132]  And again, generations haven't even known it.
[00:52:30.132 --> 00:52:40.655]  But the big, apart from the Federal Reserve getting created back in the early World War I, we'd know World War I if it wasn't for that being created.
[00:52:40.655 --> 00:52:51.720]  But the fact is, when FDR gave you the New Deal, that was the announcement of this is the new way, this is a new system, this supersedes the Constitution, the Constitution's out the window, and the bankers and so on.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.260]  We were running the show.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.141]  That was a legal declaration.
[00:52:56.602 --> 00:53:04.287]  Absolutely, and he declared the War Powers Act in 33 and put the country into a permanent emergency, and that's what we're still under today.
[00:53:04.287 --> 00:53:06.668]  We can cut big government.
[00:53:06.668 --> 00:53:09.970]  We can support the family.
[00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:16.234]  We can trust in our Creator to lead God and direct us, not the big organized religion.
[00:53:16.234 --> 00:53:22.998]  There is a big awakening happening, and the globalists are trying to manipulate that and control that, but their global warming taxes are in trouble.
[00:53:24.273 --> 00:53:29.336]  Uh, record numbers didn't take the swine flu shot or the seasonal flu, so we had record low flu.
[00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:33.438]  That was in Wall Street Journal, because it's the shot that gives you the flu, all the evidence shows.
[00:53:33.438 --> 00:53:34.859]  The people are trying to get healthier.
[00:53:34.859 --> 00:53:43.224]  That's why they're trying to wreck all the agriculture and industry where you are totally dependent on them, so even if you're awake, there's nothing you can do.
[00:53:43.224 --> 00:53:52.068]  And we're very close to entering a time when it's going to be even harder to beat these people, but I see a lot of positive things happening.
[00:53:52.068 --> 00:53:52.589]  Alan Watt,
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:54:01.388]  Well I think people will be standing up more on an individualistic basis.
[00:54:01.388 --> 00:54:03.771]  As you know, groups are penetrated so darn quickly.
[00:54:04.577 --> 00:54:11.718]  And taken over very very quickly because they've got unlimited financing at the top and unlimited agents basically to go and do that.
[00:54:11.718 --> 00:54:21.200]  I've got reports here of them doing it in Canada recently as well and living undercover with far-left groups and in Britain too.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.481]  They're out of control in Austin.
[00:54:23.481 --> 00:54:28.742]  They're just out of control operations here in Austin but it's having no effect and people are seeing through them.
[00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.120]  Yes, and that's the key to it.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.283]  If you retain your individuality and you're mixed with different people, you think you're a group.
[00:54:36.283 --> 00:54:41.466]  Whenever you see it veer off from its initial intent, then you know you've been taken over.
[00:54:41.466 --> 00:54:43.768]  And then you leave it.
[00:54:43.768 --> 00:54:46.769]  You don't submerge yourself and lose yourself within the group.
[00:54:46.769 --> 00:54:50.832]  You must always think as an individual and keep your mind on track.
[00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:53.113]  That's the key to everything.
[00:54:53.113 --> 00:55:05.339]  And the boys at the top, now here's the thing too, they've taught us to think that everything is fair and that we live in some kind of democracy where everyone gets to say and those who make the most sense will always win.
[00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:10.462]  The big boys at the top do not and never have played by any fair rules.
[00:55:10.462 --> 00:55:14.764]  If you want power and you want to maintain power, you don't play by the rules.
[00:55:14.764 --> 00:55:17.265]  That's why they don't care if they're caught out with all their lies.
[00:55:17.265 --> 00:55:20.127]  They continue regardless as though they've never heard you.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.322]  And they'll stoop to nothing to get their way.
[00:55:23.322 --> 00:55:27.905]  If it's blowing up buildings or a whole city, they will do it, if need be.
[00:55:27.905 --> 00:55:28.366]  If need be.
[00:55:28.366 --> 00:55:30.047]  And we've got to understand that.
[00:55:30.047 --> 00:55:33.089]  Never to panic when we see these things come down the pike.
[00:55:33.089 --> 00:55:35.691]  And that's why they're so... I agree with you.
[00:55:35.691 --> 00:55:47.660]  That's why they're so angry at 9-11 Truth and demonizing it everywhere, because we've taken their toy of false flag terror, and now people are automatically thinking, is it the government, Kibono, who stands to gain?
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.021]  And it's really angering them.
[00:55:50.963 --> 00:56:17.490]  It's angering them, and they put so much money out, and groups again, anti-groups you might say, and propaganda from the Pentagon through various agencies that appear as independent news clips, and I've read articles from the Pentagon where they actually do this, to brainwash the public and try and poo-poo it, and these silly radicals with their crazy paranoid ideas and repetition of language like that, that's what they hope to win over the general public with.
[00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.934]  The general public, unfortunately, as I say, you cannot live in reality.
[00:56:24.503 --> 00:56:32.808]  If you're consuming daily television, fiction is not fiction to entertain you, it's there to indoctrinate you.
[00:56:32.808 --> 00:56:48.516]  And I've lost count, I've tried to keep track of all the shows that come out since... All the messages, the anti-family, anti-gun, anti-homeschool, anti-free market, anti-pro-world government, all the messages and cartoons about the Illuminati making it a joke.
[00:56:48.516 --> 00:56:50.217]  I'm going to make this point and then go to calls.
[00:56:51.334 --> 00:56:55.723]  You mentioned how they create mass insanity where people accept
[00:56:56.917 --> 00:57:00.179]  Mass murder, war, torture, human sacrifice.
[00:57:00.179 --> 00:57:09.924]  Look at the Romans, look at the Aztecs, look at the Druids, where, oh, the sun won't come back during an eclipse if you don't give us your children to sacrifice.
[00:57:09.924 --> 00:57:11.205]  Every culture does this.
[00:57:11.205 --> 00:57:22.551]  They make you give over your children to be burned in fires or flayed or have their hearts cut out, because if they can make you do that willfully, they have full mind control over you.
[00:57:22.551 --> 00:57:26.293]  So human culture always ends up getting dominated by the psychopaths.
[00:57:26.733 --> 00:57:29.855]  And they turn the world into the type of world they like.
[00:57:29.855 --> 00:57:31.937]  Death, destruction, torture and killing.
[00:57:31.937 --> 00:57:34.318]  It's 1% of the population.
[00:57:34.318 --> 00:57:43.705]  We've got to identify them, educate the virtuous and good and the mighty to rise up and be the leaders they are to defeat this scum.
[00:57:48.203 --> 00:57:51.224]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:57:51.224 --> 00:57:56.547]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:57:56.547 --> 00:57:58.607]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:57:58.607 --> 00:58:03.590]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:04.790]  How much do you want?
[00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:05.911]  When do you want it?
[00:58:05.911 --> 00:58:07.791]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:07.791 --> 00:58:08.872]  When will you need it?
[00:58:08.872 --> 00:58:11.073]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:11.073 --> 00:58:12.413]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:12.413 --> 00:58:13.714]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:13.934 --> 00:58:19.179]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:19.179 --> 00:58:22.783]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:22.783 --> 00:58:26.607]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:26.607 --> 00:58:27.828]  How much will you need?
[00:58:27.828 --> 00:58:28.729]  We don't know.
[00:58:28.729 --> 00:58:29.830]  How much do you want?
[00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:30.771]  All you can get.
[00:58:30.771 --> 00:58:31.592]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:31.852 --> 00:58:34.897]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:58:34.897 --> 00:58:37.141]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:37.141 --> 00:58:38.122]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:47.506 --> 00:58:48.667]  What's your home worth?
[00:58:48.667 --> 00:58:50.790]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.834]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:58:53.834 --> 00:59:01.544]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[00:59:48.399 --> 00:59:49.940]  Coast to Coast.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.001]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:52.001 --> 00:59:55.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:58.041 --> 01:00:06.563]  I need all info warriors, anyone in the Northeast, anybody in the Midwest, to go to Pittsburgh now with video cameras.
[01:00:06.563 --> 01:00:09.624]  The troops are bought and paid for by offshore banks.
[01:00:09.624 --> 01:00:12.105]  Republic is falling right now.
[01:00:12.105 --> 01:00:14.546]  They are openly bringing in Marshall Well.
[01:00:14.546 --> 01:00:16.886]  They have troops deploying in every major city.
[01:00:16.886 --> 01:00:19.567]  We need everybody to go to Pittsburgh who loves this country.
[01:00:19.567 --> 01:00:23.248]  International media, government staffers and protesters.
[01:00:23.288 --> 01:00:35.758]  The G20 basically represent the largest nations which participate in the Western banking cartel, which I feel is behind a lot of the pain, anguish, and misery that exists in our world today.
[01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:40.643]  This is such a police state there, that they tried to talk to the military and talk to a spokesman last night?
[01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:46.008]  Defense Link put a press release out and they said, no, we're not going to talk to you, get out of here.
[01:00:46.008 --> 01:00:53.296]  Then they got their license number, had the police pose as Alamo rental car people from the county there, Allegheny County in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:53.296 --> 01:00:53.957]  They called them.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.441]  And said, oh, your car's got no brakes.
[01:00:57.441 --> 01:00:58.501]  Bring it in.
[01:00:58.501 --> 01:01:00.322]  And they said, well, we're in the coordinate G20.
[01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:01.763]  We're news reporters.
[01:01:01.763 --> 01:01:03.203]  We can't get out till tomorrow.
[01:01:03.203 --> 01:01:06.605]  And they said, well, that's fine, because I'm a police officer with the Army and FBI.
[01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:08.165]  And you've all been put on terror list.
[01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.686]  And your life's over, boy.
[01:01:09.686 --> 01:01:11.107]  And we know you're a terrorist.
[01:01:11.107 --> 01:01:13.688]  And you were sneaking around the military base and ran.
[01:01:13.688 --> 01:01:15.468]  All lies.
[01:01:15.468 --> 01:01:16.389]  OK, so I just went over.
[01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:18.490]  They're going to have a guy come out and talk to us.
[01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.451]  Or they said they'll get us a number to contact.
[01:01:21.451 --> 01:01:22.671]  He said the PAO.
[01:01:22.671 --> 01:01:23.612]  This is probably him right here.
[01:01:24.631 --> 01:01:27.015]  Briefly, tell folks about last night.
[01:01:27.015 --> 01:01:34.289]  You guys pulled up to the gate, you asked to talk to the public information officer, they called the police and lied and said that you were sneaking around.
[01:01:34.289 --> 01:01:35.871]  Yes sir, how's it going?
[01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:43.060]  We were responding to a news story that the National Guard was going to be masked to go into Pittsburgh.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.201]  Can we get a comment on that?
[01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.083]  We then pulled off to the side of the road where they instructed us to.
[01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:49.364]  We waited around 15 or 20 minutes.
[01:01:49.364 --> 01:01:51.425]  A representative came back immediately.
[01:01:51.425 --> 01:01:52.746]  He was hostile towards us.
[01:01:52.746 --> 01:01:54.267]  He did not like our credentials.
[01:01:54.267 --> 01:01:55.788]  We're out of Austin, Texas, Channel 10.
[01:01:56.556 --> 01:01:58.717]  Katie, can I see your credentials?
[01:01:58.717 --> 01:02:00.418]  We tried to get as much information as we could.
[01:02:00.418 --> 01:02:07.900]  He refused to answer our questions, so then Rob asked him for his information and where we could contact him tomorrow if we could get a word with him.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.781]  He then gave it, and we left.
[01:02:09.781 --> 01:02:11.662]  Speech freely as reporter?
[01:02:11.662 --> 01:02:11.942]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:12.102 --> 01:02:14.324]  You guys have credentials for the G20?
[01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:18.126]  I can't... The middle of the night, you come here tomorrow, we'll see what we can do if we can accommodate you.
[01:02:18.126 --> 01:02:19.707]  We're not gonna... I mean, we only got a few questions, man.
[01:02:19.707 --> 01:02:20.908]  Yeah, we just have, like, four questions.
[01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:21.869]  The answer's no.
[01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:22.529]  Not gonna comment.
[01:02:22.529 --> 01:02:25.251]  No, I'm not... That's a pick.
[01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:28.813]  If you get some credentials, you get some that I can work with, I'll do the interview.
[01:02:42.182 --> 01:02:46.424]  And then he told Douglas, you're on a list now, pal, for the rest of your life.
[01:02:46.424 --> 01:02:47.464]  Yeah, he did.
[01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:48.285]  With pleasure.
[01:02:48.285 --> 01:02:49.785]  You ran from them, is that true?
[01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:21.159]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:27.343]  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.
[01:03:27.343 --> 01:03:35.069]  Public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite.
[01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:36.510]  Tyranny is here.
[01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:40.893]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:47.153]  I don't think so.
[01:03:47.153 --> 01:03:51.476]  They're closing in!
[01:03:51.476 --> 01:03:59.962]  They said the market would drop by 4,000 points, blood would flow in the streets, and lions would be devouring children in the parks of Los Angeles.
[01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:04.145]  It's got the same story, it's just FBI training, but it was FBI.
[01:04:05.706 --> 01:04:08.809]  That the military will fire on its feet.
[01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:10.210]  Fire, fire, fire.
[01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:12.712]  And they're turning their guns on us!
[01:04:12.712 --> 01:04:17.256]  A nuclear attack has been solely and entirely caused decades ago.
[01:04:17.256 --> 01:04:20.358]  Decades, decades, decades, decades ago.
[01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:23.341]  And, and, and, and, and, complete control.
[01:04:44.729 --> 01:04:46.673]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:47.794]  It's here.

[01:04:57.728 --> 01:05:00.051]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:02.433]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:05.657]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:05:05.657 --> 01:05:10.763]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:05:10.763 --> 01:05:14.948]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:05:15.248 --> 01:05:17.731]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:05:17.731 --> 01:05:20.494]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:05:20.494 --> 01:05:23.398]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:05:23.398 --> 01:05:31.007]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:05:31.351 --> 01:05:36.633]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.053]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:05:39.053 --> 01:05:43.274]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:05:43.274 --> 01:05:44.335]  And I got news for you.
[01:05:44.335 --> 01:05:45.675]  You're everyone else.
[01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.176]  Invisible Empire.

[01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.779]  Big Brother.
[01:06:03.779 --> 01:06:05.541]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:05.541 --> 01:06:07.303]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:07.303 --> 01:06:08.885]  You want answers?
[01:06:08.885 --> 01:06:10.827]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:10.827 --> 01:06:14.631]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:14.631 --> 01:06:18.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:26.469]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're building our TV studio next door.
[01:06:26.469 --> 01:06:28.091]  We have 7,000 square feet here.
[01:06:28.091 --> 01:06:30.753]  We got 7,000 square feet next door.
[01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:38.501]  They are probably 70 yards away, but you may hear banging during this hour.
[01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:40.943]  We've never had that as a sound effect in the background.
[01:06:41.804 --> 01:06:49.226]  I don't know if you can hear it right now, but they're driving metal studs into the ground in the studio, and I'm trying to rush them.
[01:06:49.226 --> 01:06:55.048]  The city held us up for six months with permits, and so I've told them, just continue.
[01:06:55.048 --> 01:07:00.489]  If it gets too bad, we'll just, I guess, take off a few days or something, because nothing can stop us putting this studio in.
[01:07:00.489 --> 01:07:07.451]  So an added level of radio theater.
[01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:10.892]  Talk about trying to not be distracted while you're doing something.
[01:07:13.254 --> 01:07:16.197]  Can you guys hear that on air?
[01:07:16.197 --> 01:07:16.817]  You can't hear it?
[01:07:16.817 --> 01:07:17.538]  Well, that's fine then.
[01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:23.304]  It's louder than Fourth of July for me, but this must be a good microphone setup we have.
[01:07:23.304 --> 01:07:27.187]  Okay, well then I'll try to focus with the banging in the background.
[01:07:27.187 --> 01:07:28.929]  All right.
[01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:31.071]  Look, here's the problem with covering healthcare.
[01:07:31.071 --> 01:07:32.272]  It's like any other issue.
[01:07:32.272 --> 01:07:37.217]  It's so bad, I can't even find the proper words to cover how evil it is.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:48.148]  And now that we've had a week and a half to go over the full final version, it's amazing even me, and I expect a lot out of these tyrants.
[01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:51.651]  I mean, it takes a lot to surprise me.
[01:07:51.651 --> 01:08:02.721]  Tom Daschle, three years ago, wrote a book, we've read the passages, saying, we need to get more like Europeans who just understand after 60, you have a duty to die.
[01:08:02.721 --> 01:08:06.204]  And they have this comparative care, they have these bio,
[01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:08.227]  I don't know.
[01:08:29.341 --> 01:08:33.064]  And then you go on Medicare, Medicaid, and the taxpayer pays for it.
[01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:34.885]  But then you get a lower standard of care.
[01:08:34.885 --> 01:08:39.648]  That's how they cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, lower the standard of care, but raise taxes.
[01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:44.811]  It's nothing but a tax increase for government and a boondoggle payoff to the insurance companies.
[01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:46.753]  I'm going to get into that coming up next.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:52.941]  But we've got the YouTube video itself posted up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:55.642]  WorldNetDaily has an article about it as well that's excellent.
[01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:59.483]  New York Times columnist, death panels will save a lot of money.
[01:08:59.483 --> 01:09:00.303]  That's a quote.
[01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:04.504]  Paul Krugman tells Roundtable Economist, agree, it's going to be major.
[01:09:04.504 --> 01:09:11.326]  And their argument is, hey, these panels are going to cut what tests you get, what surgeries you get, just like in Europe or just like the VA.
[01:09:11.326 --> 01:09:14.506]  The one case we have of government-run healthcare, it's a nightmare.
[01:09:14.506 --> 01:09:16.207]  I was talking to a lady this morning from England.
[01:09:17.602 --> 01:09:21.030]  And she was telling me just how the health service is absolutely horrible.
[01:09:22.381 --> 01:09:29.168]  But you talk to Americans who've been told the lie, those that support socialist healthcare, they're like, oh, it's great, everything's free in England.
[01:09:29.168 --> 01:09:46.725]  Yeah, waiting a month on a gurney, that was in the news last week, and dying a month, a month, not being given any healthcare, 18 months for cancer surgeries that are almost 100% operable, if you get it within a few months, oh no, you wait over a year and a half, you die.
[01:09:48.103 --> 01:10:03.751]  So I wanted to go ahead and play the New York Times economic columnist Paul Krugman says the so-called death panels established by President Obama trillion-dollar nationalized health care plan will end up saving a lot of money for the government but he's operating under the false left-right paradigm saying
[01:10:04.651 --> 01:10:05.892]  Well, wait a minute, Republicans.
[01:10:05.892 --> 01:10:15.276]  You're saying this is going to cost too much money, but if these death panels cut the amount that's spent, which they will, then that cuts spending.
[01:10:15.276 --> 01:10:17.057]  No, that's not how this works.
[01:10:17.057 --> 01:10:27.423]  The insurance companies get the lower standard of care for everybody, they get to force 30 million plus people to get insurance, and the government gets to raise all these new taxes on people and save money.
[01:10:28.248 --> 01:10:35.990]  So, more money goes to the banks and insurance companies in interest on the debt, you get less care, you get less service.
[01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:46.172]  So he knows people are watching at home and he tries to manipulate them by saying, well, wait a minute, if this cuts, if this cuts cost, how is this driving up the deficit?
[01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:47.932]  But they admit it costs more money.
[01:10:47.932 --> 01:10:49.713]  They admit it raises all these taxes.
[01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:54.654]  They admit it brings in more money, but does lower cost because you're being robbed.
[01:10:55.762 --> 01:11:04.804]  I'm going to go over the insurance companies that were behind this in a moment, but right now, let's go ahead and play Paul Krugman on ABC News program This Week.
[01:11:04.804 --> 01:11:05.124]  Here it is.
[01:11:18.847 --> 01:11:29.435]  The advisory panel which has the ability to make more or less binding judgments on saying this particular expensive treatment actually doesn't do any good medically and so we're not going to pay for it.
[01:11:29.435 --> 01:11:31.176]  That is actually going to save quite a lot of money.
[01:11:31.176 --> 01:11:32.317]  We don't know how much yet.
[01:11:32.317 --> 01:11:40.243]  The CBO gives it very little credit but most of the healthcare economists I talk to think that's going to be a really major cost saving.
[01:11:42.315 --> 01:12:02.014]  There you go, a cost savings and they admit over 40 billion dollars a year cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and they're not just all the new federal taxes and taxes on health care savings accounts and everything else, but they make the states come up with money for Medicare and Medicaid.
[01:12:02.014 --> 01:12:05.597]  They make them contribute to it completely unconstitutional.
[01:12:05.597 --> 01:12:05.718]  Now,
[01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:09.321]  I told you how three months ago I was in an airport.
[01:12:09.321 --> 01:12:16.072]  I already knew this, I already read it other places, but there was the head of the healthcare insurance lobby saying, hey, we wrote this bill.
[01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:30.171]  And if you put a public option in it, which I'm not for, by the way, because it'll always get stolen, it's wrong to take people's money for somebody else, it's wrong for the government to make you buy something, but it's even worse than stealing money to help people, because they're not even doing it for that.
[01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:31.132]  Of course they're not.
[01:12:31.132 --> 01:12:34.535]  Did the Soviets steal people's money and labor to help them?
[01:12:34.535 --> 01:12:36.677]  Did Hitler, the National Socialist, do it?
[01:12:36.677 --> 01:12:38.319]  Did Mao Zedong?
[01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:39.760]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:45.061]  That's the point, you're always going to get cheated.
[01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:50.868]  But there they were saying, if you do try to actually cover people with pre-existing conditions, we're pulling out.
[01:12:50.868 --> 01:12:55.272]  We're for this if it makes people come buy our goods.
[01:12:55.272 --> 01:12:57.595]  If it makes them buy our service and lets us lower quality.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:08.586]  And that's why in the last week and a half, all the major insurance, health insurance company stocks are up, and it's been leading the stock market up in the last week and a half, and that was all over AP, Bloomberg, you name it.
[01:13:08.586 --> 01:13:24.415]  There's your evidence for all you stupid liberals who really believe the nanny state cares about you, and the government loves you, and boy, you got the rich guys, you got the middle class, you know, you're gonna get your free giveaway now because you wanna be a lazy parasite.
[01:13:25.586 --> 01:13:31.168]  Or because you're so taxed, and so regulated, you can't make ends meet because of big government.
[01:13:31.168 --> 01:13:34.669]  Destroying our economy, and ruining the best healthcare in the world.
[01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:38.750]  Some people aren't lazy, they are being cheated.
[01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:41.591]  And the illegals are bankrupting, and it goes on and on.
[01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:48.273]  But a great article by Revolt of the Plebes, we've got it up on Infowars.com, The K Street Hustlin' of Obamacare.
[01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:55.466]  And it says, ooh snap, looks like we've been right along.
[01:13:55.466 --> 01:14:02.627]  All the K Street money pumped into the House and Senate has been overwhelmingly one-sided in favor of Obama's horrendous new healthcare legislation.
[01:14:02.627 --> 01:14:03.468]  Go figure.
[01:14:03.468 --> 01:14:14.150]  According to a new study released over the weekend by the Center for Public Policy, a non-partisan public interest think tank in D.C., it is estimated that a record $120 million was spent lobbying for the health reform.
[01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:22.875]  In addition to direct lobbying, some of the top firms also rewarded members of Congress with campaign contributions through political action committees and individual lobbying donations.
[01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:29.799]  The largest of these firms, Patton Boggs LLP, contributed more than $55,000 almost exclusively to Democrats.
[01:14:30.339 --> 01:14:38.128]  Patten Boggs represents Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the nation and the eighth largest corporation in the United States.
[01:14:38.128 --> 01:14:46.718]  On January 21st, 2010, Patten Boggs was one of several big-name health insurance, pharmacological, and hospital lobbying organizations who all
[01:14:48.069 --> 01:15:01.291]  Whose top executives got together to throw a fundraiser for Massachusetts Senatorial candidate Martha Coakley in hopes of landing her the Democratic seat at the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the health care takeover bill.
[01:15:02.082 --> 01:15:07.525]  The other top firms that participated, along with a list of companies they represent, are as follows.
[01:15:07.525 --> 01:15:14.009]  And it goes on for page, after page, after page, after page.
[01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:18.953]  And you can go, also in a link here, to the Center for Public Policy and look.
[01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:37.739]  Over 94% of all lobbying health care and insurance money, and the guy behind Obama more than anybody else, Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Company, Mogul, they are all there pushing this.
[01:15:37.739 --> 01:15:40.120]  Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, you name it.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.821]  The biggest fortunes are made by controlling government contracts.
[01:15:57.674 --> 01:15:58.975]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:15:58.975 --> 01:16:04.560]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.584]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:16:09.584 --> 01:16:14.629]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[01:17:05.511 --> 01:17:09.876]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:17:57.947 --> 01:18:00.949]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:18:00.949 --> 01:18:06.294]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:18:06.294 --> 01:18:08.335]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:18:08.335 --> 01:18:13.339]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:18:13.339 --> 01:18:14.260]  How much do you want?
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:15.640]  When do you want it?
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.521]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:18:17.521 --> 01:18:18.602]  When will you need it?
[01:18:18.602 --> 01:18:20.803]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:22.143]  Will there be any food?
[01:18:22.143 --> 01:18:23.664]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:18:23.664 --> 01:18:28.926]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:18:28.926 --> 01:18:32.527]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:18:32.527 --> 01:18:36.329]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:18:36.329 --> 01:18:37.569]  How much will you need?
[01:18:37.569 --> 01:18:38.470]  We don't know.
[01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:39.550]  How much do you want?
[01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:40.511]  All you can get.
[01:18:40.511 --> 01:18:41.311]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:44.634]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:18:44.634 --> 01:18:46.876]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.

[01:18:57.079 --> 01:18:58.380]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:03.965]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:19:03.965 --> 01:19:08.990]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:14.035]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:19.782]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:19:41.245 --> 01:19:44.689]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:46.430]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:02.103]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:02.103 --> 01:20:09.084]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:15.725]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:20:15.725 --> 01:20:20.446]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:20.446 --> 01:20:26.507]  That's right, deep behind the propaganda lines, attempting to wake the people up, attempting
[01:20:27.463 --> 01:20:38.588]  To get the population to listen to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine and others' words, love your country, fear your government, or you will get tyranny.
[01:20:38.588 --> 01:20:42.150]  Now for the rest of the hour, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst is our guest.
[01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:44.371]  I interviewed him several times.
[01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:48.873]  More than a decade ago, he is one of the most famous whistleblowers in U.S.
[01:20:48.873 --> 01:20:52.935]  history, perhaps the most famous in the more modern times.
[01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:53.955]  I don't
[01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:10.645]  We're good to go.
[01:21:31.201 --> 01:21:32.442]  It's all over the newspaper.
[01:21:32.442 --> 01:21:34.864]  San Francisco, a few weeks ago, I saw in the news.
[01:21:34.864 --> 01:21:41.910]  Tulia, Texas, literally filling the jail with half the town's black people framing them.
[01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:45.873]  Here's a New York Times article, DNA evidence can be fabricated, scientists show.
[01:21:45.873 --> 01:21:47.374]  That was from a week ago.
[01:21:47.374 --> 01:21:50.256]  Folks, we knew this.
[01:21:50.256 --> 01:21:50.877]  We knew this.
[01:21:52.054 --> 01:21:57.816]  Well, you were talking about are things getting worse or getting better, and I think they're getting a lot better.
[01:22:18.155 --> 01:22:21.438]  I think, because we have instantaneous knowledge now.
[01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:24.961]  We're connected through the internet and there's nothing anybody can do about it.
[01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:25.801]  And we can.
[01:22:25.801 --> 01:22:31.366]  We can research on our own, from our living rooms, our bedrooms, our offices, even our cars.
[01:22:31.366 --> 01:22:38.532]  We can be at the beach and find out that, for instance, an article just came out while I was waiting for this show here.
[01:22:38.532 --> 01:22:43.796]  The Nebraska CSI chief has been found guilty of planting evidence.
[01:22:44.608 --> 01:22:48.912]  We know about those things now, and that's really healthy.
[01:22:48.912 --> 01:22:56.659]  When a government controls the knowledge base, then that becomes dangerous, because their inferences may not be proper inferences.
[01:22:56.659 --> 01:23:00.202]  We, as a people, govern this nation.
[01:23:00.202 --> 01:23:01.844]  That's what our goal is.
[01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:04.426]  It may, at times, we vary from it.
[01:23:04.426 --> 01:23:10.912]  But, sir, I think that with instantaneous knowledge, then we all can take part in
[01:23:11.926 --> 01:23:15.689]  Juries, we can all take part in who we elect.
[01:23:15.689 --> 01:23:17.631]  We can say, I'm not sure about this.
[01:23:17.631 --> 01:23:24.156]  We, about two weeks ago, three weeks ago, had a guy in North Carolina before the North Carolina Innocence Commission.
[01:23:24.156 --> 01:23:25.757]  His name's Dwayne Deaver.
[01:23:25.757 --> 01:23:35.145]  Told him, 18 years ago, during trial of this man, it was before the commission, there were two tests that decided whether it was blood in the evidence.
[01:23:35.145 --> 01:23:39.869]  And, um, one of them said yes, and the other one said no, and he only reported the yes.
[01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:51.987]  And it has shaken up this state to think that a man in our crime laboratory, a lowly state employee, can put a guy in jail forever.
[01:23:51.987 --> 01:23:58.109]  Just unilaterally decide, well, I'm not going to report the stuff that would hurt the prosecutor's case.
[01:23:58.109 --> 01:23:59.809]  We found that out instantaneously.
[01:23:59.809 --> 01:24:02.490]  This wasn't in some court 500 miles from here, whatever.
[01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:04.931]  It's all over the news, all over the place.
[01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:07.892]  And so I think it's really, things are getting better.
[01:24:07.892 --> 01:24:09.032]  A lot better because
[01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:14.327]  Um, you know, I could talk to you and you're going out to a lot of audience.
[01:24:14.327 --> 01:24:15.267]  I'm in North Carolina.
[01:24:15.267 --> 01:24:17.948]  I think you're in Texas, aren't you, sir?
[01:24:17.948 --> 01:24:19.088]  Absolutely.
[01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:24.650]  So, um, people's questions can be answered just by going to Google.
[01:24:24.650 --> 01:24:25.910]  And, uh, are we getting better?
[01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:29.591]  We're getting better at the lightning speed, in my opinion.
[01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:37.934]  Some of it's frightening because the paradigms that have been in place for so long, you know, let's trust J Edgar Hoover's agents.
[01:24:38.737 --> 01:24:40.978]  They're beyond investigation.
[01:24:40.978 --> 01:24:45.119]  They used to tell me when I was in the FBI, we're the investigators, nobody will investigate us.
[01:24:45.119 --> 01:24:55.161]  Well, by golly, all of us, anybody, grade school kid, can investigate any of these things and look at, don't just accept.
[01:24:55.161 --> 01:24:57.902]  So, are we moving ahead?
[01:24:57.902 --> 01:25:01.623]  We're moving really fast ahead.
[01:25:01.623 --> 01:25:03.404]  Are we scared by what we're seeing right now?
[01:25:03.404 --> 01:25:08.165]  I doubt, but in the long run, it's going to be healthy.
[01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:11.247]  Well here's an example.
[01:25:11.247 --> 01:25:20.722]  I have the indictment and the affidavits for the head of the Mumbai terror attacks and it's a US government agent.
[01:25:20.722 --> 01:25:22.585]  I have NBC here with the FBI
[01:25:24.033 --> 01:25:31.861]  Literally commanding and setting up and running the latest Muslim terror group that was going to bomb a synagogue.
[01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:43.192]  We have these groups infiltrating militias and the leaders are the ones who are government informants or agents provocateur-ing this and it's just case after case after case and then
[01:25:44.588 --> 01:25:52.635]  I myself have had people who it turned out were feds try to set me up for things.
[01:25:52.635 --> 01:26:00.521]  I'm trying to understand from your perspective as the former head of the FBI Crime Lab Forensics Division, how did you awaken?
[01:26:00.521 --> 01:26:02.603]  How did you start seeing the corruption?
[01:26:02.603 --> 01:26:04.284]  Why did you speak up?
[01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:07.207]  What percentage as a dead reckoning guesstimation
[01:26:08.027 --> 01:26:14.938]  Of police departments or FBI agents or their workers, what percentage
[01:26:16.994 --> 01:26:27.341]  For whatever reason, just love framing people because we now know because of DNA evidence and other issues in some states, a third of the people or more are completely innocent.
[01:26:27.341 --> 01:26:30.603]  And we know that the biggest industry now in this nation is prisons.
[01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:35.046]  And there's this incentive to just build, build, build and put more people in prison.
[01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:42.931]  And as you said, the paradigm is shifting as the population begins to discover that something is rotten in the state of our Republic.
[01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:49.855]  I don't support law enforcement officers that go outside that cross the thin blue line and tarnish their badge.
[01:26:49.855 --> 01:26:50.896]  I just don't.
[01:26:50.896 --> 01:26:55.218]  I understand from being inside what the pressures are.
[01:26:55.218 --> 01:27:02.623]  When we have an Oklahoma City go up and we see bodies of little children being dragged out, we call for revenge.
[01:27:02.623 --> 01:27:12.249]  A call for revenge directs our politicians, and that's what they are, they're politicians too, to move forward with an agenda that we will at all costs, da da da da da.
[01:27:13.516 --> 01:27:20.361]  That vengeance drags at the foundation of our justice system.
[01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:22.963]  We want to know what happened.
[01:27:22.963 --> 01:27:25.785]  We want to know who really did it.
[01:27:25.785 --> 01:27:36.853]  Unfortunately, in any enterprise such as law enforcement, where somebody who gives the right answer to the right question at the right time gets the right job and there's no oversight,
[01:27:37.771 --> 01:27:44.677]  Um, as a friend of mine and I were saying recently, we all know what floats to the top in a septic tank.
[01:27:44.677 --> 01:27:53.665]  And that, frankly, is what, without proper oversight, can float to the top in a law enforcement agency or a government agency.
[01:27:53.665 --> 01:27:58.809]  People that are willing to do whatever it takes, without any moral compass, go to the top.
[01:27:58.809 --> 01:28:01.271]  They control who then floats to the top with them.
[01:28:02.329 --> 01:28:07.453]  The problem you have in law enforcement is the kind of, in my opinion, let's take the FBI.
[01:28:07.453 --> 01:28:12.477]  The FBI is cram-packed full of very, very good people.
[01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:20.844]  And those that remain as law enforcement officers instead of managers and rear-echelon folks, those people, they see what's going on.
[01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:23.875]  And they will respond.
[01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:30.860]  They respond either as, you know, going to the media under the table, which I think is inappropriate.
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.222]  They respond by going forward through the system.
[01:28:33.222 --> 01:28:45.812]  For your listeners that don't know right now, there is a move to gut the Whistleblower Protection Act with a bill, it's the Senate Bill 372 for the Senate right now.
[01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:03.546]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:12.407]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:29:12.407 --> 01:29:17.028]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:29:17.028 --> 01:29:27.850]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:37.995]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:29:37.995 --> 01:29:43.437]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:30:01.676 --> 01:30:02.937]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:02.937 --> 01:30:06.861]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:09.264]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:09.264 --> 01:30:14.970]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.134]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps.
[01:30:19.494 --> 01:30:27.617]  Now being expanded nationwide, this documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:27.617 --> 01:30:31.779]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:31.779 --> 01:30:36.081]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:36.081 --> 01:30:42.044]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:42.044 --> 01:30:44.945]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:47.546]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:47.546 --> 01:30:48.666]  It's here.

[01:31:57.864 --> 01:32:00.865]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:00.865 --> 01:32:06.186]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:06.186 --> 01:32:08.246]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:08.246 --> 01:32:13.248]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:13.248 --> 01:32:14.428]  How much do you want?
[01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:15.548]  When do you want it?
[01:32:15.548 --> 01:32:17.429]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:17.429 --> 01:32:18.509]  When will you need it?
[01:32:18.509 --> 01:32:20.709]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:22.050]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.350]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:28.836]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:28.836 --> 01:32:32.420]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:36.244]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:36.244 --> 01:32:37.485]  How much will you need?
[01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.386]  We don't know.
[01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:39.487]  How much do you want?
[01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:40.408]  All you can get.
[01:32:40.408 --> 01:32:41.089]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:42.150]  We're good to go.
[01:33:15.771 --> 01:33:34.224]  Kathleen Rowley and 15 or more other FBI agents tried to stop the exact hijackers and were ordered, you will not do that, and the guys that blocked them, their superiors, they got record cash bonuses and the good FBI agents got demoted or run out.
[01:33:34.224 --> 01:33:41.829]  And you know that, sir, because FBI agents who they tried to stop came out because they're that kind of people.
[01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:47.906]  You know, I knew doggone well I might catch a bullet when I was in the FBI for the stuff I was saying.
[01:33:47.906 --> 01:33:50.827]  I mean, it was terrifying for me and my family.
[01:33:50.827 --> 01:33:52.448]  And where would the bullet have come from?
[01:33:52.448 --> 01:33:53.069]  I don't know.
[01:33:53.069 --> 01:33:56.110]  But every one of those people said, I'll take a bullet.
[01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:57.731]  I'll lose my career.
[01:33:57.731 --> 01:33:59.452]  I'll lose my life's work.
[01:33:59.452 --> 01:34:01.013]  I may be put in a nut house.
[01:34:01.013 --> 01:34:02.053]  I may be arrested.
[01:34:02.053 --> 01:34:02.974]  I may be whatever.
[01:34:03.618 --> 01:34:05.879]  But that's not happening from field agents.
[01:34:05.879 --> 01:34:08.699]  That's not happening from FBI agents.
[01:34:08.699 --> 01:34:12.280]  It's happening from criminals who are loose in the FBI.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:30.645]  And that is not the major percentage of them, but I can... In my experience, sir, most of those are top managers at the FBI that have managed, through lack of a moral compass, to move to the top and spread that kind of criminal activity where they want to, but they get stopped.
[01:34:31.315 --> 01:34:39.777]  If Senate Bill 372 goes through, the FBI agents, I guarantee you they'll find another way to stop that criminal activity.
[01:34:39.777 --> 01:34:41.098]  They just will.
[01:34:41.098 --> 01:34:46.019]  If they're not allowed to be protected as whistleblowers, then they'll just fall on their swords.
[01:34:46.019 --> 01:34:47.099]  They're that kind of people.
[01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:53.901]  So when you say, you know, law enforcement's run amok, I think what's happening is because of the information
[01:34:54.892 --> 01:34:55.493]  I don't know.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.741]  But I wanted to go back to the beginning.
[01:35:11.741 --> 01:35:15.043]  What happened at the FBI Crime Lab?
[01:35:15.043 --> 01:35:16.764]  Why were you forced to take that risk?
[01:35:16.764 --> 01:35:19.845]  As you said, there could have been a bullet with your name on it.
[01:35:19.845 --> 01:35:24.168]  Why did you go through all that hell to get the Whistleblower Protection Act through?
[01:35:24.168 --> 01:35:29.431]  And now they're coming back with SB 372 to try to reverse that.
[01:35:29.431 --> 01:35:32.973]  Well, the day I walked through the door of the laboratory, which was
[01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:36.050]  Well, I think it was June the 16th, 1986.
[01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:38.591]  It was obvious to me it wasn't a forensic crime lab.
[01:35:38.591 --> 01:35:40.352]  It wasn't an analytical laboratory.
[01:35:40.352 --> 01:35:43.152]  It was a filthy pigsty.
[01:35:43.152 --> 01:35:45.873]  And, uh, there were no protocols.
[01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:48.934]  I saw some things in the lab that bothered me.
[01:35:48.934 --> 01:35:54.535]  We do in any organization, I'm sure people working with you or me would question some of our judgment.
[01:35:54.535 --> 01:35:56.876]  But I didn't, I didn't say, you know, scream my head off.
[01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:58.736]  I said, there's a system here to work this out.
[01:35:59.432 --> 01:36:07.827]  I took these issues over a period of six, seven years, up through the chain of command, step by step by step, and at every chain, at every point.
[01:36:08.789 --> 01:36:13.071]  Uh, somebody said to me, well, I know there's issues, however, it's not your cross to bear.
[01:36:13.071 --> 01:36:13.632]  Da-da!
[01:36:13.632 --> 01:36:16.433]  Okay, well, it is my cross to bear.
[01:36:16.433 --> 01:36:18.294]  First of all, I'm an American citizen.
[01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:21.916]  You know, the way I say it is, I am an American.
[01:36:21.916 --> 01:36:22.616]  Okay?
[01:36:22.616 --> 01:36:26.378]  That's important to me, therefore, it is my cross to bear.
[01:36:26.378 --> 01:36:30.020]  But, um, let's see what the management will do about it.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:31.641]  They never would do anything about it.
[01:36:31.641 --> 01:36:37.644]  We were required by Executive Order 12674 to report fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption to the appropriate authority.
[01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:40.492]  The big word there is appropriate.
[01:36:40.492 --> 01:36:44.836]  If I tell you there's a problem here and you blow me off, you're no longer appropriate.
[01:36:44.836 --> 01:36:47.658]  I did that all the way up to and including the President's office.
[01:36:47.658 --> 01:36:49.080]  I mean, over to the White House.
[01:36:49.733 --> 01:36:53.336]  There was no appropriate authority within the U.S.
[01:36:53.336 --> 01:36:59.061]  Department of Justice in the executive branch at all to address the issues I brought forward.
[01:36:59.061 --> 01:37:00.862]  There was no appropriate authority.
[01:37:00.862 --> 01:37:02.784]  And so finally, through the U.S.
[01:37:02.784 --> 01:37:06.527]  Congress and the Inspector General's office, we took the issues to the American people.
[01:37:06.527 --> 01:37:10.530]  And by golly, the American people are the appropriate authority.
[01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:13.392]  If we don't like what's going on, we don't need to pick up arms.
[01:37:13.392 --> 01:37:15.414]  We have mechanisms.
[01:37:15.414 --> 01:37:17.696]  It's very costly to use those mechanisms.
[01:37:18.402 --> 01:37:22.043]  They will send you to the shrink, just like out of the old Soviet Union.
[01:37:22.043 --> 01:37:25.143]  Oh, well, he's a troubled man.
[01:37:25.143 --> 01:37:28.764]  They'll take you from your office in one place and put you in another.
[01:37:28.764 --> 01:37:30.864]  They'll harass your wife.
[01:37:30.864 --> 01:37:34.585]  They snide comments, give you bad performance appraisals.
[01:37:34.585 --> 01:37:39.386]  Well, it never happened to me, but it happened to a number of my colleagues.
[01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:44.146]  All of those kinds of things that say, wow, these people are not going to address the problem.
[01:37:44.146 --> 01:37:45.507]  They're going to try and shut it down.
[01:37:48.294 --> 01:37:53.555]  You know, when the President of the United States has refused to require the U.S.
[01:37:53.555 --> 01:38:01.817]  Department of Justice and the FBI to obey federal law, Federal Whistleblower Act, they just never obeyed it.
[01:38:01.817 --> 01:38:05.097]  They just, well, it doesn't apply to us.
[01:38:05.097 --> 01:38:10.819]  That means those people consider themselves above the law, and in this country, no one is above the law.
[01:38:10.819 --> 01:38:11.119]  No one.
[01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:30.420]  And we see this system everywhere where 800 plus cities are sanctuary cities where illegal aliens here in Austin can drunk drive and kill people and they get released but citizens get the book thrown at them because politically the government wants more illegals here for whatever reason.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.100]  I mean that's just another example.
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.441]  Now from your experience
[01:38:34.406 --> 01:38:42.147]  What percentage of Crime Lab people thought somebody was guilty, and so they planted the evidence, like with what happened with O.J.
[01:38:42.147 --> 01:38:53.289]  Simpson with the LAPD, and then, and I know it's not an exact number, versus what percentage were just sloppy and didn't care?
[01:38:53.289 --> 01:39:00.831]  Well, you know, there's another percentage, sir, and that's the people who work very, very hard and really do care.
[01:39:00.831 --> 01:39:02.431]  What happens in the Crime Lab is,
[01:39:04.152 --> 01:39:14.520]  They've got the data, and back when I was involved with this system, and I still am, but gradually we've come out of it, they're stuck with this issue.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.462]  The issue is, well, the guy's probably guilty of something.
[01:39:18.462 --> 01:39:27.689]  If I report this stuff, I'm going to lose my job, so what's more important, my family or my oath of office and my nation?
[01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:29.410]  And that's a hard decision to make.
[01:39:30.086 --> 01:39:36.330]  It's just that with all these city crime labs, it comes out that they are just framing people in mass.
[01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:39.012]  And we'll talk about some of those cases as well.
[01:39:39.012 --> 01:39:42.254]  But I tend to agree with you that things are actually getting better.
[01:39:42.254 --> 01:39:46.517]  It just looks like things are worse because now we're lancing the wound.
[01:39:46.517 --> 01:39:49.319]  We're seeing the pus.
[01:39:49.319 --> 01:39:50.880]  I mean, to be like if you're in a serial killer's
[01:39:51.881 --> 01:39:56.423]  Back 40, and you dig up the 25 bodies, things aren't getting worse.
[01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.483]  You've actually stopped the serial killer.
[01:39:58.483 --> 01:40:00.224]  You've got him in custody now.
[01:40:00.224 --> 01:40:04.266]  It just looks like it's getting worse because you've now discovered the crime.
[01:40:04.266 --> 01:40:05.986]  You got it.
[01:40:05.986 --> 01:40:12.789]  You know, they call them crime labs sometimes because the crime is in the lab.
[01:40:12.789 --> 01:40:19.251]  But, you know, the labs are frankly completely, absolutely overwhelmed, overworked.
[01:40:20.408 --> 01:40:29.035]  Uh, when you're just reading an article during the break about San Francisco Crime Lab, they're doing 7,000 cases or, you know, each exam.
[01:40:29.035 --> 01:40:32.118]  There's no way you could do science that fast, period.
[01:40:32.118 --> 01:40:41.846]  And, you know, what's amazing to me is San Francisco is, uh, touts itself as one of the most progressive thought, uh, think tanks, if you will, in the country.
[01:40:41.846 --> 01:40:49.072]  I'm not sure about that because I'm from North Carolina, but, um, that kind of thing that's going on in San Francisco has been happening for years.
[01:40:49.993 --> 01:40:53.536]  And we've brought it to the attention of those folks out there.
[01:40:53.536 --> 01:40:55.798]  And judges don't do anything about it.
[01:40:55.798 --> 01:40:57.100]  Courts don't do anything about it.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.081]  Defense attorneys are overwhelmed.
[01:40:59.081 --> 01:41:00.362]  The labs are overwhelmed.
[01:41:00.362 --> 01:41:08.570]  And, well, okay, if what happens in crime labs happened in clinical laboratories, there'd be bodies all over the place.
[01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:10.592]  But there'd also be lawsuits.
[01:41:10.592 --> 01:41:13.114]  You know, these people have immunity from lawsuits.
[01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:21.099]  If a doctor carried out his business like crime labs carry on their business, he wouldn't be a doctor very long.
[01:41:21.099 --> 01:41:30.882]  So this state immunity that you've got in a crime lab, as well as no audit function, there's no outside audit function at all.
[01:41:30.882 --> 01:41:34.904]  You know, you'll be told the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors audits these labs.
[01:41:34.904 --> 01:41:38.685]  My goodness, they've been auditing these labs for years.
[01:41:38.685 --> 01:41:39.485]  Nothing's happened.
[01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:41.971]  That's just a good old boy network.
[01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:45.434]  So, you've got a human enterprise that has no oversight.
[01:41:45.434 --> 01:41:47.315]  No oversight at all, sir.
[01:41:47.315 --> 01:41:48.476]  None.
[01:41:48.476 --> 01:41:56.321]  And, on top of that, the oversight system that's supposed to work, which is the court system, is completely overwhelmed.
[01:41:56.321 --> 01:41:59.263]  We don't arrest people all over this country for all kinds of things.
[01:41:59.263 --> 01:42:01.464]  We're successfully doing it, as you mentioned.
[01:42:01.464 --> 01:42:04.947]  We have the largest per capita prison population in the world.
[01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:09.530]  But there's just a point at which the system breaks, and it breaks pretty quickly under this kind of overload.
[01:42:10.552 --> 01:42:18.855]  The bad people in the system relieve the stress of the overload by just lying, by doing something very often called dry labbing.
[01:42:18.855 --> 01:42:22.537]  Dry labbing means you didn't even conduct the analysis.
[01:42:22.537 --> 01:42:29.700]  You simply took a chart out of a drawer and labeled it as it came from the analysis and go on to the next case.
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:33.181]  And you've got an overloaded system without any outside oversight.
[01:42:34.307 --> 01:42:38.950]  Easy to institute that oversight, but the government doesn't allow it to happen.
[01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:47.475]  Our government, your listeners, do not allow the laboratories in the state of Texas to be audited by independent auditors.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.261]  What's your home worth?
[01:42:59.261 --> 01:43:01.382]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:43:01.382 --> 01:43:04.424]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:43:04.424 --> 01:43:12.129]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:43:12.129 --> 01:43:15.571]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:18.252]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free!
[01:43:18.252 --> 01:43:26.517]  At HomeGain.com you can compare realtors anonymously, receive customized proposals, see consumer reviews, then select the best realtor for you.
[01:43:26.517 --> 01:43:30.759]  Go to HomeGain.com and get an instant home value estimate, view comparable homes,
[01:43:30.919 --> 01:43:31.459]  I don't think so.
[01:43:57.611 --> 01:44:00.014]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:44:00.014 --> 01:44:02.316]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:44:02.316 --> 01:44:05.539]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:10.645]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:44:10.645 --> 01:44:14.829]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:17.613]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:44:17.613 --> 01:44:20.377]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:44:20.377 --> 01:44:23.301]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:44:23.301 --> 01:44:30.912]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:44:31.212 --> 01:44:36.617]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:44:36.617 --> 01:44:38.920]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.164]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:44:43.164 --> 01:44:44.225]  And I got news for you.
[01:44:44.225 --> 01:44:45.566]  You're everyone else.
[01:44:45.566 --> 01:44:47.067]  Invisible Empire.

[01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:58.858]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:44:58.858 --> 01:45:04.441]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:45:04.441 --> 01:45:09.464]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:45:09.464 --> 01:45:14.507]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:45:15.027 --> 01:45:20.249]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:45:20.249 --> 01:45:27.371]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:27.371 --> 01:45:28.492]  And here's the best part.
[01:45:28.492 --> 01:45:34.854]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:35.174 --> 01:45:38.357]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:38.357 --> 01:45:40.579]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:41.720]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.163]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:45:45.163 --> 01:45:46.904]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:57.373 --> 01:46:02.699]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:46:02.699 --> 01:46:05.462]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:46:05.462 --> 01:46:09.827]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:15.253]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.
[01:46:15.253 --> 01:46:16.694]  We also have some specials for you.

[01:46:58.668 --> 01:47:00.209]  Coast to Coast.
[01:47:00.209 --> 01:47:02.231]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:02.231 --> 01:47:05.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:19.001 --> 01:47:33.004]  You can be executed because a crime laboratory that has no oversight at all but a doctor going into your throat to determine if you have a sore throat has a paperwork trail that he's very well aware could take away his license to practice.
[01:47:33.004 --> 01:47:35.285]  So we have a system out of control.
[01:47:35.285 --> 01:47:39.746]  Until the people decide, and this falls right back in the seat of
[01:47:40.868 --> 01:47:42.029]  Of your listeners, sir.
[01:47:42.029 --> 01:47:48.372]  Until they decide this is not going to happen, I am not going to be threatened by this.
[01:47:48.372 --> 01:47:49.492]  Let's just put it in place.
[01:47:49.492 --> 01:47:51.713]  Oh, it's going to cost some money.
[01:47:51.713 --> 01:47:54.655]  Here in North Carolina, we put daylilies in the middle of our highways.
[01:47:54.655 --> 01:47:57.096]  Down there in Texas, you put bluebonnets.
[01:47:57.096 --> 01:47:58.456]  Okay?
[01:47:58.456 --> 01:48:05.020]  Let's put a few less bluebonnets and let's get auditors, not crime laboratory people, auditors, in to look at those labs.
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.961]  Well, is that going to happen?
[01:48:08.743 --> 01:48:14.488]  It's not going to happen unless the people that are in Texas and the United States decide enough is enough.
[01:48:14.488 --> 01:48:17.130]  Alright, Dr. Whitehurst, let's bring this down to the bottom line.
[01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:17.891]  Yes.
[01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:27.919]  Every major police department I've ever even randomly googled has had big scandals with their crime labs, and that's with most states having almost no oversight.
[01:48:27.919 --> 01:48:31.122]  It's the same thing as the National Security Act of 47.
[01:48:32.623 --> 01:48:33.244]  We're good to go.
[01:48:47.901 --> 01:48:48.762]  We're good to go.
[01:49:13.783 --> 01:49:15.323]  Not a free society.
[01:49:15.323 --> 01:49:21.805]  Freedom is a precious jewel that Thomas Jefferson said, even if you defend it, you're probably going to lose it.
[01:49:21.805 --> 01:49:25.666]  And so we know that these crime labs, by and large, are a fraud.
[01:49:25.666 --> 01:49:31.207]  There's this crisis of confidence as we learn that there's all this fraud.
[01:49:31.207 --> 01:49:38.869]  And instead of crime labs now, they're moving to new quackery that makes lie detector tests that have been proven to be a fraud pale in significance.
[01:49:38.869 --> 01:49:40.890]  They have fake brain scanners.
[01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:41.330]  They have
[01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:47.514]  All these other systems that supposedly show if you're really guilty and have been proven to be frauds, quackery.
[01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:57.442]  We have all these fake informants lying about people, setting people up, being caught over and over again, lying for money.
[01:49:57.442 --> 01:50:02.947]  We have police in all these scandals admitting that they lied on the stand and that it's condoned.
[01:50:02.947 --> 01:50:05.029]  So there is this culture of corruption.
[01:50:06.104 --> 01:50:11.886]  Well, you know, I might add to that the safest place for a serial criminal in the United States is in a crime laboratory.
[01:50:32.535 --> 01:50:39.946]  He can get away with it again and again and again and he has, there's no oversight and he's immune from prosecution.
[01:50:39.946 --> 01:50:45.554]  And you can, you can count on your left hand the number of these folks that have been prosecuted.
[01:50:46.502 --> 01:50:56.168]  You know, if you put a man away for 18 years with a lie, then by golly, you ought to go take his place and finish out his term.
[01:50:56.168 --> 01:51:02.993]  And your retirement check ought to go into helping the country pay that man what he owed.
[01:51:02.993 --> 01:51:04.814]  But what is the solution?
[01:51:04.814 --> 01:51:08.376]  We've got a society here.
[01:51:08.376 --> 01:51:10.097]  What the solution is?
[01:51:10.097 --> 01:51:10.878]  It's at the polls.
[01:51:12.397 --> 01:51:14.478]  You know, I'm a child of the 60s.
[01:51:14.478 --> 01:51:16.220]  I'm 62 years old now.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.862]  And I remember people became involved.
[01:51:18.862 --> 01:51:25.167]  We weren't attached to an iPhone and an iPod and a whatever computer screen.
[01:51:25.167 --> 01:51:28.170]  We got up and we saw what was going on around us.
[01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:30.311]  And we raised our voices.
[01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:31.993]  I'm not saying raise your gun.
[01:51:32.882 --> 01:51:35.044]  I do not believe in that kind of revolution.
[01:51:35.044 --> 01:51:38.866]  I was in Vietnam for three years, and I don't want that happening in my country.
[01:51:38.866 --> 01:51:40.908]  But we have the ability here.
[01:51:40.908 --> 01:51:43.630]  Nobody killed me yet.
[01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.691]  You know, in some countries, that'd be amazing.
[01:51:45.691 --> 01:51:47.653]  I'd have been dead 20 years ago.
[01:51:47.653 --> 01:51:48.533]  Nobody shot me.
[01:51:48.533 --> 01:51:54.678]  Now, they made life miserable for me and my family and people around me that supported what I was saying, but we weren't killed.
[01:51:55.242 --> 01:52:00.344]  You have the right to come forward and do something to collect the data.
[01:52:00.344 --> 01:52:06.726]  One of the things Forensic Justice Project does, sir, is we're tracking all the victim defendants.
[01:52:06.726 --> 01:52:16.650]  I'm not saying defendants or victims, I'm saying victim defendants of the individuals that were pointed out in the investigation of the FBI crime lab.
[01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:18.511]  That's a really neat project.
[01:52:18.511 --> 01:52:21.172]  In most of our states, we have open records.
[01:52:21.172 --> 01:52:22.072]  Citizen groups
[01:52:22.816 --> 01:52:32.262]  Can take the iPod out of their ear, and petition the government for the names of every case that bad guys ever worked.
[01:52:32.262 --> 01:52:45.070]  And then go find those people, find out if they're in prison, if they've been executed, and we can do that passing the information around all over the country, and we will launch, and have launched, an army doing that.
[01:52:45.717 --> 01:52:54.303]  When one man goes to jail, sir, he has a family and he has friends, and if they know he's innocent, and they see the system do that to him, they do respond.
[01:52:54.303 --> 01:52:56.044]  They just don't throw their hands up.
[01:52:56.044 --> 01:52:58.005]  And we've already won the first stage of the battle.
[01:52:58.005 --> 01:53:10.854]  We've gone from 20 years ago, the average person saying, no way the police ever frame anybody, to the population in polls know they frame whoever they want, whenever they want, and it's causing people
[01:53:11.254 --> 01:53:11.574]  You know what?
[01:53:11.574 --> 01:53:13.295]  I think I was on the inside of the FBI and I saw the stuff.
[01:53:13.295 --> 01:53:14.055]  And I saw how sick people were.
[01:53:40.422 --> 01:53:53.605]  At the things that were going on from voucher fraud to time and attendance sheet fraud to, you know, you go to court and there's a whole crew there and one of the guys is obviously lying and, you know, they're sick about it.
[01:53:53.605 --> 01:53:54.406]  They're sick about it.
[01:53:54.406 --> 01:53:57.466]  But sir, you know the structure we have right now?
[01:53:57.466 --> 01:53:58.787]  Horses.
[01:53:58.787 --> 01:54:05.308]  Those people, those good people, to decide between their family's security or their oath of office.
[01:54:05.308 --> 01:54:07.329]  And that's a dilemma we shouldn't put in their hands.
[01:54:08.089 --> 01:54:32.508]  They should know that when they come forward with valid, documented proof, that that guy who did what he did will not be protected by his, his, um, you know, his, what do you call him in the bureau, his juice man, not be protected by his management structure, will be tried in a court of law as a criminal, a serial criminal, and sent to prison.
[01:54:32.508 --> 01:54:34.350]  No, no immunity.
[01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:35.411]  You lied under oath.
[01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:37.512]  You lied under oath, you're going away.
[01:54:37.512 --> 01:54:39.673]  You altered evidence, you're going away.
[01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:43.016]  There's a man I've been tracking since 1989.
[01:54:43.016 --> 01:54:45.317]  That's 21 years now, sir.
[01:54:45.317 --> 01:54:47.879]  And collecting information on.
[01:54:47.879 --> 01:54:51.541]  It's well known he lied in the trial of a federal judge.
[01:54:51.541 --> 01:54:53.142]  Well documented.
[01:54:53.142 --> 01:54:55.464]  It was documented four years after he did it.
[01:54:55.464 --> 01:54:59.446]  The FBI covered it up for nine more years.
[01:54:59.446 --> 01:55:02.468]  They then admitted it, but said the issue was too stale.
[01:55:02.468 --> 01:55:03.469]  They wouldn't revisit it.
[01:55:03.469 --> 01:55:05.130]  The man retired before retirement.
[01:55:06.267 --> 01:55:07.008]  We're good to go.
[01:55:20.327 --> 01:55:23.609]  They're doing everything they can to stop us from it.
[01:55:23.609 --> 01:55:24.630]  I'm 62.
[01:55:24.630 --> 01:55:26.831]  I've probably got another 20 good years.
[01:55:26.831 --> 01:55:35.576]  So the answer is we have to pick a criminal and hound them and bring them to justice and with the internet we can... that's what I've always said.
[01:55:35.576 --> 01:55:38.458]  If a politician... You don't need to hound them.
[01:55:39.392 --> 01:55:44.315]  A citizen's hounding is, what you need is just to collect the data.
[01:55:44.315 --> 01:55:49.539]  Collect the data, and as a citizen group, it's a fascinating thing.
[01:55:49.539 --> 01:55:52.320]  Any bit of data, by the way, I've got, I'll give away to anybody.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.703]  Well, doctor, when I say hound, I mean a hound just keeps tracking and never stops.
[01:55:56.431 --> 01:55:57.171]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:57.171 --> 01:55:58.332]  That's what I mean by hounding.
[01:55:58.332 --> 01:55:59.692]  I don't mean... An old terrapin.
[01:55:59.692 --> 01:56:01.733]  You just go after them.
[01:56:01.733 --> 01:56:03.194]  You bite onto that.
[01:56:03.194 --> 01:56:05.054]  You don't denigrate.
[01:56:05.054 --> 01:56:06.195]  You do not slander.
[01:56:06.195 --> 01:56:08.095]  You just collect the data.
[01:56:08.095 --> 01:56:12.337]  And I've got six, seven thousand FBI files under Freedom of Information Act now.
[01:56:12.337 --> 01:56:15.498]  I've only processed about one-fifth of those.
[01:56:15.498 --> 01:56:18.779]  And the stuff that's coming out of those files is phenomenal.
[01:56:18.779 --> 01:56:20.940]  You need to remember why you're doing this.
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.481]  Just because one man lied,
[01:56:23.132 --> 01:56:27.695]  And a trial does not make the defendant innocent or guilty.
[01:56:27.695 --> 01:56:29.676]  It means one man lied.
[01:56:29.676 --> 01:56:35.679]  And that defendant, a fellow citizen, no matter what he was accused of doing, deserves the right to a fair trial.
[01:56:35.679 --> 01:56:37.280]  This is America, sir.
[01:56:38.146 --> 01:56:49.874]  He deserves the right to a fair trial, and if the government won't give it to him, the elected government, the appointed government, then the government called the people, and we are the government of this country, can give it to him.
[01:56:49.874 --> 01:56:50.315]  Absolutely.
[01:56:50.315 --> 01:56:51.355]  Let's shift gears for a moment.
[01:56:51.355 --> 01:56:52.696]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:56:52.696 --> 01:56:55.518]  DNA evidence can be fabricated, scientists show.
[01:56:55.518 --> 01:57:01.623]  They also admit that the police know how to take your prints, create a silicon copy, and plant them wherever they want.
[01:57:01.623 --> 01:57:03.984]  I've been warning the public about this for a decade.
[01:57:03.984 --> 01:57:04.685]  It's now becoming
[01:57:05.245 --> 01:57:05.946]  That's right.
[01:57:05.946 --> 01:57:08.007]  So sir, it's not the science.
[01:57:08.007 --> 01:57:10.449]  It is the scientist that we must concern ourselves with.
[01:57:48.442 --> 01:57:51.464]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:56.788]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:56.788 --> 01:57:58.830]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:58.830 --> 01:58:03.833]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:58:03.833 --> 01:58:04.754]  How much do you want?
[01:58:05.014 --> 01:58:06.135]  When do you want it?
[01:58:06.135 --> 01:58:08.017]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:58:08.017 --> 01:58:09.097]  When will you need it?
[01:58:09.097 --> 01:58:11.299]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:58:11.299 --> 01:58:12.640]  Will there be any food?
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.162]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:58:14.162 --> 01:58:19.446]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:58:19.446 --> 01:58:23.009]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:58:23.009 --> 01:58:26.492]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:58:26.832 --> 01:58:28.053]  How much will you need?
[01:58:28.053 --> 01:58:28.953]  We don't know.
[01:58:28.953 --> 01:58:30.054]  How much do you want?
[01:58:30.054 --> 01:58:30.994]  All you can get.
[01:58:30.994 --> 01:58:32.095]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:32.095 --> 01:58:35.137]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:58:35.137 --> 01:58:37.378]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:58:37.378 --> 01:58:38.339]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:58:47.472 --> 01:58:48.793]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:48.793 --> 01:58:54.377]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:59.400]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.424]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:59:04.964 --> 01:59:10.187]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:10.187 --> 01:59:17.290]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:18.431]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:18.431 --> 01:59:24.774]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:25.094 --> 01:59:28.295]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:28.295 --> 01:59:30.516]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:30.516 --> 01:59:31.456]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:31.456 --> 01:59:31.776]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:31.776 --> 01:59:35.097]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:35.097 --> 01:59:36.817]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
