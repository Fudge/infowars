[00:00.000 --> 00:17.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.280 --> 00:35.280]  tyranny will so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.520]  ladies and gentlemen we're only 41 days out from this incredibly important
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.240]  historical election we have a jam-packed level broadcast lined up for you today
[00:47.240 --> 00:52.160]  I want to thank you all for joining us remember this is the most demonized
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.440]  most lied about most attacked broadcast in the world by multinational globalist
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.800]  corporations by the Communist Chinese by the Hollywood pedophile scum and by
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.160]  Democrat control freaks and criminal networks across the United States and
[01:07.160 --> 01:12.680]  for good reason they hate your guts they hate America they hate flyover
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.520]  country they hate hard-working people and they want to use divide and conquer to
[01:17.520 --> 01:24.480]  control us and they see info wars as a manifestation of the spirit of human
[01:24.480 --> 01:30.680]  resistance against their evil and they want to extinguish the American spirit
[01:30.680 --> 01:36.160]  and the renaissance spirit and the true spirit of Christ in this country and
[01:36.160 --> 01:41.240]  they know that our spirit and our will is strong and they know that info wars
[01:41.240 --> 01:48.560]  is a serious focal point of that resistance and so they are massing
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.720]  everything they can to try to destroy info wars and destroy President Trump to
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.960]  destroy any type of organization or kinship that we have together to
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.920]  understand we have solidarity that comes out there internal emails it comes out
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.080]  there wiki leaks it came out new video yesterday of one of the main operatives
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.200]  for Twitter that always has his tweets put right up there with Trump's
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.680]  artificially how we're there to sow the division we're there to sow the discord
[02:17.680 --> 02:24.880]  that is their plan sabotage and guess what interest rates have been raised
[02:24.880 --> 02:32.320]  six times since Trump got in 20 months ago they were never raved when Obama was
[02:32.320 --> 02:35.640]  in for eight years and the Federal Reserve has come out there's an article
[02:35.640 --> 02:43.000]  in Reuters saying fed to lift rates possibly to end accommodative policy
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.520]  era to a good economy that translates to stop the recovery and stop Trump so
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.600]  that's the scientific way of saying it what good old Bill Maher said about how
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.040]  he wants people to basically be homeless and a depression so that people
[03:01.040 --> 03:06.680]  learn to hate Trump so sabotage it is and that's exactly who these lawless
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.680]  individuals are so now it's up to us to expose this the president must take over
[03:10.680 --> 03:15.080]  the private Federal Reserve only the president can do it through executive
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.320]  action the way the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was set up only the president
[03:19.320 --> 03:24.560]  could do that immediately you could repeal the Federal Reserve Act but that
[03:24.560 --> 03:29.480]  would take a constitutional convention because the Federal Reserve Act was put
[03:29.480 --> 03:35.440]  in through that system there's some other ways as well but it's unbelievable to
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.920]  see the whole power structure against this country and six interest rate hikes
[03:39.920 --> 03:44.800]  and they still cannot suppress the recovery they know it's going past 4.8
[03:44.800 --> 03:51.720]  percent growth and they just don't know what to do they're so desperate to keep
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.240]  you demoralized they're so desperate to sabotage you it's just simply amazing
[03:55.240 --> 04:00.520]  so when we come back from break of course right on time I predicted this last
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.680]  Tuesday eight days ago that there would be three more accusers at least and they
[04:06.680 --> 04:09.360]  would go them out starting on the weekend before the vote right up to the
[04:09.360 --> 04:16.000]  day of the vote and now right on time another woman says it in high school she
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.200]  witnessed Kavanaugh and mr. Judge his friend pulling Amtrax on girls pulling
[04:24.200 --> 04:31.680]  the train so I guess they've been listening to much too short or too much
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.960]  too live crew but there you go ladies and gentlemen of course you're by that
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.720]  nose Kavanaugh said he was a total nerd and would just study 20 hours a day and
[04:41.720 --> 04:45.560]  didn't even have girlfriends but his buddy judge did so now they're gonna tie
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.040]  him into all this they said there was punch there to get the girls drunk and
[04:49.040 --> 04:55.680]  rape him yes what's next Kavanaugh sacrificed children he drank their

[06:27.080 --> 06:31.520]  with info wars stand with free speech stand with America against the
[06:31.520 --> 06:36.840]  globalist special broadcast we're going for 16 hours today we're normally here
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.000]  10 hours a day with live broadcast 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. we have a lot of other

[06:44.720 --> 06:49.040]  stations and everybody we're going to be going until midnight and we've got a
[06:49.040 --> 06:54.240]  whole raft of special guests I'll give you the schedule coming up the bottom of
[06:54.240 --> 06:58.600]  the hour we're gonna post that up on info wars calm stand with Trump info wars
[06:58.600 --> 07:04.360]  all-day broadcast in support of saving the country the Federal Reserve has
[07:04.360 --> 07:08.840]  come out and announced they're going to raise interest rates until the recovery
[07:08.840 --> 07:14.360]  stops they say the economy's overheating that means you might be able to pay off
[07:14.360 --> 07:17.600]  some of your debts you might be able to pay off some of the national debt the
[07:17.600 --> 07:21.320]  growth of the debt for the first time started to slow and they just cannot
[07:21.320 --> 07:27.160]  have that so they didn't raise interest rates under Obama but they are now
[07:27.160 --> 07:30.640]  raising it six times and they say they'll do it to end the quote
[07:30.640 --> 07:37.760]  accommodative policy era where they tried to stimulate the economy of course
[07:37.760 --> 07:43.240]  the policies of Obama high regulations only giving the 0% interest to big
[07:43.240 --> 07:48.080]  mega banks and large corporations that was not meant to stimulate the general
[07:48.080 --> 07:56.320]  economy but to vertically vertically integrate it now under Trump he's gotten
[07:56.320 --> 07:59.640]  some of the policy change where you're seeing record loans to small businesses
[07:59.640 --> 08:02.840]  record small business startups and that's why you're already seeing record
[08:02.840 --> 08:08.880]  profits in just 20 months in small businesses that is a big big deal very
[08:08.880 --> 08:15.480]  very serious situation that China has had you basically zero interest rates for
[08:15.480 --> 08:21.240]  their companies for decades but we can't have that anymore because Obama is out
[08:21.240 --> 08:25.960]  of office and Trump is in office now and so we can't let America have a
[08:25.960 --> 08:32.400]  recovery we can't show you what good old-fashioned Americana policies do look
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.600]  the economists all know what works Trump is doing what JFK did the same
[08:38.600 --> 08:42.920]  policies the Democrats used to have these policies but it empowers the little
[08:42.920 --> 08:49.520]  guy and they don't like that one bit now let me give you a boil down to what's
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.640]  coming up we've got some of the amazing clips of Trump at the UN obviously
[08:54.640 --> 09:01.000]  basically calling globalism out we also have Trump exposing the entire
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.800]  Kavanaugh situation as a total fraud and a con job and a hoax we're gonna go to
[09:04.800 --> 09:09.920]  that first here in just a moment we're gonna look at the latest Kavanaugh
[09:09.920 --> 09:15.320]  accuser when when I'm on target I'm on target did I not say last Tuesday and
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.040]  the videos at info wars.com and news wars.com if you want to go pull it up
[09:19.040 --> 09:24.640]  or just go to real.video and it's there as well Alex Jones predicts
[09:24.640 --> 09:33.160]  Democrats are gonna roll out three more female accusers and now we have the
[09:33.160 --> 09:37.680]  third accuser right on time this is such a snowball hell you might have I might
[09:37.680 --> 09:44.600]  be wrong you might have 150 you know by by Friday with the vote that Senator
[09:44.600 --> 09:49.160]  Grassley has scheduled I mean there may be women coming out saying that they
[09:49.160 --> 09:56.440]  saw Brett Kavanaugh literally put suicide vest on children and have them
[09:56.440 --> 10:00.000]  march in and blow up churches oh I'm sorry that's Islam so we can't talk
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.400]  about it I mean they may say they saw Kavanaugh sexually mutilate newborn
[10:03.400 --> 10:06.720]  girls oh I'm sorry that's radical Islam again they may say they saw Kavanaugh
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.960]  at spirit-cooking events drinking blood and worshipping Aleister Crowley oh no
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.240]  no no that's that's John Podesta the Democrats hell they may say Kavanaugh
[10:15.240 --> 10:19.560]  was a lawyer that represented hardcore child rapist and that Kavanaugh bragged
[10:19.560 --> 10:26.160]  as a lawyer that he had had helped cover it up knowing the child rapist were
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.880]  guilty including seven men that raped a 11-year-old girl till her cervix was
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.760]  smashed I'm sorry that was Hillary we may learn that Kavanaugh flew on a
[10:36.760 --> 10:43.000]  jumbo jet 29 times without the secret service with a convicted pedophile that
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.160]  was videotaping world leaders having sex with little girls to blackmail him for
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.320]  Robert Mueller I'm sorry that was Bill Clinton again but see none of those none
[10:53.320 --> 10:59.160]  of those confirmed things matter it's it's all these 36 year old no
[10:59.160 --> 11:06.200]  corroboration all the stories fall apart that's what we should be talking
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.960]  about not Hillary saying she came she saw Gaddafi died and hundreds of
[11:09.960 --> 11:14.560]  thousands died including little girls but the sex slavery no no no no no it's
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.200]  the moral Democrats the ones that want to sexualize your children through
[11:19.200 --> 11:24.600]  Hollywood they're the ones that want to stop the evil first in his class in
[11:24.600 --> 11:29.880]  college first in his class in so many ways and known as a total nerd who was
[11:29.880 --> 11:34.080]  a virgin till his last year of college according to all these witnesses and
[11:34.080 --> 11:39.000]  everyone that knows him on record and his his own calendars showing that none
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.640]  of this is true in his house and his buddy's house wasn't where she said it
[11:42.640 --> 11:51.360]  was it doesn't matter because Anto Vetti they truly ferret like man a true
[11:51.360 --> 12:01.800]  scumbag he says it's true so that is the end of it ladies and gentlemen he says
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.560]  this latest woman is courageous and brave and just amazing and all the
[12:06.560 --> 12:12.400]  feminist dog whistles that are totally fake of the women kept in slavery by the
[12:12.400 --> 12:19.520]  Democratic Party why did she go to parties where she said they ran trains on
[12:19.520 --> 12:28.360]  girls gang gang gang bangs now she calls it rape but she never called the
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.720]  police or told anybody and then she said she didn't like the parties because of
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.000]  the punch so she wouldn't drink it but still she went back a whole bunch and
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.160]  then she got raped now I'll tell you I was at high school parties and stuff
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.000]  where people got drunk and I was never around spiking things with drugs but
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.080]  everybody knew that was ever clear in the punch most of times I went to those
[12:50.080 --> 12:52.520]  things I wish I wouldn't have gone to them because I didn't wind up you'll
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.880]  face down in a hallway or something there wasn't a lot of sex happening
[12:55.880 --> 12:59.640]  because people just got drunk and threw up all over the place but that's not the
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.280]  kind of guy Kavanaugh was I've always admitted it that I've partied quite a
[13:04.280 --> 13:12.080]  bit not into drugs but you know alcohol was flowing freely and there was
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.720]  vomiting going on not not not sex at least those kind of parties I mean I
[13:16.720 --> 13:19.880]  did have girlfriends and I was promiscuous and and and I'm not saying
[13:19.880 --> 13:23.720]  that's a good thing but that was all consensual this idea though that oh
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.440]  there were parties and there was drinking and then there's no witnesses of
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.840]  him at ever at any of these parties it's crazy and the president knocks it out of
[13:30.840 --> 13:40.160]  the park this is a giant con game this whole thing has giant holes in it and
[13:40.160 --> 13:46.840]  it's all the 11th hour 58 minute this all gets rolled out now not eight weeks
[13:46.840 --> 13:53.680]  ago when Kavanaugh first got announced let's go to the president in less than
[13:53.680 --> 14:00.920]  two years I think he's just a wonderful human being I mean I think it's
[14:00.920 --> 14:04.840]  horrible what the Democrats have done it's a con game to play they're con they're
[14:04.840 --> 14:09.760]  really con artists they're trying to convince you know they don't play they
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.920]  don't believe it themselves okay they know he's a high-quality person they
[14:13.920 --> 14:20.680]  don't believe it it's just resist and obstruct they're playing a con game and
[14:20.680 --> 14:23.320]  they play it very well they play it actually much better than the
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.080]  Republicans they're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy they don't
[14:27.080 --> 14:30.280]  know what the hell they're doing they want to get rid of ice they want to get
[14:30.280 --> 14:35.120]  rid of law enforcement they don't want to take care of our military they want to
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.000]  raise your taxes but they're good at one thing they got one thing that's
[14:40.000 --> 14:49.360]  obstruction and resisting and con and then he goes on to talk about how they
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.640]  know they're lying Schumer knows they're lying when we come back on to play the
[14:53.640 --> 15:01.160]  whole clip but we're also then going to get into as I said Trump going to the UN
[15:01.160 --> 15:05.840]  and being laughed at but I've watched the video several times and listen to it
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.000]  most of it sounds like good-humored so I don't think this is like him being
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.480]  laughed at at the correspondence dinner or other places but but that said so
[15:15.480 --> 15:20.440]  what the man in the arena gets laughed at the man changing the world gets
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.280]  laughed at so I have some very important things that we're going to be saying
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.600]  about this when we come back on the other side please remember they're trying to
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.560]  censor us they're trying to shut us down the entire power structure is obsessed

[22:03.600 --> 22:08.160]  Farage so it's good to be laughed at and then laugh last but first I want to
[22:08.160 --> 22:13.160]  play a clip from a Michelle Obama speech that's linked up on drudgerport.com
[22:13.160 --> 22:17.640]  right now the full speech where she just says some unbelievable things she
[22:17.640 --> 22:24.160]  encourages people who quote no nothing about nothing to vote I'm not kidding

[23:13.320 --> 23:19.640]  18 years old and trust me I didn't know nothing about nothing at 18 years old
[23:19.640 --> 23:23.480]  but you still out of control slaves now don't you the big mega banks and the

[23:32.080 --> 23:36.920]  Trump at the United Nations yesterday I think more big you know being laughed
[23:36.920 --> 23:40.600]  at because you know what he's saying is interesting but also he's in David
[23:40.600 --> 23:44.480]  Rockefeller's house the big headquarters of globalism in the
[23:44.480 --> 23:51.080]  lion's den so you decide for yourself one year ago I stood before you for the
[23:51.080 --> 23:58.600]  first time in this grand hall I addressed the threats facing our world
[23:58.600 --> 24:07.640]  and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity today
[24:07.640 --> 24:12.480]  I stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the
[24:12.480 --> 24:20.240]  extraordinary progress we've made in less than two years my administration has
[24:20.240 --> 24:26.000]  accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.000]  country America's so true
[24:35.160 --> 24:39.880]  didn't expect that reaction but that's okay
[24:40.840 --> 24:48.480]  oh yeah they're laughing because they like you that's jovial Donald Trump
[24:48.480 --> 25:00.200]  years ago now I know that he's taken some flag lately but no one is happy no
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.160]  one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest to ban the
[25:05.160 --> 25:11.560]  Donald and that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that
[25:11.560 --> 25:22.960]  matter like did we fake the moon landing what really happened in Roswell and
[25:22.960 --> 25:40.480]  where are big Ian Tupac all kidding aside obviously we all know about your
[25:40.480 --> 25:49.840]  credentials and breadth of experience for example seriously just recently in an
[25:49.840 --> 25:58.400]  episode of celebrity apprentice at the steakhouse the men's cooking team did
[25:58.400 --> 26:03.720]  not impress the judges from Omaha steaks and there was a lot of blame to go
[26:03.720 --> 26:08.680]  around but you mr. Trump recognized that the real problem was a lack of
[26:08.680 --> 26:16.520]  leadership and so ultimately you didn't blame little John or meatloaf you fired
[26:16.520 --> 26:25.720]  Gary music stop them for a month no again notice what's happening here the
[26:25.720 --> 26:30.400]  Maverick runs beats him turns the economy around this is absolutely delicious
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.920]  now let's go to Nigel Farage who they laughed at when he said they would cause
[26:34.920 --> 26:40.920]  the EU to collapse and pull out of the unelected system and and now they're
[26:40.920 --> 26:48.000]  not laughing is knit funny you know when I came here 17 years ago and I said
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.600]  that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union you
[26:54.600 --> 27:00.440]  all laughed at me well I have to say you're not laughing now are you and the
[27:00.440 --> 27:07.160]  reason you're so upset the reason you're so angry has been perfectly clear from
[27:07.160 --> 27:13.280]  all the angry exchanges this morning you as a political project are in denial
[27:13.280 --> 27:21.560]  you're in denial that your currency is failing you're in denial well just well
[27:21.560 --> 27:28.240]  just look at the Mediterranean no no no as a as a policy to impose poverty on
[27:28.240 --> 27:31.680]  Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean you've done very well and you're in
[27:31.680 --> 27:38.160]  denial over mrs. Merkel make it Merkel's call last year for as many any people as
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.000]  possible to cross the Mediterranean into the European Union has led to massive
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.600]  divisions between countries and within countries but the biggest problem you've
[27:47.600 --> 27:53.320]  got and the reason the main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did
[27:53.320 --> 28:00.280]  is you have by stealth by deception without ever telling the truth to the
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.120]  British or the rest of the peoples of Europe you have imposed upon them a
[28:06.120 --> 28:13.120]  political Union you've imposed upon them a political Union and when the people in
[28:13.120 --> 28:18.960]  2005 in the Netherlands and France voted against that political Union when they
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.720]  rejected the Constitution you simply ignored them and brought the Lisbon
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.480]  Treaty in through the back door all right and we have other clubs for Don
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.640]  Lemon then says Trump's a loser the whole world's laughing at him that's
[28:32.640 --> 28:38.080]  called leadership and so who's laughing now that's all they use is soft morric
[28:38.080 --> 28:43.360]  ridicule and and demonization attacks to make us not be leaders but leadership is
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.480]  doing the right thing and not going with the pack of cowards and pack of
[28:47.480 --> 28:52.440]  jellyfish so I'm proud of everybody that stood against these bullies and we're
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.240]  winning and we're changing history yet again we are the Mavericks we are the

[33:59.040 --> 34:04.320]  others are doing and yes to take a line from the original misfits this is where
[34:04.320 --> 34:09.360]  Eagles dare to be public and to be supporting Western civilization now I
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.240]  know of our guests quite a bit because growing up the time I was like 10 years
[34:13.240 --> 34:18.520]  old I liked hard rock heavy metal and I liked good punk rock and I really liked
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.440]  the misfits and then I learned about 12 or 13 that all the wild girls were into
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.840]  it so I've been to many misfit concerts I've been to all of them okay I mean I've
[34:26.840 --> 34:30.840]  been to a lot of it with this guy fronting a glendanzik you name it and
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.600]  so I'm not really a fanboy usually trying to get musicians and people on but
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.280]  when I really liked the band and when somebody's being persecuted for free
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.600]  speech promoting us well then it's it's amazing so I'm excited by the way I haven't
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.120]  chimed in on Willie Nelson I'm good friends with I caught our side attacking
[34:50.120 --> 34:55.680]  him he's 85 now for backing Beto that's his right to do that we we have a right
[34:55.680 --> 34:59.600]  to think he's an idiot but he's not I had dinner with him five years ago he's
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.760]  senile so leave Willie Nelson alone I can tell you right now so I'm just gonna
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.280]  stop right there you can attack when else than you want I'm not attacking Willie
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.360]  Nelson because I mean there I am five years ago had dinner with him and he was
[35:12.360 --> 35:16.440]  not the Willie Nelson I knew for ten years before so let's just say that he
[35:16.440 --> 35:20.240]  was gone five years ago so I'm not being mean about that but whatever he does now
[35:20.240 --> 35:24.760]  it's his fifth wife who I'm not knocking I know her to okay let's stop there
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.520]  joining us is Michael Graves Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago and I
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.280]  was blown away by it that this happened and I think it's best that he just tell
[35:33.280 --> 35:38.440]  the story but this is big news former misfit singer appearance canceled after
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.880]  social media review Michael Graves and oh my gosh they have this big music
[35:43.880 --> 35:47.120]  festival I know because Paul's brother is in the music festivals he covers them
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.240]  and runs major festivals doesn't run this one that's he Watson moonlight says
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.560]  that's his real job and this is a big deal because they said we reviewed him
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.680]  and it's it's white supremacy and all this made up crap they're almost like
[36:00.680 --> 36:03.800]  you know this guy or that guy and so he's still gonna be playing in the town
[36:03.800 --> 36:06.200]  but this is a very very dangerous situation and what did he get in trouble
[36:06.200 --> 36:10.600]  for well here he is to tell us right now so Michael have enjoyed a lot of your
[36:10.600 --> 36:14.500]  music my wife loves your music she thinks yeah you're even better than
[36:14.500 --> 36:17.560]  Glenn Danzig I think that's impossible but you're both amazing it's good to
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.600]  have you here thanks Alex thank you very much for having me on your show and
[36:22.600 --> 36:26.440]  and for coming to my defense I appreciate it very very much do you know
[36:26.440 --> 36:36.040]  how much tailed the misfits has gotten me how much back in the day back in the
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.960]  80s 90s I mean that was where all the hot girls were still is pretty hot you
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.480]  know yes sir okay seriously though let's get into what happened to you because
[36:44.480 --> 36:46.840]  this is this is dangerous and it just shows it's happening everywhere you know
[36:46.840 --> 36:50.520]  they reviewed your social media like like they reviewed your DNA or something
[36:50.520 --> 36:56.000]  this is this is what sounds Nazi to me yeah Alex it really it came out of the
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.560]  clear blue sky my tour manager is also my guitar player and I we had a day off
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.160]  and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after
[37:07.160 --> 37:14.320]  the festival had posted it that they had like you said reviewed my social sites
[37:14.320 --> 37:22.000]  and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from info wars from
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.920]  Breitbart on and on and you know it's not just one person it's it was a and is a
[37:30.920 --> 37:37.360]  board of nine that that freaked out over this and it really is a sign of the
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.360]  times Alex because about 10 years ago I went out on tour and did more than 50
[37:42.360 --> 37:48.560]  states across America it was called the war of information tour and me and my
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.200]  guys we were handing out info wars magazines bumper stickers that other
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.200]  patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from from ordering through
[37:59.200 --> 38:03.680]  info wars and we were disseminating the information and getting the word out and
[38:03.680 --> 38:12.640]  no one said boo no one cared that what we were doing now jump to where we are in
[38:12.640 --> 38:21.840]  2018 and this is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this this will
[38:21.840 --> 38:27.840]  have repercussions as as everyone's seen just from just from retweeting
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.720]  anybody that's ever come to any of my shows from the misfit days forward
[38:32.720 --> 38:40.960]  whether I'm playing acoustic or not in in any form that I perform I do not make
[38:40.960 --> 38:48.200]  any statements from the stage it's not about that so yeah I was I was
[38:48.200 --> 38:54.240]  discriminated against when when my social sites were reviewed and I love how
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.520]  all the left which is even the left of these authoritarians because I know you
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.800]  guys have been critical the right wing as well when they're authoritarian so am
[38:59.800 --> 39:04.640]  I they're just oppressing everyone and lying about who we are when they do it
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.240]  and then and then literally trying to send a chilling effect everybody you
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.120]  better keep your mouth shut or we'll ruin you so you're right you really are
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.640]  sticking your neck out here in a whole sea of cowards out there but it's also I
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.000]  think a greater danger if we don't start sticking our necks out because this is
[39:20.000 --> 39:27.200]  getting out of control I agree with you Alex and like you say in the
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.520]  arena that you're in you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people and we
[39:31.520 --> 39:35.120]  all appreciate that and I certainly appreciate that you and your entire
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.680]  organization has given me and a lot of other people the courage to as well in
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.960]  the arena that I fight in music and art cultural expression to hit the barbed
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.080]  wire at well as well and I hope that and I know that there's other patriots out
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.320]  there there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this other
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.400]  bands other artists and the attack on me and seeing what I do and being
[40:01.400 --> 40:07.240]  articulate and being informed about it is going to give the the courage and the
[40:07.240 --> 40:14.200]  the cover for other artists other musicians to do this regardless of the
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.400]  consequences I just can't believe it America and in England in 2018 like you
[40:19.400 --> 40:23.920]  said that it's it's a courageous act to keep your politics separate from the
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.600]  music overall but to put out some tweets about some news articles and then
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.280]  they come and review you and then this persecution now James Woods is still
[40:31.280 --> 40:34.200]  locked out of Twitter and every few hours somebody else I know is being
[40:34.200 --> 40:39.640]  banned and I have family that'll just put out some pro you know Trump article
[40:39.640 --> 40:43.720]  about the economy being better and one of my cousins got banned off Twitter for
[40:43.720 --> 40:46.680]  just saying oh look the economy is growing I mean this is really
[40:46.680 --> 40:51.640]  authoritarian and it shows whatever the left turned into teamed up with big tech
[40:51.640 --> 40:58.600]  they'll do anything now it seems yeah I get Alex three months before the
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.720]  election the top professors right on the Psyops were telling Hillary that they
[41:02.720 --> 41:08.240]  need to expand the culture war and and and cultural division and that's
[41:08.240 --> 41:14.680]  exactly what they're doing and that's exactly what's happening here I'm not
[41:14.680 --> 41:21.480]  that big of a deal I'm I'm kind of a small blip on the radar so again like
[41:21.480 --> 41:27.640]  I tweeted out I'm a canary in the coal mine as well if this can happen to me it
[41:27.640 --> 41:35.880]  can and will happen to and anybody else that that that that comes out if you will
[41:35.880 --> 41:44.440]  as a conservative that being said it's important right now to be courageous and
[41:44.440 --> 41:51.960]  and to push back and to and to speak and be articulate and informed and empowered
[41:51.960 --> 41:56.200]  by all this because I'm a perfect example Alex I've been listening to you a
[41:56.200 --> 42:03.560]  long time and and when this happened yourself and and many other great
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.640]  patriots have come to my defense and I'm so thankful oh listen it's so
[42:08.640 --> 42:12.520]  preservation at the same time and but it is good to be in this club the great
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.000]  crew I've got the great audience of actors people like you always get to meet
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.640]  other folks that are real mavericks and just have integrity and aren't gonna
[42:19.640 --> 42:24.680]  bow to this but but you know in China they'll arrest you if you criticize the
[42:24.680 --> 42:29.000]  economy here they ban you off Twitter or Facebook if you promote the economy
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.680]  which shows at least the communist Chinese are for their own system the
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.520]  people running our country are trying to are totally pissed off that we want to
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.960]  be successful showing they're trying to demoralize this I want to ask you what
[42:41.960 --> 42:45.200]  you think the backlash will be and how serious this will get before we turn the
[42:45.200 --> 42:49.160]  corner and and can we save civilization with the former head of the misfits
[42:49.160 --> 42:53.280]  Michael Graves straight ahead stay with us we'll be back official Michael Graves
[42:53.280 --> 43:02.840]  comms the website living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[43:02.840 --> 43:07.440]  the real drama can be found here in Lailania states but a lot of us on the
[43:07.440 --> 43:12.080]  big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.560]  rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[43:17.560 --> 43:22.800]  the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[43:22.800 --> 43:28.400]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[43:28.400 --> 43:33.520]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.840]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[43:37.840 --> 43:43.120]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[43:43.120 --> 43:49.120]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.320]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.680]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it I
[43:58.680 --> 44:04.960]  want to plow into all of this I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just
[44:04.960 --> 44:09.960]  encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water

[47:02.560 --> 47:07.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:07.960 --> 47:20.920]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[47:20.920 --> 47:42.360]  listening to Alex Jones this magic moment and then it happened
[47:50.920 --> 48:02.480]  good stuff I recognize a lot of this guy's music in our bumper music because
[48:02.480 --> 48:06.200]  usually you got like a super iconic band like the misfits and then the next
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.880]  singer is not as good or they copy the last guy well he didn't do that he's
[48:09.880 --> 48:15.720]  just as good as Glenn Danzig in my view and I love the album with all the 50
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.960]  stuff on actually bought that one and I've been listening to that for a long
[48:19.960 --> 48:23.560]  long long time I was actually listening to it hiking in the Grand Canyon when I
[48:23.560 --> 48:29.520]  slipped off a cliff edge and blew my Achilles that's a funny funny story but
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.600]  as you don't remember the song you have when you blow your Achilles Michael
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.640]  Graves here official Michael Graves.com and as George Arwell said in a world of
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.160]  universal deceit telling the truth a revolutionary act and so here he is banned
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.840]  from a big music festival because he quitted Breitbart and Alex Jones info
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.520]  wars and Paul Watson talking about the discrimination against white people
[48:52.520 --> 48:56.640]  which you've got that the the board member at the New York Times at the time
[48:56.640 --> 48:59.280]  he tweeted you know saying whites are the subhuman creatures that live in
[48:59.280 --> 49:04.600]  goblin holes and then you've got an article today with this MSNBC host is
[49:04.600 --> 49:08.240]  being sued because she just randomly said some white lady was a racist and
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.320]  was a subhuman and should be killed and I don't dislike people because they had
[49:12.320 --> 49:17.240]  brown skin but then when the media turns them into racist and they say I'm
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.920]  subhuman it sounds like something Hitler said and then I say it's wrong or
[49:20.920 --> 49:28.160]  Michael Graves says it and then he's banned this is getting crazy Michael. Alex
[49:28.160 --> 49:34.680]  I'm on a street level and in a lot of ways it is getting crazy especially in
[49:34.680 --> 49:42.560]  the art and music community what makes this situation particularly dangerous
[49:42.560 --> 49:48.560]  is because it was coming from somebody that works within city government as
[49:48.560 --> 49:53.880]  as well that's kind of being left out of the story on this individual who is on
[49:53.880 --> 50:00.040]  this board of nine and we only know one of the names the other eight of them
[50:00.040 --> 50:07.040]  remained anonymous but this individual is the director of cultural services in
[50:07.040 --> 50:13.640]  the city now I don't think that it's too hard to imagine that this person's
[50:13.640 --> 50:19.880]  ideology and the things that he believes don't then bleed over into the art and
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.600]  music community as a whole to me that's very very dangerous I'm trying to change
[50:25.600 --> 50:31.280]  the world for the good and to lift people up and to make them feel good
[50:31.280 --> 50:42.040]  about themselves through music and art to have to get us out of this whole you
[50:42.040 --> 50:50.640]  know junk in junk out right so you have all of these folks that are in the the
[50:50.640 --> 50:58.720]  music and art community who are authoritarian their raging leftists that
[50:58.720 --> 51:05.040]  that put that mindset and that ideology into the minds of young people with all
[51:05.040 --> 51:10.960]  their in their inclusive policies all this crazy anti-discrimination stuff
[51:10.960 --> 51:17.240]  that just breeds fear into the minds of of people in general and I think it
[51:17.240 --> 51:22.520]  creates racism on both sides it definitely does it polarizes people on
[51:22.520 --> 51:27.600]  both sides you see it on on the social sites you see on Facebook you see you
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.720]  mentioned it's in the Wiki leaks that that was their plan absolutely that's
[51:31.720 --> 51:39.640]  the truth Alex but the good news is that there are more of us than there are of
[51:39.640 --> 51:45.840]  them in music and in art that's the truth there's more of us than than them
[51:45.840 --> 51:53.880]  and it's just that again people like me are giving courage and giving cover to
[51:53.880 --> 51:58.800]  all those people who are afraid to to come out and say anything I have children
[51:58.800 --> 52:05.520]  I have a family out it's young children this is if I can't do this I can't you
[52:05.520 --> 52:11.360]  know I got to take care of my family I got to take care of myself and so leftists
[52:11.360 --> 52:16.920]  like the one that that that has come up against me are doing the same thing in a
[52:16.920 --> 52:24.320]  very small way that's being done to you and all the other conservatives that
[52:24.320 --> 52:29.520]  that we see being banned and censored and discriminated against what about the
[52:29.520 --> 52:33.120]  effect of this backfiring it's you know it's almost like putting in the 80s or
[52:33.120 --> 52:37.880]  90s offensive lyrics on the package so all the kids want it info wars traffic
[52:37.880 --> 52:41.040]  has basically quadrupled since they did this now they cut us off a bunch of
[52:41.040 --> 52:44.320]  the big platforms so right now it's about a dead eat they are trying to shut
[52:44.320 --> 52:48.560]  us down they just took PayPal away from us in seven working days that's gone
[52:48.560 --> 52:51.840]  they're trying to target our other payment processors right now I mean so
[52:51.840 --> 52:54.600]  they're going after us and you mentioned the key here and then we'll get back
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.120]  into that question but I just ask that I have big tech working with the
[52:59.120 --> 53:02.880]  Democrats and they have hearings in the Senate and House saying we want Alex
[53:02.880 --> 53:07.920]  Jones taken off the air and executives go we'll get right on that sir and then
[53:07.920 --> 53:12.960]  a month later I'm banned so I'm watching C-span they're lying about me saying
[53:12.960 --> 53:17.920]  things I never said using the straw man to then ban me and and they admit then
[53:17.920 --> 53:22.680]  once we get Jones we'll be able to shut anybody down and now it's happened and
[53:22.680 --> 53:26.040]  so in a sick way they're using me as propaganda they're using the cartoon
[53:26.040 --> 53:30.920]  image they've spun or edited to then even though I want to help people they I
[53:30.920 --> 53:34.960]  kind of feel guilty they're using the cartoon image of me having fun now
[53:34.960 --> 53:38.640]  against everybody that's why I'm telling folks hey my plight is your plight I'm
[53:38.640 --> 53:42.400]  not just saying that to get you on board with me I'm telling you folks I am the
[53:42.400 --> 53:49.320]  first domino brother you are enemy number one you are enemy number one and
[53:49.320 --> 53:55.480]  they have weaponized language so you say Alex Jones and people freak out
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.680]  doesn't matter what you're saying you say Alex Jones in full wars people freak
[53:59.680 --> 54:07.880]  out conservative again bright part in our a all of these words to the to the
[54:07.880 --> 54:14.880]  ill-informed or the under-informed the lower IQ audience if you will it just
[54:14.880 --> 54:22.000]  creates an emotional response and which is which is which is what's supposed to
[54:22.000 --> 54:27.400]  happen they're programmed to to react that way so that they do that how they
[54:27.400 --> 54:33.160]  just freak out and and again the example is what happened to me and and these
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.080]  this board of nine up in Canada have admitted that that that they saw that I
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.400]  was tweeting Paul Joseph Watson they saw Alex Jones I had made a video with one
[54:43.400 --> 54:49.400]  of my songs and one of your monologues and they just and they freaked out what
[54:49.400 --> 54:53.160]  album is that I want to hear that I want to play that it's called the truth about
[54:53.160 --> 54:58.600]  Alex Jones is an acoustic song called ghost and it was a wonderful rant a
[54:58.600 --> 55:04.120]  wonderful monologue that you did right around Christmas time it's up on my
[55:04.120 --> 55:08.920]  Facebook and I'll certainly I won't play it because here's the all be honest I
[55:08.920 --> 55:12.160]  just work all the time now I might watch a show of my wife couple times a week or
[55:12.160 --> 55:15.760]  you know listen to stuff it's already on Spotify though they banned me but I had
[55:15.760 --> 55:18.120]  no idea though because I'm really honored I love your music and I've
[55:18.120 --> 55:21.320]  listened to all your albums that I knew about it I didn't know you've done that
[55:21.320 --> 55:24.320]  so I've definitely got to go download that right now so it's called the truth
[55:24.320 --> 55:27.360]  about Alex Jones I wonder if that'll be better off Spotify because they just
[55:27.360 --> 55:34.680]  banned like 20 apps that had info wars in the name off Apple last month I have to
[55:34.680 --> 55:39.480]  assume outs that I'm soon going to be taken down off of Twitter and Facebook

[59:49.880 --> 1:00:09.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show you know there's a lot of different
[1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:13.560]  types of liberals nice folks like sting that mean well I know folks that know
[1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:19.480]  he's a good guy but he got somebody like bono bono who gives 99% of the money he
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:22.480]  raises for average and charity to himself and it's proud of it and then
[1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:25.600]  lectures everyone about global government how we should open a borders up
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:30.000]  it's it's just sick it's crazy we're gonna play later that song the truth
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.560]  about Alex Jones from Michael Graves official Michael Graves dot com for all
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:39.080]  the different bands and things he does but just finishing up gut level your
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:45.320]  smart guy obviously them trying to ban the sex pistols or trying to ban the
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:49.200]  misfits in different venues made them bigger not just that the music was good
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:55.360]  and raw and real so why do authoritarians keep seeing this will work I mean I
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:59.160]  guess if you get total tyranny like a Hitler or a Stalin or a linen or a
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:03.560]  Mao sometimes it works and that's my concern they think with big tech and
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:07.320]  this combination with government and Hollywood that they can go all the way
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:10.880]  but the only way they're gonna succeed is to go all the way and you read their
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:13.760]  white papers they say they're gonna go all the way so I think people you
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:17.960]  understand this is do or die now what's what's your gut level on where this is
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:26.840]  going I believe that we are going to have to continue through through the fire
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:33.560]  I don't believe that the leftists are going to let up they say that they're
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:41.480]  not going to let up and again we have to just be strong and courageous and keep
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:48.280]  that attitude of victory and love and lifting each other up as we are and
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:55.040]  and in just the way that we've been doing I'm in the game of again lifting
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:01.200]  people up and one of the reasons that info wars is so important to me as an
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:09.880]  artist because I as well and a great communicator and in order to effectively
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:17.320]  communicate a cleaner attuned vision there's that synergy of mind body and
[1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:25.360]  and soul Alex and and your organization has all of those things to to through
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:30.080]  your products that that I use on the road I have my silver bullet I have my
[1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:34.120]  iodine my supermal vitality like you I'm working all the time from the from the
[1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:38.080]  time I open up my eyes at the time I go to sleep I have to be on stage I perform
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:43.000]  at a very very high level but that conveyance of emotion and spirit comes
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.480]  from the core of our humanity and and your products that that enhance our
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:52.560]  mind body I mean I appreciate that you know they are great products but you're
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:57.160]  in a lot better shape than I am so so so that means a lot what do you think's
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:00.480]  gonna happen if they lose the midterms because you're right did they get more
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:04.840]  more crazed it's their religion they're getting more and more violent than they
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:12.280]  say we're violent when we're not what how do you think this ends well I I I'm
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:17.680]  I believe in in in what the Bible says and so I believe that at the end of the
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:22.480]  day we're gonna be victorious if we lose the midterms we're we're in we're in
[1:03:22.480 --> 1:03:29.320]  big trouble I think we're in deep duty not great because they're the left are
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:33.120]  saying exactly what they're what they want to do to us look what they're
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:37.920]  doing to us right now it's not gonna get any better if more of these people
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:44.720]  assume power the the the struggle is is right before us and it's it's clear as
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:52.440]  day and it's just going to get worse God forbid the left wins the midterms I
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:56.120]  agree because they said they're going into pure tyranny they're gonna roll it
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:59.920]  all up Michael graves official Michael graves dot com join us in the next few

[1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:15.600]  live from austin texas broadcasting
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:42.160]  you know when I hit a hole in one I will tell you but it's not really a hole in
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:45.920]  one because these people are so predictable criminals sociopaths
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:49.640]  psychopaths that's why cops can literally after years of following a
[1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:53.840]  psychopath can figure out when they're gonna strike where and really good
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.040]  detectives can actually have a hunch it's not a hunch it's their big
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:01.160]  subconscious brain going with their gut and then catching that that's happened
[1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:04.760]  hundreds of times in the u.s. happens in Europe people really learn how to get
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:09.760]  the mind of it and I said last Tuesday they're gonna roll out more women I'd
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.920]  say one on the weekend probably Sunday night about seven o'clock I play the
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:17.080]  shish day and then I said another day or two later than and then right before the
[1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:24.880]  vote I said at least three well it's now three it's now gang raping meanwhile all
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:27.400]  the other witnesses now it's over a hundred women have gone public saying I
[1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:34.240]  knew Kevin I dated him he wouldn't even kiss he was a total nerd meanwhile
[1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:40.120]  ladies and gentlemen you have almost no news coverage of the pope I meant to
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:43.360]  play this video here stay running out of a press conference because they kept
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:47.600]  bringing up sex with children his deputy pope is on a secret trial for over a
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:52.160]  hundred traffic little boys you've got all these other cardinals busted
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:08:00.880]  3,000 priests you know unfilled indictments you name it just in
[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:08.640]  Pennsylvania this is getting insane and meanwhile the left though they hold up
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:14.480]  Bill Cosby which if you really look at that folks it's a setup because he was a
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:17.680]  conservative he didn't play ball the globalist I'm not defending him I'm not
[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:21.320]  saying it's perfect it's seedy it's weird but women go to a house they take the
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:25.080]  drink they take the pills they go to a poker party at a hotel room with a bunch
[1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:31.360]  of dudes and then they their playmates I mean you know what playmates are their
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:38.920]  hookers I mean that's a known fact it's a it's a high-level hookers and I'm
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:44.640]  saying fine send Bill Cosby to the electorate chair firing squad is ass
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:51.920]  seriously but then let's get Bill Clinton in trouble for flying on the
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:55.600]  express with little kid that girls let's Hillary supporting known convicted
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:58.600]  pedophiles and protecting him and and everything else they've done and the
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:03.760]  Vatican taken over by this vampiric cult that energetically sucks the energy
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:06.840]  off children that's what it is and I told you under Trump they start getting
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:14.080]  busted worldwide and they are a rest of pedophiles are up 15 plus fold you'll
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:17.800]  see hundreds of arrests here hundreds of arrests there children cotton cages
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:22.880]  dead bodies and it just gets the cops bust them the witnesses bust them
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:29.560]  Trump's green lighted it but the courts it stops so Leo Zagami joins us to get
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:33.760]  into this he of course from aristocratic family and he's friends with
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.440]  Bertelskone and he first five years before the current Jesuit Pope was in
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:43.200]  charge said he'd be the Pope said he would start announcing we shouldn't have
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:49.800]  pups for life once they're elected we we should step down which is now what
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:53.080]  they're saying and so he's got let me tell you I've been to the Vatican
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:56.160]  wedding and you know he's got a lot of pull there with the Patriots that are
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:59.040]  in there there's not just evil there there's some good people there as well
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:04.040]  so Leo is the consummate insider and he has been in the Islamic secret
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:08.040]  societies the Christian secret societies the P2 lodge he's in all of it in
[1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:11.640]  fact when I was there and you know and I agreed not to get into any details but
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:15.760]  he took me to some of the castles and facilities and things in fact he was
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.720]  gonna take me to more but I was exhausted because you know you're you're
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:23.760]  already seven hours back when you're from Texas so it's it's the equivalent
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.840]  of you know you're totally exhausted and then it's already midnight there and
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:31.640]  you're tromping around under a full moon in Rome going to castles but Leo Zagami
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:34.960]  is with us right now you can see all the interviews but our YouTube channel is
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:39.280]  gone love to re-upload us but Leo what an incredible time you know for me the
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.200]  way the left claims men and women having sex or men and women together is this
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:46.280]  dirty bad thing but then they want to now say babies aren't boys or girls at
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:49.360]  birth they want to inflict them with mental illness from birth they're
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:53.200]  targeting children because they can't fight off the pedophilia they use the
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:56.800]  transsexualism as the cover for that quote educating the children and then
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.920]  they look at Kavanaugh and they say oh but he's the devil and they just
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.960]  escalate these charges and then all the witnesses say none of it's true what do
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.800]  you think's really going on here and then I know you've got some big
[1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:11.880]  developments on the main high priestess of the Aleister Crowley movement that's
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:17.840]  coming up next segment who's in the in the John Podesta emails she supposedly
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:23.440]  got assaulted a pitcher smashed over her head by some activists was that a
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:28.640]  staged event but again this is the woman that supposedly is a vampire
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.480]  priestess they all bragged it oh she's like 80 years old but she looks so young
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.680]  give me a break that a rubber chicken head like like Joan Rivers did so Leo
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.920]  Zagami of Leo Zagami.com bestselling author thanks for joining us. Hello Alex
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:47.760]  it's good to be back on the show regarding Marina Bramovich apparently it
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:52.920]  was a genuine attack I mean she was shocked this canvas was broken on her
[1:11:52.920 --> 1:12:00.080]  head by this Eastern European artist who in the past has challenged other artists
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:03.440]  let's get to that next segment then I was just throwing out possibilities and
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:07.080]  you're the expert and you're up I deferred to your...
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:14.760]  At the moment Alex there is a really big one the pope has said himself during a comment regarding
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:21.560]  John Paul II that he's considered... John Paul II is considered a saint why he himself is a devil
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:26.680]  he said John Paul II was a saint I am a devil this is between brackets what he
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:31.080]  said so he actually admitted he is the devil and he did it when he was
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:36.120]  traveling Saturday to Lithuania so I mean... That's associated press I forgot
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:41.080]  that that's the headline quote Trump admits Trump a pope admits that he's the
[1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:45.200]  devil so so so there's your quote let's let's put that up for people in fact we
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:48.080]  should have started with this we'll get to the Alaser Crowley priestess in a
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:53.520]  minute Leo Zagami please start over. So as I said when he was traveling to
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.680]  Lithuania was presented with this book I think on John Paul II and during the
[1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.920]  conversation with the journalist he said basically that John Paul II was a
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:07.400]  saint and he was instead a devil so I mean he himself has admitted that he's
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:12.120]  really something totally different from John Paul II and his deal with the
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:19.060]  Chinese is gathering more and more controversy because the ex the
[1:13:19.060 --> 1:13:25.080]  merit bishop of Hong Kong Bishop Zen has heavily criticized this agreement
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:29.080]  basically what Pope Francis has done in China he has given his underground
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.800]  church to the Chinese authorities who have already nominated their own bishops
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:41.080]  and that means basically it's like bringing people to a concentration camp
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:45.560]  because you know and let me stop you because you're so on target the Pope
[1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:49.160]  has declared himself I am the devil revelations now being fulfilled will
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:54.320]  pull the verses up and they have ordered via the Jesuits the Chinese to give all
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:58.320]  the names of underground Catholics so they can be arrested and killed this is
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:04.040]  in the news he is literally turning over the faithful in a 500 600 year old
[1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:10.120]  ancient secret Catholic organizations which helped go into Japan when it was
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.880]  the death penalty they are literally turning over the saints in China he the
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:22.360]  man is the devil my god well it seems he is and now the he's been caught in a
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:29.160]  giant lie by a group of witness who had denounced these pedophile activities in
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:34.080]  the Buenos Aires and there is a documentary that was published on the
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:39.920]  13th of September by Lifesite News I think and basically these witness are
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:44.280]  denouncing Pope Francis and the saying that Pope Francis published a book in
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:50.040]  2010 when he was still Archbishop of Buenos Aires and he completely lied he
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:56.080]  said we never had a case of pedophile here in our dioceses he lied and now
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:01.920]  these big teams are testing they're bringing forward the testimony so we're
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:06.880]  gonna talk about that but the big the big bombshell here is why would he we
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:10.000]  come back get into the context we have the Associated Press but you're there in
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.640]  Rome why would he announce to people I am the devil I mean when you declare
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:21.040]  yourself Lucifer this is very religious this is a special moment here isn't it
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:25.440]  absolutely and we couldn't expect something different from a Jesuit I mean
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:32.920]  from an order that for the first time places their own priest as the Pope and
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.600]  now he declares himself the devil this is a revelation of course of things to
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:42.140]  come and I had already written about it in my book as you know post for
[1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:46.840]  Francis let's talk about it because it in lesser magic it is a declaration of
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:54.080]  blasphemy I mean as the Pope saying I am the devil this is unbelievable what does
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:59.920]  this herald straight ahead Leo Zagami when you use public Wi-Fi hackers and

[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:32.160]  longing for the sun so we've got the pope declaring himself the devil
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:36.480]  in public we've got giant pedophile rings run by the
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.280]  globalists who have taken over the Vatican and the catholic church getting
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:42.640]  caught everywhere we got pedophilia coming out of the
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:45.920]  closet and left this publication saying your children belong to us
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:49.520]  hospitals saying we won't call kids boys or girls we're gonna totally brainwash
[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:53.200]  them and mess them up because that's really what the devil wants control of
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:57.920]  sex for is the in procreation and then you've got Leo Zagami Vatican
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:01.760]  expert to predict that all of this first said that
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:05.280]  this current uh jesuit would have would be the popes you know five years before
[1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:09.760]  he was wrote books about it you've got on top of it in europe
[1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:13.040]  the high priestess of the democratic party she's admittedly worshiped by the
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:17.920]  clintons worshiped by uh the democratic party by
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:21.440]  john pedesta she's in the wiki leaks getting a painting
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:25.360]  smashed overhead in europe show leo zagami take it away
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:28.640]  wherever you want to start again because this is all just wild what's going
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:32.000]  on uh the corrupt coup in the catholic church i think it's
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.560]  close to being undone or is that a wrong statement
[1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:40.880]  well they are having difficulties now in finding a replacement for cardinal
[1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:44.240]  mechanic because first it was supposed to be bored
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:48.080]  then a coup basically all these cardinals
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:53.440]  have skeletons in the closet so the u.s catholic church at the moment doesn't
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:56.240]  have a real leader because most of them were
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:01.120]  nominated by pope francis and they were pedophiles or they were
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:04.160]  carrying a pedophilia but they were bringing
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:07.760]  huge amounts of money in the Vatican and for this reason the pope
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:13.040]  closed the night like he always has has at the same time that we have of course
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:16.240]  this link with the democratic party in
[1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:21.280]  america as well as in europe and there is figures like marina bramovich
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:27.440]  that last month in italy uh participated to a controversy regarding
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:31.760]  the immigrants and said that she's even made this
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.600]  poster where she said that we are all in the same boat
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:41.360]  and now she was attacked in florence and florence is an awkward city
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:45.920]  florence is a city with a real tradition of black magic
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:49.920]  we have the monster of florence of course everybody knows about that
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:56.080]  but of course there is also other links to satanism in florence and suddenly
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:00.400]  in florence we have this attack with a canvas
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:05.760]  where they was painting painted actually the image of marina bramovich by this
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:10.640]  eastern european guy mysterious eastern european guy who apparently
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:18.400]  is doing these acts of let's say inspired acts in some way against these
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:22.160]  these pseudo acts and i saw it accurate because i read the papers that he said
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:26.080]  you're bringing a satanic ritual to the city trying to bring in basically the
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:29.200]  devil in the end of days that's why i'm opposing you and he's a well-known
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:35.120]  provocateur he's a he's an agent provocateur of course of art but
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:38.720]  we know that marina bramovich is much more than an artist she's the high
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:42.480]  priestess of occultism and she started days back
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:47.120]  in the ex-uslavia well start start with that because literally in the wiki
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:51.760]  links but also george soros his son they worship her
[1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:54.720]  they they then she is in alice the crowley magic
[1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:58.080]  they think she's like a vampire and is younger than she is i think she looks
[1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:00.720]  like a sack of crap looks like a big disgusting
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:06.880]  maggot uh with that anyway i can't even look at her but but but why do they
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:10.160]  worship this this this pastual
[1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:15.920]  where she comes from a sort of a aristocratic occult background that was
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:22.160]  also linked to the the soviet union at the time she was a very
[1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:27.200]  privileged person in uoslavia and from a very early age
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:33.200]  she started to get involved with occultism and she also embraced the
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:37.920]  philosophy of alice the crowley through a guy called michael berthio
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:43.360]  who is based in chicago and he's an homosexual at the same time he's a
[1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:46.960]  bishop self-declare of course homosexual but he runs this
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  homosexual secret society called the coronson club so
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.200]  and at the same time he runs also another secret society that had
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:00.160]  a branch in uoslavia that of course marina bramovich
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:06.160]  started to to participate in meetings and of course she discovered
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:09.760]  alice the crowley's philosophy but also she discovered
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:15.840]  michael berthio approach to modern art using modern art and performance art
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:21.040]  to promote satanism so what this guy is actually
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:25.600]  saying is a provocateur who broke the canvas in the head of marina bramovich
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:30.480]  is absolutely true she's not only promoting performance art she's
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:33.760]  promoting occultism and that forces flew her
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.160]  out well that's why in her reddit asked me anything she said when i'm doing art
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:40.400]  it's art but i do do these real rituals and
[1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:44.160]  she's obviously been part of the rituals i don't think she's near even near the
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:47.680]  top but she's their probe she's there coming out
[1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:51.360]  individual and you know i talked to stanley cubrick's daughter
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:55.040]  and it was all off record so i can't get into the details but all hell broke loose
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:58.720]  after i interviewed her for two days uh and we should reupload those interviews
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:01.760]  youtube took him down but he was never part of the occult but it was
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:06.800]  everywhere and basically confirmed a lot of things we already knew leo
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:10.960]  well the stage thing is that even i mean after this accident
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:16.240]  the mayor of florans of course uh uh from the democratic party of course a
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:20.160]  close friend of the clinton's the mayor of florans apologized
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:26.240]  he said oh we are with you marina sorry for this i mean she's just an artist she
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:29.520]  had broken a canvas on her head don't make a big deal out of it instead of
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:32.720]  course the mayor of florans had to endorse and give
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:37.040]  his support because she's definitely an idol of the left wing
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:42.640]  and and she's uh politicizing her art not only using it for occult means and
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.120]  this is becoming more and more evident we come back with one of the leading
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:50.480]  experts in the vatican in the world and i knew he was
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:53.840]  15 years ago and read some of his books and thought i when it all came through
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.320]  and met him in rome he's just amazing we'll come back with leo zagami
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:01.760]  on the other side uh yet bravadovich off the screen i can't look at her anymore
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:06.880]  that mental illness that demon creature uh before we go any further
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.920]  remember we're doing a special 16 hour broadcast today right through midnight
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:14.080]  tonight i'll be here a bunch of big guests tonight
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:17.680]  in full wars dot com for its last show if you'll just email your friends and
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:21.520]  family and neighbors and co-workers and say hey this is the censored show
[1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:25.040]  this is what they don't want you to hear he's being demonized everywhere
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:29.920]  why don't you find out what's really being said and what's really
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:33.200]  going on and i'm taking on the devil worshiping child molesters
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:36.720]  and it's all been proven and that's why they hate our guts and they're so close
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:40.560]  to defeat so anytime i get uh you know a little bit of
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:43.440]  apprehension here i just think about the children
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.240]  and how these vampires are literally sucking their souls
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:49.600]  and and then i'm man up just go to the next level so
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:52.640]  spread the links in full wars dot com for its last show
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:55.920]  they banned us on the apps except for the android app and they'll probably ban
[1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:58.640]  that too but you can download it they'll still be on your phone in full

[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:16.640]  so you got to look in your area find out and then spread the word but we're
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:20.160]  getting a lot of big affiliates and it's it's neck and
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:23.040]  neck every time the enemy does something it's like newtonian physics
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:28.160]  god just matches it you match it but so it's just it's just a free will thing
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:31.440]  and so we're gonna see where this convergence goes
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:36.640]  but separately see the shirt i just loved it back from the trump campaign
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.480]  well it's trump with the severed head of the gorgon hillary this is
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:42.800]  metaphysical it's political we don't want to cut her out for real

[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:04.400]  how trump ties in who the who the different big players are but just give
[1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:08.320]  us the basic boil down of this epic battle who the bad guys are who the
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:12.000]  good guys are and what you think's going to happen next
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.880]  well this epic battle in turn on out to the catholic church has moved to the
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:21.280]  united states of america as you know a few days ago a priest burned the rainbow
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:25.840]  flag outside the the chicago church in protest of cardinal blaze
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:29.520]  kupic and this guy is reverend paul
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:34.160]  calchic i hope i spell his name well because he needs our support because he's
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:38.240]  been now removed from his office four days ago
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:42.640]  after he was leading with the few parishioners a player of exorcism
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:48.800]  over this rainbow flag that was used and found in a parish
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.520]  and apparently it wasn't just a normal rainbow flag it had also symbols of the
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:58.560]  catholic church on it so that's why calchic led these parishioners
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:03.360]  in a pair of exorcism for this for this flag
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:07.440]  but of course cardinal blaze kupic who is
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:11.040]  with paul francis didn't like it and by the way there's no doubt
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:15.200]  that the lgbt i don't hate i don't hate any of those people for what they do but
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:20.000]  when they go out for children it's lb gtp and it's now a cover for pedophilia
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:27.120]  the lgbt movement in the main the big media the big companies are pro pedophilia
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:31.920]  well unfortunately the Vatican seems to be pro pedophilia because as i said in
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:35.760]  past shows that there is a large percentage of their clergy that is
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.280]  homosexual there is also a large percentage that is
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:43.280]  participating in acts of pedophilia and the ones who are not participating in
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:46.480]  acts of pedophilia are covering up for the ones who are doing and we have our
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:49.120]  media covering it up because it's in the police reports that
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:52.640]  they're five six men are raping little eight-year-old boys they're begging for
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:56.000]  mommy they're pouring holly water on them they're saying take the holy water
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.120]  the semen in their mouth i don't want to get into tales but these are for those
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:03.040]  that don't know these are classic blasphemy rituals
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:06.720]  this is a war that of course started when uh
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:10.960]  donald j trump and we announced it first here on info was started his war
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:14.720]  against the pedophilia in his worldwide and how did you know that because
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:17.440]  when about a year before he got elected you came on and said when trump gets in
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:20.640]  he'll declare war and i knew he didn't like pedophiles and it's set it on
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.480]  twitter and things but how did you know
[1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:30.400]  well because i mean he is very close to a cardinal book and to all those
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:34.480]  conservatives and traditionalists that still exist within the vendingen that
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:38.080]  you also mentioned at the beginning of the show those people who still believe
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:40.640]  that the vendingen can be saved in some way
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:47.680]  so donald j trump is really not against the catholic church but against this
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:52.560]  this progressive catholic church that has been
[1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:56.880]  they're taking it over with their dogma of pedophilia
[1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:01.360]  yeah he's crafted by the jesuits and their liberal progressive attitudes so
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:06.080]  of course he's against all that and of course pork francis is the number one
[1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:09.680]  enemy of of the j trump in the world because
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:13.920]  him and soros and the rest of the new world order are trying in every way
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:17.840]  possible to censor people like us and at the same time fight
[1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.920]  donald trump so this is the war that is happening at the moment and we had a
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:27.040]  very important meeting last saturday between alexander soros
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:33.040]  and obama this meeting is a sort of formation of a shadow government alex
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:36.560]  we shouldn't underestimate what they're doing they're preparing to kick out
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:40.880]  trump and at the same time they are taking out of the closet
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:46.160]  obama and they are giving him this new organization which basically
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.680]  basically is backed by soros to interface
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.000]  with all the candidates for the midterm election so they are forming a shadow
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:58.880]  government here they are forming a shadow government preparing for a coup
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:02.080]  well i know george soros is fading off like david roger phone to oblivion but
[1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:04.800]  i'm told it's alex soros and the documents funding
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:09.200]  antefa who particularly hates me why do you think soros and alexander soros
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:15.280]  hate info war so much because they are the ones who are pushing
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:21.840]  all this this progressive uh liberal ideology they're the main sponsors of
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:25.920]  the left wing in europe and the united states of america
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.400]  they of course are allies with china they're basically
[1:41:30.400 --> 1:41:33.760]  pushing this left-wing ideology that in the end
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:38.800]  will instead be the worst fascist state ever once is implemented because
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:42.800]  silicon valley of course is helping out now
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:46.480]  this whole project and they're doing it in the most
[1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:52.400]  anti-democratic way alexander soros and obama last saturday
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:56.240]  have been putting together a plan for these midterm elections we need to
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:59.280]  understand what was said during this meeting because it's very
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:02.640]  important i think because i think that is
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:06.960]  anti-democratic i think alexander soros shouldn't be allowed
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:11.200]  to do this in the united states of america to meet with obama
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:16.240]  and to and to do this kind of uh of meetings in preparation for taking
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:19.360]  over uh the the whole of the united states of america
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:23.520]  when they get out of the way trams so leo they admit that they've got a 25th
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:26.000]  amendment marshal law plan obama put stay behind
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.120]  networks i didn't know about the alexoros uh obama
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.520]  meeting tell us during the break we're to find that we're gonna come back and
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:35.520]  ask you because i agree with 41 days left they're making their move on america
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:39.120]  on the on the brexit on everybody what do we do to stop it

[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:50.400]  when they make their next move what is the next big move from a man who
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:53.440]  really has like nobody else know what's going to happen
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:57.120]  definitely with the vatican leo zigani straight ahead

[1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:30.480]  ladies and gentlemen as i said earlier in the interview
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:35.600]  Leo Zagami is somebody who
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:38.640]  has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:41.760]  he lives in rome risk-critic family dialed into everything i've
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:45.520]  met with him in rome worked with him amazing contacts
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:50.240]  and he has the exclusive that alexander soros now taking the manual over from
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:53.520]  his father who reportedly is becoming senile
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:59.600]  forms shadow government with obama and he's got the exclusive at leozagami.com
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:05.520]  and again this is in preparation to take out trump they're in total war mode
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.280]  they admit they want 25th amendment they admit they're trying to remove him
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:13.440]  they admit they're engaged in all this and so he's saying he's got to tell on
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:18.160]  what their moves are going to be leozagami obviously this is critical
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:23.440]  information people need to listen very very very carefully
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.240]  the national democratic redistricting committee has been
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:33.040]  shaped by the soros as a new toy for the real political
[1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:38.240]  relaunch of obama and michelle obama so the obamas
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:43.840]  this this motto they have is quite also quite meaningful the political system
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:47.840]  is rigged they have rigged it of course is rigged
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:51.360]  but by them not by us and instead they are
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:55.680]  notice that they're calling themselves the resistance everything we said
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:59.840]  they're now becoming that then banning me to then step in as the as the body
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:05.280]  snatcher into the body yeah in fact i mean even the motto is
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:09.040]  very similar to the work we have done in the past few years
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:12.720]  when they say the political system is rigged the fight to fix it is now
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:19.040]  i mean this is really ridiculous i think that people should check out alexander
[1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:25.680]  soros as the new really puppet master of this new world order because he's
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:31.280]  arriving from an experience as a chairman of course of the open society
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:38.720]  and he's been also indicated this year in the famous world economic forum
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:42.880]  as one of the young global leaders of 2018
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.000]  so he's the upcoming figure that will replace george soros this means
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.760]  basically that we are going to get rid of soros
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:58.320]  father son this family is is is is going to continue
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:05.680]  pushing their new world order and their democratic progressive liberal ways and
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:11.360]  of course in support of paul francis and of course with artists like marina
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:16.400]  bramovich like that promote this this whole thing so
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:21.200]  they have the whole system rigged but they accused us of having rigged it i
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:25.920]  mean sorry it's quite that why are they so scared now because
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:29.120]  they admit a lot of publications of globalism is in retreat it's in trouble
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:33.200]  is that is that true in your view or or if this was a football game
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:37.360]  or a soccer match where are we right now against the devil worshipers
[1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:42.320]  well just the words that were published on twitter on the 22nd of september
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:47.360]  alexander soros are very revealing he says it was great to welcome president
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:52.160]  barack obama back into my home this week and introduce him on
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:55.520]  behalf of the national democratic redistricting committee
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:59.760]  he says my home so what is his home the democratic party is the democratic
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:02.960]  party the party of george soros alexander soros
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:06.080]  or is the party of the united states of america or
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:10.080]  so this is really revealing to the people
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:14.240]  once and for all who is really who are the puppet master here who are pulling
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.280]  the strings i mean the photos of alexander and obama the way
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:23.360]  they exit also the room after the the talk
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:28.160]  it's like they are hand in hand together and well let's just say it they act
[1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:32.320]  like they're gay lovers
[1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:36.160]  possibly but in any case they're all over each other which is which is which is
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:39.680]  which is whatever the point is is that let's expand on this
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:42.800]  we got documents earlier this year in january that
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:46.640]  alexander soros was funding anybody can type this in
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:51.840]  uh leak documents show uh obama was planning martial law in
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:56.560]  maryland in 2015 is the headline and it's all their own documents how they
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:00.320]  fund antifa how they do it antifa is allowed to dox people threaten to kill
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:03.680]  people harass people in restaurants twitter won't take them down
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:07.600]  i confront a cnn reporter who's having me censored i get banned on twitter so it
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:12.720]  shows the power of antifa because alexander soros funds it
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:17.200]  and now they want to put their hands on actually on the redistricting on the
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:21.280]  boat process they want to change the law in their favor
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:25.680]  they want to make sure that there is never another possibility for donald
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:30.080]  trump so this is the danger that we have here that
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:33.200]  soros is is starting to move you know his
[1:52:33.200 --> 1:52:37.360]  his various puppets so he can get this law changed
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:41.840]  and once he has the law changed he has washington in his hands silicon ball in
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:44.720]  his hands then he has the whole world in his hands
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:50.560]  basically the whole worldwide web and in this planet with china of course
[1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:54.880]  and and with the communists this is the first time alex that we have
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:53:00.800]  the pope nominating bishops together with a communist country
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:06.080]  having a say in the whole process i mean catholicism was about bishops being
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:09.920]  nominated by the pope and the valigan now they're
[1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:13.840]  nominated together with together with the communist party of china
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:17.600]  of course catholics will rebel in the next few weeks and say why don't we have
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:21.600]  the same opportunity in america in europe of
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:25.920]  participating to the process of nominating our own bishops and
[1:53:25.920 --> 1:53:29.280]  cardinals but this is only possible for the communists
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:33.840]  doesn't this tell you something alex about where we're going
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:37.040]  it is and if people if people are watching on tv right now there's the
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:41.920]  article from earlier this year documents to tell plan for civil unrest
[1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:46.400]  marshal on baltimore run by alexander soros notice the two videos are banned
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:50.320]  though because youtube took us down but we're going to re upload those videos
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:52.880]  and have a matter of that page it's a whole project we've got
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:56.240]  trying to hire folks to be able to upload the thousands of videos because
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:53:59.680]  this is show damning and all these videos are so evergreen
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:02.880]  in the like fine wine they get better over time
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:07.440]  like real estate they just they just appreciate that's why they wanted the
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:12.160]  channel of billions of views taken down and and and so
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.400]  in closing leo zagami and leo zagami.com
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:20.640]  are we winning are we losing what do you expect to happen what can the average
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:25.520]  person do to defeat this really the satanic world government
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.280]  well on the short run technically speaking we are losing because they
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:35.680]  are more powerful from silicon valley in getting
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:39.200]  their message through and they have already the mainstream media now they're
[1:54:39.200 --> 1:54:42.720]  getting the internet on their sites on the short run
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:47.680]  they might actually win this war but then on the long run people
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:51.120]  are going to realize this is going to become a living hell
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:56.400]  they started with info they're going to continue with every single conservative
[1:54:56.400 --> 1:55:01.840]  journalist or blogger and then in the end if you don't think in the way they
[1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:06.800]  want in that left-wing ideology you you're not going to be allowed to even
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:12.320]  talk and that's why people like faith goldie uh and the misfits frontman
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:16.160]  michael graves and everybody everybody's getting more aggressive now
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:18.880]  yeah she's number three in the debate they don't have her she goes on stage
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:22.400]  anyways they're going to find out that the big dog is about to get off the
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:26.720]  porch leo yeah a few days ago i was about to go
[1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:29.280]  i don't want to say the name because i feel sorry for him
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:32.880]  i was about to go on an important radio show in canada
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:37.280]  and they begged me to not nominate your name
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.600]  i mean they were like if we put the name of alex jones through the system
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:45.200]  they're going to block everything i was like
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:48.960]  petrified in front of this i mean you are telling me
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:52.880]  my friend alex i collaborate and worked with him for years and you're telling me
[1:55:52.880 --> 1:55:57.120]  to not nominate his name i mean this is where we are at
[1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:00.640]  well that's the litmus test in fact they tell talk show host just put him down
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:04.400]  we'll promote you but then next it'll be them it's show draconian

[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:07.600]  it's alex jones
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:24.080]  there's a story up on europe wars
[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:29.440]  that's europe.infowars.com armed clan turns german club
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:32.960]  into war zone and the police are trying to cover up that it's islamic they
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:37.680]  later admitted is this is happening everywhere
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:41.440]  so this is the tribalism we bring in giant third world populations
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.600]  for very clan-based gang-based systems and then think
[2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:49.120]  that this isn't going to happen so that's coming up vox days riding shotgun
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:51.920]  with us for the hour at the bottom of the hour and open the phones up

[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:07.120]  they're they're going after us in a bunch of ways behind the scenes they are
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:10.240]  really craved and i know they've banned and
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:14.480]  attacked vox as well again we don't need to really get it
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:17.920]  his bio everybody knows vox day vox day is the best-selling author
[2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:23.680]  of sjw is always lying sjw has always doubled down he's the lead editor of

[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:43.040]  this is a short segment some stations don't carry it but i want to get you
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:46.800]  started here what is front and center for you vox
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:51.360]  with all the craziness going on in cavanaugh and 41 days out and
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:54.080]  the harassment of conservatives everywhere and the left really
[2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:57.440]  forming into a fascistic group how would you describe the current climate
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:02.400]  right now well i think that whoever said that
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.680]  everything that is happening across the west
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:11.920]  is prelude for civil war is a pretty good way of describing it
[2:02:11.920 --> 2:02:17.520]  and who are the main players well the dividing lines
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:21.760]  are predominantly globalist versus nationalist but there's a lot of
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.760]  subdivisions within that you know right now
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:31.520]  there is a de facto alliance of the various identity groups
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:37.360]  that are making up the democratic party plus a shrinking subset of the white
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:41.200]  american population and then on the republican side
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:44.480]  you've got the it's divided because you've got
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:48.880]  the trump faction which is essentially
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:54.400]  civic nationalist and predominantly white but then you've also got the small
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:57.200]  group of actual nationalists and then you've got the group
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:00.800]  of people who are sort of big business globalists
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:04.160]  but are still otherwise on the republican side so
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:10.400]  it's all a mess right now and it's going to continue to get worse because
[2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:15.840]  all of the trends are simply pointing to more conflict
[2:03:15.840 --> 2:03:19.760]  i agree that's why trumps desperately trying to launch a stability
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:25.200]  project to not have this global meltdown well there's no question
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:32.400]  but as great as the god emperor is and he is the best president
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:36.800]  that we've had across the 20th century and into the 21st century
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:43.600]  no question i don't know that his civic nationalism
[2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:47.600]  is up to understanding the magnitude of the task
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:53.920]  you know a lot of us who were steeped in the the civic nationalist concept of
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:03:58.240]  the united states find it really really hard to accept
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:02.320]  the reality that
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:08.960]  it's not a viable plan assimilation is not a viable plan when you've got 65
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:12.080]  million people who have entered when you've got
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:16.000]  40 some million people who don't speak english at home
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:20.800]  yeah we're well and they've been weaponized to make sure it didn't work
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:28.880]  oh no question you know there's there is a number of interested parties
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:32.640]  both inside the united states and without
[2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:36.480]  and you know before somebody leaps in and thinks that i'm
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:41.040]  just talking about israel or something i'm not i'm specifically talking about
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:45.520]  a number of other countries and global rivals
[2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:49.840]  and that's that's bound to happen at least you talk about the big pieces
[2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:56.160]  from 35 000 feet and zoom in with vox day straight ahead

[2:06:44.640 --> 2:06:47.680]  this is the heart of 1776
[2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:49.520]  you're a white male
[2:06:49.520 --> 2:06:53.120]  it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host
[2:06:53.120 --> 2:06:54.880]  alex jones
[2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:58.880]  me bitch get out of the way
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:05.040]  we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag
[2:07:05.040 --> 2:07:09.360]  info wars helped fuel the rumor that president obama is an ices supporter
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:12.960]  it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.480]  i will not let you down you'll be very very
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:20.240]  impressed i hope and i think we'll be speaking a lot
[2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:23.920]  and alex jones this means that donald trump will be
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:30.240]  the 45th president of the united states waging war on corruption it's alex
[2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:34.240]  jones so i'm gonna ask vox day who's a smart
[2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:38.000]  guy uh video game creator uh patriot comic book
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:44.720]  pioneer you name it vox versi.com why info wars
[2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:48.640]  is under particular attack and and why they're genuinely obsessed with it
[2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:51.360]  because i can get on an easy target taking itself out of context and i
[2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:54.640]  thought that was it for a while but now i talk to people involved in the
[2:07:54.640 --> 2:07:59.120]  government and the enemy side summit they are literally obsessed with info wars
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:03.280]  and i think it's because they see it as the spirit of americana
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:06.480]  and they're threatened by the whole pantheon of guess we have on
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:10.080]  and they somehow believe if they can shut us down
[2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:12.800]  that that will be the blueprint for shutting everybody else down and then vox
[2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:15.840]  want you to get more into the 35 000 view
[2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:19.440]  35 000 foot view of the globalist and what they want
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:23.040]  what makes them tick so people understand why they go out of their way for
[2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:27.520]  power and control and why they target innocence and and and
[2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:32.400]  can civilization be saved because it's true the paradox is
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:35.440]  prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men
[2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:39.680]  liberty has created so much freedom and so much wealth that the average person
[2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:43.280]  is becoming more decadent and slob like but just like there's a newtonian
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:46.240]  physics for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.520]  we're giving the choice with trump and nationalism and all the things that are
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:51.920]  happening we're just as powerful as the evil in
[2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:57.760]  fact even more so but people are seeing kind of the ghost side
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:01.200]  of what the globalists are doing this projection of resistance
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:05.440]  but it only becomes real if we step into it and make it the future
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.840]  we can't just see the paradoxical doppelganger of the new world order
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:14.640]  and think oh look we're winning because it's there
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:18.480]  we have to push it like a sailing ship has to have wind in the sails that makes
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:20.640]  sense
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.840]  i think it made elements of sense yes it's a large distalt but just but just go
[2:09:25.840 --> 2:09:28.240]  from that about about how do we beat these people
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:33.120]  can we have a real victory uh or is it just a stopgap measure with
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:37.120]  trumps what i'm getting at and then why is info wars under such attack
[2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:41.200]  well let me start with the second question first the reason that info wars
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:48.880]  is under attack is that info wars and you alex are two of the
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:53.920]  biggest challenges to the narrative that they are attempting to push
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:09:59.600]  and so they can't stand any challenge to the narrative because their
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:06.720]  narrative is false and they know it and so when they are
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:13.360]  looking out at who is opposing them what they see is they they are shocked
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:17.200]  they are astounded and they find it impossible to believe
[2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:22.400]  the number of listeners you have they remember they were surprised that
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:25.680]  donald trump got enough votes to beat hillary
[2:10:25.680 --> 2:10:31.760]  they don't have a accurate understanding of the divisions within the
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:34.240]  country they think that they're much more powerful
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:37.680]  than they are they think they're much more popular than they are
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:44.320]  and so info wars challenges that directly because when they look at the
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:48.480]  fact that you know only two million people watch their
[2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:54.400]  cable news television show or only five thousand people follow them on twitter
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:58.000]  the fact that that you have a large following on twitter the fact that you
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.040]  have a lot of youtube subscribers or whatever
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:05.440]  they find that personally offensive because that reminds them that they are
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:09.760]  considerably less influential than they believe themselves to be
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:13.760]  and and and all their ratings keep going down down down down down
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:18.320]  are they ever going to give up or this going to become more insane
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:22.560]  they will always become more insane they're not going to give up because
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:27.520]  uh i i address this actually in my book sjw is always double down
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:34.480]  and they're driven by a sense of inferiority and they're driven by a
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:40.560]  sense of self-loathing and this causes them to need
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:45.360]  an external opponent you know you fill a need for them i mean
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:48.640]  i know it sounds funny but to a certain extent
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:52.800]  you complete them and so without you
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:56.240]  they don't have a mission without you they don't have
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:02.080]  a jihad and so you know these these social justice warriors
[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:09.200]  are focused on eliminating the threat to the narrative that you represent
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:13.120]  i think that's beautifully said and so they've chosen info wars as the archetype
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:16.240]  to be destroyed and and so that was a selfish question but i agree with you
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:19.120]  that's that's what they're doing meanwhile we already did our damage
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:22.720]  years ago everything else is gravy i don't think they even understand the
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:25.760]  young people being brainwashed in the public schools
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:28.560]  are totally that's what you've done with your comic books
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:32.720]  they're already bestsellers they're rebelling aren't they oh there's no
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:36.880]  question it's actually kind of shocking to me
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:41.840]  as a middle-aged man who was you know raised
[2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:48.560]  with classic american civic nationalism you know
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:54.400]  very proud to be colorblind all that sort of thing
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.040]  um it's been a real shock to me to listen
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:03.120]  to the way that the the young guys talk
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:09.760]  in the football clubs in the the social groups and so forth
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:14.880]  there's a reason why they've been nicknamed generation cyclone
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:19.920]  because they simply do not believe anything
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:24.160]  that they're being taught in school they don't even believe in sort of the
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:28.960]  reasonable civic nationalism that you and i tend to believe they're right
[2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:32.240]  they're very very uh cynical and even the minorities who are the
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:36.240]  majority now below 40 they don't buy stuff either it's it's
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:39.520]  i don't think the establishment realizes they have completely lost
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:44.320]  the the youth no there's no question they have i mean
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:50.480]  you know it's it's very very simple um when you're told one thing
[2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:55.760]  and you experience the direct opposite you're not going to believe
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:59.440]  anything else that that authority tells you and so
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:03.200]  you know for it's very easy for people of our generation
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:11.680]  to talk about this whole uh shiny uh equality and non-racial
[2:14:11.680 --> 2:14:15.440]  but the left flipped the script and totally betrayed that and so let's just
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:19.760]  say it it's making everybody get real tribal real quick
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:23.040]  it's partly that but it's also partly the fact that there's
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:30.320]  16 5 million post 1965 immigrants i mean this is the largest
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.600]  migration in human history and as as the great military historian martin
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:40.480]  van creveled writes migration always leads to war
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:46.480]  human movement always leads to war that's what causes all the wars
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:51.840]  certainly a high percentage of them so basically
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:54.480]  and trump gets that and so does the pentagon after they're perfect we're
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:57.440]  going to a major destabilization even if we try to fix things
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:00.560]  we're looking at really dangerous next three decades
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:04.080]  and instead the left trying to make it as bad as possible for short-term gain
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:11.040]  they are insane well if they had any grasp of consequences
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:15.120]  if they were able to follow a logical train of thought
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:19.280]  they wouldn't be leftists and so we just have to deal with the reality
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:24.240]  that warning them is not going to help that yeah they seem to think we warn
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:28.080]  them lovingly that we're weak we're like no we just don't want to
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  endanger our own lives destroying them precisely but the fact is is that
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:37.920]  warning them hasn't worked for the last 30 years republicans have been saying
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:41.280]  oh you're not going to like the consequences well guess what they
[2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:45.440]  don't understand the consequences so warning them doesn't do you any good
[2:15:45.440 --> 2:15:49.120]  so let's talk about time frames here for societal collapse and meltdown
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:53.120]  if the trump nachos experiment doesn't work which is a valiant effort but it
[2:15:53.120 --> 2:15:57.760]  will probably fail i'm david hall founder of diamond gusset

[2:20:06.440 --> 2:20:23.200]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:29.920]  look I want to be a cheerleader for Trump the guy is awesome I mean he's
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:34.080]  really hitting his stride now his work ethic everything he's done it's so
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:39.120]  focused it's pragmatic he he's just the real deal he's pro-human I'm very
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:43.480]  honored to be persecuted alongside him with all of you but Vox day researcher
[2:20:43.480 --> 2:20:48.640]  writer a smart guy sure with us he said the Federal Reserve saying in Reuters
[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:52.160]  oh we're gonna stop the prosperity we're gonna raise interest rates really high
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:58.080]  to stop Trump I mean that's in Reuters here today so we just have to realize that
[2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:02.400]  everyone should be totally behind Trump China is working with the Vatican to
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:06.800]  docks real Catholics and kill them and then and it's like the Pope's a good I
[2:21:06.800 --> 2:21:12.240]  mean the stuff going on is so manifestly evil that the fact that we're barely
[2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:18.960]  winning right now shows the idea that the West projects its own superiority and
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:24.160]  culture onto everything else and then we sit here and then meanwhile it's not
[2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:27.320]  superior that's why people all want to come here and I'm not putting anybody
[2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:31.200]  down but those cultures never ignited the way we did then you get into debates
[2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:35.120]  about well you're cave people I don't care I love everybody I want freedom
[2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:38.880]  there are great people in every culture every region the point is the globalist
[2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:42.240]  are at war with the West because it's where the Christians said we're not
[2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:45.520]  gonna have slavery it's where women got the right to vote so the
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:49.280]  authoritarians can't beat that so they flip it and create all these twisted
[2:21:49.280 --> 2:21:54.120]  rights it's in their own admissions they're totally wicked so Vox only
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:21:59.200]  just a positive news here but but but first long-term prognosis of why you're
[2:21:59.200 --> 2:22:03.920]  saying that the weakness of humanity and the the sinful nature I guess the end
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:08.040]  of the day let's look at the bad prognosis versus the good and then in
[2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:13.480]  the short term your proponent of red wave I believe it unless the election
[2:22:13.480 --> 2:22:17.800]  fraud is just over the top as a seawall so let's let's look at the bad long term
[2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:25.040]  the good short term with Vox day the bad long term is that I would expect the
[2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:34.560]  USA to break apart as a political entity in the 2033 timeframe and that's based
[2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:43.640]  on the economic situation it's based on the average lifespan of currencies and
[2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:48.440]  everything that I've seen this is a prediction I made about 14 years ago
[2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:56.080]  and everything that I've seen indicates that it's on track oh the globalists
[2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:00.480]  even plan that but can't we let's let's just say it we want freedom but we're
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:04.480]  dealing with authoritarian outside forces if we crack down and we have to
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:08.320]  figure out the way to do that culturally to create a new level playing
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:12.640]  field if we crack down on the tyranny and the outside forces we could probably
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:18.520]  get around that yeah there's a good chance but the problem is is that even
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:25.240]  as great and as insightful a leader as Donald Trump is not really looking at
[2:23:25.240 --> 2:23:33.320]  the the real issues as far as I understand you know in in Europe there
[2:23:33.320 --> 2:23:38.760]  are leaders who are looking directly at the demographic issues who are looking
[2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:47.440]  at doing what they call reportations which is returning a lot of the a lot
[2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:52.200]  of the refugees and migrants and economic migrants and and even citizens
[2:23:52.200 --> 2:23:59.160]  to their former countries that's a whole debate that doesn't even exist in the
[2:23:59.160 --> 2:24:03.160]  United States and I don't know that it can exist in the United States because
[2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:10.480]  of our historical friendly attitude towards immigration and the fact that
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:15.120]  there's no strong nativist nationalist party in the states and let's be clear
[2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:18.840]  isn't it because Soros and the UN are weaponizing the third world that that
[2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:24.000]  is doomed to fail a then B isn't Russia though with their collapsing population
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:29.520]  all the problems the model can they be successful realizing that this was an
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:33.480]  extremism plan can the Russian model be successful and could it be
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:39.880]  duplicated yes the Russian model at first of all the Russian nation is not
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:44.080]  dying the Russian no man under the globalist under the globalist they wanted
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:50.640]  to oh yeah the globalists wanted to but under Putin the the life's average
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:58.160]  lifespan in Russia has increased dramatically and a strong pro-christian
[2:24:58.160 --> 2:25:05.320]  pro-nationalist government can significantly change things you know a
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:10.160]  lot of people when they talk about a nation dying it's really ridiculous
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:16.160]  because if you look at how many people there are there's far more people in in
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:20.840]  every country than there's ever been Britain ruled you know Britain
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:25.840]  established the empire in which the Sun never set with far fewer white British
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:30.640]  people than they have today because they had will so it's right because they had
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:34.120]  will and they had cultural confidence and because they had hope and they had
[2:25:34.120 --> 2:25:42.720]  faith and we need to see a revival of muscular Christianity we need to see a
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:47.520]  revival of national pride because if we don't we will be conquered that's the
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:54.880]  way the world works precisely but you see the ignition of populism and
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:59.280]  Christianity happening again and the and the pedophile control Catholic Church in
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:03.880]  trouble I mean I'm seeing a lot of really good science box well there are
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:07.400]  good signs I mean but the problem is what what a lot of people don't seem to
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:15.160]  understand is that winning is going to involve conflict and we've gone a long
[2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:22.960]  long time in the United States without having to deal with war directly on our
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:27.320]  doorstep and I agree so let's if men aren't even willing to have politically
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:30.360]  correct people attack them or to be banned or to have them go up your bank
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:33.240]  account you'll never stand up when the rubber meets the road so what's your
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:39.440]  message to men about how we wage war against globalism now I think the most
[2:26:39.440 --> 2:26:49.800]  important thing is to not be afraid you know my grandfather volunteered for the
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:58.840]  US Marines the day after Pearl Harbor and one thing he told me was that when
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:04.320]  you're on a beach and there's a bunch of people shooting at you and everybody
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:12.760]  looks at you to see what to do he said just do something he said it doesn't
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:19.480]  even matter what pick something do it and the next thing you know 30 men
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:25.600]  will be right there behind you exactly take action and and it doesn't
[2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:33.000]  necessarily remember our action is the idea that you're sitting around playing
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:37.320]  arm to armchair strategist is somehow going to change the world is
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:44.320]  ridiculous what changes the world is people acting people doing things and
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:47.360]  totally agree because your conscious brain doesn't know what to do your
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:51.400]  subconscious does and once you go into action you're going to find that's some
[2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:54.800]  of the most directed action you'll ever have is when you're not even thinking
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:59.960]  well not only that but you know if something works then you reinforce
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:04.840]  success if something doesn't work then you do something else it's not rocket
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:12.640]  science but but unfortunately we're so used to abstracting things and trying to
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:17.120]  plan things and and trying to figure out all the possible alternatives which is
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.520]  not possible that we tend to paralyze ourselves no I totally agree get out of
[2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:28.960]  the chaotic state move move that that's the answer yeah and so you know we get
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:34.440]  you get shut down by Twitter go on to gab but go on to one way you get shut
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:40.160]  down by YouTube go on to bit shoot you get shut down by PayPal talk to Stripe

[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:12.760]  you got it
[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:22.560]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live
[2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:31.720]  so twitter has banned everybody for myself James Woods to you name it what
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:35.880]  What they claim is racist or hateful or aggressive or demeaning.
[2:33:35.880 --> 2:33:42.240]  Now they say do humanizing, but there's stories up on info wars.com that show the Antifa group
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:47.160]  that's been doxing Gavin McGinnis and, you know, saying terrible things about him and
[2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.100]  his family and how they're going to kill him and saying they're going to kill the vice
[2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:53.960]  president and doing all these other horrible things and chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:33:56.180]  with his wife.
[2:33:56.180 --> 2:34:02.720]  They are all over Twitter calling for violence, but they get to stay up.
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:07.920]  But now a new nebulous term ban dehumanizing speech.
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:12.800]  Major hospitals are refusing to call newborn baby boys and girls boys and girls.
[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:20.360]  That's dehumanizing, attacking the very biological foundation of the species, attacking reality
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:23.360]  itself.
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:29.640]  But oh, don't worry, Jack Dorsey is going to ban what they call dehumanizing and leave
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:30.640]  people up.
[2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:35.920]  I mean, I've got an article here about this MSNBC host attacking some white lady saying
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:37.280]  that she was saying racist things.
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:39.720]  She did then saying, I want to kill you.
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:40.720]  You're a piece of crap.
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:42.400]  You should be murdered.
[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:44.160]  Twitter leaves that up.
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:45.680]  So it's the craziest stuff.
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:50.280]  If I run into a CNN reporter who's been lobbying to have me banned and I go, how dare you?
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:51.360]  You're a modern book burner.
[2:34:51.360 --> 2:34:52.360]  That is so disgusting.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:56.840]  In a public place, he's a man I'm banned for attacking a protected group.
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:34:59.760]  Now journalists, oh, they can lie about the president all day.
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:00.920]  He calls them liars.
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:02.920]  That's attacking the press and free speech.
[2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:08.840]  No, countering liars and saying you're liars is free speech, but that's the spin.
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:10.040]  Oh, I've got free speech.
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:11.400]  Don't restrict my speech.
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:16.200]  The left means don't disagree with me while I hit the head with a bike lock down.
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:19.920]  We sell the first four installments, two more coming out.
[2:35:19.920 --> 2:35:22.960]  We have sold out twice of these, so it's very, very popular.
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:27.440]  It's great for your children, great for your teenagers, great for you.
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:31.720]  Really great artwork and also shows women very, very empowered, but also very, very feminine
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:34.080]  that they don't look like men.
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:36.880]  Alt hero number one, crackdown.
[2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:42.960]  We've got alt hero number two, rebel cell number three, reprisal number four, the war
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:43.960]  in Paris.
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:48.880]  They're all available at infowarstore.com and I'm sure they'll sell out in a couple
[2:35:48.880 --> 2:35:53.360]  days and you can always get them over at Vox Day's website as well.
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:57.880]  But let's talk about the culture war then in the short term that I do think you agree
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:00.400]  we're winning globally because we're starting to fight back.
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:05.560]  My God, we're selling freedom and truly open societies and things that really have been
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:06.560]  proven to work.
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:09.640]  So the fact that we finally show up shows while we're winning.
[2:36:09.640 --> 2:36:13.480]  Let's talk about the comic books and why it upsets the establishment because no one dared
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:19.320]  have nationalistic or patriotic or common sense comics, so surprise, surprise, they're
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:23.880]  already best sellers and what type of opposition have you run into and then let's get more
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:25.360]  into the red wave.
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:34.440]  Well, right now there's a tremendous amount of attack on right wing and not really even
[2:36:34.440 --> 2:36:35.440]  right wing.
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:40.480]  They're basically moderates, but in the comics industry terms, the comic industry is so far
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:48.960]  left that they consider these guys to be hard, extremist right, which is rather amusing.
[2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:57.440]  But Marvel and DC have continued to move to the left and so they're pushing things like
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:37:04.080]  transgenderism in Bad Girl, they're pushing homosexuality in a number of different comics
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:06.920]  and so forth.
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:12.320]  So people have reacted really badly to this because they're actually eliminating and destroying
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:19.440]  a lot of the old characters that people liked, Wolverine's replaced by a girl, Thor is replaced
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:27.800]  by a woman, Spider-Man's replaced by a gay Hispanic kid, and they're bringing in all
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:32.480]  kinds of anti-American messages intentionally.
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:42.680]  In fact, the incredible thing is that Marvel's vice president of content creation is actually
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:51.720]  Huma Abeddon's cousin and so that's a connection you never see them drawing in the media and
[2:37:51.720 --> 2:37:58.960]  what's interesting is that the fans are revolting against this and so if you go on to places
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:06.400]  like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, you can see that these independent comics are exploding
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:08.600]  in popularity.
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:13.560]  There's one guy, we don't get along terribly well, but he's been extremely successful,
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:23.000]  a former DC artist named Ethan Van Skyver, his Indiegogo campaign raised over 500,000
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:29.960]  and so it's because people are so tired of- The orthodoxy, it's not even left or right
[2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:34.480]  and here's the deal, you want your kids to have comic books where it's not, it wouldn't
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:38.120]  all be about sex anyways, you don't want to sexualize children, it's like I was reading
[2:38:38.120 --> 2:38:43.120]  an article today about another library and the adult section is having drag queens there
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:46.600]  to pull dance for children and they're like, oh you're against drag queens, I'm against
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:52.080]  sexualizing children but oh as long as it's LBGT, it's okay to do this to kids and literally
[2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:58.280]  it's recruiting kids into that which is pedophilia, I mean it's just amazing to see this happening
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:03.440]  so continuing, tell us about Alt Hero and because I know they've been a big success
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:04.440]  so far.
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:17.000]  Yeah, Alt Hero is a series that is designed to portray the battle between the globalist
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:19.240]  and the nationalist perspectives.
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:23.320]  Now a lot of people were very surprised when they read it because they were expecting some
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:31.480]  sort of polemic or screed or polar opposite of what you get from Marvel or DC but we didn't
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:35.600]  do that and we don't do that because you can't tell a good story that way.
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:42.280]  The only way that you can tell a good story is by allowing the characters and the perspective
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:44.800]  to speak honestly for itself.
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:52.680]  So for example Captain Europa who's the EU superheroism on the cover of the war in Paris,
[2:39:52.680 --> 2:40:00.040]  some of his dialogue is actually words that were spoken by Emmanuel Macron, the current
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:07.440]  president of France, who is of course a very strong pro-EU, very much a globalist and that
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  sort of thing.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:16.960]  You cannot engage in an honest debate if you do not present both sides accurately and honestly.
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:24.280]  Now there's obviously no question about which side I'm on but the ironic fact is we present
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:32.040]  a better and more honest argument for globalism than most of the globalists do because they're
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:36.720]  not willing to speak openly about what it is that they want to do and why they want
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:40.640]  to do it and why they believe that's the right thing for mankind.
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:46.840]  They genuinely believe that this is what's necessary to prevent war.
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:47.840]  There is an idealism.
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:52.880]  Well, but that's their cover like Emperor Palpatine says I want total tyranny so we'll
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.880]  have peace.
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:58.120]  I mean that's the sick argument is there's no free will, there'll be peace.
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:04.920]  These people I've found are very, very monstrous and you also are courting SPLC demonization
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:12.080]  by one of your characters sports the Confederate battle flag so tell us about that.
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:17.240]  Well actually in that case we had to avoid doing that.
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:21.360]  It's acceptable to have the mask.
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:30.120]  Originally we had her full outfit like the Confederate flag but because Amazon has a
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:36.080]  no Confederate flag policy if we wanted to allow it to be sold there we had to you can
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:37.080]  see there.
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  She's just wearing a mask.
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:42.040]  Which I understand why you do that but now it's the okay symbol.
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:48.520]  Now it's they're just constantly now a federal judge says is America first racist maybe that
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:49.520]  should be banned.
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:50.520]  Here's a Bloomberg article.
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  So you see how they just can keep adding new like don't say Alex Jones or you get banned
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:55.760]  it just never ends.
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:00.960]  Oh there's no question but that's why we need to build our own platforms.
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:09.040]  That's why we need to go our own way because one of the problem with the conservative approach
[2:42:09.040 --> 2:42:16.920]  over the past 50 years is that it's been constant retreat but trying to remain engaged and there's
[2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:18.960]  no possible way to win there.
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:24.200]  You're not going to beat Google while you're playing Google's game.
[2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:29.080]  You're not going to beat Google by appearing on YouTube.
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.320]  No I totally agree.
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:35.040]  You only use those platforms to help drive people to your big platform.
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:36.040]  That's how you defeat them.
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:37.540]  Vox stays our guest.
[2:42:37.540 --> 2:42:42.440]  We're in the middle of this 16 hour broadcast that goes to midnight tonight.
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  Stand with Trump.
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:44.960]  Stand with him for a stand with free speech.
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:49.520]  Whatever you do listening on AM FM radio TV spread those links.
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:52.400]  I don't keep saying it but you're the reason we're winning folks.
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:55.360]  You're the reason you're overriding the censors.
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:01.280]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need you to go to the site
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:06.320]  now if you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals please consider
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:15.520]  a contribution 25, 50, 100, 250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:21.040]  to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:24.080]  want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[2:43:51.040 --> 2:43:55.920]  You're helping spreading it and with your help downloading it we are unstoppable.
[2:43:55.920 --> 2:44:01.160]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[2:44:01.160 --> 2:44:05.560]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:09.720]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:11.720]  People say why would you start a fight with them?
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:15.760]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:17.280]  no future if we didn't do this.
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:23.120]  So we've already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:27.520]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:33.520]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com,
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:38.440]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:43.080]  We have huge sales at infowords.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:47.440]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite trying to block our commerce and you're right
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:48.440]  to the market.
[2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:52.240]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:56.720]  This is InfoWords Darker Sour, with your support, I'm counting on you.

[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:36.400]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and

[2:45:56.040 --> 2:46:02.400]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:08.760]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:16.040]  or videos or other material from InfoWordsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:20.920]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:21.920]  at InfoWordsStore.com.
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:25.600]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:30.760]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that.
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:34.760]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:41.800]  dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well, InfoWordsLife.com or triple-A2533139 and your
[2:46:41.800 --> 2:46:46.600]  purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:50.320]  the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:59.000]  we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:27.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:40.400]  I'll answer my question from earlier, Vox did a pretty good job of it from another angle.
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:45.800]  They hate me because they hate you and this is a broadcast where we can talk, we have
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:51.440]  all these great guests on, we have the callers, we have community and I genuinely am not scared
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:56.360]  of them, I'm genuinely having fun fighting them, I'm genuinely getting stronger as they
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:48:01.240]  attack me even in some ways as I get weaker and so that's what angers them because what
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:03.920]  Vox said is critical.
[2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:10.400]  If you want to understand authoritarians, devils, worshippers, Aleister Crowley types, they're
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:16.280]  all backstabbing, lying, dishonorable, very alone people that all just virtue signal to
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:22.560]  each other and screw each other over all day long and so our mere existence infuriates
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:28.800]  them so they believe they can absorb us like Caranquilla Indians would catch sailors, Spanish
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:33.280]  sailors that crashed in Galveston 500 years ago and eat their livers or brains, they thought
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:37.320]  they were taking on their power and it really is, I see somebody with a great looking wife
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:42.280]  and successful business and I think that's a really great person, our species is strong
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:46.360]  and somebody that stands up for what's right, I admire them, other people's strength or
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:50.600]  beauty doesn't make me feel small, I'm an individualist but I feel this collective strength
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:54.920]  in them, just like I see weakness and corruption that makes me feel weak, seeing strength makes
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:58.120]  me feel strong, not a globalist.
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:01.200]  They love fluoride in your water, they love giving you a vaccine they know is going to
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:05.120]  give you a neurological disorder, there's all these big studies out even today about
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:11.480]  fluoride and vaccines causing brain damage, that's what they do because they hate themselves
[2:49:11.480 --> 2:49:16.680]  so much, they're projecting so know this, we're living in epic times, we're on this
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:20.240]  planet, we're in one hell of an adventure, the real adventure is happening now in the
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:26.800]  real world, not on Netflix, not whatever, but you see all the entertainment being poisonous
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:31.040]  because it's globalist control, well entertainment, jacking into it from the other angle like
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:36.480]  this comic books and infowarestore.com is a great way to get these and then donate them
[2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:40.680]  to the library, they'll get read hundreds of times, get them and send them with your
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:46.560]  children to school to give away, this is really how you change the world ladies and gentlemen
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:53.640]  and that's why they're so horrified and then separately, I mean I really should be plugging
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:57.800]  every segment because they're trying to financially shut us down but you've been coming through,
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:49:59.760]  you've been buying a lot of products and things, they're trying to take our payment
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:05.240]  processors away right now and that's the next level of tyranny's barring folks from the
[2:50:05.240 --> 2:50:10.040]  marketplace, they call us Nazis all day but that's what the Nazis actually did.
[2:50:10.040 --> 2:50:16.440]  So we do have X2, the best halogen out there, the good halogen, the best purist iodine and
[2:50:16.440 --> 2:50:19.520]  it is the last run of it and it's still 25% off so I wouldn't change this special yet,
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  that's going to end very soon.
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:25.720]  We've got Brain Force Plus, 20% more now on each bottle, great nitropic, very healthy,
[2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:30.360]  amazing, works great, so you get a lot of energy and stuff but not the toxic side effects
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:33.400]  of it or the crash.
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:38.880]  That's 40% off right now, that's a big special, we've got our great bottom and B12 that's
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:43.680]  organic and really high quality, secret 12, that is 40% off right now, just a bunch of

[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:07.440]  that make it easy to support this broadcast because believe me, at the end of the day,
[2:51:07.440 --> 2:51:12.960]  I'm not worried about losing info wars or whatever happens to me, I'm worried about
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:14.280]  them winning.
[2:51:14.280 --> 2:51:19.360]  And so we need wind in our sails, we need gunpowder in our political cannons and you're
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:24.160]  the ones that provide that, like jets for bombing sorties, you're loading the fuel,
[2:51:24.160 --> 2:51:28.000]  you're loading the bombs, I mean, you're not beside us, you're at the heart of us.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:33.960]  So infowarestore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA 2533139.
[2:51:33.960 --> 2:51:39.400]  So Vox in closing, we've got about six minutes left, I've been raising a lot of topics here,
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:42.320]  you got some of the red wave, can you comment more on what you really think is going to
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:45.240]  happen with this election and then just any other points because I've been, I've been
[2:51:45.240 --> 2:51:48.240]  guiding the conversation, you'd like to relate to folks.
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:54.680]  Well, to address the blue wave concept, I said from the beginning that it was ridiculous,
[2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:58.320]  I never bought it for a second.
[2:51:58.320 --> 2:52:05.560]  I have been predicting a Trump slide in 2020 for some time now and you may recall that
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:10.000]  I was one of the very few observers who said that Trump was going to win the presidential
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:16.080]  election and never wavered from that from I think February 2015.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:23.120]  The reason that the Democrats are going to be very disappointed in the midterms is because
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:32.160]  the economy has been doing well, Donald Trump has maintained enthusiasm among his supporters
[2:52:32.160 --> 2:52:38.240]  even though he hasn't been as effective at either draining the swamp or building the
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:46.640]  wall as we would have liked him to be, you know, the biggest mistake that Trump has made
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:50.920]  and I don't want to be too critical here because like I said, he has proven himself
[2:52:50.920 --> 2:52:58.320]  so far to be the best president of the 20s, he's facing total mutiny, right, the biggest
[2:52:58.320 --> 2:53:05.360]  mistake that he's made is that he didn't watch his six, he didn't bring in, no, you're
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:10.040]  right, he should have brought in acolytes, not people out of the swamp.
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:16.240]  Exactly, you know, he got sucked into believing that he needed people with experience and
[2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:22.720]  people with credentials, he didn't, all he needed and all he needs are people are people
[2:53:22.720 --> 2:53:25.920]  who will do exactly what he tells them to do.
[2:53:25.920 --> 2:53:36.760]  And, you know, if I were advising him, I would suggest fire everybody and get a bunch of 25-year-old
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:43.880]  hardcore true believing loyalists and they'll figure out how to do whatever it is they need
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:49.440]  to do to do their jobs, you know, they don't need to have been at the FBI for 30 years
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:50.440]  to know how to do their job.
[2:53:50.440 --> 2:53:54.200]  I agree, look at Strach, he's a total mental patient, you don't want to, and I get Trump
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:53:57.480]  wanted navigators, like you get, you know, a Native American group to take you to Lewis
[2:53:57.480 --> 2:54:02.520]  and Clarkacross, he needs a few goblin guides here, but you just can't bring in all the
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:06.160]  swamp guys and think because you're sharing power, they're not going to backstab you, their
[2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:12.880]  nature is that they're all creatures of their system and so they're all complete backstabbers.
[2:54:12.880 --> 2:54:19.840]  Well, there's an old English television show that is very educational in this regard, it's
[2:54:19.840 --> 2:54:24.600]  called Yes Minister and then it was called Yes Prime Minister was the follow-up and the
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:31.640]  whole joke was that the elected officials had no power and that the bureaucrats spent
[2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:38.840]  their entire time doing exactly whatever they thought best and then convincing the minister
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:43.280]  that what they wanted to do was really his idea and that he had no other choice but to
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:44.720]  do what they wanted.
[2:54:44.720 --> 2:54:50.480]  So this is not a new concept, this is something that, you know, goes back decades.
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:56.640]  And so, you know, unfortunately, we've seen the price of that, we've seen the problem
[2:54:56.640 --> 2:54:58.160]  with that because-
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:03.960]  Totally arrogant nobodies in a culture of all sucking each other's tallywackers, I
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:09.960]  mean, that's what they do, it's just, it's a sick, sick culture of sycophantic nobodies.
[2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:18.040]  But I actually think that it's normal in a bureaucracy to sort of ignore the elected
[2:55:18.040 --> 2:55:23.440]  official who's only going to be there for a period of time and, you know, in some ways
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:28.680]  it might have been better if he'd gone back to the Andrew Jackson system of spoils where
[2:55:28.680 --> 2:55:32.320]  you bring your loyalists, get rid of all the bureaucrats and then you can, you know, get
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:34.040]  your agenda passed.
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:41.760]  So I think that what Trump needs to do is he needs to trust himself and he needs to
[2:55:41.760 --> 2:55:47.960]  stop assuming that you can convince people and that you can negotiate and that sort of
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:48.960]  thing.
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:49.960]  He just needs people that will do exactly-
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:52.800]  Look how he threatened to release the secret documents and they all started groveling.
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:54.840]  I agree with you.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:59.160]  What do you think the next 40 days they're going to try to pull, to try to derail this?
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:01.680]  Because they're really, I mean, if Cabinon gets confirmed, which I think is going to
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:04.800]  happen, they're going to go into meltdown mode.
[2:56:04.800 --> 2:56:07.000]  Oh, there's no question.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:12.400]  But I think that they're going to behave themselves to a certain extent because they genuinely
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:15.200]  believe in this mythical blue wave.
[2:56:15.200 --> 2:56:20.160]  And so they think that they're going to get a democratic house and possibly a democratic
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:23.560]  Senate and impeach him.
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:27.640]  And there is no chance in hell that that's going to happen.
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:28.640]  And I agree with you.
[2:56:28.640 --> 2:56:32.000]  You know, the insanity is going to continue to intensify.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:33.440]  And I think that's our biggest hope.
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:36.080]  I'm not glad they're going to do it, but I think they're going to go so far that that
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:41.600]  will counterman normal political reshuffling.
[2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:47.280]  But I think their extremism, their bullying will force the full realignment.
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:51.200]  I think the Democrats are a best ally.
[2:56:51.200 --> 2:56:58.280]  To a certain extent, but the problem on the Republican side is that they have not yet fully
[2:56:58.280 --> 2:57:03.040]  embraced the identity politics that they're going to have to embrace if they want to remain
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:11.360]  competitive, you know, running around anointing every black pseudo conservative that you can
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:17.360]  find and immediately handing them a show on Fox or a congressional district isn't going
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:18.360]  to work.
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:19.520]  It's never worked.
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:25.520]  And so what they need to understand is that the people who are for you are for you.
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:26.680]  People who are not are not.
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:28.440]  And that's the way it's going to be.
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:29.440]  Let's do five more minutes.
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:30.440]  I agree with part of that.
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:32.880]  But I got to tell you, so-called minorities are really seeing through this and they want
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:33.880]  freedom too.
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:38.200]  And a lot of our listeners are black, Hispanic, and they totally see through this crowd and
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:39.720]  they don't want to be in a racist America.
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:45.480]  They want a future for their kids, but I agree that there are plenty of races too.
[2:57:45.480 --> 2:57:47.800]  In Full Wars Life is launching its newest product.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:50.000]  We're really, really proud of it.

[2:59:49.920 --> 3:00:11.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:15.440]  Alright folks, Roger Stone's coming up in the next segment and then we're going to continue
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  on to midnight tonight.
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:19.120]  I'm going to be back tonight, basically seven o'clock on.
[3:00:19.120 --> 3:00:24.160]  We've got a bunch of big guests joining us this evening and we're just doing another live
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:27.240]  broadcast right up till midnight, defensive free speech.
[3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:28.600]  I'm not whining and complaining.
[3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:33.080]  I'm very, very thankful for all the listeners and the things you've done because you understand
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:37.520]  we're all in the same boat together, but man, there are so many Islamic stabbing and mass
[3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:43.120]  truck attacks, 100 people run into yesterday and Islamic rips in Germany going and just
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:49.520]  shooting people in clubs and just, it's insane.
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:56.280]  And I just look at the globalists doing this to America and Europe and they're just destructive
[3:00:56.280 --> 3:01:03.760]  weirdos, but then you look at Alexander Soros and Obama and then you realize just the type
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:09.160]  of existential hatred they have for everybody.
[3:01:09.160 --> 3:01:18.000]  I mean, these are nasty, nasty, nasty people, chaos creators who for whatever reason have
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:24.400]  this feeling that they're not part of America so they could conquer it and mess it up as
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:29.400]  bad as possible that they would somehow be big boys then.
[3:01:29.400 --> 3:01:32.320]  And so that's the point people really have to get into.
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:34.840]  I mean, look at this headline.
[3:01:34.840 --> 3:01:40.720]  Driver runs into a crowd of 100 children and teachers in Sweden and another truck attack
[3:01:40.720 --> 3:01:43.520]  in Germany.
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:47.960]  And it's like Sid Eakon said two years ago, he goes, the Islamic mayor of London, he goes,
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:48.960]  you'll just get used to it.
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:49.960]  And it's kind of true.
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:52.360]  It's like, oh, 100 acid attacks this week.
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  Oh, no big deal.
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:55.400]  Oh, another big Islamic child kidnapping ring.
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:56.400]  Oh, no big deal.
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:01:58.560]  Oh, no big deal.
[3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:01.040]  Just a driver runs into a crowd of 100 children and teachers.
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:02.040]  Yeah, no big deal.
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:03.440]  It's no big deal.
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:10.000]  MSNBC anchor Joy Reid sued for inciting hate mob against a refugee woman.
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:15.600]  Well, the media report about the harassment mob formed by someone on their side.
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.160]  And then I didn't know that Joy Reid put this out against some lady she called racist with
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:21.880]  no proof.
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:22.880]  You are a disgrace.
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:27.280]  I wish your children were ripped from you so you would understand the pain.
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:32.080]  You are a dirty white woman bitch, dear racist bitch.
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  It seems like your old, poor, evil soul never left the Hitler era.
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:37.560]  You're fucked by Soros.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:38.560]  What a waste.
[3:02:38.560 --> 3:02:39.560]  What an embarrassment.
[3:02:39.560 --> 3:02:45.360]  What a disgrace of a humankind to have people like you in the world who just want open borders.
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:48.360]  You're the kind of white trash that should be dragged into the town square and flogged.
[3:02:48.360 --> 3:02:51.760]  Well, I'm sure you like Islam then, lady.
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:53.600]  Your tongue should be cut out.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:54.600]  Leave this country.
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:55.800]  You're an absolute disgrace.
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.960]  I'm glad everyone in the entire world knows you're a racist piece of, you know what, you
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:04.920]  are effing and it goes on.
[3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:09.000]  Want out your life is probably becoming a living hell and you don't know how to handle
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  it.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  I can offer a way out.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.240]  You're a worthless human being.
[3:03:12.240 --> 3:03:13.640]  Go kill yourself.
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:17.560]  The best way to make America great again is to tar and feather sluts like you and ride
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:20.280]  them out of the country on a rail.
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:24.880]  She's still on Twitter, by the way, and it goes on here.
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.000]  She says, racist, you know what?
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.240]  Who the eff do you think you are?
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:37.480]  You are sick and twisted, females are going to tell you, and you'll end up in hell.
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:42.560]  You're a disgusting human being and if it wasn't for your voicemail being full, you would hear,
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:46.760]  I can't read any more of this, actually she's going to kill her and everything.
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:51.480]  They let the group of tech tech crews and his wife, who says kill the president, kill
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:55.600]  Pence, kill police officers, they let them operate on Twitter, but I can't, which, which
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:03:58.400]  is fine.
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:05.440]  But Jack Dorsey and all these people are a psychotic cult that are raping the Bill of
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:09.840]  Rights, raping the Constitution, funding all these radical groups, and of course they've
[3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:17.680]  got to pack a slew, you know, a whole line of women ready to come out and say whatever
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:19.480]  they want about Brett Kavanaugh.
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:23.320]  The truth is, everything they say about Brett Kavanaugh is what Bill Clinton and Hillary
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:29.280]  Clinton have been caught involved in, certified, not 35 years ago, but recently.
[3:04:29.280 --> 3:04:33.640]  We'll get Roger Stone's take on Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed.
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:40.640]  I think he will, and I predicted, you know, like in the Christmas story, that you would
[3:04:40.640 --> 3:04:46.920]  have three more accusers after Ford leading up to the hearings in confirmation, and I've
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:48.920]  been proven absolutely untrusted.
[3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:54.400]  But now it may be worse, maybe five million women will go public.

[3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:19.040]  This video will help you find minorities and tell them how much they hate white people
[3:06:19.040 --> 3:06:23.760]  and how white people are inherently evil and how Christians are inherently evil.
[3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:30.000]  I played the clip yesterday of the Democrat-Congresswoman saying, men, just shut up.
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  You're all guilty.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  Just shut up.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:35.200]  If a woman accuses you, you're guilty, even if it's 36 years later and there's all your
[3:06:35.200 --> 3:06:38.320]  witnesses say it didn't happen.
[3:06:38.320 --> 3:06:42.840]  And so I was getting into MSNBC anger, Joy Reed sued for inciting a hate mob, and I
[3:06:42.840 --> 3:06:47.440]  was reading quotes of her followers sitting at the point she did is she said the woman
[3:06:47.440 --> 3:06:52.480]  had harassed and done all these horrible things with child and yelled racist things at someone,
[3:06:52.480 --> 3:06:53.480]  which wasn't true.
[3:06:53.480 --> 3:06:57.360]  It just shows the insanity of all of this.
[3:06:57.360 --> 3:07:03.760]  So Roger, there's a lot to get to here today, and you've got Michael Avenatti, I always
[3:07:03.760 --> 3:07:07.080]  call him Avenatti just to be both joking around.
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:16.080]  You've got him now with another woman, you know, saying that Brett Kavanaugh ran trains
[3:07:16.080 --> 3:07:20.440]  on women or gang bangs, even though all his friends say he didn't even date girls, was
[3:07:20.440 --> 3:07:24.280]  a total bookworm nerd, his calendar shows he wasn't at any of these parties.
[3:07:24.280 --> 3:07:26.320]  They bring on another woman, another woman, another woman.
[3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:29.000]  So the first woman gets discredited, none of the witnesses say it's true.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  So it's another woman, another one.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.440]  We can see how they smoke screen now with a daily one.
[3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:36.040]  I said three more accusers by the time they have the vote.
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:40.280]  Now I've already been proven right today, it may ruin my record, I think more will come
[3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:41.280]  out.
[3:07:41.280 --> 3:07:45.320]  I mean, hell, they may have a whole sports stadium of 100,000 women all saying he gang-raped
[3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:46.320]  me.
[3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:50.640]  You know, he abducted me with a flying saucer and took me up and did it, and we've got to
[3:07:50.640 --> 3:07:51.960]  believe it.
[3:07:51.960 --> 3:07:59.720]  So I'm learning how we're all inherently bad, Roger, but Avenatti though, or Avenatti or
[3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:05.920]  however you say his name, the gerbil, the human gerbil, he is here telling us how the
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:06.920]  cow ate the cabbage.
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:11.400]  So what's your inside baseball on cabin on where all this is going?
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:17.560]  Well, Alex, your, your predictions have turned out to be exactly right.
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:23.400]  What's amazing here is, and I've been in American politics for almost 40 years.
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:30.240]  Is this entirely new standard used to be that no major news outlet, not the Washington Post,
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:37.520]  the New York Times, CBS, anybody would dignify an uncorroborated charge.
[3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:44.040]  Somebody who came forward and made an accusation but offered no eyewitnesses, no corroboration,
[3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:51.560]  no evidence, no proof, can't say when it happened, where it happened, what year it happened,
[3:08:51.560 --> 3:08:58.000]  but because of identity politics, we are now told that any woman who makes a charge must
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.640]  be believed simply because they're a woman.
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:04.360]  This is an absurdity.
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:11.440]  Now, Alex, I'm old enough to remember the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings when Clarence
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:19.080]  Thomas was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush, and you had
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:28.320]  very much the same hysteria around those hearings until Senator Arlen Spector subjected Ms.
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:34.240]  Hill to a withering cross-examination in the Senate hearings.
[3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:38.960]  By the way, they still teach that cross-examination in the law schools.
[3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:42.120]  It was so extraordinarily effective.
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:49.960]  What happened was her credibility was shredded, Clarence Thomas was confirmed, and went on
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:53.680]  to be an outstanding Supreme Court justice.
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:59.240]  Today, the Republicans in the Senate don't seem to have that kind of courage.
[3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:06.880]  They are, as I understand it, going to hide behind a woman prosecutor to do the questioning
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:14.800]  of a witness who again offers no proof or evidence of her charges other than her recently
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:15.800]  recovered memory.
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:19.720]  Well, she says the Kavanaugh didn't even rape her.
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:24.720]  She said he was at the thing with the spiking of the punch, and then girls had sex, so that
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:25.720]  means gang raping.
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:31.080]  Meanwhile, everybody else that knows Kavanaugh says, dude, Mr. Bookworm first in his class,
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:34.360]  the dude was not at parties, or they were parties.
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:38.400]  They were like, you read his, you read his, it's so sad, actually, in a cute way.
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:43.200]  And I was reading his, his calendars that even saved him, and it's like getting ready
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:49.080]  for daddy's birthday, and then I've got a study to get an A plus, and G Wilbur, you
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:51.760]  know, then I'm going to have some milk toast in the morning.
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:56.720]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, but I guess I think a lot of these women actually
[3:10:56.720 --> 3:11:01.080]  have probably been abused or something, but they project it that, oh, all men are rapists.
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:03.800]  So for the greater good, they're going to remember this.
[3:11:03.800 --> 3:11:07.880]  Well, I can remember the Loch Ness Monster raped me too, 36 years ago.
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:12.240]  Well, I think it's extraordinarily transparent.
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:19.400]  And then the irony of having Senator Richard Blumenthal on CNN last night with Anderson
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:26.680]  Cooper essentially calling Judge Kavanaugh a liar, Richard Blumenthal, a man who indisputably
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:31.680]  lied about serving in Vietnam, a country he never set foot in.
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:38.120]  A man who is a, who is a disgrace to the office of the U.S. Senate, a man who soils
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:44.320]  the memory of all those brave men and women who did give their life in that conflict.
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:48.520]  And then he has the, the Cajones to sit there with his straight face and call somebody else
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:49.520]  a liar.
[3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:53.560]  Well, Roger, that's a great argument, but, but, but what about funding the Arab Spring
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:56.480]  that enslaved hundreds of thousands of women and children to sex slavery?
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:12:01.120]  What about the Clintons and all their sex crimes, the Lita Express and Hillary's chosen
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:04.520]  job represent rich pedophiles that rape little girls and she brags.
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:05.520]  I knew he was guilty.
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:06.520]  Ha, ha, ha.
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:09.520]  He passed a lot of tech to show me that didn't work, but I knew he was guilty.
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:10.520]  Ha, ha, ha.
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:13.640]  I mean, and, and the stealing, the Haitian money and the, and the child running and just
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:14.640]  all of it.
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:16.320]  These, and the Vatican and all the crap.
[3:12:16.320 --> 3:12:20.720]  And then meanwhile you've got thousands of priests, admittedly raping kids in the U.S.
[3:12:20.720 --> 3:12:24.360]  No one gets in trouble and they say, oh, statute of limitations.
[3:12:24.360 --> 3:12:27.360]  It's only 15 years for child rape in Pennsylvania.
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:31.800]  And then meanwhile, 36 years, drunken parties, no proof, and it's the end of the frickin
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:32.800]  world.
[3:12:32.800 --> 3:12:36.920]  These people, it'd be like Hitler at Nuremberg shitting there as the main judge.
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:41.440]  It has no credibility because of who they are.
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:44.200]  And nobody seems to be willing to say that.
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:47.760]  That's the great irony here, Alex.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:54.280]  This is a fraud, but if this is the new standard, then I have no doubt whatsoever that women
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:59.000]  are going to come forward shortly and say, although they have no proof, although they
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  have no evidence, although they told no one, although they can't remember where and when
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:05.120]  it happened.
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:10.960]  I was sexually assaulted by Corey Booker or I was sexually assaulted by Eric Swowell.
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:12.960]  We're going to talk about it.
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:15.440]  You know, well, should they not be believed?
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:19.240]  Should they not be put on CNN to tell their story based on this standard?
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:20.240]  They should.
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:21.240]  That's right.
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:25.960]  There's no such an accuser, and this is hypothetical, but what would be the difference between such
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:29.840]  an accuser and these women who come forward to malign Judge Cavill?
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:32.080]  Well, we're innocent until proven guilty.
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:33.080]  We're innocent until proven guilty.
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:35.240]  Let's play a few minutes of Clarence Thomas as we go to break.
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:38.000]  We're coming up with a president talking about this being a con game, but here's a few minutes
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:39.480]  of Clarence Thomas.
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:41.800]  Do you have anything you'd like to say?
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:49.200]  Senator, I would like to start by saying unequivocally, uncategorically that I deny
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:56.960]  each and every single allegation against me today that suggested in any way that I had
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:05.880]  conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill, that
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:15.360]  I ever attempted to date her, that I ever had any personal sexual interest in her, or
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:19.960]  that I in any way ever harassed her.
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:29.040]  The second, and I think more important point, I think that this today is a travesty.
[3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:31.680]  I think that it is disgusting.
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:40.120]  I think that this hearing should never occur in America.
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:48.720]  This is a case in which this sleaze, this dirt was searched for by staffers of members
[3:14:48.720 --> 3:15:01.240]  of this committee, was then leaked to the media, and this committee and this body validated
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:09.080]  it and displayed it at prime time over our entire nation.
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:17.080]  How would any member on this committee, any person in this room, or any person in this
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:26.560]  country would like sleaze said about him or her in this fashion, or this dirt dredged
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:31.400]  up in this gossip and these lies displayed in this manner?
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:34.440]  How would any person like it?
[3:15:34.440 --> 3:15:37.800]  The Supreme Court is not worth it.
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.560]  No job is worth it.
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:41.840]  I'm not here for that.
[3:15:41.840 --> 3:15:48.440]  I'm here for my name, my family, my life, and my integrity.
[3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:49.840]  People smell the truth, don't they?
[3:15:49.840 --> 3:15:53.400]  Clarence Thomas didn't do a damn thing.
[3:15:53.400 --> 3:15:57.440]  Health care reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[3:15:57.440 --> 3:16:01.400]  keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the health
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:04.120]  care system has become a challenge.

[3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:12.840]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways

[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:02.680]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:06.840]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:13.920]  lights every day, but thanks to supermailvitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[3:19:13.920 --> 3:19:18.120]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[3:19:18.120 --> 3:19:22.280]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[3:19:22.280 --> 3:19:27.280]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:34.520]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:13.200 --> 3:20:20.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:33.200]  The fall of Venezuela has already happened, but the official fall is nigh.
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:37.200]  And Trump is weighing military intervention and getting South American backers.
[3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:42.200]  And I don't like military intervention, but this could collapse like dominoes.
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:45.200]  Like, I need a set of dominoes in here.
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:49.200]  We need to buy some to explain that Venezuela is just like seven or eight countries down.
[3:20:49.200 --> 3:20:52.200]  Right to us.
[3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:54.200]  They've already millions are exiting.
[3:20:54.200 --> 3:20:56.200]  It's a total collapse.
[3:20:56.200 --> 3:21:02.200]  And I think Alexandra Cortez should run down there because she says that's the model.
[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:07.200]  And it's so beautiful, so wonderful on communism works.
[3:21:07.200 --> 3:21:10.200]  Going back to Roger Stone, Roger, you know the president well.
[3:21:10.200 --> 3:21:12.200]  And I just think suddenly he has more energy.
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:13.200]  He's more aggressive.
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:14.200]  He's more impromptu.
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:15.200]  He's on fire.
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:17.200]  We're going to play part of a five minute clip.
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:20.200]  We talked about the con game of going up your cabinet.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:24.200]  But to me and him saying declassify stuff, they're trying to block it.
[3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:26.200]  But now Rosenstein staying.
[3:21:26.200 --> 3:21:28.200]  He resigned and he didn't tomorrow.
[3:21:28.200 --> 3:21:30.200]  Seems like so much is happening this Thursday.
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:35.200]  And I just smell and I see and I get the signal that more and more Trump's doing what he wants to do.
[3:21:35.200 --> 3:21:39.200]  And that is scaring the living hell out of the globalist.
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:40.200]  I completely agree.
[3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:44.200]  The president seems to have a new bounce in his step.
[3:21:44.200 --> 3:21:48.200]  And the breaking news is all breaking his way.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:22:03.200]  It's amazing how quickly those in the deep state rushed to dissuade him from declassifying the material surrounding the FISA warrants that were used unconstitutionally spy on the president's campaign.
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:06.200]  That's right, Mr. President, it's time for sunshine.
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:09.200]  Sunshine is the disinfected.
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:19.200]  These characters are so shady that they get the British to contact the president and say, oh, Mr. President, you can't declassify this material.
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:24.200]  It would harm your national security and our international relationships.
[3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:25.200]  No, Mr. President.
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:31.200]  It'll prove that the British were spying on you at the behest of the Obama Justice Department.
[3:22:31.200 --> 3:22:34.200]  Which you first broke at the Poletano and I, we all broke it.
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:39.200]  People go, that sounds crazy. I want to farm power because we spy on the Brits illegally. They spy on us illegally.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:42.200]  The Brits kill U.S. citizens. We kill their citizens.
[3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:46.200]  That's well-known spy craft with the special relationship.
[3:22:46.200 --> 3:22:48.200]  That's exactly right.
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:53.200]  Also, Alex, I want to remind people tonight about our global marathon.
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:55.200]  We're going to be on right up until midnight.
[3:22:55.200 --> 3:22:57.200]  I'm going to be there doing my part.
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:23:03.200]  This is going to be very exciting as we continue to sound the clarion call for freedom because there's a lot of good news.
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:09.200]  We now know, for example, according to the New York Post, that the president has an executive order
[3:23:09.200 --> 3:23:15.200]  demanding an investigation on the basis of antitrust into Facebook and Google.
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:22.200]  And quite obviously, Infowars is in the forefront of those conservative news outlets that are being shadowed.
[3:23:22.200 --> 3:23:26.200]  And by the way, I dropped the piece of the earth.
[3:23:26.200 --> 3:23:31.200]  I had law firms six weeks ago send those reports to the president through intermediaries.
[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:35.200]  That's one reason we were banned. So next month's news today, continue.
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:39.200]  This is, I think, the most important fight on the horizon.
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:45.200]  If there is no Infowars, then there is no one to sound the clarion call for freedom.
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:53.200]  There is no one to put into perspective for people, for example, that the accusers of Brett Kavanaugh have no evidence,
[3:23:53.200 --> 3:23:57.200]  have no eyewitnesses, have no corroboration.
[3:23:57.200 --> 3:23:59.200]  Can't remember when it happened.
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:04.200]  Well, Roger, if you said that I raped you 36 years ago with no proof, they'd laugh at you because we're men.
[3:24:04.200 --> 3:24:07.200]  Or if I said that, it's preposterous.
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:10.200]  Kavanaugh was a bookworm nerd.
[3:24:10.200 --> 3:24:13.200]  I mean, he has all the real witnesses.
[3:24:13.200 --> 3:24:18.200]  Everything they've done has fallen apart, but they keep leapfrogging to the next pile of crap.
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:27.200]  Yeah, it's really extraordinary because the politically correct nature of this Me Too movement
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:32.200]  means that if you're a woman, regardless of your lack of any evidence or proof,
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:35.200]  you must automatically be believed.
[3:24:35.200 --> 3:24:38.200]  That sets a dangerous new standard.
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  And I know a number of Democrats who could be subjected to the same exact type of accusations.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:49.200]  Well, here's the deal.
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:53.200]  I think they've crossed the Rubicon, and a lot of people are seeing this,
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:57.200]  and the Republicans are, we don't care if you have 100 women, but you'd see the bandwagon gang up effect.
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:24:59.200]  It was easy to predict.
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:00.200]  We're done.
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:01.200]  This is a load of crap.
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:02.200]  We're going to confirm him Friday.
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:04.200]  I mean, I think the Me Too thing has finally played out,
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:09.200]  especially when it's led by the famous lawyer of pedophiles, Hillary,
[3:25:09.200 --> 3:25:16.200]  and her big, ugly pedophile Crooked Johnson husband.
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:21.200]  Yeah, even the Democrats at this point probably wish that Hillary would just go away.
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:24.200]  The idea of Hillary Clinton coming out and saying,
[3:25:24.200 --> 3:25:27.200]  well, these women should be believed is ludicrous.
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:29.200]  What about Kathleen Willie?
[3:25:29.200 --> 3:25:31.200]  What about Juanita Broderick?
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:33.200]  What about Paula Jones?
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:37.200]  What about the numerous women sexually assaulted,
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:44.200]  bitten, raped, having him expose himself to these women?
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:54.200]  And that's why I said that he has a crooked male genitals is that the women before it was ever in the news said it literally turns and points straight down towards hell his father.
[3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:58.200]  So Bill Clinton has a very large male genitals, and they literally is deformed.
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:02.200]  I mean, he has a crooked broken, and that's how the women know.
[3:26:02.200 --> 3:26:10.200]  Yeah, the only thing I disagree about is I was under the impression from interviewing a number of his women victims that it was actually abnormally small.
[3:26:10.200 --> 3:26:12.200]  But points straight down?
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:25.200]  Yes, but you can go to the Clinton's war on women, which is available at the info wars dot com store right now to get the definitive story on Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults against dozens of women.
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:37.200]  And more importantly, the role that Hillary plays in hiring the nasty private detectives and the vicious lawyers to bludgeon these women to intimidate them to bully them into silence.
[3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:41.200]  Let's be clear, some people got beaten half to death.
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:49.200]  There is there is no question one witness was beaten so badly that even today he fears for his life.
[3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:53.200]  Well, did they break his legs and everything he lived next door to Jennifer flowers?
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  Yes.
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:26:59.200]  And the Jennifer flowers relationship was actually a consensual relationship.
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:12.200]  This poor bastard's problem is that he made the mistake of setting up a security camera in the hallway because somebody had been vandalizing his automobile and what he caught was Bill Clinton coming and going.
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:21.200]  Then one day three Arkansas State troopers showed up and they beat this man so badly that they left him for dead.
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:34.200]  Fortunately, he survived. It's all there in the Clinton's war on women available at the info wars dot com store right now at a terrific price of nine ninety five, which is much less than you can buy it anywhere else.
[3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:39.200]  Folks, I know you already know all this. Get the book and give it to the library after you read it.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:40.200]  This is how we win the war.
[3:27:40.200 --> 3:27:41.200]  About 100 people read it.
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:43.200]  That's how we win one mind at a time.
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:49.200]  We're going to break them up with Roger Stone or play some of Trump eloquently exposing this whole Kavanaugh situation.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:54.200]  But listen, everything's game changing and enforced or dot com.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:28:01.200]  So yes, I don't keep extending for three, four days to sail on X to because, you know, it's just oh, it's our last day.
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:02.200]  It's our last day.
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:06.200]  I have been so busy on air and so busy like a one legged man.
[3:28:06.200 --> 3:28:11.200]  And you know what contest that I have just not launched all the other big specials that we will launch tomorrow.
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:13.200]  They were meant to be launched today.
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:17.200]  This is the last day to get X to I've got to I've got to go do the specials right now.
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:19.200]  I'm going to shoot some ads for the new t-shirts too.
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:20.200]  So you'll see it all tomorrow.
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:26.200]  But part of the new specials that they did get out because I said this last week to the crew was 40% off brain force plus.
[3:28:26.200 --> 3:28:27.200]  Great deal.
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:33.200]  40% off secret 12 in full or store.com is the main site in force life.com is the supplements.
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:35.200]  40% off 50% off.
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:36.200]  Supermail vitality.
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:37.200]  This is the last run of that.

[3:28:52.200 --> 3:28:54.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:28:54.200 --> 3:28:58.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:28:58.200 --> 3:28:59.200]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:28:59.200 --> 3:29:02.200]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:08.200]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:31:53.200 --> 3:31:57.200]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[3:31:57.200 --> 3:32:00.200]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[3:32:00.200 --> 3:32:06.200]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[3:32:06.200 --> 3:32:14.200]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[3:32:14.200 --> 3:32:20.200]  To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[3:32:20.200 --> 3:32:26.200]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:30.200]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[3:32:30.200 --> 3:32:37.200]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[3:32:37.200 --> 3:32:43.200]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[3:32:43.200 --> 3:32:48.200]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[3:32:48.200 --> 3:32:56.200]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:32:56.200 --> 3:33:04.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:04.200 --> 3:33:16.200]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[3:33:16.200 --> 3:33:23.200]  Make ready to land our troops beyond the energy field and deploy the fleet so no one gets off the system.
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:28.200]  That's what the globalists want for America, but humanity is awakening.
[3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:30.200]  This is Info Wars.
[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:32.200]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:37.200]  Well, Bloomberg has to admit Trump is right a year later.
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:44.200]  We don't want to invade Venezuela, but I meant it when I said it, that it's collapsing in a domino effect.
[3:33:44.200 --> 3:33:49.200]  And my memory did serve that Venezuela is seven countries south of us.
[3:33:49.200 --> 3:33:56.200]  Can we go to the Geospatial Center, also known as Google and the CIA map, please?
[3:33:56.200 --> 3:33:59.200]  And there it is. Let's zoom in on the CIA map.
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:09.200]  There you see Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and then Venezuela.
[3:34:09.200 --> 3:34:15.200]  It's seven countries south of us. Five million people the last month have left.
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:24.200]  Tens of millions more are trying to leave. They put up emergency fences in Colombia and in other surrounding countries like Brazil.
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:33.200]  They even leftist governments have declared civil emergencies because people are fleeing what Alexander Cortez would have for America, communism.
[3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:41.200]  So here is Trump's Venezuela military option gains backers as millions flee.
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:52.200]  When President Donald Trump said a year ago, just like they're fleeing California, when President Donald Trump said a year ago, the U.S. was considering a military option for Venezuela.
[3:34:52.200 --> 3:34:55.200]  Hardly anyone in Washington thought it was a good idea.
[3:34:55.200 --> 3:34:59.200]  Again, I don't want military options, but it is a national security issue.
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:04.200]  Because Mexico and others have opened up a conduit, a corridor for anybody that wants to come up from South America.
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:20.200]  Today, as Venezuela slides towards dictatorship, they've been a dictatorship for 15 years, and collapse already collapsed, triggering a million strong migration crisis, which Soros is already in countries north of that setting up.
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:32.200]  Support for such a move is being discussed openly. The notion of using force to topple the government of President Nicolas Maduro is gaining adherence, although it remains a distinctly minority view.
[3:35:32.200 --> 3:35:40.200]  Now, I just say seal that border with the U.S. military. The wall is not even needed. Put 100,000 troops in the border. That should do it.
[3:35:40.200 --> 3:35:53.200]  And just let the heaven of Latin America descend into hell. Because everyone wants to get up here and then say, George Washington in America sucks and piss on everything and run around bitching.
[3:35:53.200 --> 3:36:01.200]  I think Californians and all the socialists should just run down there to Venezuela and just bash in your heaven.
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:07.200]  Or go to China where there's no welfare. Criticize the police. They cut your genitals off and murder you. Go work in an apple slave plant.
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:13.200]  It's okay because Tim Cook's gay. Hey, murder everyone. Hey, liberal.
[3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:20.200]  You know, I help censor everyone. That's what they're doing here. Little uncouth when I do that, but it's okay.
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:27.200]  Jack Pusovic, I was doing that on the street in D.C. I found this camera and he was just going like, yeah, at a certain point, I don't care.
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:34.200]  Okay, I'm having some fun here. But it's just like Tim Cook's like, I can kill whoever I want at play factories. I'm gay. It's liberal.
[3:36:34.200 --> 3:36:37.200]  I can censor whoever I want. It's gay. It's liberal.
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  Well, you're gay, so it's okay. If Hitler would have said he was gay, Tim Cook would be like, I'll Hitler.
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  I mean, like, oh my God, Hitler is so cool. Anyways, sorry. I'm getting a little bit too much into it.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:54.200]  There he is. Going back to Roger Stone. I mean, what do you make of the situation of Venezuela, Roger?
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:37:05.200]  You know, wait a minute. This is the socialist utopia. We were told that this was heaven on earth, that their system was so far superior to ours.
[3:37:05.200 --> 3:37:15.200]  People, there are no dogs left because people have hunted them all down to kill them for food. People are eating grass because they can't find anything to eat.
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:22.200]  No, it's an international emergency. And Donald Trump, in my opinion, has the courage to take a stab.
[3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:29.200]  And by the way, Venezuela used to be as rich as Argentina, like 100 years ago, richer in the US, 50 years ago as rich.
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:37.200]  They're the diamonds, rubies, gold, timber, oil. It's a frickin' paradise of resources.
[3:37:37.200 --> 3:37:45.200]  Yeah, there is no reason for the current situation given they're riches, particularly in the terms of petroleum.
[3:37:45.200 --> 3:37:57.200]  But this is what communism gets you. Alex, speaking of food, I do have to mention to you that on Monday night, I was invited out to dinner by a New York Times reporter,
[3:37:57.200 --> 3:38:06.200]  and he said that it was on him, which meant it was on Carlos Slim. And therefore, I took him to the finest steakhouse in all of South Florida,
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:13.200]  where I knew they had an incredible 48-ounce porterhouse that is just a thing to behold.
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:15.200]  Okay, I'm getting hungry.
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  And therefore, I ordered it. And I must tell you, I enjoyed every bite, but afterwards, it was really debilitating.
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:29.200]  And then I remembered, I had ordered a bottle of carnivore from themfors.com store.
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:35.200]  Let me tell you, this is now my new favorite product next to Brain Force Plus.
[3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:46.200]  You don't have the situation where this just sits in your gut and ferments. The enzymes that are used in carnivore help you to gently digest.
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:50.200]  You don't have like John Wayne with 45 pounds of undigested Hillary Clinton in your guts.
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:38:58.200]  I mean, it's exactly right. In this case, my digestive disease disappeared like that.
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:07.200]  This is a truly great product. And right now, $23.42 on a special price worth every penny of it.
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:17.200]  So the next time you're going to gouge Carlos Slim and hand him a restaurant bill of a couple hundred bucks for some of the finest beef in the United States,
[3:39:17.200 --> 3:39:20.200]  make sure you've got your bottle of carnivore first.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:23.200]  Why do you say beef? I'm getting really hungry here. What's the name of the steakhouse?
[3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:30.200]  It was called Mastro's Ocean House. This is a new place. It's just opened in South Florida.
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:34.200]  I know there's one in New York City. I know there's one in Washington, D.C.
[3:39:34.200 --> 3:39:40.200]  I must tell you, it was outstanding, but the best thing about it, it was being paid for by the New York Times.
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:45.200]  Well, it doesn't better than a glass of red wine, a big old juicy porterhouse, and a potatoes grottin' and some asparagus.
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:49.200]  But like I said, I got to get a driver when I do that, actual Uber or whatever.
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:55.200]  Because when I get home, it's like, boom, we're talking sleep for 12 hours when I eat a porterhouse.
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:40:01.200]  Yeah, it's called the food coma, but you can avoid the negative effects with carnivore.
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:05.200]  So this is, you can now add another satisfied...
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:15.200]  But you know what Bernie Sanders said. He said, when I go to the store, hundreds of different vitamins, 30 different deodorants, I don't need it.
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:25.200]  Too much freedom, too much diversity. Now, I never found a university, I didn't swindle, and I have three one million dollar homes.
[3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:29.200]  And they called for me to be banned on Twitter, Alex Jones, because he criticized me.
[3:40:29.200 --> 3:40:35.200]  But when we get in people's faces, when the anti-foot does and says they're going to kill you, then it's okay.
[3:40:35.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  So, let me ask you now, what do you think's going to happen with President Trump in the next 40 days, Roger?
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  Well, Alex, this meeting that he has with Rod Rosenstein, the rogue deputy attorney general, who most definitely has been exposed
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  for proposing to wear a wire in order to entrap the President of the United States to remove him under the 25th Amendment.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:09.200]  Remember that, folks, you heard it here at InfoWars first. It was not a joke. He was not joking.
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:14.200]  The New York Times story makes it clear that several of their sources asked, is this a joke?
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:16.200]  Andrew McCabe asked him, are you joking?
[3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  Sure, so what happens tomorrow to Ratstein?
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:27.200]  Well, that's an excellent question. There are three possibilities. One, he resigns. Two, he is fired.
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:35.200]  Three, he is allowed to stay. If the President chooses door number three and he's allowed to stay, I positively guarantee you
[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:41.200]  President Donald Trump will be impeached shortly after the midterm elections.
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  I mean, Rosenstein literally looks like one of those friend-toilet crystals. You've got the backstory on him.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:51.200]  Like, I heard he, like, covered up with a mafia. He's really corrupt.
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:59.200]  Yeah, look, his appointment is due to Wright's previous, the President's first White House Chief of Staff.
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:08.200]  Why you would appoint James Comey and Robert Mueller's best friend as your Deputy Attorney General is beyond me.
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:15.200]  This guy is a charter member of the swamp. He is a swamp creature through and through.
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:18.200]  He has stonewalled the Congress in their efforts to get at...
[3:42:18.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  Let me just be honest. I'm going to come out with it here.
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:28.200]  He gang-raped me along with Comey and Mueller a few years ago, 37 years ago, and they got me drunk on punch.
[3:42:28.200 --> 3:42:30.200]  You need to believe any accused, so...
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:36.200]  He has to step down now. Rosenstein, write me. He write me over and over again, and you have to believe me.
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:40.200]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic, folks, but we'll be right back.
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:44.200]  Oops, yeah, it's true that Rosenstein, I'm only dreaming, actually.
[3:42:44.200 --> 3:42:46.200]  I have a thing for friend-toilet crystals.

[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:33.200]  get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:37.200]  So go to InfoWordsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[3:45:37.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:49.200]  Unleash the SuperMail in you.
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:53.200]  SuperMailVitality.com.
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:57.200]  Just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing,
[3:45:57.200 --> 3:45:59.200]  and Survival Still X2 is the pure iodine.
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  No one else has this from deep-earth crystals between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:06.200]  It's very hard for me to get. It's the good halogen.
[3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:11.200]  But instead, they hammer you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine,
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  that literally fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it.
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:18.200]  Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse and carriage.
[3:46:18.200 --> 3:46:20.200]  Silinium is an electrochemical.
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:26.200]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:30.200]  So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo of those.
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  Just experience it for yourself. Why do you think they fear me so much?
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:36.200]  Very simple stuff. Filter your water.
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:38.200]  Yeah, I find myself some water filters.
[3:46:38.200 --> 3:46:40.200]  Best out there for the price.
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:44.200]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six months a year until we get more.
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:46.200]  I hope we get more. This is the last run it looks like.
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  SurvivalShortX2M4store.com or M4slife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:16.200]  Hi, Roger Stone here, hosting with me. It's Alex Jones, part of this broadcast.
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:18.200]  It goes all the way to midnight tonight. Stand with Trump.
[3:47:18.200 --> 3:47:19.200]  Stand with him for wars.
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:22.200]  Stand with America and the recovery.
[3:47:22.200 --> 3:47:24.200]  He'll go, oh, you're anti-government.
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  Yeah, I was anti-globalist once we got our government back.
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:30.200]  I'm pro-constitution. I mean, my God, we're all being persecuted for this.
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:33.200]  So Pigglestein, Rattstein, whatever you want to call him,
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:36.200]  they crap their bridges a week ago when Trump said he'd release it.
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:42.200]  Then they said, oh, have the Inspector General at the Justice Department look at it
[3:47:42.200 --> 3:47:44.200]  and then Trump's waiting to get that.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:48.200]  But Trump has the power. What are they so scared of, Roger?
[3:47:48.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  You've been saying for 20 months since he got elected, you said, look out.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  They've used illegal spying. They've done all this.
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  You've been proven right. Release the secret documents.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:05.200]  All it is is their criminal operation reporting back to Hillary.
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:08.200]  We already know what's in it. It's already in the WikiLeaks.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:13.200]  I mean, this is why isn't the Death Star firing weapons now?
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:17.200]  He needs to destroy them now.
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:22.200]  Because some of his timid advisors are taking the ridiculous position
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:30.200]  that declassifying these documents will somehow expose their sources and methods
[3:48:30.200 --> 3:48:32.200]  and threaten the national security.
[3:48:32.200 --> 3:48:35.200]  It was Hillary's secret server did that to the whole world.
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:40.200]  They're the globalists selling out America the Personnel Management Hack. Exactly.
[3:48:40.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  What declassification these documents will prove is that the Obama Justice Department
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:51.200]  and the Obama FBI used unconstitutional surveillance of the Trump campaign
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:55.200]  to first try to prevent his election and now try to negate his election.
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  And by the way, hasn't Obama looked like he's crapping bricks lately?
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  Well, because this is where it all leads to.
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:05.200]  What did the President know and when did he know it?
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  When will President Trump order Barack Obama's arrest?
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:11.200]  That's the only question.
[3:49:11.200 --> 3:49:14.200]  Well, sure, victory is pulling the lever.
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:17.200]  They only take his restraint and his detente, his weakness.
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:20.200]  He needs to pull the lever now.
[3:49:20.200 --> 3:49:23.200]  He needs to say, Fire it will, Commander.
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:25.200]  No question about it.
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:29.200]  That's precisely what I have written and said today.
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:31.200]  And it's what he needs to do.
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:33.200]  Do not be deterred by these quizlings.
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:36.200]  And notice, that's why they hate you and I and others,
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:39.200]  because we say attack, attack, attack, because we're on the right.
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  We have victory within sight.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:43.200]  We have them dead in the crosshairs politically.
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:46.200]  Fire! Fire! Yes!
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:48.200]  Plus it's what people want.
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:53.200]  And therefore their response is ban info wars.
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:56.200]  Get them off of Facebook. Get them off of Twitter.
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:49:58.200]  Get them off of every platform you can.
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  But if it's such a bad strategy, why do they want to shut up?
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:03.200]  Because it's the winning strategy.
[3:50:03.200 --> 3:50:05.200]  That's exactly right.
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:09.200]  No, they're afraid the President will see you or me or David Knight
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:13.200]  or Owen Schreuer or any other number of people here at Info Wars
[3:50:13.200 --> 3:50:16.200]  telling the truth and laying out what must happen.
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:18.200]  And that's the last thing in the world they want.
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:22.200]  See, that's why it was significant that the Rosenstein story
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:26.200]  was not published by, say, Breitbart News or the Daily Caller
[3:50:26.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  or even Info Wars.
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:31.200]  It's in the New York Times and it's triple sourced
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:33.200]  and there's no way to keep it away from him.
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:38.200]  There's no way for him not to know that Rosenstein is a weasel
[3:50:38.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  That's my question. Why would the New York Times expose one of their globalist operatives, Rosenstein?
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:48.200]  He's not the only one. Why did they burn him?
[3:50:48.200 --> 3:50:52.200]  Because they knew the President already knew in secret documents were coming out.
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:55.200]  So they wanted to have a controlled release.
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:51:00.200]  And I think maybe an early warning to try to dissuade the President from canning it.
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:03.200]  Right now what's going on, even as we speak,
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:09.200]  is a three-day effort to convince the President not to fire this weasel when they meet tomorrow.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:13.200]  Because if the President had taken action right after he read this story
[3:51:13.200 --> 3:51:16.200]  he would have canned this guy in record time.
[3:51:16.200 --> 3:51:19.200]  Who does he put in? Why does he put Judge Napolitano in?
[3:51:19.200 --> 3:51:22.200]  Well, he needs somebody that's confirmable.
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:30.200]  The rumor is a Southern member of the U.S. Senate who's a known Trump hardliner.
[3:51:30.200 --> 3:51:34.200]  I'm going to guess that that's Senator Richard Shelby from Alabama,
[3:51:34.200 --> 3:51:41.200]  the Senator from Alabama who isn't comatose or wasn't comatose, unlike Jeff Sessions.
[3:51:41.200 --> 3:51:45.200]  Although I would admit that that is a guess on my part.
[3:51:45.200 --> 3:51:50.200]  It's time to have an Attorney General who believes in the rule of law.
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:55.200]  In the meantime, if the office were to remain vacant,
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:59.200]  the two names, and there's some contentious about this,
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:04.200]  a lawyer named Panuccio who's the Associate Attorney General from Florida
[3:52:04.200 --> 3:52:10.200]  or Noel Francisco who is the Solicitor General confirmed by the U.S. Senate,
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:13.200]  either one of them would now be in charge of the Mueller investigation.
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:16.200]  And let's expand on this.
[3:52:16.200 --> 3:52:20.200]  You can smell death in the Democratic Party politically. They're a rotting corpse.
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:26.200]  All we have to do is make the right move right now and we will secure this country's future for a long time.
[3:52:26.200 --> 3:52:31.200]  Let's take a few minutes of the President, though, astutely breaking down the con artistry of Kavanaugh,
[3:52:31.200 --> 3:52:37.200]  the whole Kavanaugh attack and the con artistry of this system to destroy Kavanaugh. Here it is.
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:39.200]  Do you have some thoughts, sir?
[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  I think he's just a wonderful human being.
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:44.200]  I mean, I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done.
[3:52:44.200 --> 3:52:47.200]  It's a con game to play. They're really con artists.
[3:52:47.200 --> 3:52:52.200]  They're trying to convince, you know, they don't believe it themselves.
[3:52:52.200 --> 3:52:56.200]  They know he's a high quality person. They don't believe him.
[3:52:56.200 --> 3:52:59.200]  It's just resist and obstruct.
[3:52:59.200 --> 3:53:03.200]  They're playing a con game and they play it very well.
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:05.200]  They play it actually much better than Republicans.
[3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:08.200]  They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
[3:53:08.200 --> 3:53:09.200]  They don't know what the hell they're doing.
[3:53:09.200 --> 3:53:14.200]  They want to get rid of ICE. They want to get rid of law enforcement.
[3:53:14.200 --> 3:53:16.200]  They don't want to take care of our military.
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:20.200]  They want to raise your taxes, but they're good at one thing.
[3:53:20.200 --> 3:53:24.200]  They're good at one thing. That's obstruction and resisting and con.
[3:53:24.200 --> 3:53:27.200]  He's one of the highest quality people.
[3:53:27.200 --> 3:53:33.200]  You know what he said that really what he was focused on was trying to be number one in his class at Yale?
[3:53:33.200 --> 3:53:39.200]  To me, that was so believable. I understand college very well and I understand being number one in your class.
[3:53:39.200 --> 3:53:41.200]  And I understand a lot of things.
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:42.200]  Trump was.
[3:53:42.200 --> 3:53:46.200]  When he said that, I understood exactly what he was so truthful.
[3:53:46.200 --> 3:53:49.200]  And I think it came out. I mean, I hope it came out.
[3:53:49.200 --> 3:53:54.200]  But for the Democrats to be trying to make him into something,
[3:53:54.200 --> 3:53:57.200]  let's be nice about it, that he's not.
[3:53:57.200 --> 3:54:01.200]  He's a high quality person. He's a great intellect.
[3:54:01.200 --> 3:54:06.200]  You're also not seeing him on his footing. This isn't his footing. He's never been here before.
[3:54:06.200 --> 3:54:09.200]  He's never had any charges like this.
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:15.200]  I mean, charges come up from 36 years ago that are totally unsubstantiated.
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:21.200]  I mean, you, as watching this as the president of a great country,
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:24.200]  you must say, how is this possible?
[3:54:24.200 --> 3:54:28.200]  36 years ago, nobody ever knew about it. Nobody ever heard about it.
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:32.200]  And now a new charge comes up and she said, well, might not be him.
[3:54:32.200 --> 3:54:39.200]  And there were gaps and she said she was totally inebriated and she was all messed up.
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:42.200]  And she doesn't know it was him, but it might have been him.
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:46.200]  Oh, gee, let's not make him as the Supreme Court judge to consider that.
[3:54:46.200 --> 3:54:49.200]  This is a con game being played by the Democrats.
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:52.200]  Also, take a look at the lawyers.
[3:54:52.200 --> 3:54:56.200]  These lawyers are the same lawyers that have been fighting for years.
[3:54:56.200 --> 3:54:59.200]  They keep fighting. Take a look at the lawyers.
[3:54:59.200 --> 3:55:02.200]  And it's a shame that you can do this to a person's life.
[3:55:02.200 --> 3:55:08.200]  And I'll tell you, maybe even more important, who's going to want to go before this system
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:10.200]  to be a Supreme Court judge or to be a judge?
[3:55:10.200 --> 3:55:12.200]  Stop right there. He goes on.
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:18.200]  The terrorizing of everyone that's backed Trump almost disagree with the president here.
[3:55:18.200 --> 3:55:20.200]  Does it make you not want to?
[3:55:20.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  It's like Clarence Thomas said, this is all BS, but I'm here to clear my name.
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:24.200]  You're not making me back down.
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:27.200]  I don't want this judgeship, but you're not going to destroy me.
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:30.200]  And so they put us in this existential crisis.
[3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:33.200]  It actually, I think, makes us man up, Roger.
[3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:37.200]  And so I think there's going to be a big price to pay in 40 days.
[3:55:37.200 --> 3:55:40.200]  I think red wave, there's a seawall of election fraud.
[3:55:40.200 --> 3:55:43.200]  But I got level, man.
[3:55:43.200 --> 3:55:46.200]  I think we're going to see the House and Senate held.
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:48.200]  And then what happens if that's true, Roger?
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:53.200]  A, do you think having on this confirmed level be red wave, blue wave or a stalemate?
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:56.200]  And then what does the left do when they lose?
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:56:03.200]  This has stirred Trump supporting voters and those who voted for Trump in 2016 like nothing else.
[3:56:03.200 --> 3:56:11.200]  The story on page one in yesterday's New York Times by Jonathan Martin about why the Kavanaugh controversy is going to lead to a blue wave
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:17.200]  and why voters are going to be revolted by the Republicans treatment of women is total Bush law.
[3:56:17.200 --> 3:56:21.200]  Nonsense. His uninformed opinion based on nothing.
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:31.200]  On the contrary, as I move around, I find conservatives and moderates and pro-Trump voters angry and motivated to turn out
[3:56:31.200 --> 3:56:36.200]  because they're revolted about the character assassination against Judge Kavanaugh.
[3:56:36.200 --> 3:56:42.200]  And doesn't the censorship on social media make conservatives be sure to not just vote but get others to vote?
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:45.200]  I think it is a vital part of it.
[3:56:45.200 --> 3:56:47.200]  Look, you've got the senator from why he admitted.
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:51.200]  Doesn't matter whether any of the stuff of Kavanaugh is true, she says.
[3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:55.200]  He must, he must withdraw because of the charges have been made.
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:56:59.200]  No senator, you should withdraw. You should resign from the Senate.
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:03.200]  You've soiled yourself with inane comments like that.
[3:57:03.200 --> 3:57:09.200]  We have a system under which you are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:15.200]  The people who have excused Kavanaugh have no corroboration, no eyewitnesses, no proof.
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:18.200]  And it's getting obvious. All right, you'll join us tonight. We're going right to midnight.

[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:52.200]  Years ago, infowars life created the powerful Myko ZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[3:57:52.200 --> 3:58:00.200]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[3:58:00.200 --> 3:58:09.200]  Myko ZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:21.200]  Myko ZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[3:58:21.200 --> 3:58:33.200]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, poudarco bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
