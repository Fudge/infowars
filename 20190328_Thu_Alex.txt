[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted emblems,
[00:12.720 --> 00:17.600]  whether sought or un-sought, by the military industrial commentaries.
[00:17.600 --> 00:22.520]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[00:22.520 --> 00:23.520]  Dallas.
[00:23.520 --> 00:29.560]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.560]  It is a big idea.
[00:31.560 --> 00:33.560]  A new world order.
[00:33.560 --> 00:39.560]  It was almost as if we were planned in force.
[00:39.560 --> 00:41.560]  It's just hanging.
[00:41.560 --> 01:07.560]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:07.560 --> 01:18.560]  For many of us, police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[01:18.560 --> 01:20.560]  The city's global governance at last.
[01:20.560 --> 01:21.560]  Is it one world?
[01:21.560 --> 01:23.560]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.560]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:27.560 --> 01:29.560]  1776 will commence again.
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.560]  If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[01:32.560 --> 01:38.560]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:38.560 --> 01:46.560]  It's Thursday, March 28, 2019, and I am having a rare moment in my almost 25 years on air
[01:46.560 --> 01:55.560]  of victory, and of really savoring something big for myself, my family, your family, all
[01:55.560 --> 01:58.560]  of us together.
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.560]  I tend to be a pessimist, but I just got massive chills.
[02:03.560 --> 02:06.560]  But there's not just evil in this world.
[02:06.560 --> 02:07.560]  There's also good.
[02:07.560 --> 02:14.560]  And humanity's gotten so down into the depths of wickedness, killing already born babies
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.560]  now, the Democrats, that I believe the pendulum has stopped.
[02:19.560 --> 02:25.560]  The Democrats and other satanic forces are panicking, and now it's swinging back the other way.
[02:25.560 --> 02:27.560]  In fact, I know it.
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.560]  I can metaphysically feel it, and I don't think there's any way they can push it back
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.560]  the way they want towards their left-hand path.
[02:36.560 --> 02:42.560]  Now, it's still going to be a one hell of a war, but the initiative is on our side.
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.560]  Trump is doing all these really, really, really, really good things.
[02:47.560 --> 02:50.560]  He's just now gotten control of the executive.
[02:50.560 --> 02:52.560]  They weren't just calling him a Russian agent.
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.560]  They declared a national emergency, and Brett Hume said that a week ago.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.560]  Democrats just declared one.
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.560]  Obama declared one with executive orders, and they just didn't do what Trump said.
[03:02.560 --> 03:09.560]  Now, he was able to get around a lot of it, but now they're in trouble for the crimes they've committed.
[03:09.560 --> 03:15.560]  Their fraudulent investigation is the crime, and he's taken the gloves off against big tech censorship,
[03:15.560 --> 03:22.560]  everything, and my God always told me Trump was real, but I'm getting big, juicy chills right now.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.560]  I mean, the biggest ever, we are on the right path.
[03:24.560 --> 03:25.560]  This is exciting.
[03:25.560 --> 03:27.560]  Now, there's going to be some big curve balls.
[03:27.560 --> 03:30.560]  You just know we're going to wake up, you know, in five years, ten years,
[03:30.560 --> 03:33.560]  and there's a bio weapon that's been released, and hundreds of millions are dying.
[03:33.560 --> 03:36.560]  I mean, you can see that in the crystal ball. Historically, that's coming.
[03:36.560 --> 03:40.560]  Big wars. There's going to be societal breakdown, the smart phones.
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.560]  People are addicted to the GMO, the forced inoculations.
[03:44.560 --> 03:50.560]  There's a lot of evil going on, but humanity's waking up to it as all these hoaxes unravel,
[03:50.560 --> 03:54.560]  and we're getting our legs under us.
[03:54.560 --> 04:02.560]  We're not asleep anymore. The eyeballs are open enough, and so we've turned a corner.
[04:02.560 --> 04:08.560]  There's a few more corners to turn before we square this thing up, but I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:08.560 --> 04:12.560]  we are winning.
[04:12.560 --> 04:18.560]  It makes me incredibly proud of all of you and everybody else that we've reached this point.
[04:18.560 --> 04:25.560]  You can say that in the history of fights, we've won a war to get a real president in and to have a fighting chance.
[04:25.560 --> 04:32.560]  We've actually won a war. We've won the war, but it's like blowing the Death Star up.
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.560]  There's still going to be a lot of stuff coming our way after this, but we have won a major war,
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.560]  a deciding war if we press the initiative, if we press the attack.
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.560]  We have really done it. You have done it, but who do we think? Jesus Christ.
[04:48.560 --> 04:52.560]  That's who we think is Jesus Christ, Son of God.
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.560]  We think Jesus Christ. I thank you all for your prayers. Keep praying. It's working.
[04:56.560 --> 05:25.560]  And keep taking action.
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.560]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients,

[06:00.560 --> 06:09.560]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say,
[06:09.560 --> 06:17.560]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[06:17.560 --> 06:28.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.560 --> 06:34.560]  You know, it's a misstatement to call the listeners of this broadcast an audience.
[06:34.560 --> 06:43.560]  No, the awake activist souls who all bleed red blood and who all love their children and want to have a better future
[06:43.560 --> 06:52.560]  and who love God and love justice and love common sense and who love the right hand path, not the left hand path.
[06:52.560 --> 06:56.560]  I salute you.
[06:56.560 --> 07:06.560]  And I think it's time at a gut level, also intellectually, to announce that we have won a major, not battle.
[07:06.560 --> 07:10.560]  And this is a big idea. It's the truth, but I don't know how to codify it or quantify it.
[07:10.560 --> 07:16.560]  We've won a war.
[07:16.560 --> 07:21.560]  I'm going to make this announcement right now.
[07:21.560 --> 07:31.560]  We have not defeated the dangers of technology, the GMO, the AI, the Chai comms,
[07:31.560 --> 07:36.560]  and what's left of globalist forces and our own corruption and our own personal evil.
[07:36.560 --> 07:41.560]  God can come into our hearts and do that, but in the war for the David Rockefeller,
[07:41.560 --> 07:50.560]  Carnegie Endowment, New World Order government project for a planetary governance, they have lost.
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.560]  I think March 28, 2019 is a good day.
[07:54.560 --> 07:59.560]  You said they lost yesterday, they lost tomorrow. This is the line.
[07:59.560 --> 08:02.560]  The New World Order is dead.
[08:02.560 --> 08:12.560]  Globalism was defeated. And this audience of activists, you were the seed.
[08:12.560 --> 08:16.560]  You were the detonator.
[08:16.560 --> 08:23.560]  You caused the chain reaction with your activism, with your prayers, with your financial support, with your steadfastness
[08:23.560 --> 08:30.560]  to not just lead the United States out of this evil, but to lead the entire planet out of it.
[08:30.560 --> 08:37.560]  Globalism is failed. It's being overturned everywhere.
[08:37.560 --> 08:39.560]  It doesn't mean the old for rich haven't stolen all that wealth.
[08:39.560 --> 08:45.560]  It doesn't mean they're not going to continue to try to divide in Congress, but the world government project
[08:45.560 --> 08:52.560]  of the robber barons and of the British Empire and of the Council on Foreign Relations is dead.
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.560]  And the attempt to have us merge with Communist China will fail
[08:58.560 --> 09:01.560]  because once the big domino falls, the whole chain goes down.
[09:01.560 --> 09:09.560]  And once we're aware of the Chinese avarice and their Communist plans against us, they will never succeed.
[09:09.560 --> 09:17.560]  So we have a lot of big battles to fight and a larger war against evil and against our own weakness.
[09:17.560 --> 09:27.560]  But the war against the New World Order in its current configuration has been won.
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.560]  You know, you go back four years ago, they said if Hillary Clinton loses about a year and a half out from the election, a year out,
[09:32.560 --> 09:37.560]  they said world government will fail, the New World Order project will fail.
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.560]  They weren't just saying that.
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.560]  They already had nationalists in the elected everywhere. They could see the demographics, the numbers.
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.560]  And we've still got incredible challenges.
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.560]  The globalists, what's left of them are going full authoritarian and it's going to be rough.
[09:52.560 --> 09:58.560]  But their larger project is discredited. Their carbon tax project is falling apart.
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.560]  Their Green New Deal. Their operations trying to launch pedophilia as normal and good.
[10:05.560 --> 10:14.560]  That's falling apart. Still horrible. They're in a major offense, but that triggered their failure because they're crazed.
[10:14.560 --> 10:20.560]  They're rabid. They're fiendish.
[10:20.560 --> 10:26.560]  These globalists have to have power. They have to have innocence. They have to have children.
[10:26.560 --> 10:35.560]  And once people come to grips with just how evil and bad they are, there's no putting Virginia back on the bottom.
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.560]  So let me tell you what's coming up today.
[10:40.560 --> 10:48.560]  And then we'll go over it all, take your calls. We also have a guest joining us.
[10:48.560 --> 10:58.560]  But this is really momentous and I can go over how it happened and what Trump's going to do next.
[10:58.560 --> 11:06.560]  And that we really need to recognize that we're winning and that's why we're under so much attack and that we have...
[11:06.560 --> 11:13.560]  I'd use the cheesy analogy of the Terminator where Skynet's been blown up and defeated.
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.560]  So all they can hope to do is go back in the past and try to destroy the people that stop Skynet in the future.
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.560]  And I mean, it really comes down to something about like that.
[11:26.560 --> 11:35.560]  The globalists have been discredited and their main project defeated and the world's now awake.
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.560]  It doesn't mean, though, that the pieces of the chopped up snake still aren't a threat and still aren't an issue.
[11:40.560 --> 11:51.560]  But we need to go ahead and declare massive, decisive discrediting at an ideological level and at a financial level and at a national level.
[11:51.560 --> 11:55.560]  All across the world, they are having nothing but defeats.
[11:55.560 --> 12:02.560]  And it's important in the propaganda war to speak the truth when it's there and to declare them discredited and dead.
[12:02.560 --> 12:12.560]  Now, in their fit, in their death rows, they're going to be very, very dangerous.
[12:12.560 --> 12:21.560]  They're going to attempt, like, giant vampire squid to take those of us that they see as those that defeated them with them.
[12:21.560 --> 12:23.560]  I intend to not go with them.
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.560]  But if I get drug off down a hole with them, they can get my body, they're not getting my soul.
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.560]  So if they destroy me, that is not a defeat.
[12:32.560 --> 12:41.560]  And that's their tactic is to destroy Trump, destroy Alex Jones, destroy Tucker Carlson, destroy people and then go, oh, look, your leader's got destroyed.
[12:41.560 --> 12:44.560]  Folks are more sophisticated than that and they see through it.
[12:44.560 --> 12:47.560]  So Trump is preparing to go on massive offense.
[12:47.560 --> 12:48.560]  He's announced it.
[12:48.560 --> 12:49.560]  He's delivering.
[12:49.560 --> 12:51.560]  We've already seen major response from Google.
[12:51.560 --> 12:53.560]  I'll tell you about that.
[12:53.560 --> 12:59.560]  He's announcing offensive against the big state and he's announcing offenses against Smollett.
[12:59.560 --> 13:01.560]  Now, there's some troubling things with Russia and Venezuela.
[13:01.560 --> 13:04.560]  We'll get into that and so much more.
[13:04.560 --> 13:06.560]  But this is an incredible time.
[13:06.560 --> 13:09.560]  And you can also say that the corporate media is dead.
[13:09.560 --> 13:12.560]  They've been living dead with billions of dollars pumped into them from big corporations.
[13:12.560 --> 13:17.560]  But now they really are sinking into total oblivion.
[13:17.560 --> 13:19.560]  And the president's pointed that out as well.
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.560]  So that's all coming up.
[13:21.560 --> 13:29.560]  That said, though, don't get complacent because we may be destroying their project globally.
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.560]  But they're still in control of many things and are now going to get very aggressive because they're not giving up.
[13:34.560 --> 13:36.560]  They're going to try to intimidate us in a submission.
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.560]  That's why you've got to tell folks what the local station you're watching or listening to.
[13:41.560 --> 13:45.560]  You've got to spread the word about news wars.com and prison planet.com.
[13:45.560 --> 13:47.560]  They don't get censored as much.
[13:47.560 --> 13:51.560]  So it's easy for you to share those on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, all that.
[13:51.560 --> 13:53.560]  And say, here's the forbidden show.
[13:53.560 --> 13:54.560]  You're a free human.
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.560]  You're allowed to hear what they don't want you to hear.
[13:56.560 --> 13:57.560]  They say so bad.
[13:57.560 --> 14:03.560]  And remember, we have the big super mega sale that's going to have to end Monday or Tuesday
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.560]  because we've already sold out of a lot of the best selling products.
[14:07.560 --> 14:13.560]  We have a lot of the others still in stock, but with store-wide free shipping, 50% to 60% off all the supplements.
[14:13.560 --> 14:17.560]  A bunch of other huge specials, double-patriot points, that's 10% each dollar you spend.
[14:17.560 --> 14:19.560]  You get on the next order.
[14:19.560 --> 14:25.560]  I mean, a lot of these are lost leaders like the Super Silver Woon Gel and so many others.
[14:25.560 --> 14:27.560]  We're selling those at cost, the colloidal silver.
[14:27.560 --> 14:28.560]  But I want you to get it.

[14:46.560 --> 14:56.560]  Or the body's turmeric or things you're going to want to reorder like the Super Blue colloidal silver iodine fortified toothpaste without the deadly halogen fluoride.
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.560]  It's got the good halogen.
[14:58.560 --> 15:00.560]  It doesn't have the bad halogen.
[15:00.560 --> 15:02.560]  It's so good for your gums, so good for your teeth.
[15:02.560 --> 15:04.560]  My dad, a dentist, a neurosurgeon, designed it.
[15:04.560 --> 15:10.560]  Brain force plus 60% off, DNA force plus 60% off. Never done that before, but I want you to see how great it is.

[15:39.560 --> 15:40.560]  Okay, wow.
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.560]  Let me get focused here and just praise God and thank God for this.
[15:45.560 --> 15:47.560]  Keep praying, folks. It's working.
[15:47.560 --> 15:48.560]  And just try to be good people.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.560]  And that's all God wants to take action.
[15:50.560 --> 15:52.560]  God will take us the rest of the way.

[17:20.560 --> 17:27.560]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:27.560 --> 17:30.560]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:30.560 --> 17:36.560]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:36.560 --> 17:40.560]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:40.560 --> 17:43.560]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[17:43.560 --> 17:51.560]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[20:21.760 --> 20:42.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[20:42.760 --> 20:51.760]  We'll see the globalist problems multiplied, compared on out.
[20:51.760 --> 20:53.760]  This is the time when we know we've won the war.
[20:53.760 --> 21:00.760]  But as soon as you figure out you've won one war, realize it's got a whole other set of problems.
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.760]  And the very same globalist whose project is dead are still in power in many areas.
[21:06.760 --> 21:14.760]  What's their big project, as they saw it, is discredited in all its authoritarianism and in deep trouble.
[21:14.760 --> 21:17.760]  Here's an example.
[21:17.760 --> 21:23.760]  They passed in the European Commission this copyright act that basically bans free speech.
[21:23.760 --> 21:25.760]  It's totally draconian.
[21:25.760 --> 21:28.760]  Bans memes, bans sending a text link to an article.
[21:28.760 --> 21:32.760]  It's insane.
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.760]  And they got 15 members.
[21:35.760 --> 21:38.760]  They tricked them to think they were voting against it when they voted for it.
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.760]  And the Commission says, sorry, no redo vote.
[21:40.760 --> 21:42.760]  The way they had it written, it was so deceptive.
[21:42.760 --> 21:44.760]  That's how they operate.
[21:44.760 --> 21:49.760]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article on infowarstore.com detailing all that.
[21:49.760 --> 21:56.760]  We also have footage coming up of a so-called migrant ship out of North Africa, pirates,
[21:56.760 --> 22:03.760]  sending out distress signals and then boarding and taking a large freighter and robbing it.
[22:03.760 --> 22:05.760]  And the liberal media defends it.
[22:05.760 --> 22:09.760]  Oh, how loving.
[22:09.760 --> 22:16.760]  So now, again, the EU is trying to order ships to go save people with distress signals.
[22:16.760 --> 22:20.760]  And of course, the oldest pirate trick in the book is send out a distress signal,
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.760]  put out up a flag that you need help, and then you know what happens.
[22:25.760 --> 22:27.760]  That's another form of false flag.
[22:27.760 --> 22:29.760]  There are many false flags in naval history.
[22:29.760 --> 22:33.760]  The British coined the term false flag about 500 years ago.
[22:33.760 --> 22:38.760]  And there's probably more false flags than you could count on six or seven hands.
[22:38.760 --> 22:42.760]  But the most classic is a flag of truce.
[22:42.760 --> 22:48.760]  That isn't really a truce, a flag of SOS, a flag of we need help, and then you board them.
[22:48.760 --> 22:51.760]  A false flag just means a flag that's lying.
[22:51.760 --> 22:58.760]  If you fly a flag that you're not, let's say if you're German and you fly a U.S. flag, it's a false flag.
[22:58.760 --> 23:03.760]  But the media is taught everybody that a false flag, this means a purely staged terror event.
[23:03.760 --> 23:05.760]  No.
[23:05.760 --> 23:12.760]  When the Christchurch monster did what he did, he was said he was trying to cause a global race war
[23:12.760 --> 23:16.760]  to get people fighting, that he did it to create a crisis.
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.760]  And says, I'm not going to tell you who I really am.
[23:18.760 --> 23:24.760]  Well, he's telling you then it's a false flag.
[23:24.760 --> 23:26.760]  But not the type the media has dumbed it down.
[23:26.760 --> 23:29.760]  You know, I did popularize the term false flag.
[23:29.760 --> 23:34.760]  I brought it back into modern use in the vernacular in the last 20-plus years.
[23:34.760 --> 23:37.760]  But then they steal the term and simplify it.
[23:37.760 --> 23:38.760]  But I digress.
[23:38.760 --> 23:43.760]  You know, I see this segment because it's so monumental that when I have this much incredible good news
[23:43.760 --> 23:50.760]  and also bad news as well, I'm tendency to hold back because I just don't feel worthy to bring you this information.
[23:50.760 --> 23:54.760]  So the time we have in the shorter segment, long segment is coming up next.
[23:54.760 --> 23:55.760]  Let me just do it this way.
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.760]  Let me just tell you what we have in the stack.
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.760]  Trump has announced a major offensive against the globalist.
[24:03.760 --> 24:08.760]  We're going to get into exactly how he's already doing it and how incredibly good this is,
[24:08.760 --> 24:11.760]  but that they're going to strike back in a very, very nasty way.
[24:11.760 --> 24:22.760]  We've got all of that here, more than 20 articles that are all just incredibly important that I'm going to hit when we come back.
[24:22.760 --> 24:31.760]  And then I'm going to look at some of the bad news, and that is war with Russia.
[24:31.760 --> 24:40.760]  Trump says Russian troops must get out of Venezuela and all options are on the table to make that happen.
[24:40.760 --> 24:43.760]  That's up on infowords.com, a Michael Snyder article.
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.760]  Space sports between the U.S. and Russia will trap humanity on Earth no matter who wins, an analyst says.
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.760]  And then, of course, what I mentioned, MEP is tricked into voting wrong way, but EU refuses to re-vote.
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.760]  It's Paul Joseph Watson article on infowords.com.
[24:59.760 --> 25:07.760]  Then French drones patrol English Channel as migrant crisis escalates.
[25:07.760 --> 25:09.760]  Migrants an invasion, Islamic invasion.
[25:09.760 --> 25:11.760]  Migrants hijacked cargo ship that rescued them.
[25:11.760 --> 25:12.760]  I mentioned that.
[25:12.760 --> 25:13.760]  We're going to play the video with that in the audio.
[25:13.760 --> 25:14.760]  It's incredible.
[25:14.760 --> 25:18.760]  And then I mentioned this a few days ago, but never got to, but I'm going to today.
[25:18.760 --> 25:23.760]  Teens aren't socializing in the real world, and that's making them super lonely, depressed.
[25:23.760 --> 25:25.760]  It's upping suicide rates.
[25:25.760 --> 25:28.760]  All of that information.
[25:28.760 --> 25:32.760]  Your phone might be messing with your sleep and relationships.
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.760]  Slay the smartphones.
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.760]  And then something that really illustrates everything about the robot takeover.
[25:38.760 --> 25:41.760]  How it makes us stupid, makes us dumb, and also causes big problems.
[25:41.760 --> 25:44.760]  British airway flight was supposed to go to Germany.
[25:44.760 --> 25:53.760]  It went to Scotland because it was on autopilot and they gave them the wrong flight manifest of the computer from air traffic control.
[25:53.760 --> 26:00.760]  That's why when there's a glitch with these systems, there's all these crashes because the pilots don't know how to fly anymore, folks.
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.760]  Remember when landings and takeoffs were rougher, even if you had a great pilot?
[26:05.760 --> 26:14.760]  They're like, whoa, notice how smooth they are now, because it's a computer.
[26:14.760 --> 26:24.760]  And I'm telling you, folks, there ought to be a law that if we even in the future have driverless cars, or any of this, or robot planes, you've got to have a human.
[26:24.760 --> 26:27.760]  And half the time, they've got to fly half the missions.
[26:27.760 --> 26:29.760]  It just keeps us in the game.
[26:29.760 --> 26:32.760]  Every study shows that calculators have made us dumb.
[26:32.760 --> 26:35.760]  All of it is killing us. It's making us stupid.
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.760]  And they're great tools, but it's just got to stop.
[26:38.760 --> 26:44.760]  Being just rolled out as a monopoly, and then we have no relationships, and then people don't have kids anymore.
[26:44.760 --> 26:46.760]  And we have a world, a future.
[26:46.760 --> 26:48.760]  People don't want to go out hiking.
[26:48.760 --> 26:54.760]  Every study shows smartphones make you depressed, hiking in the woods, or the mountains, or the hills, or the valleys makes you happy.
[26:54.760 --> 26:56.760]  Having a garden makes you happy.
[26:56.760 --> 26:58.760]  It's a fact. It's who we are.
[26:58.760 --> 27:00.760]  That's coming up.
[27:00.760 --> 27:03.760]  So we'll be breaking it all down today.
[27:03.760 --> 27:05.760]  And then I got to get more into this.
[27:05.760 --> 27:13.760]  The new talking point from U.S. Senators and others is that I got this Sandy Hook father killed when he committed suicide.
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.760]  And they say that I'm terrorizing the families.
[27:16.760 --> 27:18.760]  I never said that man's name.
[27:18.760 --> 27:20.760]  That's coming up.
[27:20.760 --> 27:23.760]  But that's how they tend to get rid of the First Amendment.
[27:23.760 --> 27:25.760]  And they want to use Sandy Hook for that.
[27:25.760 --> 27:26.760]  It's very, very sad.
[27:26.760 --> 27:28.760]  They're using these poor families.
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.760]  It's just getting crazier and crazier and more out of control.
[27:32.760 --> 27:44.760]  And then, talking about Trump on the offense, Trump confirms FBI DOJ will probe outrageous Jesse Smollett case, which leads right to Barack Hussein Obama.
[27:44.760 --> 27:52.760]  And then Pelosi's floundering around, introduces new climate bill one day after Green New Deal collapses.
[27:52.760 --> 27:59.760]  Project Veritas, as a new incredible video out on infoworks.com, spread all these videos and articles, folks.
[27:59.760 --> 28:00.760]  It's a war.
[28:00.760 --> 28:09.760]  Project Veritas interviews victims of voter fraud, makes some major new findings, and then pedophile faints after receiving 260-year prison sentence.
[28:09.760 --> 28:15.760]  Well, shouldn't a rape that three-year-old, excuse me, that three-month-old baby?
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.760]  These guys all look the same.
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.760]  Shouldn't have raped the three-month-old baby or the two six-year-old girls.
[28:22.760 --> 28:26.760]  By the way, why is he not getting the death penalty?
[28:26.760 --> 28:27.760]  Seriously.
[28:27.760 --> 28:30.760]  I mean, a guy like this deserves to be beaten in the head with a baseball bat.
[28:30.760 --> 28:40.760]  Can you imagine just taking a big swing and tied up to a post and just taking that lower mandible off with a Louisville slugger just breaking all and then just bashing his brains out all over the place?
[28:40.760 --> 28:43.760]  I mean, that's a natural, visceral response, isn't it?
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.760]  Somebody raped a three-month-old baby, but the less like, that baby's lucky.
[28:48.760 --> 28:52.760]  Tell the governor of Virginia how this way they keep that baby alive and harvest those organs.
[28:52.760 --> 28:55.760]  That bunch of women would square in their seats and get really excited by it.
[28:55.760 --> 28:56.760]  Oh, shit, babies.
[28:56.760 --> 28:58.760]  Oh, I like that.
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.760]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[29:01.760 --> 29:03.760]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[29:03.760 --> 29:04.760]  PD stopped eating.
[29:04.760 --> 29:05.760]  All of his hair fell out.
[29:05.760 --> 29:07.760]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[29:07.760 --> 29:09.760]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[29:09.760 --> 29:11.760]  Crames, antibiotics, sprays.
[29:11.760 --> 29:12.760]  No results.
[29:12.760 --> 29:15.760]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.
[29:15.760 --> 29:17.760]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com.
[29:17.760 --> 29:20.760]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you've got to feed this hungry healthy.
[29:20.760 --> 29:22.760]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[29:22.760 --> 29:28.760]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.760]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.760]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[29:32.760 --> 29:33.760]  Her coat is not soft.
[29:33.760 --> 29:34.760]  It's silky.
[29:34.760 --> 29:37.760]  It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.760]  She's got life.
[29:38.760 --> 29:39.760]  She's got energy.
[29:39.760 --> 29:40.760]  Tons of energy.
[29:40.760 --> 29:41.760]  No more bad smells.
[29:41.760 --> 29:42.760]  Dynavite's the mom.
[29:42.760 --> 29:46.760]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[29:46.760 --> 29:48.760]  You know, besides me, of course.
[29:48.760 --> 29:50.760]  859-428-1000.
[29:50.760 --> 29:53.760]  859-428-1000.

[31:25.760 --> 31:32.620]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready and so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong
[31:32.620 --> 31:39.560]  Are you gonna really be able to face the other stuff because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are
[31:39.560 --> 31:43.120]  Also ready to fight you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back
[31:43.120 --> 31:45.340]  And I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen to me in the future
[31:45.340 --> 31:50.160]  I mean all I know is I want to go with the master built. I want to go to the next level
[31:50.160 --> 31:54.700]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced not these devil worshipers
[31:54.700 --> 32:01.560]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus and now through the end of March

[33:24.360 --> 33:29.240]  Info wars tomorrow's news today
[33:33.240 --> 33:38.840]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[33:40.920 --> 33:42.920]  Thursday March 28 2019
[33:44.800 --> 33:46.800]  Globalism is dead. It's still
[33:46.800 --> 33:53.800]  Operating in pieces, but it's main project is dead. We've won a major war against their carbon tax their global court
[33:54.080 --> 34:02.400]  Their TPP and they admit their own publications that their ideology is dead and failed. We have won a major war
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  Not a battle
[34:06.640 --> 34:12.440]  But a major war I think it's fair to say at this point I'm not declaring premature victory
[34:12.440 --> 34:19.120]  There's a lot of stuff to deal with even bigger crises coming down the road, but humanity is awake and the fight to get humanity awake
[34:19.160 --> 34:25.840]  Those that are gonna wake up is central to everything and we're winning that war. We've won the major war
[34:27.480 --> 34:31.920]  But there's a lot more to face obviously we're gonna open the phones up the next hour you disagree with that you agree
[34:32.200 --> 34:38.280]  Have we won the war against globalism the globalists admit their programs dead their world government project. Nobody's accepting it
[34:38.280 --> 34:40.280]  It's being reversed everywhere. I
[34:43.360 --> 34:48.640]  Think it's fair to announce the globalism as it's known as dead and the new world order is dead
[34:49.480 --> 34:51.840]  Now let's get into Trump on the offense
[34:52.320 --> 34:57.560]  Trump announced in a big Fox News interview yesterday major offensive against the deep state
[34:58.360 --> 35:05.520]  He said I'm going to go after them on their illegal wiretaps on their fake dossiers on how they try to manipulate elections
[35:05.520 --> 35:08.800]  on everything very very exciting and
[35:10.200 --> 35:18.680]  Taking action traditional watch sews for records of communications between Clapper John Brennan and CNN because we know now the dossiers
[35:19.480 --> 35:22.160]  Disinfo didn't just come from the steel and
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.320]  Globalist operatives in Russia it came from CNN the leftist intelligence op
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.520]  So they create the fake
[35:32.520 --> 35:40.120]  Background the fake info and then they put it the dossier and they report it like the dossier is independent
[35:45.800 --> 35:47.800]  Now continuing
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.800]  Trump calls on shift to resign
[35:51.360 --> 35:54.960]  For all of his fraud all of his lies and that's Trump on the offense
[35:55.480 --> 36:00.760]  Rachel Maddow's ratings plummet since conclusion of Mueller probe again
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.240]  They already had basically no viewers like a hundred thousand viewers until the election people got really interested and
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.560]  They got on average half a million viewers still not that big and
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.000]  Then now maybe their biggest shows two three million viewers and now
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.160]  That they've been proven to be total liars total frauds with all this breathless
[36:20.160 --> 36:27.040]  We're gonna lock up Donald Trump Jr. And we're gonna lock up Trump. They're all Russian agents. They are incomplete and total
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.360]  Freefall already down 19% just the last week
[36:33.480 --> 36:38.000]  Continuing fellow Republicans one house intelligence chief Adam shift to resign as well
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.160]  we'll play that clip in a moment and then we'll get into
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.200]  The most important part of the offense if we're gonna win because we're winning the war against globalists worldwide
[36:47.520 --> 36:51.160]  We're winning the war to get nationalists in but if we don't stop the censorship
[36:51.160 --> 36:54.960]  They could steal by fraud keep their people in like Venezuela does
[36:54.960 --> 37:00.240]  That's why this is the most critical point to get Daniel's article up on info wars.com
[37:00.720 --> 37:05.840]  Trump meets with Google's Sundar Pichai to talk about political fairness
[37:07.160 --> 37:15.800]  Is Trump finally tackling online censorship meeting was not scheduled. Well, he is he's the the the the incubation
[37:16.960 --> 37:18.320]  Center
[37:18.320 --> 37:20.320]  for all of this
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.640]  Is the colleges and that's where they get the SJW is trained for the same culture in quote Google
[37:27.040 --> 37:34.880]  Facebook and Twitter campuses and then it's just like a campus. They've got foosball. They've got beer. They keep them in that culture a
[37:35.640 --> 37:42.000]  Political correctness of group thing and so the executive order to pull billions out if they keep the censorship
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.480]  That's real action and then now what they're signaling with Google and more that's real action
[37:46.480 --> 37:52.760]  We're gonna be getting into that and and and not too late because Twitter is announcing a plan to ban the president off of Twitter
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.720]  Yes, they've begun the project to do that. But first
[37:57.640 --> 38:00.240]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.320]  That is very very important Trump promises to release
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.000]  The abusive FISA applications the fake
[38:08.560 --> 38:14.200]  Info off the fake dossier using CNN dis info that put the illegal warrants out
[38:14.200 --> 38:18.800]  To just legalize the already illegal spine that was going on here is
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.040]  Mr. President you have the ability to
[38:22.800 --> 38:28.560]  Release the FISA applications. There was the original application three subsequent
[38:29.720 --> 38:36.360]  Renewal applications. We are told Andrew McCabe said no dossier. No FISA warrant
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.040]  That was a backdoor to your campaign before the election
[38:39.040 --> 38:47.400]  The dossier also was leaked to the Washington Post parts of it and is a coffin David corn to the American people and of course never verified
[38:47.840 --> 38:54.960]  You have plans to release those FISA applications gang of aid information the 302s of bruce or and others and
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.360]  The five buckets that John Solomon's and Sarah Carter as they call them. I
[39:00.080 --> 39:06.320]  Do I have plans to declassify and release? I have plans to absolutely release
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.720]  but I have some very talented people working for me lawyers and
[39:11.360 --> 39:19.200]  They really didn't want me to do it early on Devin Nunes by the way and meadows and and you look at Jim Jordan and so many of
[39:19.200 --> 39:25.080]  The people that that were they worked so hard and a lot of people wanted me to do it a long time ago
[39:25.080 --> 39:28.120]  I'm glad I didn't do it. We got a great result without having to do it
[39:28.120 --> 39:33.160]  But we will one of the reasons that my lawyers didn't want me to do it as they said if I do it
[39:33.160 --> 39:40.640]  They'll call it a form of obstruction. So they'll say oh you release these documents. So we would make all of this information
[39:41.960 --> 39:48.280]  Transparent, you know in politics. You always hear transparency would make it transparent and then they'd call it obstruction
[39:49.040 --> 39:54.360]  Knowing the people we're dealing with so frankly. I thought it would be better if we held it to the end
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.800]  No, but at the right time we will be absolutely releasing and I did the right thing by not doing it so far
[39:59.800 --> 40:04.800]  But you understand they would call it something that it wouldn't be it's the only time you'd be transparent
[40:05.200 --> 40:08.120]  Where they'd say bad things about transparency
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.600]  And it was in January of 2017
[40:13.440 --> 40:21.520]  That we said there's illegal fiza court warrants illegal spy on the president. This will bring down the deep state. So next year's news
[40:22.520 --> 40:24.520]  Today ladies and gentlemen
[40:24.480 --> 40:28.120]  Now let's go to another clip here. It's representative Conway
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.040]  Seconding the president many others are chiming in saying congressman Schiff has no shame
[40:33.040 --> 40:38.800]  He's he's been at the heart of this fraud the heart of the fake dossier the heart of the attacks on the First Amendment
[40:38.800 --> 40:43.840]  Everything else. He's truly a monstrous person and he really should resign. Here's that clip
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.880]  Special counsel Mueller's findings are consistent with those of this committee as well as the public statements are various senators on the
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.120]  Senate select committee on intelligence
[40:53.120 --> 41:00.000]  Despite these findings you continue to proclaim to the media that there is significant evidence of collusion you further have stated
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.680]  You will continue to investigate the counter-intelligent issues
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.160]  That is is the president or people around him compromised in any way by hostile foreign power
[41:08.520 --> 41:14.280]  Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming the findings of the special counsel
[41:14.440 --> 41:20.960]  conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information
[41:20.960 --> 41:26.980]  Having damaged the integrity of this committee and undermine the faith in the United States government institutions
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.240]  Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as chairman of this committee
[41:32.360 --> 41:39.360]  Which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the US intelligence community
[41:39.360 --> 41:45.400]  As such we have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a commander consistent with your constitutional
[41:45.400 --> 41:52.320]  Responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as chairman of the committee this chairman this letter is signed by all nine members of the
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.440]  Republican side of the House but the other committee and I ask you to sit there be entered into the record of today's hearing
[41:58.440 --> 42:03.760]  We're gonna come back with his response in a moment, but this is the Trump offense. We have to clean up the swamp
[42:03.760 --> 42:07.000]  They're not gonna stop. They're not gonna just sue for peace and go away
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.360]  They're never gonna quit they believe they own and run the entire civilization. This is powerful
[42:12.360 --> 42:14.360]  We'll come back with the rest of it
[42:14.360 --> 42:16.360]  On the other side
[42:16.800 --> 42:24.800]  But this is just an incredible time to be alive and the crimes they've committed are so transparent
[42:24.800 --> 42:31.560]  They've been caught red-handed. It's not just our right to demand prosecution. It's our duty. It's not just the president's right
[42:31.560 --> 42:37.520]  It's his duty. It's not just the prosecutors and the courts and the
[42:38.560 --> 42:41.960]  Judiciary and the grand jury's right. It's the duty and
[42:41.960 --> 42:45.920]  And it's time to come back up for air. It's time to prosecute
[42:45.920 --> 42:51.920]  I mean shift is running around saying oh, he knows there's Russians and we're all Russians
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.400]  He knows he knows he's been proven to be a fraud part of the original fraud
[42:58.880 --> 43:00.880]  I've got some really good news though
[43:01.600 --> 43:09.680]  X-toos back the original X-toos deep breath crystal pure atomic iodine what you want in four store.com

[43:16.560 --> 43:17.880]  I thought X-3 is great

[43:22.840 --> 43:28.080]  It's sold a lot that people want original X-2 like I was resigned the fact we didn't have X-2

[48:14.080 --> 48:20.480]  So Trump has announced he's going on the offense. He's done it against the universities that are now
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.560]  Factories of Socialist and Communist brainwashing where no free speech is allowed for Christians conservatives
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.640]  libertarians nationalists or just anybody that deviates from the
[48:31.400 --> 48:32.680]  orthodoxy
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.240]  And he's announcing moves and meeting with Google that if they don't start taking action
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.400]  He'll have antitrust sanctions against them and
[48:40.400 --> 48:43.360]  Federal elections Commission action
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.080]  But I'm so proud of Texas because it just seems like nine times out of ten
[48:49.560 --> 48:54.800]  It's Texans which left of Texas still a great state, but now a colony of California many areas
[48:55.440 --> 48:58.120]  That stand up and really tell it like it is and
[48:59.600 --> 49:01.600]  Here is the video of
[49:02.400 --> 49:04.400]  Just yesterday
[49:04.400 --> 49:11.480]  One of the chief coup plotters for the coup against the president and the takedown of the election and the coup against the voters in
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.080]  This country who knowingly worked on the dossier who worked on the fraud
[49:15.800 --> 49:23.080]  Who tried to set up all these innocent people who had all their fake hearings and all their fake subpoenas and came up completely dry
[49:23.080 --> 49:30.320]  And who helped previously on the committee cover up for Hillary and her servers and real Russian money from uranium one
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.320]  Here is one of the chief coup plotters?
[49:35.400 --> 49:36.440]  Congressman
[49:36.440 --> 49:41.280]  Schiff they confronted by Texas representative Mike Conway
[49:41.280 --> 49:48.960]  It is powerful and it's what will bring down these tyrants is getting right back on their face with the truth their bravada their hutzpah
[49:49.880 --> 49:51.880]  Must be met with steel
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.360]  Resolve these people are cancer
[49:54.360 --> 50:03.760]  They're globalists. They hate the country. It's the Democrat operating system and these pseudo-intellectual slime bags have now met their match
[50:03.760 --> 50:05.040]  Here it is
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.560]  This chairman says prior to the inauguration of President Trump in January of 2017
[50:09.800 --> 50:17.080]  You've been at the center of a well orchestrated media campaign claiming among other things the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government
[50:17.480 --> 50:20.240]  Indeed before the appointment of Robert Mueller's a special counsel
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.920]  You're alleged during one of your frequent television interviews that there was quote more than circumstantial evidence quote of collusion
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.040]  But that you could quote not go into the particulars close quote
[50:30.320 --> 50:36.360]  You repeated your repeated public statements which implied knowledge of classified facts supporting the collusion allegations
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.280]  occurred at the same time
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.040]  Anonymous leaks of alleged intelligence and law enforcement information were appearing in the media
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.640]  These leaks were often sourced to current or former administration or intelligence officials
[50:47.640 --> 50:55.000]  Appeared to support the collusion allegations and were purported to be related to ongoing investigations of President Trump and his associates
[50:55.320 --> 51:02.440]  As you know the committee has long been aware of and actively engaged in intelligence oversight activities related to Russians malign activities
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.600]  As part of our duty to oversee the actions of the intelligence committee community
[51:06.600 --> 51:13.480]  We conducted a thorough investigation related to the 2016 Russian efforts to interfere in our elections this investigation
[51:13.480 --> 51:19.440]  This investigation included a review of the allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian
[51:19.720 --> 51:24.240]  The committee found no evidence that President Trump or anyone associated with the Trump campaign
[51:24.680 --> 51:27.880]  colluded coordinated or conspired with the Russian government
[51:28.360 --> 51:35.080]  Special counsel Mueller's findings are consistent with those of this committee as well as the public statements of various senators on the Senate
[51:35.080 --> 51:37.000]  Select Committee on intelligence
[51:37.000 --> 51:43.560]  Despite these findings you continue to proclaim to the media that there is significant evidence of collusion you further have stated
[51:43.560 --> 51:46.240]  You will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues
[51:46.360 --> 51:51.720]  That is is the president or people around him compromised in any way by hostile foreign power
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.840]  Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming the findings of the special counsel
[51:58.040 --> 52:04.600]  conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information
[52:04.600 --> 52:10.520]  Having damaged the integrity of this committee and undermine the faith in the United States government institutions
[52:10.880 --> 52:15.800]  Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as chairman of this committee
[52:15.920 --> 52:22.920]  Which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the US intelligence community
[52:22.920 --> 52:29.840]  As such we have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your constitutional responsibility and
[52:29.840 --> 52:35.880]  Urge your immediate resignation as chairman of the committee this chairman this letter is signed by all nine members of the
[52:36.560 --> 52:42.040]  Republican side of the House but the other committee and I ask you to sit there be entered into the record of today's hearing
[52:43.440 --> 52:47.920]  That is Americana that is America like a grizzly bear getting up on its hind legs
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  That is the solution they boldly try to steal the election
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.920]  They boldly illegally spied they then lied about it
[52:54.920 --> 53:01.520]  Then they look they all lied to Congress and Schiff was in there the whole time manipulating it. It's incredible
[53:02.920 --> 53:05.480]  We'll have some of Schiff's response here in a moment, but
[53:07.320 --> 53:13.360]  They stole the 2018 election top Google experts have come out computer scientists. It's been proven
[53:13.680 --> 53:19.520]  You've seen them gaming at all and if we don't move against them and against the big tech censorship
[53:19.520 --> 53:24.120]  They're going to steal the election and that's why they're still so damn arrogant
[53:25.560 --> 53:29.480]  But even Pelosi and even Maxine waters have said okay
[53:29.480 --> 53:32.240]  Let's move away from impeachment because they know it's unpopular
[53:32.240 --> 53:37.600]  But it's what they want to do and they are in a panic mode right now
[53:38.480 --> 53:40.480]  in a big way
[53:42.040 --> 53:44.680]  It's an incredible time to be alive ladies and gentlemen and
[53:44.680 --> 53:48.480]  We need to take action
[53:49.080 --> 53:53.760]  Against these individuals. We need to politically legally lawfully non violently
[53:54.440 --> 53:56.440]  But through the criminal justice system
[53:57.080 --> 54:00.320]  Go after them because they have they thought they were invincible
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.840]  They had the magazines that the newsweeks already printed up madam president the week before they said 98% chance
[54:06.840 --> 54:11.880]  She's gonna win that they think they're invincible and they can't believe it and now they're losing confidence finally
[54:11.880 --> 54:15.960]  They're starting act whipped, but chef because he's a ringleader
[54:16.640 --> 54:23.160]  It's putting on a confidence act because he knows he'll go to jail for what he's done using the FBI and intelligence
[54:23.680 --> 54:27.640]  agencies to try to take an election away from the American people
[54:30.040 --> 54:32.040]  Here is some of chef's response
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.440]  You might think it's okay that the campaign chairman of a presidential campaign
[54:38.440 --> 54:45.720]  Would offer information about that campaign to a Russian oligarch in exchange for money or debt forgiveness
[54:45.720 --> 54:48.040]  You might think that's okay. I don't
[54:49.840 --> 54:51.840]  You might think it's okay
[54:52.600 --> 54:55.360]  That that campaign chairman offered polling data
[54:56.400 --> 55:01.400]  Campaign polling data to someone linked to Russian intelligence. I don't think that's a pause again
[55:02.120 --> 55:04.040]  All that's made up all that flies
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.480]  But obviously there are Russians in New York and DC one time the Russian and one of the ambassadors came to a Trump event
[55:09.480 --> 55:12.840]  Was in the crowd of 5,000 people they go look a Russian
[55:14.440 --> 55:16.440]  It's crazy
[55:16.480 --> 55:19.080]  So that's all he they gave polling data
[55:19.600 --> 55:25.840]  To someone linked to a Russian the same committee has called me a Russian agent
[55:26.440 --> 55:31.720]  Total defamation no judge no jury. I'm not there. I can't face my accusers
[55:31.720 --> 55:39.280]  They just say in the judiciary committee and the intelligence committee and in the house armed services committee
[55:39.480 --> 55:46.560]  That I am a agent of a foreign power when it's Hillary and the globalist on the chai come
[55:46.920 --> 55:48.920]  tit I
[55:48.960 --> 55:50.960]  Can't listen anymore chef
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.280]  Spew his same old lies over and over and over again. It just makes me sick. I
[55:56.280 --> 56:02.960]  Want to get into how he's had the head of Google at the White House yesterday. I
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.160]  Know you're all sick heard about censorship. This isn't just the average person on Twitter or Facebook. Oh, I got censored
[56:08.160 --> 56:09.960]  You know, they're censoring that's admitted
[56:09.960 --> 56:12.760]  But it's how we take action. This is all the marbles
[56:12.760 --> 56:18.280]  And if we get the talking point out that it's all the marbles and how the president can legally lawfully go after him
[56:18.280 --> 56:21.200]  Which I've had top law firms look into we will beat them
[56:21.800 --> 56:23.800]  Why do you think they want me shut down? I
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.400]  Don't spend the money we get when you buy products
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.880]  For for lobbying in DC so that I get some government contract
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.920]  I just spend money with law firms and groups behind the scenes
[56:37.360 --> 56:43.880]  Creating blueprints for the White House. So everybody else is scared to do it to break up big tech to go after them to stop them
[56:44.880 --> 56:46.680]  You know big tech spy on folks
[56:46.680 --> 56:51.400]  Why do you think last year they wanted me banned and we're freaking out in the head of YouTube's having meetings going?
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.200]  I know we have to get Alex Jones off. We got him off and now what they're scared folks
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.120]  They're scared because I don't just act like I know stuff
[57:00.120 --> 57:03.400]  I spend all my time researching it and I know how to beat them
[57:04.560 --> 57:12.840]  So I'll say it again. However, you're listening AM FM TV spread the word in full wars.com for slash show the forbidden show free shipping store-wide

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.800]  I
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.120]  Love this part
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.120]  Hey, yeah
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.120]  All right, let's get back to the broadcast
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080]  Where should we begin here today I
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.640]  Want to be very clear
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.160]  When I said that we've had victory over the global government new world order
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:11.440]  Program their whole program shot falling apart wrecked the ultra rich that set up the globalist extraction system though
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.120]  Still have their wealth and power
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:19.640]  It's just that their system is falling apart around them and they're trying to organize a global collapse to bring us back under submission
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:26.360]  But they even admit that's not gonna work. So now they're basically evacuating to armored keeps and fortresses and redoubts in
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.160]  Tasmania, Kauai, New Zealand and
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.240]  Switzerland
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240]  Luxembourg
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.720]  Canada rural areas of Canada Wyoming, Montana
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.800]  And so when your enemy is going into armored dugouts and
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.920]  Basically signaling to their own minions that the war is lost you've won the war
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:59.080]  But you're left with the aftermath of the war and the nanotech the globalism the AI the corrupt big tech companies that are still there
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.440]  Believing they're God and they've got to be confronted. They've got to be dealt with so
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.560]  I don't know what you call this historically. It's it's kind of like beating the Nazis, but then you've got the Soviet Union
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.680]  And we've got ourselves and the corruption and just the problems and the breakup of the family and the smartphones
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.960]  destroying relationships and
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.960]  The mental illness exploding and the suicide. We've got a ton of problems. I'm not trying to be over positive here
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.440]  But the globalist admit if Hillary loses, we're gonna lose the world government
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.240]  Then they said if we can't get Trump out and his credit nationalism, we're done. Well, you know what by your own yardstick
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.760]  Your own white papers hitting the panic button. You are up the creek without a paddle
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.320]  And so I want to open the phones up for listeners and just get your take on
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.600]  Trump getting ready to go after big tech going after the brainwashing the universities
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.440]  Going after the Smollett fraud going after the FISA warrants
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:04.520]  Going after the illegal investigation. I mean he is taking action and the Democrats are scared and even Maxine waters is
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  Taking off her wartime, you know
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.240]  Outfit and is now saying. Oh, no, let's all be friends
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:19.120]  But just think of this arrogant group that have been in power so long with the neocons and with the Democrats
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.840]  they thought they were invincible and that's what makes them so dangerous is
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.120]  that they're just a bunch of
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.160]  Scenile crazy globalist
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:34.920]  Ally with a bunch of crazy drug addict devil worshiper tech heads
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.800]  You know all the drugs they're on and then a bunch of weird globalist money and sorrows
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.960]  There's almost 90 years old and his weird-ass kid Alexander and just just you people can't run jack crap and
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.600]  Then you think you're gonna terrorize people like me
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.440]  We're just gonna put our tail between our legs and run off into the woods or something
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960]  You got nothing coming man
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600]  You're not putting any of this back together again
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.040]  Best thing all you can do is just disappear. You're not gonna do that
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.320]  So the real fight is about to start
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120]  The real fight is on and
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.640]  We should talk about the aftermath of the collapse of the Rockefeller world government
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.720]  Rockefeller British Empire World Government project Cecil Rhodes is project
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.540]  Carried out in the last century by David Rockefeller is dead
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.440]  Cecil Rhodes plan is dead
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.560]  And now we had ill of the chai comms and the Dunyan globalists in your area, but you should understand folks
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560]  They've been trying to demoralize you
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.520]  No, we've broken their back, but we can't let them claw us into hell with them
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.480]  I'll give the number out. We come back news wars.com info wars.com
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.360]  Do not spread the links do not tell people about the show David Rockefeller. Thanks you from his grave

[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.200]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalist
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.000]  It is you the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bully that stood against the peer pressure
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.960]  That stood against the threats that have now changed the world
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960]  And that's why you've been on the team
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.680]  Supporting us praying for us and spreading the word you are the info war and now because of their intensifying

[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:24.040]  I got to tell you the fact that we're having victory after victory all over the world against the globalist is really exciting
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.760]  But it takes my energy level to a whole nother plane
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.120]  Where we had looked at the other big threats against humanity and
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.160]  As soon as we deal with this globalist threat we enter a whole new phase
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.720]  And remember we'll still be facing globalist, but their project of world government as we know it is dead
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.560]  So I get rid of cancer though. It might come back might have a test of science
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.340]  We got to watch real closely a lot of their big challenges
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.720]  You agree with me about that you disagree well just a month ago
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.960]  I wasn't gonna give up on Trump, but he just wasn't taking action against the deep state enough. He wasn't fighting censorship
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.840]  Now he's doing it in royal flush splendor and
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.640]  The system is totally panicked. How are they gonna strike back? Those are big questions. I want to hear your human intelligence
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:16.320]  I want to hear what at a gut level an instinctive level and a cerebral cortex and subconscious level
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:22.800]  What you believe is gonna happen next the toll-free number for longtime callers first-time callers callers that disagree
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:30.680]  Whatever the case is eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:37.880]  Is the toll-free number to join us eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine on this Thursday, March 28
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.880]  2019 global Transmission
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:47.880]  There's a lot of other big meat and potatoes issues I've got here incredible clips audio so much but
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.880]  The fact that the Pentagon came out and called out Google for treasonously working with the chai comms in it
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.680]  through a secondary area and then the chairman said actually they're doing it directly and
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:08.040]  You got Trump summoning unannounced Sundar Pachai who used to be arrogant wouldn't even show up to Congress
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.080]  Just six months ago just five months ago. He'd tell Congress
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:16.400]  I'm not coming then he had to go to Congress and couldn't even find his way into the hall because I was in his face
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:23.040]  Saying you're an enemy you work for China. We're gonna expose you stop the censorship. You're not invincible. We're away
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:30.240]  And a few months after that. He's summoned to the White House and told you better stop meddling in elections
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.720]  You better stop not being fair or we're gonna break you up and Trump said it went well
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.600]  You think about that how far we've come and Trump signed that executive order to those universities
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:46.400]  So we're gonna pull your funding any time you violate people's rights who are on campus
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.240]  Who are visitors who are speakers who are student groups and?
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360]  Now he's talking about doing it
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.880]  with big tech with government contracts and
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.880]  Boy, suddenly
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.280]  Sundar was asked to come to the White House last year wouldn't do it Sundar sure showed up this time didn't he?
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:13.000]  Because we're winning against the globalist we're winning against the traders that sided with China. That's the globalist globalist just means trader
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:21.800]  There were tax exempt offshore that raise your taxes to transfer it and government contracts and other things offshore to them. They're just criminals
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:28.360]  Who'd ruin the whole world where where? They're all so godless none of them have kids literally almost none of them have kids
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.560]  And then they all are just going to live in armored fortresses on hilltops
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.800]  And they know the mercenaries they've hired want to kill them
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.800]  And so they're trying to hurry up get robots that'll protect them
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:48.480]  So they can all be prisoners of their trillions of stolen goodies up in the armored fortresses redoubts keeps
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.480]  strongholds
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080]  Castles
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400]  Fortified command bases
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.920]  Refuge
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:10.000]  When the real refuge is being altruistic and a renaissance person and really building strong societies and strong people and watching others excel past you
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.520]  That's your security for the future is is creating a climate of good people
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.520]  climate
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.520]  The west
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.520]  The west is the best
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.400]  And it's going to do the rest
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.000]  The west is the best
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  The west is the best
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.760]  The west is the best
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.360]  And she's going to do the rest
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  If we take our destiny
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.880]  Our destiny in our hands and hold it to us and then commit to it and then sacrifice for it
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.920]  And the minute you start sacrificing you go, this is sacrificing
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:00.480]  I can hold air into my lungs. I can see so far now. I have discernment god doesn't give traders discernment
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  They get fallen knowledge of evil how to lie how to cheat how to steal all these twisted virus laden cancerous
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.520]  But testicizing deformities not the vision of the most high
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.160]  The quiet place of the most high
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.560]  The understanding the purity the eternals of it all
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.600]  So trump accuses
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.880]  Google and others manipulating the elections. Well, he needs to go after him for that judicial watch sews for records of
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.120]  Communication between james clapper john brenn and cnn fixing the fake dossier
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:42.400]  They're all going to get in big trouble and you have to drop the hammer and we finally got a president that will drop the hammer
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.760]  As the leftist ratings continue to plummet
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.640]  And as the head of google is summoned there, but here's an example
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.440]  We showed you last week and we showed you this week and then everybody went and did it
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.440]  You go to youtube and type in alex jones
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:06.960]  And you'd get your old all anti alex jones news and you click this hour today this month all the same fake results
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.080]  But if you did democrats you would get all new results
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  There's so many frauds there
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.880]  Everybody's searching alex jones. It sends it to john oliver. It sends it to steven cobear. It sends it to whoever
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.440]  And
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.000]  Is your democrat though? It's the latest real result. Well, the word is that went to the white house
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.880]  and lo and behold
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.440]  Couple days after we showed that over and over again
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.920]  google put it back to normal
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:44.960]  Where have you actually searched this hour? Let's show people if you can they're watching on tv anybody go to youtube type in alex jones
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  and click this hour
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.040]  Or today or this week or this month and you'll get whatever the top videos were
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040]  For this hour
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.600]  Or the last day you can click it you see let's click last hour
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.000]  And as you can see their stuff just minutes ago
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]  Coming up with our videos
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.960]  But they just wouldn't let you see anything anybody else was seeing
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:22.160]  They were blocking and only sitting into the establishment. Well, guess what? We had a platform to show
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.600]  Millions of people and they had the back off. That's why they don't want us here
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.800]  That's why they don't want you to be able to comment. That's the new thing google and youtube last week and last month
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.760]  Several times have said we want to get rid of
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.600]  comments
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.160]  Or if you have mean comments on your video, we will ban you or demonetize you
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.880]  You're like, well, that's somebody else commenting not me. Well, that's like the soviet union your neighbor does something wrong
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880]  So you got a shell
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.600]  proof youtube corrects alex jones results have for him for worse calls out game to algorithm
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.800]  They totally broken the number one video site in the world and they're doing it everywhere and then denying they're doing it
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.800]  They had to stop
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.240]  They had to quit it
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.400]  They had to back down because it was so ridiculous, but that's what scares me. Why was it info wars noticed it?
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960]  A few weeks ago
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.160]  Why do we have to hammer it to get it fixed? And it wasn't for other people. It was for conservatives
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.920]  That are nationalists and it was that was it all the leftist everybody else worked just fine
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.840]  They just go in create a list of 50 videos that are anti whoever
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.480]  Anti-inclinical
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.160]  Whoever anti-inculture anti alex jones anti
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.000]  Michael sabbages was was rigged anti tony robinson. So that's all you get
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:53.200]  Because you heard the head of youtube going. Yeah, I hate it. You know when people's kids go find alex jones or jordan peterson
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.160]  They go
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.480]  They're like, well take them down. Well, we have taken alex jones down, but we're we're working on jordan peterson
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.680]  You see, what do you do just show anti jordan peterson stuff?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.720]  from selected approved people
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.720]  totally rigged
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.920]  Here's another one instagram is investigating. This is business insider talk about shameful
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:18.080]  This isn't satire by the way instagram is investigating an alex jones post that has stoked
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.800]  anti-semitic hate in the comments
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800]  Nothing about jews in the post
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.040]  Nothing about anything to do with race or religion
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.960]  And but oh a few comments called me an israeli agent. And so that's me stoking
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.800]  Anti-semitism is anti-semites probably leftist posing with fake comments. They call it smoliting
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.200]  Doing it. But see now the comments are bad now. I'm anti-semitic because people claim I work for israel
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.760]  That's right
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.440]  So I've got to be taken down because the jew haters don't like me says
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.120]  business insider and media matters run by jordan soros

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.760]  Instagram is investigating an alex jones post that has stoked anti-semitic hate
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.400]  in the comments and
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.760]  They never show you the evil art in the article, but we've actually got it hanging on the wall out there
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.840]  So maybe we can queue up the video that I titled smulleting

[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.840]  But then you find out
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.160]  The anti-semitic comments are against me
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440]  So that's the next level
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.240]  Even though i'm not even jewish
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.040]  And then they lie and say i'm not supposed to be on facebook or anywhere
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.920]  What happened is the media created an illusion that I was banned on facebook and instagram
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.400]  They just took two of my pages down saying I violated the rules there, but left the other pages up
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.800]  But there's this illusion you see that i'm not allowed anywhere. No one's allowed to even interview me
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.520]  I've been unpersoned so that senators
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.680]  Can sit up there and lie about me on tv. We'll get to that too and then your phone calls
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:31.520]  But here's a little uh montage of some of the latest demonization and lies against info wars
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:37.280]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten alex jonesa 5 1776 will come
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.720]  If you're proud to take off firearms that man is alex jones. He's one of those guys who believes a big foot was responsible for 9 11
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:54.320]  I've heard of that alex jones so I know him joe alex jones alex jones alex jones alex jones alex jones alex jones
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:01.120]  From info wars info wars you watch info wars info wars dot com info wars dot com info wars
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.320]  info wars till clinton is a rapist info wars dot com
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.400]  clinton is a rapist info wars dot com
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:18.560]  That's according to website info wars info wars. It's a radio show hosted by alex jones alex jones. Nice guy info wars dot com
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.760]  info wars info wars info wars info wars
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.680]  What's happened with info wars? I would love it if you would follow up also about alex jones and info wars alex jones
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.880]  Obviously is a well known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bully. You didn't call me to testify in america
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.920]  I have a right to fix my accusers and you congressman doge are a liar and a fraud. I know we had
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.160]  alex jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:48.400]  We're talking about alex jones and the fact of the matter is is that the companies that allow people like him
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:56.800]  Conspiracy theorists to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility info wars founder alex jones is calling out alleged collusion between google
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:04.560]  And democrats shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the first amendment info wars just lost their war on info
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:12.160]  Yesterday apple itunes vimeo and spotify youtube twitter and facebook have all blocked alex jones and info wars
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.360]  Who is the most banned news network in the world info wars comes to mind alex jones
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.080]  Which has now been taken off the facebook thank god he then waged a long campaign against jones
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:28.560]  It worked jeff supper silence and deep platformed his show. It was a stunning defeat for free speech
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.320]  Hello, this is hank hill, and i'm telling you what you need to listen to alex jones
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.680]  so
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.040]  When you read this instagram article and a bunch of others out
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.640]  It'd be like if you were writing a science fiction
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:57.200]  Kurt vonnegut novel about a police state in the future where you don't have free speech because of what somebody else does
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:05.280]  Instagram is investigating an alex jones post that has stoked anti-semitic hate in the comments
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.840]  And then it goes on to say well, he's been banned everywhere except on a few sites
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.480]  He's getting bigger on those so we need him banned
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.080]  And then it talks about a mural
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.720]  Put out by mere one
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.960]  Called false prophets
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.960]  And then it's just an image of a bunch of globalists sitting around a table
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.880]  Controlling the planet with toxic waste shooting up behind them. We showed the image earlier. Maybe we'll show it again now
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.120]  but
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120]  They then discuss it to say well
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.000]  The artists had done a street mural in england
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:52.640]  But the leftist groups got involved and they had it taken down and they had a member of parliament who said it was good art
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.800]  apologize
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  And say it's deeply anti-semitic
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.800]  And then when you look at the image that's a print of the mural
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.960]  There's there's nothing to do with jews. They just inject that
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.400]  Just like they said peppy the frogs are nazi hillary said that
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.080]  Or they say i'm a sandy hook guy harassing the families never happened
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.880]  They just it's it's the media that creates the hysteria and creates all the problems
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.320]  And so they go on and say yes the work of art is super evil
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120]  And elvish jones posted it
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.120]  And then there was anti-semitic remarks and then you read the actual remarks that were on there
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.200]  They even quote them. It's that i'm a Zionist shill because i'm not anti-israel
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:40.240]  And they say well facebook banned alex jones last year. So we need to go ahead and have him banned off here. Why is he here?
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:48.480]  No, they didn't ban me off facebook even if rob reiner says so they took two of our pages down saying i'd beat up a 10-year-old kid and that wasn't true
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.920]  It is twilight zone, but let's go out to break with this clip of the connecticut congressman
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.960]  chris murphy
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.080]  Saying that because a sandy hook father committed suicide that i terrorized him and i killed him
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.080]  But showed at google and others
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.960]  So this is the new way they're going to try to get rid of the first amendment. Here it is
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.840]  Well, listen, i mean i'll use his name. We're talking about alex jones
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:19.200]  And the fact of the matter is is that the companies that allow people like him conspiracy theorists to be able to purvey lies have a
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:26.640]  Responsibility um, there is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.560]  Of mass tragedies like alex jones did for so long. The new town families are proceeding
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:35.600]  With a court case to try to hold him accountable
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.760]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense this garbage to be spread out over the internet
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:49.040]  Have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of info wars
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.560]  I wish
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560]  That these
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.760]  Parents could
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:28:01.360]  Um that these parents could shut it all out. Um, but they can't um, they cannot and some of them
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:08.320]  Have frankly turned uh to chasing down these conspiracy theorists as a full-time job because they see it as their
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.200]  Responsibility to make sure that everyone knows what happened to their child and think about
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:20.960]  How that sort of second victimization works when every so let's stop right there. This is totally made up. It's the media
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.000]  Hyping hyping people that questioned it forever
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.440]  And making it the top story and then they're saying we're doing it
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.680]  And then misrepresenting what we said before what we're saying now
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.240]  It's just incredible. We cannot allow alex jones or anyone else who's conservative on the internet. They are victimizing
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.120]  People by bringing it up and saying it didn't happen
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.760]  And that's not what's going on
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:49.440]  Chris murphy is victimizing the sanitary families christ murphy is a degenerate lying democrat pig
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.720]  And it's a threat to this country other i fact stay with us

[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:25.920]  Defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.320]  Ladies and gentlemen the left tried their
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.760]  Trump was ever gonna win
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:43.760]  Then they tried trump's a russian agent. We're all russian agents and then they tried we're all racist
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.400]  And then they tried we're gonna try to steal all their health care when obama cares went to bankrupt things and bring in socialism
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.000]  The zealom annual admitted that on fox news the architect of it
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.920]  The other architect said thank god we're so dumb gruber
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.240]  And then they lied to us about cavadoff all these fake women most of admitting it was fake and they staged it
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:06.320]  Then they had jessie smollett getting busted in the cabana
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040]  Kids being set up by the media
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.600]  Americans get what's going on
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.240]  But I gotta tell you something
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.880]  I've been persecuted. I've been lied about I've been attacked a lot. I'm going to your phone calls in a moment
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:25.120]  And it hasn't been enjoyable at one level, but it's kind of like that saying pain is weakness leaving the body
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:30.960]  I have done thousands of print interviews thousands of radio interviews
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.240]  Thousands of tv interviews literally thousands
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.120]  And I've also been there at events and seen what happened cut and dry
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.640]  And then seen them
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.280]  edit video edit audio and lie
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.480]  And I've seen the corporate press
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.920]  In unison put out lies together
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.760]  The most censored places in america are universities and journalism schools
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.560]  major journalism
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.240]  and law clinics
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.280]  from
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.960]  university of texas
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.480]  to georgetown
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.480]  in washington dc
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:12.480]  Work around the clock to end free speech
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440]  They work around the clock to end journalism
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.120]  They're followers
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.920]  But that's the good news. The bad news is is they're bad
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.160]  And the reprobating are not coming back. The good news is
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.960]  That they're followers. They all do the same thing. They all act the same way. That's a strength, but also a weakness
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.000]  When you realize they can't think on their own and all they can do is stage stuff and lie
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  And then they think we're like them
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.720]  With the sandy hook family's lawyers the sandy hook folks are nice people, but they're lawyers
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.760]  Literally think I'm the homeland character
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.280]  They think I'm being given orders of what I say. They believe there's like manuals and things
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.160]  Uh, where where it's it's some formula because that's what they do
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:08.160]  They get walking orders. They get told what to say. They don't believe I'm up here on air
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:16.720]  I've had national news here many times and they always come in and are looking and they watched her in a live show and they started asking the producers
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:21.680]  Where's where's the teleprompter? We know there's a teleprompter. Who's telling him to say that?
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Can you imagine that?
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.960]  They keep asking in texas and in connecticut they go give us the marketing for sandy hook
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.560]  We don't market a news event. We have products. We sell to fund ourselves and sponsors
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.800]  That's marketing and then the news is either us covering what's happening or sometimes breaking news
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:51.040]  But again when your people like that that are such followers
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.400]  They all work in unison. They all pair at the same garbage like the us senator
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880]  chris murphy
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.840]  Who just lied about me and a lot of everybody else saying take us all off the year. We're terrorizing people till they kill themselves
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:15.440]  With no evidence. He gets to say these incredible defamatory things. Am I invited on msnbc where I'm accused of of of of killing people
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.160]  No one remembers adam lands his name. You'd think I killed the poor kids at uh
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:31.280]  At uh, San Diego you think hell he just said I killed this dad
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:35.520]  What are they going to do next?
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:42.000]  That senator is an enemy of the american people. He's the enemy of the free press. He's the enemy of the truth
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.280]  There's anti-semitic comments against me
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.280]  Calling me all these names because I'm not anti-israel
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.040]  You'd turn that over to palestinians and in a week it'd be civil war forever
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.400]  No, the arab countries take any of the quote palestinians in
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.400]  Saudi arabia takes zero ladies and gentlemen
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.800]  Why are you anti-israel? It's just it's just mental illness. It's just it's just it's like this weird online
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:10.240]  sacrament that all the in cool people are
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.280]  Up to right wing left wing
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.480]  And then I'm being called all these names
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.440]  And then I'm being called all these names and then
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.640]  All these newspapers and publications go. Oh look
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:26.800]  He's got an anti-semitic picture up which isn't even anti-semitic has nothing to do with it
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.480]  and
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.480]  There's anti-jew comments
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.320]  Well people have the right to say those anyways. I don't agree with it, but they're attacking me
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.480]  Let's see. They think you won't go actually see what happened
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:47.440]  So now powerful men in smoky rooms around the world is their monopoly table
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:55.440]  Is jewish according to business insider according to media matters who are projecting that those are jews and making it jews
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.920]  I guess to create
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.360]  Anti-semitism
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.600]  I don't know
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  But it just shows how
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.480]  Anti-free species people are all right, we're going to go to
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:23.680]  Chris and Tom and Jacob and Jack and Corey and Carlos and Robert and Zach and Fred and Eden and

[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]  That would be
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.760]  Hmm
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:02.240]  I guess been holding the longest would be Justin and then Eden Justin in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Welcome
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.920]  Hello, Alex welcome
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.400]  I wanted to ask you a question
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.600]  about
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.840]  the race of race specific bio weapons you had mentioned in
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.000]  In the past about meetings that have been going on and been taking place behind the closed doors
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.840]  About what they're planning it like with the 12 year
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.880]  Uh world's gonna end scenario all that
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.880]  Well, they're introducing into the cultural cosmology that humans are bad deserve to die
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.880]  And they're creating a race narrative to hate ourselves and not have a life force or a survival instinct
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.480]  To invert that instinct into an anti-human loathing
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.960]  So we accept the mass culling as a prophecy when it begins to take place
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.800]  Hence aOC being told to say there'll be no humans in 12 years
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:58.160]  And so that is on the drawing board in some of their previous blueprints would to be exterminate 98 percent of humanity
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.240]  by
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.120]  2030
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:07.520]  Which should be less than 12 years 11 years. Those are different blueprints that David Rockefeller and others have publicly talked about
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.880]  Prince Charles's father
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.880]  Has just has talked a lot about it Prince Philip
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.200]  Ted turners talked a lot about me. That's that that's in their blueprint. And then yes, they've had race specific bio weapons for a long time
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.560]  Uh that say you can release a weapon that'll kill
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.000]  98 percent is usually the top with these weapons of the of the blacks
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.120]  So they've got bio weapons. They're tailored for blacks
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.320]  Um, but the problem is everybody also has some of the same basic genetics
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.760]  So you you'd still probably get five ten percent more than europeans would die
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.520]  Of course, I'm not for killing any of the blacks, but you see the whole extermination program of the abortion
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.120]  But but but
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.000]  Let me try to explain this like if you want to create a bio weapon to kill Arabs
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:55.600]  Well, that that's got a problem too. We'll wrap back and we'll we'll talk about the real world of bio weapons
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.480]  By leaps and by bounds
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800]  The number one best-selling
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.040]  Supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:22.400]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.360]  But burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.440]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.160]  Healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.440]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:43.840]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in the fruit juice or water whatever you'd like
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.960]  Warning though, it's very very strong. It lasts up to 10 hours
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:53.600]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.080]  turbo force at m4slife.com
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.040]  The globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.600]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.200]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.200]  So you can make your own decisions
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.240]  They want you to believe you're powerless
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:20.640]  But the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.640]  And and what we say and what we do that changes the world. We are the power structure
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:31.280]  We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers and the globalists
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.040]  Understand that and they understand
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.920]  That they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.880]  Now to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.880]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of march
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.480]  We're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50 off m4 store.com something everybody should take advantage of
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.840]  You know, the worst part about getting old and i'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.600]  So I need to make them strong now now. I can be there for my children now
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.040]  I can make them strong now. I can instruct them now
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.520]  I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.680]  You think of this digital age your words going forever, but now they're even better getting rid of what you said
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:24.320]  They were before it's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.760]  But I have joined my will to the resistance
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.880]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right and the long as the people know the truth
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:39.440]  And you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.360]  For there is a magic that then takes place the trends in space and time when you commit be a word of mouth
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:51.120]  Or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing

[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.840]  Go
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:27.040]  You can't come inside if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:34.880]  All right, we got a lot of really good questions from the callers. We don't really screen your calls when you volunteer
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.880]  What your point is to put it on the screen?
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.120]  Dion wants to talk about jessie's smaller situation only vindicates info wars
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.680]  Eden I want to talk about people
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.840]  waking up as the answer
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:49.200]  Fred wants to apologize to alex for that neutrality
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:55.600]  Trump should ignore the polls and go with his gut that's zack robert lives on reservation. They have contributed
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  Uh against trump
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.640]  Carlos they are regrouping for the next assault
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.040]  Corey big tech is going after trump. Yeah, jacob how to win the info wars the next phase of attacks
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.200]  That's jacob tom in texas. We need to take back
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.480]  What we've lost trump is doing it and then steven michigan trump rally tonight in grand rabbits
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.760]  Well, we're gonna have our reporters
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:24.480]  We're gonna have live coverage tonight at news wars.com and info wars.com of that unfolding with katlyn benet and more
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.480]  So stay with us for that
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.000]  The caller hung up but here's the problem
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.440]  Somebody calls in about something i'm like race specific bio weapons
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.280]  And it's bad to kill any group or race the people
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.560]  But the problem of the people that produce the weapons is humans are all interrelated
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.160]  So you might tailor a weapon that'll kill the majority of one group. It'll also kill a bunch of your group. It's kind of like
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.880]  Nerve gas you can fire it at your enemy move the wind changes that comes and gets you
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.080]  That's why the globalists have all built these bigger underground bases
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.880]  So they'll survive during this and their main plan you see it in james bond movies like moon raker
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.440]  And things written by mi6
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.720]  Ian fleming
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:10.160]  Is is that they're going to release a bio weapon and call the population to save the earth
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:14.160]  And they're kind of doing it through the vaccines through the gmo's through the food
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.280]  All of it is kind of culling us now
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.280]  But
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.440]  South africa developed in israel's developed in the uk's developed in the us has developed them as of 50 years ago
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.200]  Other countries have undoubtedly developed them. You know, the chinese have developed them
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:40.000]  And so it's kind of a mutually assured destruction situation and we should do a whole show sometime on race specific bio weapons
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.120]  And the really advanced weapons that are out there because that's a that's an issue that people should discuss
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.480]  Uh, let's go to deon in california on jesse schmollett. Go ahead. Thanks for holding
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:53.760]  How you doing alex? I'm on the road. I'm a truck driver
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.840]  and um
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.200]  I'm from california big trump supporter, uh
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.800]  great big fan of uh everything you guys do there for wars and uh, and I and I buy your products too
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.720]  so
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:16.800]  Anyways, what I wanted to share was I I think I'm kind of glad the uh, how this guy got off in a way
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:20.800]  And and this is and this is why I want to point out. It it just goes to show
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.920]  Anybody who watched that story?
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.320]  I don't care where you're at on what side of politics you're on. It's just
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:37.360]  Completely obvious the corruption in the system. It's just it just blatantly right there for everybody to see and it vindicates you and everybody
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.360]  an alternative news
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:45.120]  That's been talking about the nonsense has been going up and building up to create division in our society
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.760]  When it's these people that go out
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.280]  They create they create the problems and then they try to be the ones that come up with a solution for the problem
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:58.560]  That's the galleon dialectic and listen obama's famous. He got caught with soros trying to cause race wars
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:05.120]  Four or five years ago that it all came out and and so this is what they do and then of course his lawyers are involved
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.120]  Up to their necks in it
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:13.600]  So and now trump is is demanding a federal investigation, but imagine being so corrupt
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:20.400]  This kim fox that she said she recused herself, but she didn't recuse herself and then she does this
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.280]  Don't they know this is going to just bring more scrutiny on him. It shows how entitled these people are
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:31.440]  It it really does but I think I'm happy though because I feel like this is the opportunity
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.560]  For everybody to like take a deep breath
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.560]  Say a prayer, you know, I always I always ask God to give me guidance and anything
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.080]  I think about or do because I don't want to react emotionally to anything
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.720]  but I want to I want to be clear headed and
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.600]  Based on facts and and whatever our laws are and and I mean and I hope people in the FBI
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:52:00.720]  Deon we're losing your phone, but good points. It shows the democrats entitlement
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.320]  That they can do whatever they want because they've had the justice department so long that
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.520]  It's just crazy
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:13.040]  Small it is now saying it really happened and bashing the police
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.160]  When they've got all the proof open and shut it's
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:23.680]  It's like catching somebody in the act of strangling a woman. You got the video of it everything and they say I didn't do that
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.080]  I mean, it's it's just
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:28.080]  It's like walking in and a guy's on top of your wife
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:32.560]  Or clearly having sex you see the man having sex with your wife
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.680]  You say hey, you're having sex and they go. I'm not having sex with your wife and then they complete the sex
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:43.520]  Imagine that image. Hey, can you sit out for a minute while I finish here? I'm not having sex with your wife
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.040]  You're like, I can see it. You're doing it. No, I'm not
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.680]  It's like what?
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.200]  You're absolutely right. It's as they lose power. They get crazier and crazier and crazier
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:58.240]  good points
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.840]  Who's up next here?
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:08.560]  Eden in the great state of texas. Eden. Thanks for holding her on the air
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:16.240]  Hey, Alex, how you doing today? I'm a truck driver, too. You got two in a row. Can you hear me? Okay, sir? I can god bless the truck drivers
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:24.720]  I've been watching you since 2008 when you were doing the park ranger stuff and I haven't arrested up the dmb for an opening of print
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.760]  That's like that's like 19 that's like 1997
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:35.120]  No, they were reruns on my local channel at the time. That's awesome 2008
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.320]  That I started following you and buying your stuff
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.520]  And I got your stickers on the back of my trailer. Well, you're incredible and we love you brother
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.480]  I wanted to say something in reaction to last call or a little bit and then answer your question about
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:55.360]  What do we think they're going to do next? And I wanted to say well
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:00.960]  If shift says it's still happening, right the so-called rushing collusion
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:08.480]  Then why can't small it say well, he was really assaulted and he didn't pay off anybody to do it, right?
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.160]  Anyway, no, that's what's happening. That's what's happening
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:18.480]  Right and the next thing was you're really more researched than I am. I have to admit it
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.080]  Although you may know I'm going to assume you do
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.720]  There's some time during the Hoover
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:30.320]  Administration one of the top guys there made a statement and it wasn't hidden
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.880]  he said that
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.800]  secret quarters like Jesuit the secret brotherhood
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:42.800]  Nice and malta and then you know it goes on and on have been running our three letter agencies
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.440]  Oh, well, there's definitely power structures in every major group and organization
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.360]  The current Vatican wants world government and to bring in all the muslims and everything else. You're absolutely right
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.360]  Eating good to hear from you
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.800]  Let's go to fred in wisconsin, then we'll go to uh tom fred in wisconsin. Thanks for holding you're on the air
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:02.960]  Hey, alex
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.480]  Listen to you for 15 years and you had me on in 2012 for the sopa type of thing and
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:12.400]  Then I called angrily and I was very upset about the net neutrality thing
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:16.160]  But brother, I didn't know at the time the past that we were going down
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.640]  I didn't know that hillary was going to try and overturn the electoral college
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:24.880]  I didn't know until I got in the council votes in wisconsin that jill sign
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:28.640]  I'm gonna have four attorneys. They're trying to throw out hundreds of votes
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.320]  I had no idea so you have my apology for that
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:39.440]  And everyone in america needs to listen. It is time to stand up. They are trying to take our voice
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.600]  They're trying to take our voice
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.560]  Stand up now before it's gone. It's a lot harder to negotiate from behind than it is
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.560]  Negotiate out front. We need to do this now
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:54.320]  Fred let's quantify this because they use semantical games here
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:59.120]  They called it net neutrality to not have government involved the internet which I support
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:05.040]  But obama's net neutrality was to let big tech censor and act like a censoring government
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.840]  Now they've kind of left it as a no man's land
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.720]  And so that's that's bad too. Trump needs to fix it
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.640]  But but now do you see what I was saying their plan for censorship by saying there's no government involved in the internet?
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:19.520]  They would then act as a global government and have the eu
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:25.600]  Via regulation take control of our regulations by a lack of regulation saying no regulation in the us
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  Oh, absolutely. There I
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.000]  I didn't know what a shadow ban was when I called you back then
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.840]  I just knew the internet was functional today. The search engine doesn't even work anymore
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.600]  Well, exactly. So so so you were saying hey that we've had net neutrality. It's been good
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.640]  It's being codified by obama leave it alone. It was the end of net neutrality in the name of net neutrality
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.240]  And I had just read the soros statements that they were going to take the internet over soon
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.320]  So I just knew that
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:53.920]  The name means nothing. It's what they actually do. You see what I'm saying the problem is
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.920]  Trump's kind of left it open right now and let them do this
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.200]  And and and that's that's bad, but now he's signaling. He's going to take action. What do you think you should do?
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.880]  All right, I think he should go into google and tell them
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:11.920]  Hey, you run on public open forum laws. You aren't judged by the content you put out there
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.320]  You want to keep running that way? You let all speech on there. I don't care if it's hate speech
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.840]  I don't care if it's speech that people doesn't like as long as it's not illegal. It's not hurting children or something
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.800]  That's section 230. That's section stay there. We're gonna come back to you
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.000]  I want you to be able to make your statement your phone's better now friend first
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  I couldn't hear you come back to Fred to finish up the statement. Yeah, we have laws. We have section 230. They're ignoring that
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.480]  They're not supposed to be involved in what we say
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.200]  If somebody says something wrong, you sue them
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.760]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen news wars.com tomorrow's news today

[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.960]  There are thousands of ideologies out there
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.120]  Hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:59.200]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.080]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:10.400]  I went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:13.840]  And lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:20.800]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:28.400]  That sends chills at my spine so whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products at infowarstore.com

[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:50.800]  You are the info war and I salute you
[01:59:50.800 --> 02:00:15.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:17.760]  Going back to fred in wisconsin
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:21.920]  Three four years ago they were calling it net neutrality
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:26.880]  And what it allowed the big tech company to do is
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.760]  Not have net neutrality
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.200]  and to start
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:33.760]  Going after anything they claim was obscene or hateful
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.160]  And I was pointing out we already had net neutrality under section 230
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:43.120]  Why were they adding this and the new renegotiation of naft and gat codifies this even more and
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:49.600]  Trump has endorsed that because he likes the overall plan it'll get changed in congress, but that's a big problem that trump's been supporting
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:53.840]  But it takes a lot of research to even know this stuff every time we get something in front of trump
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.080]  He makes the right decision just we have to get the information in front of him. That's why the globalist fear him so much
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:00.320]  but
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:02.560]  Soros and others said oh under the new net neutrality
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.760]  We'll operate these things as utilities
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.560]  They'll have immunity, but also
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:11.680]  We're going to censor people I said well, that's not net neutrality
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:18.000]  That's a weird merger of state and corporate and does it sound too good. So now here is big tech
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:25.200]  As the colleges said the search engines are broken. They're fixing everything. They're they're they're censoring in live time
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.960]  They're doing everything they want to everybody. It's just out of control fred. What do you think trump should do?
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.840]  you know
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.240]  I think if if these companies
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.320]  want the protection of not being liable for what's posted
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.520]  And they they can't censor it because everything they do is too faith alex
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.200]  You know, they said that uh, trump wouldn't accept the election if he lost
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.200]  Well, hillary was the one that tried to overturn the results as soon as she lost
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:59.520]  And i'm going to tell you I was in wisconsin doing the recount on trump's behalf because I volunteered for the campaign
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:08.320]  And they brought a stack of envelopes right with what was like 150 votes on it and the top one had the wrong zip code on it
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:12.960]  So three of jillstein's attorneys wanted to throw out 150 votes
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:15.520]  And I jumped up and said, well, what are you doing?
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.600]  And they said no, no, we can't do this. So everything they do is too faith
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:25.360]  They want democracy, but they want their democracy their rule and I woke up to it and I'm ready to fight
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.520]  Well, you're right. I mean the democrats the republicans
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:32.160]  You have a lot of horrible people in their party and they still do at the top but
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.600]  I mean the democrats are just like a craved group of
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:41.600]  Control freaks that will never stop and they just they have no qualms all they do is stage stuff
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.480]  And they've they've converted their constituents into acting like monsters as well
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:50.640]  Uh, and as they don't give what they want fred, what do you think they're going to do?
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.080]  As the leftists learned that they're losing and their bullying hasn't worked so far
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.080]  They just keep doubling down which causes more people to wake up. What do you think's going to happen?
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:05.360]  I you know what I think the end game is alex. I think once they have us all shut up once they take you off the air
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.640]  They come for the guns and then it's the killing fields all over again
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.840]  All over again republicans would be wiped out. Maybe we're put in camps. Who knows?
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:15.840]  But this is always the start of it
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:21.840]  So while we have a voice while in four wars is up and running while we can while we can screech
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.120]  Let's do it and while we have a president that supports us
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.640]  Supports us let's get behind him and let's let him know that we want freedom on the internet
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.280]  That we want freedom of speech that we won't let these people put us down. You know what I mean?
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:38.240]  Great point. God bless you. Okay
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.440]  I'm going to come back and I promise I'm going to tom then and uh then to quarry
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.840]  And to carlos and and others and we have a constitutional lawyer
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:51.600]  Joining us to talk about the attacks on free speech not to counter that
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.600]  This is the central fight because it's election meddling by big tech and it doesn't matter if we wake up and take the country back
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:03.440]  They will steal it from us. It's what authoritarians do every time if we aren't involved if we aren't focused
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.000]  And I'll go back to this

[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:16.880]  Now that the president has been found innocent of colluding with the russians
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:21.280]  We're not going to forget what the democrats have done to this country over the last two years
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.600]  In fact, we're going to remind them every day for the rest of their lives
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:32.880]  Join me as we continue our trip down memory lane reflecting back on the first two years of the trump administration
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:37.280]  He may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:43.760]  Do you agree with congressman adam schiff was going to be the chairman of the house intelligence committee that president trump could be
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.440]  Indicted and possibly face jail time after he leaves office. Yes
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:56.640]  If we do the investigations the information is there where fitland while rome is burning
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:04.400]  This president needs to be impeached. I wouldn't be surprised after all of this is said and done that some people end up in jail
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:08.880]  You know, and I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening and that people might go to jail
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.440]  You're exactly right for the rest of their lives
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:16.800]  I know I think they're all going to jail. That's my impression. Yes. It's not out of the question that a
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:22.800]  Senate could convict on impeachment charges. He has no idea that he's going down
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.960]  it certainly looks
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:30.560]  Like they are the kind of offenses that would call for impeachment hearings. Absolutely
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:36.400]  I think he can be looked at and perhaps even charged with obstruction of justice
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:40.480]  Well, about the only accurate thing CNN has reported in the last few years
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:46.480]  Is that the democrats are not yet ready to conclude that there's no russia conspiracy?
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.640]  Despite the two-year Mueller investigation, which included interviews with 500 witnesses and
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600]  3500 subpoenas and warrants
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:03.600]  Clearing the president and all of his associates of colluding with the russians. The democrats are still delusional and in denial
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:05.760]  All these dots
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.760]  We're now to believe don't connect
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:13.280]  Well, that's that's the conclusion in front of us chris. I mean all that stuff was suggestive
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.520]  It didn't prove anything. In fact the trump tower meeting at my reporting tells me it was a bust
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:19.760]  They didn't actually hand over any incriminating information
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.880]  What it showed is that donald trump jr. Was willing to accept help
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.240]  But we we saw no evidence that they actually accepted help, you know hacked emails or sort of
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:33.840]  Analytical stuff from all that stuff. It never panned out chris. How can they let trump off the hook?
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.800]  Well, because everyone was innocent chris. That's why let's not forget that supposed
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:45.680]  journalists at the new york times and the washington compost were given Pulitzer prizes last year for quote
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:52.880]  They're deeply sourced relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation's
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.360]  understandings of russian interference in the
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:04.480]  2016 presidential election and its connections to the trump campaign the president elects transition team and his eventual
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.640]  administration newsweek reporter seth abramson once went on a
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  135 tweet rant where in his hundred and thirty first tweets said quote the trump campaign
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:19.840]  Colloded with russia trump knew trump will be impeached or resigned
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:27.520]  It was said and true in march and is true now on twitter says you're limited to posting a hundred and eighty characters per tweet
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.680]  He started it saying it was a thread and then numbered them
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.560]  Won through a hundred and thirty five and just kept waiting
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.040]  tweeting and tweeting
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.680]  He actually wrote a book that came out last year titled proof of collusion
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:48.160]  And he's got a new one coming out in august titled proof of the conspiracy
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:52.640]  Meanwhile, it appears that chunk yogurt at the young turk says taking a different approach
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.400]  tweeting out quotes
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:57.200]  Let me be clear before we find out what's in the muller reports
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:02.080]  My contention has been that the collusion was after the election
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:06.560]  I've said countless times that I don't care about tweets during the election
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.840]  I hope muller investigated connections to russia before and after
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.280]  I guess robert muller was looking in the wrong direction this whole time
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.640]  But I still can't figure out what the problem would be of trump and his associates talking with russia
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:28.160]  After the election because that's called diplomacy in other news the pentagon has just authorized one billion dollars
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.120]  To begin building sections of the border wall where it's badly needed
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.800]  So the globalist circumvent
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:41.920]  Trump he just circumvents them trump is really kicking butt. I'm very proud of president trump right now
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:48.960]  Going after the censor is going after university censoring going after the small X folks that cover that up for obama
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.160]  It's all happening very very good time to be alive
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.440]  Very exciting. Meanwhile, there's a story up on info wars.com
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.160]  We're Nancy Pelosi after aoc's
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:02.480]  So-called green deal failed that banned cows and planes and automobiles
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.800]  only for america
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:10.080]  Policies put forward a plan almost as bad where we make all the carbon cuts, but china doesn't have to
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:12.240]  Gee wonder where the investment will be
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:19.840]  If china doesn't have all those taxes on them these people are the religion of screwing this country over
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.680]  Because you have to run that flag up to have powerful foreign corrupt countries work with you
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:29.280]  You're like, why do they hate america because they're traders?
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.720]  They enjoy it. They're on the other team
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.520]  I'm telling you
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.880]  I knew top democrats hated america. I knew it was their religion. They hate nationhood. They hate christianity. They hate our ethos
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.320]  Of the rugged individual. It's what threatens them. They want to create dependency
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.400]  But
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.840]  When you go to democrat events and say america's back america's great. They literally start flipping out
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:57.200]  And I know it's hard to believe I just
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:05.200]  It's like aoc comes to this country gets rich here hates america says it sucks
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.760]  Doesn't try to make it better
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:16.480]  Because she's at odds with it. She wants to conquer it. She can't conquer a free market, but if she ran everything
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.160]  Well, you can live like they do in venezuela
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:26.000]  Okay, let's go to tom in texas tom. Thanks for holding you're on the air. What do you think about all the craziness taking place?
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:32.480]  Howdy, alex. Thanks for taking my call. First of all, I want to commend you for what you're doing and spearheading this fight
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.320]  And I want to challenge anybody here in my voice
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.040]  To stop being meek and mild
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.840]  It is our job as a christian warrior
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:45.760]  To defend life liberty and everything god gave us
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:52.960]  And we have sat on the sidelines too long whether it's just a small let to a thousand different things whatever it may be
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.920]  Has happened to us as a country as a people
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:02.000]  That we've just sat by in our church houses and done nothing if your preacher on sunday morning
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:05.440]  Isn't speaking of what's going on in this world of
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  born babies being murdered
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.640]  and everything else happening
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.560]  Get out and find somewhere that is a warrior church get out in the streets make your voices heard
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:22.320]  Because it is time and it is past time to get up and stand up and say something
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.280]  We need to act before we lose everything alex. I agree with you and and things are getting really bad
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:32.800]  But I sense and I see more people are coming out of the trance
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.160]  Globalism as a project will never complete itself. I think we've won that phase of the war
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:40.640]  Uh, but bigger challenges are coming
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:46.720]  So but but I agree we have to face the fact that most people are still in a spiritual delusion
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.040]  They're under a spell. They're in a trance
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:51.280]  I get looked at
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.280]  when I talk to
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.360]  certain christians that I know
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  and I speak
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.920]  I call myself a christian warrior for my lord
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:03.520]  Because nobody else will i'm willing to stand up
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:09.600]  I have started to emulate you and your organizations to try to get my voices heard as well
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:17.200]  Because nobody else has stand up and saying anything. It makes me sick to think my little children are growing up in a world
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.560]  That I don't know what it's going to look like in 20 years, and I may not be able to do it then
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:25.520]  So I'm going to do it that's right and and tom that's the thing
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:30.960]  They're in a trance. So it seems like we're weak people are pathetic because everybody's asleep
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:33.600]  But you're doing the hard job and you will see
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:37.280]  Most of the times how to wake somebody up they get mad at the time like leave me alone
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:40.960]  I'm asleep, but six months later a year later a month later a day later
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.040]  Those seeds sprout and they remember what you said
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:48.240]  So keep it up my friend, but you're right
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:52.160]  We need to take back what we've lost and and you know trump is definitely
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.120]  Against all odds delivering now and notice he's talking about god more and more in his faith
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:59.600]  He understands that strength and it's really upsetting him
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.520]  Yes, sir, and that's the whole deal is
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:06.240]  We as humans
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.600]  We'll never fix this world. We are sinful flawed creatures
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:12.160]  Anybody who doesn't admit that is a fool
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:16.160]  So the only way to lead and guide this properly is with god

[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.160]  But I've read his articles. He's a smart guy
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:49.600]  dealing with
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:53.120]  The roll out of the surveillance state against democrats political enemies
[02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:56.080]  And the farming of that out
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.960]  To big media and we've got underground video that
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.600]  Veritas shot
[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:07.920]  Years ago and then last year in this year of new york times youtube employees high level vice president saying
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:13.040]  Oh, we surveil everybody we hand out the info to other people. They're in our business
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:18.480]  That's why they're on such a power trip and now trump's talking about criminal investigations into this
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:24.320]  Uh and going after big tech censorship. He's already signed an executive order against what's happening at the university. So very
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:30.320]  Exciting I want to get into that the obama ministrations expanded government surveillance and the Mueller investigation
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.320]  And how they kept those powers going
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:38.160]  Uh of the whole clinton stay behind group and the obama stay behind group after trump got an office
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:43.840]  Are we seeing the end of those groups power? Is that why the democrats are panicking so much?
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:47.760]  Also colleges and employers want access to your personal social media
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:54.800]  Content internet history to reject applicants. There's political views. They don't like how do you fight back against that?
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.320]  So much more with our guest brad. Thanks for joining us
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.920]  Hey, thanks for having me alex. I appreciate it. You know the first two points. I want to get into tie together
[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:07.760]  It's kind of like a digital super class. They've got access to the back end
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:14.720]  To your twitter private messages your youtube to all of it and they're still stonewalling us congress the pentagon
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:19.360]  About what they're doing when this house of cards comes down. It's over. I'm not defending facebook
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:22.080]  But why do you think they're the only one called out so far?
[02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:29.360]  Well, because facebook is the biggest. Um, they're the biggest boy in the block and also I mean take a look at twitter
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:35.760]  I mean the bottom line the problem with facebook is that there was some articles that came out recently that they were actually allowing other people to
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:41.600]  Read your private messages and this is absolutely troubling and so I mean that's why people really need to understand
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.640]  How to protect their information from these companies because these companies they're taking your personal data
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:51.600]  And they're giving it to whomever they feel like giving it to and they're also selling it to large companies
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:57.040]  That are being used and is being used to discriminate against you and that is just so troubling and that's something that
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:03.920]  Hopefully that um, I think it's something that the president will end up stopping and for example today earlier today
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:10.720]  It came out that that um, they're charging facebook with violating the fair housing act because of data discrimination
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:13.760]  So this is a huge problem. It's not just censorship
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:19.040]  It's also data discrimination along with censorship and these things are becoming a much bigger problem
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:25.440]  So hopefully the current administration will do something about it to stop these terrible very troubling discriminatory practices
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:30.240]  And big tech's gotten away with this. It's kind of like if you're going to steal steal big or you're going to kill one person
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:35.440]  Kill a thousand you're still going to get the death penalty. Remember it came out what three years ago that some of the big
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:38.560]  uh hotel and
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:40.560]  travel booking sites
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:45.840]  Had cookies and they knew if you were middle class or wealthy and what you were willing to pay they had algorithms
[02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:49.280]  They would charge you more because they knew your profile
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:55.680]  But if you were poorer they would charge you less knowing you didn't have the money and then once those algorithms got exposed
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:58.640]  Uh, you know, they stopped doing it, but it's just crazy
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:06.560]  Exactly. This is a huge problem. So for example, let's say let's say someone has um shown some percolivity towards
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.560]  Liking a certain type of political page or they're conservative or there's someone who likes conservative causes
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:15.760]  And advertisers know about this. It's it's highly possible
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:21.200]  It's and the fact that people can be charged higher rates because of the fact that they're visiting conservative websites
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.520]  Or they like a conservative
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:31.040]  Personal line and me personally when I've actually had some situations where I've I have actually gone to for example staples
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:34.800]  This happened where I used a VPN and when using a VPN
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.240]  I was able to hide my location and hide my personal information
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.640]  I was able to obtain things that for a lot cheaper price than if I didn't use a VPN
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:46.800]  So it's really a matter of making sure that you basically it's not just clearing your cookies
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.680]  But it's also doing other things such as
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:56.480]  Trying to hide your personal information because these companies will use this data to charge you higher prices
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:01.680]  There's a handful of articles out there on the internet that they've done investigative reports all means troubling things
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:07.120]  So let's be clear. Let's be clear. Oh the average leftist is all behind big tech censorship surveillance
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:10.400]  Now because they know it's giving them power, but that's a small piece of the puzzle
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:13.680]  Doesn't matter whether you're white black old young liberal conservative
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:21.440]  You're getting ripped off. You're getting gamed. You're getting spot on so people say well, what do I have to hide?
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:29.200]  Uh, well some people that post on facebook. We're going to out of town. Here's the presence. We got your photos geo located
[02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:35.120]  You get robbed you have doors and blinds on your house and fences around your house for security folks
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:39.680]  Not that you're bad. There's bad people and so the idea that let's just trust big tech
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:43.760]  Remember mark zucker said our users trust us. They're a bunch of dumb efforts
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.480]  Oh, exactly. I remember when that came out. It was about 2009 2010
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.760]  there was a business insider article about that and the thing is it's not that you have something to hide it's it
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.920]  It's all about personal privacy and you have to realize that those who have information about you
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.360]  They can use that information to hurt you. They can use that information
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:08.640]  It's not just to to so-called discriminating against you based upon what your political beliefs are
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:11.600]  It's also the fact that they can end up becoming
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.520]  Like for example cyber criminals social engineering
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:20.720]  It's all these things that the more data you're putting out there the less control you have over your life
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:25.360]  And so for example insurance companies facebook wanted to end up doing some type of
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:34.800]  Association with a handful of insurance companies so that way they could basically charge young teens higher prices and google scanning student emails for
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:38.560]  Not just advertising but other digital dossier and commercial purposes
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:44.080]  So the companies they want to take your information and they want to use it against you the more data out there about you
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.240]  The less control you have over your life and the less
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.000]  Ability you have as far as being a democratic nation when you have a handful of companies that have all this power
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.040]  Because literally data is the new gold out there
[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:59.920]  But haven't they gone too far now that they've given all these weaponized systems that we're just used for profit
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:01.920]  Now they've
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:06.880]  Hired all these democrats out of the colleges. They even call big tech campuses and they recreate it
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.560]  And they have a reign of terror against us. They get caught doing it and still don't care and then a lot of congress about
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.560]  It's a very troubling situation because my biggest issue with a lot of this stuff
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:23.040]  Is that there's a lot of people out there that are taking your personal information?
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:27.520]  And so for example, let's say you you like the certain personal line and you're a teen
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:31.920]  Well, then you're going into a college interview and if someone has googled you when they've taken a look
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.480]  They figured out what what your instagram account is or your twitter account or your snapchat account
[02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:41.760]  Then they're taking that information. They're making pure judgments. They're saying, okay, you know what this person has
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.240]  liked someone who's conservative or they're following someone who's conservative therefore
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:52.000]  We're not going to give that person an opportunity to attend this. Oh, we see that now all these lawsuits where colleges are saying
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:54.480]  You've visited a conservative
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:58.400]  Or you like something your band. I mean that is real terror
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:04.960]  Exactly and for example, harbert even has in their interview handbook for their alumni interview handbook
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:11.840]  They want to know exactly what websites you're visiting and which blogs you're visiting and from that information
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:16.160]  You could you could tell a lot about so and you can tell about their personal health issues
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.760]  You can tell about not only their politics their sexual orientation
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:24.080]  Their religion these are some very private and personal bits of data
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.040]  And by the way, aren't you one of the top lawyers involved in getting some of the laws passed that banned colleges from doing that?
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.440]  Exactly, it was talking about how we fight back and then take phone calls
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:39.280]  Across the board on a whole bunch of issues about how trumps gonna strike back against this on the other side

[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:39.440]  All right, I want to start taking some of your phone calls with our guests because we're all taking calls on big tech censorship
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:44.960]  How to counter it but our guests you can look it up. It's been instrumental as a writer and researcher lawyer
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:46.960]  And getting state laws passed
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:56.080]  Where you can't have the universities and others demanding to violate your fourth amendment and to know
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:04.240]  What your entire background is what's on your social network? What's in your email all this
[02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:09.360]  Of course the average person says well, that's totally constitutional. That makes sense, but nobody raised it
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:13.760]  Nobody made a case nobody got him to write a bill or to get it passed
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:17.360]  That's why we get so much done. Thanks to the great audience taking action
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.280]  It's why trump's getting so awake is because we are taking action
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:26.160]  Most christians or conservatives or libertarians or nationalists are busy just working all day
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:30.800]  We just let the leftists run around bullying and running society. That's coming to an end
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:33.520]  So so get into that and and what you've been able to do
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:38.160]  Brad sheer and where you see this going what you think trump should do
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:46.160]  Yeah, sure sure. I think that trump should definitely try to do whatever he can to level the playing field as far as
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:49.440]  As far as I have a big problem with
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:56.000]  Various platforms saying, you know, we're going to de-platform somebody or ban somebody just because we don't like what they have to say
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:59.360]  I mean, I'm a big fan of letting the marketplace of ideas
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:06.400]  Determine what someone has to say and all the laws that I've advocated for it. It's it's basically the
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:12.560]  data privacy social media privacy and free speech because without privacy you can't have free speech
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:16.560]  And also with kids in the biggest one of the biggest issues you have a lot of these
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:24.160]  Large companies mainly facebook and google what they're doing is they're they're literally creating these digital dossiers in our schools
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.160]  of our kids and that information is then being used to
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:35.680]  As far as in the guidance counselor area with different programs to then take that information and it's being used by colleges
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:41.120]  And that's very unfair because of the fact that the types of things that kids are doing while they're growing up
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:46.960]  It should not be in any way shape or form count against them because when kids the kids say stupid things
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:50.560]  That's just the nature of the beast and as a parent of a couple kids
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.480]  I think what the what they do when they're young should never have any
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:57.280]  Um, there should not be held against them. You know, I agree
[02:35:57.280 --> 02:36:02.960]  But isn't that a larger paradigm with the left not to share but in europe where they want to sexualize children younger
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:06.960]  They want to emancipate them where they can have vaccines when they're tan or have sex when they're tan
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:12.560]  Uh, I mean the system is really coming for our children because the corporations and governments see them as weak
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:14.880]  See them as malleable
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:18.240]  Those are some very important issues
[02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:24.480]  And I I've seen like for example in my school district the amount of data that these companies are collecting
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:30.080]  It's unfettered data access and this information is actually being utilized against our kids
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:35.120]  Like for example several years back when when google got in trouble for literally scanning the student emails
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:37.280]  in our kids schools
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:38.720]  And no one held them accountable
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:45.120]  So my hope is that the current administration and the department of education end up starting starting to hold these tech companies
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:49.680]  Totally accountable for these illegal activities of collecting all this data owner
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:53.680]  And by the way, you could just be a teacher and then leak it to a member of the media that's good
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.400]  And then and then bring down the whole thing. We have to say no and you're right big tech has been treated
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  Like they're god
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:03.520]  And they can just and they have totally raped us
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:08.880]  Even six months ago sundar pachai wouldn't show up to congress to testify now. He did now
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:13.200]  He's gone and and been confronted by trump and I think they're starting to realize they're not invincible
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:19.920]  Exactly we've you a hundred percent and and that's the big problem here is the fact that for a long time big tech got
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:26.080]  A free pass and under the previous administration. There was a lot of issues where well, who were the biggest, um
[02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:33.440]  Uh, donators to the to obama's campaign and who actually ended up coming to visit the white house more than anyone else
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.280]  And that was president that was google's google's lobbyists
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:44.480]  And um, facebook was up there too. So, I mean, let's not forget the chai comms with all their hidden microchips inside the chips
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:47.760]  I mean, this is just crazy absolutely crazy
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.120]  Brad shares our guests
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:52.640]  We're gonna take a few calls the right shotgun with us and then obviously he's a smart guy
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:57.120]  He'll be seeing him on some of the other shows and my broadcast. Uh, let's take a few calls here
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:59.360]  We've got a caller here says
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:04.960]  Uh, the big tech is going after trump. I agree quarry in north carolina than carlos. Go ahead
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.840]  Uh, hey, alex. Thanks. I would I'd like to preface my comment just thanking you
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.960]  You know, there's a lot of alex naysayers out there always have been
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.760]  And certainly plenty to criticize you for but I want to thank you for making me active
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:23.840]  I first got involved with the fluoride issue and you know, that's not the basis of my comment
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.960]  But I do think if we were able to get that out of the water a lot of our
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:31.920]  Other challenges would be made easier because everybody's IQ would be higher and they'd be able to think about this
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.560]  But uh, that's neither here nor there, you know, I think it's kind of apropos that you know
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:43.520]  The timing of my call because I work for a multi-billion dollar data management company with installations and you know
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:50.000]  Uh, get more than 50 of the fortune 500 uh fortune 100. So I had the privilege of sort of
[02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:57.600]  Sitting with it and and the best line of business and and and they're all doing this, you know, they and so that's my point is
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.920]  You know, they've got armies of developers, you know, training machines to
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:06.640]  Uh perform all sorts of advanced analytics and and and they're automating everything
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:13.680]  So, you know, you heard of the jj god from twitter say it that they don't even look at themselves as an american company
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.960]  Even though that's where their headquarters is their global company and so they just uh, you know
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:23.680]  I don't know if that means they conform to the un or whatever but my point is they're not going to stop
[02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:31.200]  Unless the profit incentive for them to do what they're doing is taken away and you know, I don't like uh the eu
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:33.360]  At all, I think it should be disbanded
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.720]  but you look at something like the the gdpr legal framework and and basically
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.000]  Companies reacted to that because it put 20 of their profit revenue
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:47.200]  At at stake if they didn't follow the law
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:54.080]  So, well sure at least the eu government knows it needs to exercise some power or be made obsolete
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.120]  And so basically big tech is the global government now
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:04.160]  Right and if they didn't feel threatened that their revenues threatened by that law then they would not
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.280]  You know spend any money building in sure. What do you think about trump saying you censor anybody?
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.760]  Uh, we cut your government contracts
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:18.320]  Oh, I love that. I just love that. I mean, uh, the the the government, you know corporate welfare is probably one
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:24.240]  A bigger problem than than the uh, you know the citizen welfare. So that absolutely has to happen
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:30.160]  Um, but I am concerned because they're already acting criminally that despite whatever action he may take
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:36.640]  They'll just continue and so that's where we come in, you know, because uh, we relinquish a lot of our rights
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.720]  You know and and we do have freedom of association. So when we sign up for these things people need to read the contract
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:44.800]  They need to know what they're volunteering for
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.160]  Absolutely
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:50.960]  It's like smart tv's telling you hey, we're watching and listening to you. Well, why would you do that because you let me do it
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:55.680]  Right, exactly. And so I know you got to go to that, you know, to your desk, etc
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.520]  But Alex that I think you deserve to look into alternatives and this is my main point is that
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.600]  They're going to keep on this trajectory
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:09.920]  It's going to end up destroying themselves because as mentioned before, you know, google and youtube are basically useless now
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:14.240]  So we see a lot with especially with the crypto economy developing
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.000]  Alternatives out there and I really think you should look into this data network
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:25.040]  Because it's deep it's providing an incentive mechanism for peer-to-peer decentralized videos streaming. Oh, believe me
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:28.240]  I want alternatives. You're your phone glitched. What's the network?
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:37.280]  Stata network and they're trying to basically disrupt the centralization of uh, uh content delivery network. All right. Hey, Cory
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:40.800]  Awesome call. Thanks for holding. Let's get our guests his computer froze up
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:45.200]  He got back in here as a lawyer breaking this down brad. You know your quick take on what he just said
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:52.720]  Sure. I mean, there's a lot of issues in there. I mean the thing is as far as the data privacy issue goes with
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:59.440]  With the the issue along with for example the smart televisions very troubling
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:02.080]  What's going on with there? Whether it's a Samsung or Vizio?
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:08.400]  Vizio actually got trouble several years back with the FTC and it is someone I have a I have a couple of Samsung's and you have to
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:10.400]  literally go inside the
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:14.880]  Settings to turn all this stuff off and then you also had a couple a couple weeks back
[02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:20.880]  What was in the news where google it turned out they they hit put hitting cameras inside a lot of their nest
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:24.480]  Their nest devices without telling anybody and so
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:28.960]  It's they're literally the the the fox or the wolf in the henhouse
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:33.120]  And it just gets more insane stay right there more calls Carlos and others
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:39.280]  Straight ahead or awesome guests or awesome callers and then in the fourth hour so much more coming up in the war room
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:44.240]  Owen shroyer hitting it hard in many ways you have a better job than I do and by the way
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:49.040]  The folks that make it all possible this crew is the best crew I've ever had they put up with my crap
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:53.360]  So I want to thank this amazing crew buy some great products so I can give them a bonus
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.920]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.600]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body

[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:18.560]  But I thought add the other two types of iodine the scientists that do that

[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.760]  What I was resigned the fact we didn't have x2

[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:15.120]  Just a few months ago. I got in the face of sundar
[02:47:15.680 --> 02:47:19.680]  The head of google and I said buddy you're working with the chi coms you're selling the country out now
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:25.280]  The joint chiefs of staff chairman of the secretary of defense and trump have gotten his face. This is called leadership
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:28.320]  google is evil
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:30.480]  google is evil
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:32.240]  google is evil
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:34.000]  google is evil
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.680]  google is evil
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:37.360]  google is evil
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:50.480]  google is evil
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:00.080]  By the way, I'm not bragging. Hey, this is leadership
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:06.960]  Leadership that was doing what's hard because you know, it's right not because it's the popular cool thing and you sit up there
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:12.160]  And tell me how successful you are in front of a crowd. You know these fake churches all these feel-good places
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.040]  People sit up there in a fancy outfit
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.840]  But they are what good physical shape they're in
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  I'll tell you how much money they made
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:27.360]  Well, if you made money in the corrupt system that's dehumanizing people you're a joke if you're successful and build a pioneering system and
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.760]  become wealthy more power to you
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.840]  but
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:33.840]  I personally
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:40.640]  Have gone to state houses and the federal government every time and just dominated and been the top story in the country
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:42.640]  Thanks to drudge report helping
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:50.240]  Why doesn't everybody else go every time these globalists testify you go right through the metal detectors, they're right there
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:52.240]  They're people like you
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:56.400]  I'm not saying when they're at the gas station or in a restaurant with their family going
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:59.760]  You know physically attack them on the Democrats saying no, no, no
[02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:05.520]  I'm saying you go let them know when they're at Congress and you go let congressman Chris Murphy know
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:11.680]  When he says I say nobody died at Sandy Hook and I'm harassing families and that I got this poor man that committed suicide killed
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:15.360]  Go to his office and tell him you don't appreciate it if you don't appreciate it
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.920]  Because these monsters need to know
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:20.080]  We see through them
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:22.080]  We know what they're up to
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:24.880]  Legally and lawfully non-violently
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.560]  I'm gonna go back to your phone calls with our guest here today
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  Shira law.com. He's gotten involved. He's gone to state houses and gotten a bunch of laws passed saying
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:37.600]  public education
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.280]  higher education
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:44.880]  Public colleges, they can't demand your whole social media background as if you're guilty until proven innocent
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:48.640]  He's taking action. That's what it's all about. Carlos in Canada
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:54.960]  You know, I think globalism as we know it is dead. There'll be new permutations, but their project
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:50:01.760]  It has fallen apart. They're still in charge of many areas, but I'm just saying their their great world government plan is dead
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:03.920]  Do you agree with that or disagree with that?
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:06.160]  Oh, I disagree with that entirely
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.200]  No, no, no, no, listen, uh, alex on june 28th
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:14.000]  2017
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.280]  CNN's van jones said that the russia thingy is a nothing burger
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:23.680]  They've known it's a nothing burger. We've been chasing two years with nothing burger
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:30.400]  Now the president of the united states president trump has an opportunity to restore the credibility of the fbi
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:32.480]  essential because they're
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:34.480]  basically very good people that are
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:36.880]  Live it with what's going on
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:43.280]  And and hopefully address the issue of the justice department, which is more insidious and deeper
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:50.880]  That's that's essential. So yes that part of the battle is is exposed, but the real
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:56.080]  Three level if you want to call it chess game has never changed
[02:50:56.640 --> 02:50:57.600]  the
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:04.080]  Words resonate of james paul warburg to the senate committee in the 1950s saying world government
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:11.920]  Who will have it by consent or by force essentially and so it won't say and it's not going to be paid for without blood
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:19.840]  Exactly and and and the fundamentals haven't been changed in anayota. You remember the russia going to the russia thingy
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:21.360]  Um
[02:51:21.360 --> 02:51:22.480]  when
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:30.320]  Lavrov foreign affairs for russia met with the ambassador for russia and united states with president trump in the oval office
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.880]  They just got things which were exposed in the media subsequently
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:37.440]  Now this was the oval office, of course
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:41.680]  Yeah, they called it treason that he would even meet with them, which is a normal behavior
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:45.760]  I'm just saying their global project isn't a lot of trouble. I'm not saying the power structure
[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:52.080]  Is it there but in their own words their world government program where they want to take it is basically impossible
[02:51:53.040 --> 02:52:00.480]  Well what I want to address is is a very important issue alex and that is that it was an article that appeared by uh greenwald
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:03.200]  Um and on on glen glen greenwald
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.640]  From from yeah from and the guardian and at september 11 2013
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:12.400]  Um, and it basically addressed the issue that the nsa
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.040]  shares raw intelligence
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:19.920]  Information about everything americans data facts data
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.400]  Uh email data
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:23.840]  telephoned
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:25.440]  data
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:31.040]  Everything basically intelligence as well as americans raw data and and it's allowed
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:35.440]  Israel to siphon this data for the use of israel, of course
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:41.360]  But we thought I don't think president trump is aware of this and the fact is is that if you were aware of it
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:49.600]  he would have realized subsequently that when mosad two agents had revealed information about the goings on in the oval office
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:50.880]  with uh
[02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:52.880]  Lavrov and with um
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:53:01.120]  The ambassador that and and the made in the media reaction to it which began to create the the idea that he was leaking
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:02.880]  raw information
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:10.240]  Secure information to russia and that he was a trader this this was the the kernel up on which they built this whole
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:16.320]  Sure, I hear you. Oh, I appreciate your call carlos and I'm not I don't when Israel spies on us
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:20.000]  It's wrong and something should be done about it and it's true that some of the telecoms have relationships
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:25.520]  China is way more embedded in our media telecoms. They were running. I guess the gay app
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:32.960]  Uh, what is it called a tender grinder? Uh, and and and we're using it to blackmail people. So now they're having divest of that
[02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:36.720]  We've got all these other groups and organizations
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:42.160]  Where Interpol has raw data what hotel you're checked into all over the world. What's going on?
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:43.280]  I mean
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.280]  Exactly the internet is just this giant
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:51.280]  Thing now to share data with corporations and governments brad you're an expert on this is a lawyer and somebody that tracks this
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:57.120]  With your company digital armor group calm. What's your take on just how crazy these backdoors are?
[02:53:58.160 --> 02:54:01.360]  It's terrible and besides grinder which came out yesterday
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:04.160]  I think they should start thinking about looking into tiktok
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:09.840]  Because tiktok bought out musically and who who owns tiktok a chinese company?
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:16.240]  And so and a lot of young kids use tiktok and that's an app where you you basically put on
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:21.120]  Short music videos, but the type of information that's being collected is very problem
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:23.760]  some very troublesome and there's been a lot of a lot of
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:26.800]  People in the security apparatus
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:30.480]  They think that china was the one behind the opm data hack or breach
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:35.200]  And also maybe they might have been involved with the uh with the marriott data breach or hack
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:40.880]  And so the problem is that when you have these nation states, especially china and russia
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:45.440]  Maybe north creer or whatever taking taking down these different
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:49.040]  Companies and going into the back doors and obtaining this information
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:52.640]  You can start to get a bigger picture of where our people are going
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:56.000]  And what's being done with this information for example several
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.720]  Are lots of them build a giant data map that that interfaces with other maps they've got
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:03.600]  That that the general public doesn't understand go ahead
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:07.600]  Exactly, I couldn't agree with you more for example. Um, it was in the news
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:09.840]  I think it was maybe six months or so ago with strava
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:14.960]  They're a fitness app and how they had a map of all the people that were using strava around the world
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:20.000]  And what you could see was that there were a lot of um secret us bases where the um
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:23.360]  Where are you a servicemen men and women they were using the app
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:27.680]  And you could actually track where their secret bases were all over the world and this put our
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:32.880]  Our men and women who uh fight for us and protect our country and basically lays to all the targets
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:40.080]  Exactly basically showed the entire world where our secret operations are and how many people that we had
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:45.360]  Yeah, nobody in the military should be allowed to have cell phones people should go back to land lines
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:50.000]  They should go back to flip phones. The damn things are a nightmare. They're very useful
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:55.440]  But they are a nightmare. I want to have you back again soon, brad really impressed with the great work

[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:19.280]  and the media calling them angel cakes
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:22.800]  So we got the video and audio of that coming up then matt bracken will respond to that
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:26.400]  But brian in texas wants to talk about local
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:31.360]  Texan responding to alex being harassed at lucy's fried chicken. Yeah, then the left edited the video
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.960]  And the media said I came over and screamed at them. Yeah, folks. I'm not at restaurants coming up and screaming at people for no reason
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:42.160]  They came to my table three times and said if you eat, you know what we're gonna get you
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:44.960]  And then we're in my way to leave

[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:13.840]  So
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:25.760]  Well stuff in the smaller case has gotten even crazier i'm gonna get into it some at the start of the next segment
[03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:29.440]  We uh had a big article out yesterday morning about the fact that
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:35.920]  The chief cook county prosecutor said she refused herself but never did
[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:40.480]  We went looked up the state law and that she didn't well now it's in town hall
[03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:46.400]  It's everywhere that holy cow kim fox's office admits she never actually recused herself from smaller case
[03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:48.720]  She used the term colloquially
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:53.360]  Wow these people are out of control
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:57.760]  Smollett lawyer alleged Nigerian attackers could have worn whiteface
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:01.040]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.560]  Stuff's getting crazy
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:08.400]  I'm gonna get to all the colors before I punch out and have matt bracken take it over
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:11.520]  Trump probably tonight in Grand Rapids that's steve been holding a long time
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:15.040]  And we've got some others here, but brad in texas
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:19.120]  You wanted to comment on what happened at lucy's fried chicken saturday night go ahead
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:24.080]  I guess I did I heard you tell the story about that. I live here in austin
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:29.120]  I got a word of warning for all the info wars listeners, but especially the austin resident
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:32.320]  That's happened to me a little different flavor of it
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:35.760]  I have been heavily involved in rock and roll in the last 20 years
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.760]  Especially metal and punk playing in band writing articles being active, right?
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:44.560]  And I've noticed this thing over the years. You're you know, one of the shows on 6th street
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:48.800]  Thousand people are in there, right? 600 of the people just want to get drunk and have a good time
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.680]  20% of the people they are like the mega fans of the band have all the shirts and everything
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:02:00.640]  They don't have this other 20% you remember free mumia and liberate to bed and all that those people
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:06.640]  Okay, so what they do is you got a band like slayer they play it gets rough up in the front pit gets going and
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:12.080]  It's under it and rule if you don't want to get hit in the back and hang out if you want to get rowdy get up front
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:17.120]  Well, you got these little leftist weirdos that I'm standing there watching the band. They knock into you. You tell them
[03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:22.240]  Hey, man, I'm not in the pit. Watch out. They do it again. I'm not in the pit. Don't knock into me
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:27.360]  They do it a third time you clean the clock then they go run get security and you're the bad guy
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:31.360]  Doesn't that sound familiar alex?
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:35.920]  Their whole religion is about setting people up and manipulating something. They love the power. Oh, yeah, three times come to my table
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:41.920]  We're gonna get you we're gonna destroy you eat you eat this do that then they're waiting for me and when I say finally
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:47.840]  Okay, let's go. They edit the tape that I'm the bad guy. It's like what I'm saying is they're like all Jesse Smollett
[03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:49.520]  They're like all
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:53.680]  Balazzy Ford as a culture leftist stage stuff
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:59.040]  If you're a caller in a previous hour, it said it best. He said that they want democracy
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:03.440]  But they want their democracy not yours. This is bigger politics. They want rock and roll
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  But they want their rock and roll not yours. It seems that the common denominator about being one of the socialist people
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:13.120]  Is being inconsiderate for others and psychotically selfish?
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.600]  Exactly. Emitter selfish and all the studies show it. Great call
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:20.560]  Brian, you're absolutely right
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:24.480]  What's gonna happen as they lose their power and as people don't bow to them?
[03:03:24.480 --> 03:03:29.840]  I I mean at some point they're gonna have to realize that that they're not running the show and back down
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:35.440]  I wonder what's gonna happen
[03:03:36.480 --> 03:03:41.520]  All right, we've got three more callers that I will get to I'm sorry for all the others when you got 20 something phone lines
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:46.960]  It's a catch 22 you're able to get on because we have all these phone lines, but then it's hard to get to everybody
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:50.720]  I've done pretty good. I've probably taken like 20 calls today
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:54.800]  So we've got Steve and Anthony and Jared and then I'm going to get to the
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:00.480]  Islamic pirates doing a fake distress signal
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:04.160]  Taking over a major ship and then the lepidus media is defending them
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:06.880]  Defending pirates now
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:09.680]  It never ends that is coming up
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:13.200]  Next segment and then as I mentioned tomorrow's news today
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:17.600]  There's a stack here. I had and I can't find it now. I'm gonna try to find her in the break
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:23.120]  Here's a morning Scott one of the producers comes up and says I've checked the state law. I've checked her statements
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:26.240]  I've checked it. The fact that it's on her letterhead the fact that she did the
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:31.200]  The dropping of the case she never recused herself. It's a fraud and
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:35.200]  I said, well go tell the writers about a story. Well, we broke it
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:39.840]  Small it prosecuted her lied over recusal continued to work hoax
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:44.240]  Case now it's all over fox news town hall. Holy cow. Kim fox's office
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:48.640]  The admit she never actually recused herself the small it case use term colloquially

[03:06:54.480 --> 03:06:56.480]  Mo mo mo
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:06:58.480]  I
[03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:04.480]  Went to a billy idle concert when I was like 10 one of the first concerts I went to I went I was like 14
[03:07:05.760 --> 03:07:06.960]  15
[03:07:06.960 --> 03:07:10.800]  Back then he was like number one. I could always take those high school girls
[03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:15.600]  Out here. They were going to see billy idle my mama bought me a ticket back in the old days
[03:07:15.680 --> 03:07:16.800]  It's sears
[03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:21.840]  She'd drive them her little Volkswagen bug up to the mall give me those tickets. My mom was so cool about that
[03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:26.160]  And I got to like sit there be like a little mascot with the high school cheerleaders
[03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:31.600]  And then I saw him with my wife a few years ago here in Austin. He was like animatronic
[03:07:32.480 --> 03:07:34.960]  It sounded like the record in person
[03:07:35.920 --> 03:07:37.920]  I was like, wow, it's crazy
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:40.480]  All right, that's enough
[03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:42.560]  having some flashbacks
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:48.240]  I want to just say we should all celebrate the nationalism's exploding and the humanity standing up to the left
[03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:54.400]  And that some good things are happening. I just really it's been impressed upon me and my research and my gut level
[03:07:54.400 --> 03:07:59.760]  My spirit that we should all just be a little bit satisfied. We're still in one hell of a fight
[03:08:00.320 --> 03:08:04.480]  I want to commend this crew. I get so serious. I get so angry at myself that we're not doing enough
[03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:09.280]  I constantly feel like I'm not fighting hard enough and it's just been impressed upon me at a gut level
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000]  In my spirit that we need to
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.960]  Realize that we're doing as good as we can and God's going to carry it the rest of the way
[03:08:14.960 --> 03:08:20.640]  And I really mean that I'm very thankful to all the listeners. I'm very thankful to all the affiliates
[03:08:20.720 --> 03:08:24.880]  I'm very thankful to all of you throughout the years and your prayers and everything else
[03:08:25.760 --> 03:08:27.200]  because
[03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:30.880]  We really all of us come a long way together and it's really a beautiful thing
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:35.200]  So I just want to salute you all and thank you all including the crew and just everybody
[03:08:35.680 --> 03:08:39.840]  Because we need to focus on being more positive and savor the victories we've had
[03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:42.960]  You know, I get we all want to fight hard and we're always focused
[03:08:42.960 --> 03:08:44.960]  Uh, but we need to also
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:48.160]  Take some time to lick our wounds and uh
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:51.200]  Savor the fact that God's already taken us this far
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.480]  Because let me tell you we've torn the living hell out of the globlest
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:01.040]  I mean they already they are burdened up and blowing up and not happy right now
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:03.920]  So instead of getting mad about all the stuff they do to us
[03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:07.440]  Let's realize we gave them a lot better than they gave us
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:11.760]  Well, they're squatting over and killing these babies and everything god's coming for their ass
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:15.760]  All god wants is for us to do the right thing. He'll do the rest
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:20.160]  All right, Anthony, Jared and steve who's been holding the longest here

[03:09:38.560 --> 03:09:42.080]  Caitlin Bennett and others are going to be there on the spot
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:47.680]  Wonderful and uh, I already heard they got a baby trump balloon out there. So
[03:09:48.080 --> 03:09:51.440]  Oh, I know the new old focus. Well, you know that baby sure kicked the globlest
[03:09:51.440 --> 03:09:57.120]  But that baby sure ended a bunch of wars that baby sure turned a lot of crap around that baby sure beat their coup
[03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:03.120]  Yes, it did. I'll have my uh info wars in your face shirt on tonight too. So
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:08.400]  Maybe I'll see somebody out there. You damn well, right? You will that's why we're in those colors proud and loud
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:12.240]  Especially at trump rallies is good. I would not advise wearing one in a blue state area
[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:16.800]  You'll get hit in the head with a bike lock. That's why I say wear a moulin lobby. We're in news wars
[03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:22.480]  Wear one of those shirts just to meet like-minded people. But yeah trump rallies wear those info or shirts
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:25.680]  All right, thanks alex
[03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:29.200]  Hey steve by the way, you're awesome shoot some video email it to us. We'll play it
[03:10:29.680 --> 03:10:34.560]  You're awesome. All of you are reporters every one of you. I'm a reporter. You're a reporter. We're all in this together
[03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:41.280]  Doesn't matter if you got black skin white skin red skin pink skin. You love freedom, baby. You got red blood. We're brothers and sisters
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:46.880]  I'm gonna tell you something metaphysically we've turned the corner
[03:10:47.920 --> 03:10:51.760]  A lot of big fights coming up and I'm telling you I could smell victory folks
[03:10:53.280 --> 03:10:56.640]  You smell it Anthony and Marilyn you're on the air. Thanks for calling
[03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:00.160]  Hey alex can you hear me? Yes, sir
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:04.560]  God bless you alex. You've changed in hearts and minds all over the country. We're doing it together, brother
[03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:09.440]  Thank you. Thank you. I wanted to ask you about this fillet case
[03:11:09.840 --> 03:11:16.480]  I was watching fox and friends this morning and some judge naff was saying that no matter what trump is tweeting about and everything
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:22.560]  They're not going to be able to charge him with a crime because of the legal mechanism. They used to wipe that slate queen
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:26.560]  Uh, so I wanted to hear your take on that see if you think they're going to be able to get them
[03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:30.160]  Uh, maybe they'll just get them on this mail fraud stuff and not the fake hate crime
[03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:36.960]  I was about to say uh, judge naff's a smart guy and since yeah, they've they've executed the fact that
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:41.280]  Since that office and powered by the state through the county
[03:11:42.560 --> 03:11:46.720]  Says that he's had his record expunge and it's over. There's no such thing as double jeopardy
[03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:52.560]  Except there's other crimes of conspiracy if he was in communication with her which we know he was
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:58.960]  So kim fox and this other lawyer and the democrats, he won't be charged for this for the for the first aging
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:01.280]  The hate crime the false flag
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:04.960]  The inside job, but he can be charged for the conspiracy
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:08.640]  Uh to manipulate justice to obstruct justice
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:12.880]  Uh to suborn perjury uh to corrupt public officials
[03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:15.440]  I mean, there's so many crimes and you're right the due sex
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:21.360]  Or the millennium falcon coming in right when luke skywalkers about to get it is the feds and trump
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:26.560]  They know obama's involved. So this is perfect for trump because it's going to lead right back to obama
[03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:30.880]  And trump is not somebody that plays games or makes deals once they've engaged in treason
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:35.840]  He already gave them a chance to make deals the last two and a half years. They didn't so you watch smell it
[03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:40.880]  Smell it better tell everybody you don't want to commit suicide smell it better understand
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:46.400]  I I think there's a good chance that the deep state's going to kill smell it because it leads right back to obama
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:51.040]  Alex, I grew up in chicago. I've seen how these people act. They I wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:55.600]  You washed up in lake michigan something. Oh, absolutely. I think drug overdose
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:58.160]  Shot in the back of the head
[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:01.840]  And again, the media will say I'm saying that no I want small it to
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:08.400]  Be very very safe and I I'm telling you he's a dead man walking as far as I'm concerned
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:14.960]  He's too embarrassing. He did this for obama. He did this for the people at five years ago
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:19.280]  He did this for the people at fox and that's the side that's entertainment two different companies now
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:22.400]  Uh, and it's on man. It's on
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:28.320]  Thank you so much. It's like at the end of a wag the dog. It's based on three different true stories composited
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:33.520]  Talked the patriots a true story, but three stories can posit it three different men into one person
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:38.880]  Swamp fox was real two other patrons were real. They made him into the patriot one guy really lost his son
[03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:43.680]  Really did take out that a similar colonel. I mean it's all a true story
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:45.680]  Uh, but uh
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:51.840]  The point I'm getting at is is that they're not going to let him just run around now that this has been exposed
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:56.000]  And and the fact that disney owned fox is involved. So, uh
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.200]  He's told him
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:02.880]  I'm going to go public if you don't let me off. They said, okay, we're letting you off
[03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:05.280]  And they're going to kill him
[03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:11.280]  I think jesse small it is dead in the door now. He'll sorry for him. What an idiot jared in texas. You're on the air. Welcome
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:14.240]  Hey, how are you doing? Good my friend
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:20.640]  Uh, just wondering, uh, what do you think about if anybody's ever going to get prosecuted?
[03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:27.520]  Hillary claiming so on and so forth. Uh, that's a great question. I almost started the show today saying, okay
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:29.760]  I got to eat crow
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  Some of what q has said has come true
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:34.640]  Muller ended up doing the right thing. Um
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:39.760]  Trump is getting a bunch of prosecutions ready for real and he said he is. Oh, yeah, it's all coming now
[03:14:39.760 --> 03:14:43.200]  I mean, but but it's because of the action of the people everything else
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:49.360]  But I have to you know, give credit q's a bunch of different people and it got all political and disinfo got into it
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:55.920]  But early on q was good later. It became disinfo. But so far this is a big prophecy of q coming true
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:14:59.120]  Yeah, but besides q
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:04.640]  Do you think every anything? Oh, no, no. Trump has said he's he wants prosecutions. I'll tell you what
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:08.640]  Bracken let's get Bracken to take on this. I'll be one more second with Bracken

[03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:21.040]  But the globalists and the bankers in the us and england shut up the communist and then now russia has partially kicked them out
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:24.880]  And we're the new com commie command base the eu's even worse

[03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:29.120]  You still won't hear my
[03:20:30.880 --> 03:20:33.520]  Money through friday 11 a.m. To 3 p.m. Central we're here
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:37.680]  That bracket's about to take over but there's so much happening
[03:20:37.680 --> 03:20:41.120]  I wanted to hold over with them because he was stationed in Middle East and abcl
[03:20:41.120 --> 03:20:43.120]  He's written books about the pirates
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:45.520]  that are running around
[03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:49.840]  Mediterranean and they're in the arabian sea and they're in the indian ocean
[03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:54.560]  And what they've been up to for over 1500 years. That's why much of
[03:20:54.560 --> 03:21:00.080]  Asia is muslim like indonesia in areas of the philippines because they actually
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:04.880]  Done the genetic testing you'll have europeans from spain's blood found
[03:21:05.680 --> 03:21:07.920]  in families in all over the
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:10.000]  Asia because
[03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:14.800]  Their daughters were kidnapped over a thousand years ago and put on slave ships and sold
[03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:17.520]  to the kings of the east
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:22.320]  And matt bracken has written about that and the fact that that's coming back again
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:25.840]  in several of his books one of which i've read
[03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:34.960]  And now we have the headline french drones patrol english channel as migrant crisis escalates now the invasion ships are hitting cornwall
[03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:41.120]  migrants hijacked cargo ship that rescued them off the coast of libya the real headline is
[03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:43.760]  islamic pirates
[03:21:43.760 --> 03:21:46.640]  issue fake distress signal hijacked ship
[03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:49.600]  that try to commandeer it
[03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:51.280]  to europe
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:53.280]  either idly or malta
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:58.400]  Thinking they'd just be let go and i've watched multiple leftist newscast they act like they should
[03:21:58.960 --> 03:22:00.960]  And now i guess that's where they're headed
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:06.400]  We'll get matt bracken's take on this but here's one of the european union news agencies
[03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:11.600]  Uh putting out a whitewash on this i mean this is serious crime
[03:22:12.560 --> 03:22:14.640]  By the way piracy is still a death penalty here it is
[03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:21.520]  Moving on to the mediterranean now where an instant is unfolding as a hundred migrants believes to have hijacked a cargo ship
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.840]  Are now trying to reach malta
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:30.240]  They were rescued by a cargo vessel off the coast of libya and now the 108 people on board were believed to have taken over the vessel
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:34.240]  After being told they would that they would not be allowed enter into malta
[03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:40.240]  Now it comes just a day after the european union announced it would be downscaling rescue missions in the mediterranean
[03:22:40.240 --> 03:22:45.440]  Well for more on this story we're joined now here in the studio by urine users allister sanford
[03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:49.600]  Can you tell us exactly more about this stories? I know for the moment the facts are not exactly
[03:22:50.960 --> 03:22:54.960]  Very clear. I look at pause a bit more and he goes through basically a defense of it
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:23:00.400]  They admit they don't respond to the rescue calls because they stage them and then they rob you
[03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:08.400]  And they want an eu navy to stop idly and others from turning the ships back off the coast of uh
[03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:14.240]  Libya and other areas tunisia matt bracken you've written about this extensively predicting this
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:17.040]  Now they're hitting england as well
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:20.080]  Uh, this is just crazy. What's your take on it?
[03:23:21.440 --> 03:23:24.320]  Well so far this is more just um
[03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:29.040]  migration via violence just ratcheting up the migration
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:33.600]  um, not the type of piracy where they're going out and and uh
[03:23:34.320 --> 03:23:36.720]  hijacking a ship at sea to take it back to their
[03:23:36.720 --> 03:23:38.320]  to their pirate lairs
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:45.680]  Which had happened in history and might happen again as the as europe weekends, but sure it's pirates hijacking ships as a ticket to go where they want
[03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:51.120]  Right and and the the the main thing to understand from this is that
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:57.360]  Whether it's the mexican border or the mediterranean sort of border between africa and europe
[03:23:57.920 --> 03:24:02.080]  Those who are supporting open borders and the free flow
[03:24:02.080 --> 03:24:06.560]  Whether it's george soros and his in his open society
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:08.720]  Or the eu which
[03:24:08.720 --> 03:24:10.320]  These are all
[03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:11.520]  communists
[03:24:11.520 --> 03:24:17.040]  They don't call themselves the selves out anymore, but if you go back all the way through the 20th century
[03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:20.640]  We used to call it the free world versus the communist world
[03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:24.160]  But really it's morphed and gone underground and it's
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:30.800]  The the supporters of sovereign nation states where the individuals who make up that nation determine
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:33.840]  There's sure and it was always rich people over communism
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:37.120]  It's a way to enslave it. We think of communism. What free stuff are born people? No
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:43.600]  It's about a system of authoritarian control and breaking down existing nation states bringing them down clowered in piven
[03:24:44.240 --> 03:24:50.560]  Yeah, going all the way back to armand hammer and other bankers that that funded lennon and trotsky
[03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:53.200]  Until they could get to the soviet unit to russia
[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:59.440]  Which was then the you know the weakest vessel that they could have kind of inject that that communist virus into
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:03.680]  Knowing that, you know, if the czar is wiped out and communism comes to to
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:11.200]  Power in in russia as the soviet union these bankers would be in on the ground floor of this great opportunity
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:13.440]  You know rise coming right up to the top
[03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:20.880]  But you know today it's not russia versus america so much as the globalists versus the nationalists
[03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:25.200]  And I still have to put putin even though. Yeah, putin is a russian nationalist
[03:25:25.200 --> 03:25:30.640]  He's never quit on communism and even if you see if you see um putin with a cross around his neck
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:36.320]  There's no contradiction because if I've been studying this book, which I'm going to have her on later in the hour
[03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:39.520]  Uh, diana diana west sir new book
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:42.640]  Even james comey is one of these guys
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:45.200]  diana west goes back to the
[03:25:45.200 --> 03:25:49.280]  Brandon was a practicing communist and still is but he was against trump
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:52.960]  So that's the big joke is that it was clenching in the past
[03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:58.160]  Joke is that it was clinton and others that had the the russian connection trump had zero
[03:25:58.960 --> 03:26:06.400]  Right, but what shocked me was some of the people that are just being treated as like oh chris christopher steele former mi6
[03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:10.880]  He's a socialist going back to cambridge a communist. So we'll call this
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:14.320]  The communist plot
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:20.720]  Communist plotted to frame trump for russia connection. Well, I want to take one more call here because I want to get your take on this
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:22.720]  Uh, jared was asking
[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:26.000]  Is trump going to go hard? Is anyone going to jail?
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:30.720]  Uh, I don't want to bring the caller back up, but trump is saying we're going to go after the deep state
[03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:34.640]  We're going to release the fives of warrants. We're going to try to prosecute and I think of trump smart
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:39.040]  He'll follow through with this and he says investigate small it as well. What do you think matt braggen?
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:47.600]  I think it's bound to happen right now the um, according to sundance at conservative treehouse the two factions are are um
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:52.320]  Lindsay graham for a special count a special prosecutor special counsel
[03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:56.480]  Which will probably, you know, not have any result through the 2020 election
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:03.840]  Versus devin nuñez who's saying we don't need a special a special counsel juries. We are going to do criminal referrals right now
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:05.840]  We got the names. We got their perjuries
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:08.640]  Justice department turn it loose
[03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:13.680]  You know and we have to because the democrats are going to reorganize with some new overthrow
[03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:18.560]  So so here's the bottom line. It isn't business as usual the clintons and the bush is sharing power
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:22.000]  People are about to get in trouble jared. What do you think about that?
[03:27:23.360 --> 03:27:26.960]  Well, yeah, well, how many years does it have to take for somebody to get in trouble?
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:29.600]  You got the clintons for years breaking laws
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:35.200]  Bush is breaking laws 9 11. Nothing's ever happened. So when does it happen?
[03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:38.720]  Well, it has to happen now. Let me tell you something. They tried to destroy trump's life
[03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:41.360]  They've tried to destroy my life. They've called me a russian agent
[03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:46.320]  They've called they're breathing down my neck and they're the ones that are guilty. So I say they need to get it
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:50.880]  And I don't shoot my mouth off earlier. I don't want violence. I want a peaceful revolution
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:53.280]  But if people are convicted of treason
[03:27:54.320 --> 03:27:56.320]  I don't say this to act macho
[03:27:57.040 --> 03:28:01.120]  I'm saying it because we need to go ahead and just say it. I don't want offensive violence
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:05.600]  But when people are convicted, you know, I'm I'm willing to not just call for it
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:09.280]  I'm willing to pull the levers or kick the levers to hang them. I'm serious
[03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:11.760]  I will you know black masks for me, man
[03:28:12.160 --> 03:28:16.240]  You've been found guilty working with the chai comms trying to overthrow the country trying to push pedophilia
[03:28:16.400 --> 03:28:18.320]  You're found guilty of these treason charges
[03:28:18.480 --> 03:28:20.800]  I will go up there and I will pull the lever myself
[03:28:21.200 --> 03:28:26.240]  And I say that because I need to be on record saying to the globalist the traders legally judicially lawfully
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:30.960]  You want to kill children? You want to kill me when you're found guilty and everything else? I am in the game
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:36.960]  I want you dead. Get that through your damn head. I'm spiritually committed. You want to kill me?
[03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:43.840]  Here I am. I'm ready and I metaphysically cross the line and say you will be held accountable
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:51.200]  You will go to prison and some of you. I believe in the end like Nuremberg will hang until your neck until you are dead

[03:33:38.480 --> 03:33:40.480]  uh diana west the
[03:33:40.640 --> 03:33:43.680]  amazing author of american betrayal and now
[03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:46.160]  The new book the red thread
[03:33:46.400 --> 03:33:49.760]  And this is just what we've been talking about there is currently
[03:33:49.760 --> 03:33:52.880]  And a humongous battle going on
[03:33:53.680 --> 03:33:58.160]  Below the below the surface level very few people talk about it in these terms
[03:33:58.640 --> 03:34:03.840]  People are still acting like this deep state coup. It just happened like how did these people come up with it?
[03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:06.480]  Who was who was behind it? What were their motives?
[03:34:07.040 --> 03:34:09.040]  Well diana west in her book
[03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:14.880]  She's she digs into the background of all of the players and not surprisingly
[03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:20.880]  All of the key players in this including some real surprises like like uh james comey
[03:34:21.760 --> 03:34:23.280]  They are
[03:34:23.280 --> 03:34:29.120]  Progressives of the redistributionist, you know use violence to create equality school
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:30.880]  and
[03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:34.480]  Just like what i was saying a little bit earlier with with putin wearing a cross
[03:34:35.040 --> 03:34:38.320]  They don't see a conflict their twisted interpretation
[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:41.120]  Of christianity is basically
[03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:46.720]  Modern marxism, you know christ that that jesus was the first marxist
[03:34:47.280 --> 03:34:50.560]  And they're just bringing it up to the forward to the present day
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:52.160]  in fact
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:53.760]  james comey
[03:34:53.760 --> 03:34:58.480]  his entire life going back to his his uh, you know university theses
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:01.360]  Right through uh, maybe two or three years ago
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:04.960]  His his greatest influence his greatest hero
[03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:10.880]  Is a so-called theologian of the 20th century named reinhold neber
[03:35:11.520 --> 03:35:12.720]  and in fact
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:17.520]  His twitter handle for years was undercover reinhold neber
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:23.760]  So neber is one of these they didn't use the term liberation theology in the you know 40s and 50s
[03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:26.160]  But that's what he was
[03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:32.640]  He was preaching that we have to go soft on communism that the communists are really just trying to get to christ
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:34.640]  You know christianity's message
[03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:39.680]  A little bit more in a hurry, you know those gulags those those uh death camps
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:43.920]  Yeah, they that communism is just christianity in a big hurry
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:49.200]  And you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. Well in the book the red thread
[03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:55.120]  Diana west goes through all of it. It won't be a surprise to hear that for example
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:57.680]  Nelly or Bruce oars wife
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:00.880]  Went to college in the you know in the 80s
[03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:05.840]  And then went to the soviet union when they still had political prisoners
[03:36:05.920 --> 03:36:12.000]  You know being tortured in psychiatric hospitals injected with pain causing brain destroying drugs
[03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:14.560]  She was in the soviet union
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:17.040]  doing whitewash
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:23.520]  Dissertation research on the collectivization of soviet agriculture, you know, okay
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:27.600]  They had to send a few million kool-ox to Siberia where they're probably going to die
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:30.960]  But what the heck it was great for equality
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:36.880]  You know, this is the kind of person who then becomes a cia analyst nelly oar
[03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:43.920]  You know working for a open source contract employers, which means she's really cia, but they never badged her
[03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:50.320]  You know so that she can have some uh a plausible deniability about actually being a cia officer
[03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:52.880]  But nelly oar is cia
[03:36:52.880 --> 03:37:00.240]  How does a person who is an apologist for Stalin, you know who says who who in her dissertation is quoting
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:07.040]  Admiringly the authors of the books that she's reviewing and and taking research from
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:12.800]  Agreeing with them that Stalin was necessary. I mean, you know for equality
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:17.360]  You have to you have to maybe murder a few million people. I guess is what her message is
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:23.120]  She is now part of the you know, the state department fbi pipeline for information
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:28.640]  And it's no surprise. I wouldn't be you know, I wouldn't be shocked if she also knew brennan
[03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:36.000]  Like now they're saying does steel know brennan christopher steel back in cambridge in the 80s another hardcore communist
[03:37:36.480 --> 03:37:39.680]  But these guys what they did as the soviet union collapsed
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:45.120]  They went into stealth mode the way I like in it is instead of a battleship, you know
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:49.520]  Flying the hammer and sickle up on the surface. They decided to turn submarine
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:53.440]  So that it's the same it's the same communist threat
[03:37:53.840 --> 03:37:58.480]  But now it's underwater and russia is only one link in this chain
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:04.320]  Of course, it was a very important link during the 20th century. Maybe less so now, but today
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:11.840]  You know what we see are the the progeny of the communist subversion efforts in the united states
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:17.840]  They're flourishing. They are all over the place. You look at people like john carrey, you know
[03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:25.520]  basically pro-communist anti-american if you study his writings and and speeches from the uh from the 70s
[03:38:26.080 --> 03:38:28.080]  Really an america hater
[03:38:28.080 --> 03:38:34.080]  His his disciples the people that he mentored. They're all throughout the clinton and obama
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:35.680]  administrations
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:40.240]  That's why diana west is calling this the red thread. It's really a red network
[03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:46.720]  And these guys like say strobe talbot who was a you know cooperating soviet agent of influence
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:49.120]  strobe talbot
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:55.600]  hillary clinton even when she was ahead of the state department was asking strobe talbot for his suggestion
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:02.640]  For who to stock the state department with so it's not just a question of of sending a dozen or 20
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:11.760]  You know uh coup plotters to prison. There are now hundreds if not thousands of the of the you know starting as
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  Interns and then postgraduate work guys. They come into the state department. They come into the fbi
[03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:23.360]  It's no surprise that that the people that hate trump so much
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:30.160]  Have risen to the top and the real root of their hatred is their redistributionists
[03:39:30.160 --> 03:39:33.920]  They look at our constitution as a total impediment
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:39.360]  In their writings, you know comey the uh disciple of reinhold neiber
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:45.600]  Comey is is saying, you know you can't oh, you know equality has to come as a higher
[03:39:46.160 --> 03:39:49.760]  Value than what he calls a due process
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:57.040]  You need you know violent equality. You need to push it through even if you have to do acts of evil
[03:39:57.040 --> 03:40:00.240]  You have to you know, you have to take this some battle
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:05.040]  Uh to the capitalist enemies by going outside of the system
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:09.040]  They talked about this during their especially in their younger years
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:13.680]  Before they went into government and then turned into into stealth mode
[03:40:14.080 --> 03:40:17.920]  This is where it's a shock to me to find out that people like william comey
[03:40:18.400 --> 03:40:25.440]  Are collectivists they're redistributionists that that's why comey's book was called a higher loyalty
[03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:29.200]  You know those of us that were in the military or law enforcement
[03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:34.160]  We all took an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic
[03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:36.720]  But comey and his ilk
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:42.320]  They consider their loyalty to be something higher than the united states constitution
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:50.880]  And that's this global universal egalitarian nightmare that they think only they are smart enough
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:53.360]  to push on to all of us
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:57.520]  And you know, I don't see how this is ever going to um to end
[03:40:58.160 --> 03:41:05.680]  peacefully because even if trump tries and wants to have these people charged and potentially arrested and jailed
[03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:13.680]  For every one of that every name that we've heard they've all brought in dozens of their acolytes that are cut from the same
[03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:18.800]  You know socialist communist progressive, whatever you want to call it. Remember
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:25.440]  Communists are shapeshifters. They believe above all that the ends justify the means
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  Truth means nothing to these people
[03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:29.920]  power
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:37.520]  To the collective is all they care about and if they if they have to say oh, oh like in the in the book in red thread
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:44.160]  They say even in the 30s socialism is a bad word. We need to call it economic democracy
[03:41:44.160 --> 03:41:51.680]  Or social democracy that because we can sell it to the masses that way socialism has a bad connotation
[03:41:51.680 --> 03:41:53.680]  Let's call it economic democracy
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:42:00.720]  Nothing has changed. It's the same in academia in the media and in politics now
[03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:07.040]  They these groups have been stocked from top to bottom with these stealth communists
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:11.120]  and it's going to take a hell of a of an effort to root them out because
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:16.480]  Every step that trump and the department of justice under bar hopefully takes against them
[03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:19.120]  They have an entire network
[03:42:19.120 --> 03:42:26.560]  Surrounding them to soften the blow to to turn away these indictments, you know to do propaganda for them in the media
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:31.520]  It's going to be extremely difficult. I mean it's been going for so long
[03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:38.560]  You know with academia being stocked with the frankfort columbia school communists pushing these students through
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:44.320]  Encouraging them to go to the cia to the state department to the fbi their plan has worked
[03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:50.880]  And when we come back, um, we'll be talking to diana west about this, uh, this entire red thread
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:55.040]  And now through the end of march

[03:44:59.040 --> 03:45:02.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast your bracket
[03:45:02.720 --> 03:45:06.000]  It just gets old now. I'm gonna shut you down right now. Okay
[03:45:06.640 --> 03:45:13.040]  We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:15.520]  Do you understand? I'm ringing the alarm
[03:45:16.240 --> 03:45:21.200]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it gonna take us being shut down?
[03:45:21.440 --> 03:45:23.040]  Is that what you want Frank?
[03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:24.160]  You know what?
[03:45:24.160 --> 03:45:29.840]  I put him on pause again. Hey Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear
[03:45:29.920 --> 03:45:33.360]  We're under attack. We need your help as much begging as I do
[03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:36.160]  We can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this
[03:45:36.320 --> 03:45:41.280]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand. I need your help Frank
[03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:43.280]  I need your help Frank

[03:46:03.120 --> 03:46:05.120]  My leaps and my bounds
[03:46:05.120 --> 03:46:11.680]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements
[03:46:12.160 --> 03:46:19.120]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost
[03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:22.080]  But burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects
[03:46:22.240 --> 03:46:26.080]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful
[03:46:26.720 --> 03:46:30.880]  Healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world

[03:46:44.000 --> 03:46:50.240]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[03:46:50.720 --> 03:46:52.720]  turbo force and enforce live.com
[03:46:52.720 --> 03:46:59.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:21.440]  Waging war on corruption it's alex jones with
[03:47:21.440 --> 03:47:23.440]  Matt Bracken
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:30.800]  Okay, the amazing diana west is waiting on the line, but before we go to her
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:32.400]  I want to uh
[03:47:32.400 --> 03:47:37.680]  I want to mention that look if you like an alternative voice in media and not just, you know, the uh, you know
[03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:41.680]  The corporate network mainstream stuff if you want to keep this going
[03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:47.200]  The way that it's it's basically self-funded and that means the info war store
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:53.760]  So right now you can get 50 off of everything not including turbo force and the protein bars
[03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:56.320]  But everything else 50 off
[03:47:57.040 --> 03:48:02.560]  If you don't support info war is one way or the other the show goes away. That's how it works
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:04.240]  now
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:06.240]  Before I get the diana west
[03:48:06.240 --> 03:48:10.560]  Even before I read her book which I read in one sitting out two sittings last night and this morning
[03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:15.280]  It's not long. It's it's only a hundred pages. Okay the new book
[03:48:15.280 --> 03:48:20.000]  But it which is which is good because it's a fast read and it was faster to produce
[03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:26.560]  Which means a quicker turnaround cycle faster in the uh, you know in the uh in the oodle loop
[03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:29.200]  Quick quick to get out a hundred page book
[03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:34.000]  When I was watching the deep coup for the last the deep state coup for the last two years
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  I thought this didn't just happen
[03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:40.800]  I mean imagine being if you had never seen a football game and you you go out and you watch, uh
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:46.560]  The super bowl between the eagles and the patriots here before last and you see the filly special
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:49.680]  But you've never seen a football game before and you see this amazing play
[03:48:49.760 --> 03:48:51.760]  You know the quarterback ends up catching a touchdown
[03:48:52.480 --> 03:48:54.640]  And all the coaches and everybody tells you
[03:48:55.440 --> 03:48:58.480]  There's no play. It just happened. It was just random
[03:48:58.480 --> 03:49:00.480]  You know, they just ran around and that happened
[03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:05.520]  If you didn't know anything about football you might believe that even though it's a croc obviously
[03:49:05.520 --> 03:49:13.440]  Well to a trained eye the deep state coup has been as obvious as the filly special was a carefully, you know
[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:15.920]  planned play
[03:49:15.920 --> 03:49:18.960]  The deep state coup was an active measure
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:22.800]  Influence operation. This is classic
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:28.320]  Influence operation kgb style today. It's fsb
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:36.800]  But the the main part of it is all being carried out now by the spawn of the 1930s through 50s
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:39.920]  Communists that have now come through academia
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:45.680]  Influenced by all of those communists that never were thrown out during the you know during the 50s
[03:49:45.760 --> 03:49:49.200]  They stayed in in college and they've been churning out
[03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:51.680]  your little communists
[03:49:51.680 --> 03:49:58.240]  For generations now up into the to the point where they run the cia and have run the fbi
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:01.360]  Some of them are less stealthy than others. Brennan admitted
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:09.440]  He was a communist had voted for gust hall in 76 when the gulags were full and people were being executed en masse in the 70s
[03:50:10.480 --> 03:50:12.480]  And comey he went stealth
[03:50:12.560 --> 03:50:20.400]  But he says his biggest influence was this so-called christian pro-communist named rinhold neaver to the point that that was his screen name
[03:50:20.400 --> 03:50:23.920]  Anyway, we're seeing something play out now
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:29.840]  That is immense and it is so far beyond the dozen or 20 names that people have heard of that
[03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:35.600]  It's almost impossible to comprehend and diana. Are you there? Can you hear me now? Yes? I am. Yes
[03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:41.600]  Yeah, your book was so amazing. Yeah. Hello. I'm you know your book was amazing
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:49.360]  It's it's all it's all marked up already. You know, I've got it. Um, I've just got it completely, you know margin footnoted
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:55.280]  I recommend everybody read it along with american betrayal and I and I'm sure that you're going to be attacked for it
[03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:02.000]  Just like you were for american betrayal because there are so many of these stealth moles literally thousands of them
[03:51:02.560 --> 03:51:06.240]  That when they're when somebody tries to shine a light on this red net
[03:51:07.280 --> 03:51:12.720]  The stealth moles are just acting like, you know, uh, the wicked witch with water thrown on her
[03:51:12.720 --> 03:51:21.360]  Exactly or or worse, and I think that I think that actually that the reason we're even seeing this is because of the trump effect
[03:51:21.440 --> 03:51:29.680]  I mean, these are the people who would have remained stealth and remained moling our our institutions and departments and security services and all the rest of it
[03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:37.360]  Had don trump not come along and absolutely triggered them because he is that counter revolutionary figure
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:40.720]  He came on the stage our first counter revolutionary
[03:51:40.720 --> 03:51:43.920]  president who is also
[03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:51.920]  Creating this firestorm by being the threat to this globalist system that has evolved
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:56.560]  Going back to the end of world war two. I mean, this is the direction we've been moving
[03:51:57.040 --> 03:52:00.080]  Ever since the end of world war two toward a globalist system
[03:52:00.400 --> 03:52:03.920]  And we have to remember when we're actually looking at 2019 events
[03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:07.920]  We have to remember that the very beginning of this system 1945
[03:52:07.920 --> 03:52:11.120]  Was actually this system looking at the world bank
[03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:15.120]  Look looking looking at the the united nations these
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:22.000]  Essential institutions of the global system were actually set in place by soviet agents
[03:52:22.560 --> 03:52:24.800]  Inside our government harry dexter wyatt
[03:52:25.520 --> 03:52:26.160]  department
[03:52:26.160 --> 03:52:27.920]  Algeria to the state department
[03:52:27.920 --> 03:52:32.160]  Algeria has been the first un secretary general and in harry dexter white
[03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:37.280]  Bringing the imf and providing over that at the very beginning. These were soviet agents
[03:52:37.280 --> 03:52:39.840]  This is not an accident as you note
[03:52:40.320 --> 03:52:46.720]  And we have to understand that what we're looking at today this sort of russian influence story didn't start in 2016
[03:52:46.720 --> 03:52:51.440]  We've got a century to look at but certainly the post war period is when it really
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:54.160]  Takes shape and really takes over
[03:52:54.960 --> 03:52:59.040]  This effort to sort of wipe out the nation states of the world including ours
[03:52:59.280 --> 03:53:06.240]  And donald trump was that man who came on and said we are restoring the nation state and that's why you see all of the
[03:53:06.240 --> 03:53:11.520]  The the free fire and the and the explosions and volcanic eruptions going on
[03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:18.880]  Yeah, I was I was really amazed especially about comey, you know people like steel and lele or it didn't surprise me as much
[03:53:19.120 --> 03:53:21.120]  But comey has been such a stealth
[03:53:21.600 --> 03:53:25.040]  Redistributionist his entire life. I mean he had the rinald neber
[03:53:25.600 --> 03:53:32.400]  Twitter handle and considers rinald neber his great at the greatest influence on his life rinald neber was an anti
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:37.760]  Anti-communist he said we need to go easy on the communists comey even wrote a dissertation
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:44.960]  That that compared neber to jerry fallwell and basically trump and trump's family
[03:53:45.360 --> 03:53:48.880]  Was in the jerry fallwell, you know liberty university
[03:53:49.520 --> 03:53:55.120]  700 club, you know the the norman vincent peel real anti-communist christians
[03:53:55.920 --> 03:54:01.760]  along with um, you know reverend billy graham and so on and rinald neber who is is uh
[03:54:01.760 --> 03:54:04.320]  Comey's mentor and hero
[03:54:04.960 --> 03:54:12.640]  Was a person who is as a fake christian was apologizing for communists and saying they're just trying to get where jesus wanted to go
[03:54:12.800 --> 03:54:14.800]  In a little little different way
[03:54:15.280 --> 03:54:19.120]  That's exactly right and i was fascinated to learn about that because i knew nothing about it
[03:54:19.200 --> 03:54:20.880]  I knew nothing about rinald neber
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:27.440]  I didn't know who he was except for that sort of catchphrase liberal protestant theologian and i was quite shocked to find out how
[03:54:27.440 --> 03:54:34.080]  Marxist's ideas were and indeed what's really shocking is that the two books that call me cited in 2018 when he was
[03:54:34.400 --> 03:54:42.560]  Promoting his own memoir being interviewed the two most influential books that he cited by neber were written in the in the in about 1933
[03:54:42.640 --> 03:54:47.360]  1940 and that was the period when neber himself was at his most militant
[03:54:47.360 --> 03:54:53.680]  He was a member of the socialist party united states. He went on college campuses urging violence to change the social order
[03:54:53.680 --> 03:54:59.520]  He was all about you know social ownership of property and violence to get to that that wonderful
[03:55:00.080 --> 03:55:05.120]  Revolutionary place is not a bad thing. I mean this is how radical this man was when he was writing the books that
[03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:09.280]  Not just an academic. I mean we know academics are far leftist
[03:55:09.680 --> 03:55:13.760]  This is a man who goes to be the number two at the justice department
[03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:20.800]  He was deputy attorney general in 2003 under the uh, george w bush found uh administration under john ashcroft
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:27.120]  And then of course fbi director. I mean this is shocking stuff when you put it together this ideology that is
[03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:30.560]  Certainly anti-constitutional if not anti-american
[03:55:31.200 --> 03:55:36.560]  Rising to actually being in charge of our justice and our our federal police
[03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:40.880]  I mean this is terrifying stuff, but you're exactly right. He was a very stealthy person
[03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:48.800]  He was discussed himself as having been an open communist as a student in in college at william and mary in the early 1980s
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:55:55.760]  Uh, when he found knight ryan old neighbor and he's still clinging to neighbor as you've noted in 20 well to this day
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:55:57.360]  and yet
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:56:04.320]  He's supposedly not a communist anymore, but he told uh, new york magazine in 2003 that he didn't really know what he was
[03:56:04.800 --> 03:56:09.520]  But of course the world perceived him as some kind of plain vanilla stripe republican
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:13.440]  Uh, you're a partisan person very stealthy
[03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:16.560]  Yeah, I we just have a minute and a half
[03:56:16.560 --> 03:56:22.160]  Um, I can see the clock you can't but it just a couple of clips from the book it says
[03:56:22.960 --> 03:56:24.960]  Comey writes the and this is
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:30.160]  Writing about neighbor comey writes the christian and politics must be willing to transgress
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:35.920]  Any purely christian ethic he must be willing to sin in the name of justice
[03:56:36.640 --> 03:56:42.560]  And he writes a certain political action may be evil, but not necessarily immoral
[03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:49.920]  Given the circumstances so they're just more he's another moral relativist who believes the ends justify the means
[03:56:50.400 --> 03:56:54.400]  Like steel and ore and the rest of them, you know Stalin was necessary
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:57:00.800]  It's it's uh, just communism is just christianity in a hurry with a little bit of violence that's you know
[03:57:00.960 --> 03:57:02.960]  It might be regrettable, but it was necessary
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:07.040]  And we just we have 40 seconds left if you want to close it out
[03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:13.760]  Yeah, well, I would just like to point out what you're saying shows the extent to which these people consider the american citizen to be
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:16.480]  So much fodder to be so much just markers
[03:57:16.800 --> 03:57:23.520]  You know game piece that they do what they will to further their ends what they consider to be quote justice
[03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:27.760]  It's it's a travesty that these people have gotten to where they've gotten
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:33.600]  And perhaps now we do have a chance to see this this investigation continue
[03:57:33.600 --> 03:57:38.480]  So we can find out really what the command and control is because we don't even know who's behind it. That's right
[03:57:39.360 --> 03:57:42.400]  That's right. Okay. That's it. Thanks. Thanks everybody
[03:57:43.440 --> 03:57:50.000]  There are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[03:57:51.200 --> 03:57:54.080]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[03:57:54.480 --> 03:57:58.880]  That's what the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:05.280]  I went and researched the renaissance americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back
[03:58:05.760 --> 03:58:08.640]  And lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[03:58:09.600 --> 03:58:15.680]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night
[03:58:15.840 --> 03:58:17.600]  That sends chills at my spine
[03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:18.960]  So whatever you do
