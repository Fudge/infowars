[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.360]  And thank you for joining us we are live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones
[00:52.360 --> 00:55.800]  We're gonna have I'll ensure your coasting from the ATX with us today
[00:55.800 --> 01:02.360]  We have Katie Hopkins from Moscow with some big developments from there joining us the skype and so much more
[01:02.360 --> 01:08.080]  We're obviously gonna be opening the phones up. So all of you have a chance to give your take your view on what's happening in North Korea
[01:08.600 --> 01:11.100]  But here's the final equation
[01:11.960 --> 01:16.760]  Mainstream media is trying to spin this that it's a good thing for communist China that it's a good thing for North Korea
[01:17.560 --> 01:23.800]  The Washington Post is you've got the Democrats apoplectic. We've got compilation videos on info wars comm
[01:23.800 --> 01:26.360]  Just running the whole thing down. Here's what's happening
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.680]  The globalists were using North Korea as a set piece giving it to weapons giving it to missiles, but keeping it in a very very
[01:33.600 --> 01:38.160]  Control collapsed fashion as a set piece to control that whole region
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.360]  If Trump can come in and swoop in like we did 40 years after being enemies with Vietnam and turn it into an American ally
[01:45.360 --> 01:49.680]  It's a giant coup for humanity, especially the people of North Korea
[01:49.680 --> 01:53.480]  Kim Jong-un the third-generation dictator and
[01:54.920 --> 01:57.880]  They have committed unbelievable communist crimes against their people
[01:57.880 --> 02:04.040]  But it was our CIA and 49 to put Mao in it was the leftist of the Ford Foundation. This is all declassified
[02:04.960 --> 02:06.320]  That made
[02:06.320 --> 02:13.200]  MacArthur stand down in 53 and not take out the 3 million Chinese troops that have come in to supplement the millions that have already come in
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.760]  And so this is all been part of a UN action since then 60 plus years ago
[02:17.760 --> 02:22.920]  July 27th, 1953. We do the math 60 plus years ago
[02:22.920 --> 02:31.040]  And so Trump's coming in and saying listen, you're the land between two lands South Korea with the highest GDP for any one nation in the world
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.640]  Per capita with China with this third largest GDP in the world
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.320]  per total numbers or a second because it would be US China and then
[02:41.320 --> 02:48.880]  You know for total GDPs it would then look like something like the EU but for individual nations South Korea has the largest GDP in the world
[02:49.880 --> 02:56.880]  And they've got a 12.3 billion dollar GDP in North Korea and a 1.4 trillion dollar GDP
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.600]  113 times bigger
[02:59.680 --> 03:01.200]  in
[03:01.200 --> 03:03.560]  That's according to the IMF World Bank in
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.800]  South Korea, so they have 113 times bigger. So Trump comes in
[03:07.800 --> 03:14.920]  And he's trying to cut North Korea out from communist China and out from the globalists that have used it for strategic tension
[03:15.560 --> 03:17.560]  Then it's simply saying listen
[03:17.840 --> 03:23.880]  The best way for you to empower your people and let them eat meat and let them have a high calorie diet and for an American
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.000]  You know people make jokes about that most North Koreans have never had meat might have had fish
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.600]  I mean, that's how enslaved they are. That's the true dark ages of communism therein
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.480]  So if if he can go in there and at least create some type of capitalist system with a ruling class
[03:38.480 --> 03:42.520]  That will trickle down the people and be a better system and reform them over time
[03:43.480 --> 03:49.040]  Like we've seen in China but China is still terrible and horrible in the slave factories and kills political dissidents
[03:49.040 --> 03:53.560]  But compared to Mao killing 80 plus million people. They probably only killed most estimates are
[03:53.960 --> 03:57.880]  15 million since Mao was in it's a it's a reform of sorts
[03:57.880 --> 04:03.280]  Well, if you've got hundreds of thousands of people in slave camps millions that have been killed starving death in North Korea
[04:03.920 --> 04:07.760]  The sanctions only work if you crush the regime that still hurts the people
[04:07.760 --> 04:13.080]  But then get them to get off the people's back and then allow liberalization as it's called
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.680]  Economically in these regimes that doesn't mean liberalization as in the liberals turning us into North Korea
[04:20.200 --> 04:24.880]  So Trump is shaking it up. He's got a lot of smart advisors doing this
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.760]  I agree with it. It doesn't mean I like back slapping of Kim Jong-un
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.960]  It doesn't mean I like all the glad-handing, but it shows that Trump understands the Asian
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.200]  System of face as well and they has to do that for their own propaganda North Korea
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.720]  Almost forcing Kim Jong-un to accept the deal of a carpet of gold instead of a carpet of bombs
[04:46.120 --> 04:52.680]  They'll break it all down straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones. History's happening in full wars.com whose wars.com

[06:01.040 --> 06:06.200]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:14.160 --> 06:16.680]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us
[06:16.680 --> 06:24.560]  Here is President Trump going to shake hands with the North Korean hereditary dictator Kim Gung-un. This is just yesterday
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.680]  All right
[06:59.800 --> 07:06.520]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday we are broadcasting worldwide ladies and gentlemen, of course, it's really
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.040]  Now Wednesday over in North Korea over in Singapore
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.560]  Let's look at the calculus of what's happened here
[07:15.440 --> 07:17.680]  Trump has said he wants planetary victory
[07:18.480 --> 07:24.960]  He wants free market truly open societies that aren't run by the globalists that aren't anti-human that aren't anti-family
[07:24.960 --> 07:31.040]  That aren't based in an austerity plan to create neo feudalistic fascism in the globalist own terms
[07:32.080 --> 07:34.080]  The ultimate example of neo
[07:35.120 --> 07:36.640]  feudalistic
[07:36.640 --> 07:38.640]  authoritarianism is North Korea
[07:38.640 --> 07:44.320]  Third-generation hereditary dictator the land between South Korea and North Korea and Trump
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.880]  rightfully said look at yourself
[07:47.920 --> 07:49.920]  as the land
[07:50.720 --> 07:52.720]  between these two
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.040]  Giant economic superpowers you have a 12.3 billion dollar
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.520]  Gross domestic product in North Korea, and that's probably puffed up numbers South Korea has a 1.4 trillion
[08:05.520 --> 08:10.960]  GDP that is the largest for that a population that size in the world per capita
[08:10.960 --> 08:14.480]  They have the number one economy in the world the most connected internet-wise
[08:15.280 --> 08:18.080]  highest level test scores you name it South Korea
[08:18.640 --> 08:21.920]  now you have the genetically identical people to the north and
[08:22.880 --> 08:24.880]  geographically almost the same mental and
[08:25.440 --> 08:30.880]  And they can't produce one automobile or tie their shoelaces because that's communism
[08:30.880 --> 08:36.000]  Something with all these kids with skinny jeans and smartphones. They don't want to have a job and they're little you know
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.840]  Sailor outfits and stuff that you know make fun of info wars can hardly talk
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.920]  But they want to live under communism or socialism and they like Bernie Sanders
[08:44.480 --> 08:51.040]  Who likes you know, he likes hundred thousand dollar howdy's a million dollar houses and million dollar vacation
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.040]  Oh
[08:56.560 --> 08:58.560]  But you dirty Americans don't have it
[08:58.560 --> 09:00.560]  So Trump goes in there
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.520]  And
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.720]  He rightfully shows him a video. In fact, I sent that video to you guys if you haven't then we can roll it in the background
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.120]  For him. He just shows them a real estate development video from Miami
[09:14.240 --> 09:17.520]  And how they took real areas a decade ago and built them up
[09:18.240 --> 09:21.600]  Outside Miami and the media said well that wasn't even North Korea. That's Miami
[09:22.080 --> 09:27.680]  The point is is it's how they can develop things very quickly and the fastest thing North Korea can do versus raw material
[09:27.680 --> 09:29.680]  They've already been selling to China and others
[09:30.160 --> 09:32.160]  is and Russia
[09:32.400 --> 09:36.640]  Is become a big tourist attraction open up. They got great beaches. They got great land
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.720]  End all the tyranny and we're you're talking in five years. You could already have six or seven big resorts
[09:43.200 --> 09:48.160]  Building like Cancun did you name it people want to go somewhere new they want to go check out North Korea
[09:48.160 --> 09:50.160]  But wasn't so authoritarian
[09:50.800 --> 09:54.080]  And so that's what Trump's telling him now again. China wants to keep them poor
[09:54.080 --> 10:00.000]  They want to keep North Korea Korea period under their control. China has had more than 20 wars
[10:00.720 --> 10:02.320]  with Korea
[10:02.320 --> 10:10.160]  China absolutely hates Korea Korea has always been nothing but problems for China for 2000 years
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.960]  The Japanese can't stand Korea. They're constantly invading it. So these three groups
[10:15.760 --> 10:17.760]  have always been in war with each other
[10:18.480 --> 10:20.400]  and
[10:20.400 --> 10:23.760]  Trump is going to there and saying look at South Korea. They went with us
[10:24.720 --> 10:27.280]  And they've got a 1.4 trillion dollar economy
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.200]  Their average person makes like 80 thousand dollars a year your average person makes what a couple hundred dollars a year
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  You want to join us?
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.640]  They have the top medicine. They have the top everything you want to go that direction
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.920]  Look at the culture. Look at the music. Look at everything coming out of South Korea. It's it's super successful all over the world
[10:47.920 --> 10:49.360]  Yeah
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.840]  Movies music art literature computers science technology weapons. It's all out of South Korea
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.480]  It's it's rivaling japan. What what happened to you? What happened to you?
[11:01.200 --> 11:03.200]  Well, you've been under communism
[11:03.600 --> 11:10.160]  And so Trump shows them art literature culture shows them a video with cut-ins of north korea
[11:10.560 --> 11:16.400]  Of symphonies and music and industry and and things you know to show them the difference
[11:16.400 --> 11:24.400]  Of what you've been under just like he'd show eastern germans a video if he could a film clip of what you're living under versus what you could do
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.800]  And our sickening evil media when you've got the west and capitalism and freedom of religion and everything
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.400]  Literally reaching a hand out to north korea something our elite since 1949 have not done
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.200]  Our corrupt ford foundation and annemburg foundation and these big globalist foundations since 49
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.880]  put Mao Zedong in power had him invade korea and ordered macArthur to stand down
[11:49.360 --> 11:55.120]  And they use it as a model of un control to practice just like hitler and Stalin had split up poland
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.200]  Or split up other areas of europe before world war two or in the first years of it before the big war kicked off
[12:01.680 --> 12:03.680]  during the the german expansion
[12:05.360 --> 12:10.240]  Russia and and germany would divide countries well the un set it up where it'd be the arbiter
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.560]  Set up by the rockenfellers on record to decide how land would get divided up
[12:14.560 --> 12:20.560]  If you look all over the world the west and russia would divide up land or the west and china would divide up land
[12:21.840 --> 12:27.920]  So that's basically what happened. They tested that whole police action to kill hundreds of thousands of americans three million koreans on both sides
[12:28.640 --> 12:30.640]  Now 60 plus years later
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.120]  To the grandson of the first communist dictator trump is turn it loose
[12:35.120 --> 12:41.040]  We'll have no more drills. We'll pull our military out 80 percent. You've got to cut your military
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.480]  You've got to get rid of all the nukes. We will instantly come in with power stations
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.680]  We'll come in with surre treatment. We will come in and we will start building giant hotels here
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.160]  Next year by next year. We will start building gigantic hotels
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.280]  The south is ready to pour in with hundreds of billions of dollars. We're ready to come in there will be a
[12:59.280 --> 13:06.480]  Gold rush into your country the likes of which you've never seen guaranteed just put down all the communist flags
[13:06.880 --> 13:12.000]  Stop it. Stop starving people to death. So you get to be powerful and lord over them. Stop being devil worshipers
[13:12.560 --> 13:15.360]  I mean, it's that simple put down the red devil flags
[13:16.400 --> 13:17.920]  Just stop it
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.520]  If you'll just do that
[13:19.520 --> 13:24.240]  And you notice they were using their national flag at these events not their communist party flags
[13:24.240 --> 13:26.720]  See they're already starting to remove that a little bit
[13:26.720 --> 13:33.920]  So that's the reality of what trump went in and showed him and and it's the right thing to do because you could leave it
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.160]  Where china gets all the raw materials for nothing
[13:36.640 --> 13:39.120]  China uses it as an absolute slave colony
[13:39.520 --> 13:43.440]  Just like the the chinese uses its own people as slaves the communist chinese see the
[13:43.840 --> 13:50.480]  Poor farmers and and all their people is his dog meat. They see them as absolute food. They see them as absolute garbage
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.800]  They the chinese told the us go ahead and do because we want to get rid of half our population
[13:54.800 --> 13:57.280]  While they sign up with the rocket fillers to reduce their population
[13:57.840 --> 13:59.840]  massively with the one-shot policy and killed
[14:00.480 --> 14:03.520]  500, you know, uh, I mean I mean per town
[14:04.400 --> 14:10.160]  In some areas we're talking about 50 million, uh, you know children little girls nationwide that got killed
[14:10.480 --> 14:16.960]  But we're talking about massive massive massive numbers of people and in mobile execution vans and just this ruthless
[14:17.360 --> 14:19.920]  cold-blooded anti-human perfectly communist
[14:19.920 --> 14:25.920]  Perfectly technocrat attitude of china who really is the villain china owns hollywood china owns our debt
[14:26.160 --> 14:30.400]  China's all over the south china sea china's expanding china's threatening everybody
[14:30.880 --> 14:34.720]  China got the office of personnel management files 21 million from obama
[14:35.920 --> 14:39.360]  China is the dominant force expanding russia is not in our business
[14:40.080 --> 14:43.520]  Russia's trying to stabilize itself the u.s. Is trying to stabilize itself
[14:43.520 --> 14:50.080]  And trump's trying to use our power. He's trying to use that to parlay it into
[14:51.920 --> 14:59.680]  Unifying korea basically with economic power into the next decade into the decade after that having real unification like eastern
[15:00.800 --> 15:02.800]  and western germany and it's within grasp
[15:03.120 --> 15:09.360]  We have people absolutely demonizing that idea and coming after it and saying well
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.520]  You know, this is a terrible thing trump's done if obama could have done one tenth of this they would have given him another
[15:14.000 --> 15:14.960]  Nobel peace prize
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.840]  I don't think trump wants one of these so-called peace prizes because kissinger and algore and people have got them and obama has them
[15:21.840 --> 15:27.040]  It's a albatross around your neck when we come back. We'll play some clips of trumps powerful press conference
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.720]  Oh, and shroyer is going to chime in as well. And we've got katie hobgains from Moscow coming up bottom of the hour
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.880]  But straight ahead trump says I sit look at it for the perspective of real estate
[15:36.880 --> 15:39.920]  between China the second biggest economy in the world south korea
[15:40.480 --> 15:46.640]  Individually the highest GDP in the world. Thank for yourself. Be smart. Get out of the communism
[15:47.280 --> 15:54.320]  Get rid of it and stop enslaving your people. This is the best shot for communist evil to get its boot off the neck of those people
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.320]  And trumps knocks it out of the park again

[19:04.320 --> 19:06.160]  You're on the air worldwide, thanks for holding
[19:06.160 --> 19:09.760]  Hey Alex mate, I've been following you since I was 14
[19:09.760 --> 19:13.920]  And I'm 32 now, I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet
[19:13.920 --> 19:19.360]  It was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up into that
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.400]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guess
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.160]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield
[19:28.160 --> 19:33.680]  And since then I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.080]  Myko ZX body, it's all amazing
[19:36.080 --> 19:36.720]  Thank you brother
[19:36.720 --> 19:39.920]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much
[19:39.920 --> 19:45.280]  It's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit
[19:45.280 --> 19:50.080]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God
[19:50.080 --> 19:55.440]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there
[19:55.440 --> 19:57.120]  1776 worldwide
[19:57.120 --> 20:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:14.160 --> 20:18.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.640]  It's Alex Jones
[20:20.640 --> 20:25.920]  As an example, they have great beaches
[20:25.920 --> 20:29.440]  You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right?
[20:29.440 --> 20:32.480]  I said, boy, look at that, wouldn't that make a great condo behind?
[20:33.280 --> 20:38.320]  And I explained, I said, you know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.480]  Think of it from a real estate perspective
[20:40.480 --> 20:44.000]  You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.920]  How bad is that, right? It's great
[20:45.920 --> 20:50.720]  But I told them, I said, you may not want to do what's there
[20:50.720 --> 20:55.200]  You may want to do a smaller version of it, or, you know, and that could be
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.560]  Although I tell you what, he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad
[21:00.560 --> 21:05.360]  And I'm telling you, they really enjoyed it, I believe
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.520]  Here's the bottom line, Trump is trying to save North Korea
[21:11.520 --> 21:16.960]  The U.N. and the globalists are on record putting Mao in power
[21:16.960 --> 21:18.640]  Letting him invade, trying to take it over
[21:19.280 --> 21:22.400]  Having it be a U.N. police action, blocking MacArthur from winning
[21:22.400 --> 21:23.920]  It was a model of Vietnam to come
[21:25.120 --> 21:28.080]  Then China exploits North Korea for its raw material
[21:28.640 --> 21:32.160]  Just like China is exploiting us, everybody else, and their own people
[21:32.160 --> 21:38.640]  And now Trump is reaching out and trying to break the stalemate
[21:38.640 --> 21:42.240]  And bring North Korea in out of the dark, a huge victory for America
[21:42.240 --> 21:46.640]  And the world, and the North is moving towards giving up its weapons to do this
[21:46.640 --> 21:48.480]  Because he's first brought them to their knees
[21:48.480 --> 21:53.280]  And our mainstream media that praised Obama, trying to have meetings and praised others
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.240]  Praised Jimmy Carter is now saying Trump's a bad guy
[21:56.240 --> 21:59.120]  Now, Jimmy Carter's saying Trump is a good guy
[21:59.120 --> 22:02.480]  Vladimir Putin says that Trump's acting like an adult
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.480]  This is the right thing to do, I don't like Kim Jong-un and third-generation dictators
[22:06.480 --> 22:10.080]  But he was born into it, and he's signaling he's ready to get out of it
[22:11.680 --> 22:13.280]  This is the reality of what's happening
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.520]  Trump is trying to save North Korea
[22:15.520 --> 22:17.920]  This is a major victory for the world
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.520]  It's very, very exciting
[22:19.520 --> 22:21.760]  We're ready to rewrite a new chapter between our two nations
[22:21.760 --> 22:24.800]  Trump declares victory, boasting that he trusts Kim Jong-un
[22:24.800 --> 22:27.360]  And persuaded him to sign a break-up or hints of agreement
[22:27.360 --> 22:30.720]  For complete denuclearization every only five hours of meetings
[22:30.720 --> 22:31.920]  Now, that's just breaking
[22:31.920 --> 22:36.320]  Let's expand on this
[22:36.320 --> 22:37.920]  Why was he patting him on the back?
[22:37.920 --> 22:40.720]  Because everybody knows in body language, not just in Asia
[22:40.720 --> 22:43.520]  But face-saving, he's got to do that
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.200]  So that can be shown to their people
[22:45.200 --> 22:49.520]  And that propaganda is so powerful that they'll have to show it to their people
[22:49.520 --> 22:51.920]  Propaganda just needs political information
[22:51.920 --> 22:53.520]  It can be white, black, or gray
[22:53.520 --> 22:55.120]  This is white propaganda, it's truthful
[22:55.120 --> 22:57.520]  By doing that, they will show it to their people
[22:57.520 --> 22:59.520]  And that will start dominoes falling
[22:59.520 --> 23:03.520]  Where that will get the entire state apparatus behind
[23:03.520 --> 23:05.520]  Moving towards the West and prosperity
[23:05.520 --> 23:09.520]  The biggest thing those starving, dying people need in North Korea
[23:09.520 --> 23:13.520]  Again, you have a GDP of the North of 12.3 billion
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.520]  You have a GDP in the South of 1.4 trillion
[23:17.520 --> 23:19.520]  113 times bigger
[23:21.520 --> 23:23.520]  And the South just continues to grow
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.520]  This is the reality
[23:24.520 --> 23:27.520]  Meanwhile, back in America, CNN that defended
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.520]  The Clinton's giving nuclear missile secrets and fissile material to the North
[23:31.520 --> 23:35.520]  That defended Obama on record, folks
[23:35.520 --> 23:39.520]  Helping transfer the Office of Personnel Management database to the Communist Chinese
[23:39.520 --> 23:43.520]  And letting Apple move to Communist China, the total sellout of our country
[23:43.520 --> 23:51.520]  We have MSNBC panel saying that Trump is a want-to-be despot
[23:51.520 --> 23:55.520]  A want-to-be despot going over there
[23:55.520 --> 23:59.520]  Well, let me just hear if yourself heard us
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.520]  Steve, from our closest alley in the North, that's of course Canada
[24:03.520 --> 24:05.520]  It causes us no trouble
[24:05.520 --> 24:07.520]  And then you see him huddling, these pictures of him huddling
[24:07.520 --> 24:09.520]  With the other guy, with Putin
[24:09.520 --> 24:11.520]  It's really, it's a statement
[24:11.520 --> 24:13.520]  He likes Putin
[24:13.520 --> 24:15.520]  Donald Trump can relate to authoritarians
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.520]  He, as a former businessman, he likes absolute control
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.520]  Is he a want-to-be despot?
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.520]  I've conceded that for years now
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.520]  I mean, we're going home years
[24:25.520 --> 24:27.520]  All of his behavior is a tax on the free press
[24:27.520 --> 24:31.520]  His attacks on alliances that are designed to strengthen our security
[24:31.520 --> 24:37.520]  This is not, he has, feels more, but he calls Kim Jong-un honorable
[24:37.520 --> 24:39.520]  Yet Justin Trudeau of Canada
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.520]  Trudeau is weak
[24:41.520 --> 24:43.520]  Let's comment on that
[24:45.520 --> 24:47.520]  Yeah, yeah, Trump's a want-to-be despot
[24:47.520 --> 24:49.520]  So, here's what's going on
[24:49.520 --> 24:51.520]  Trudeau is an enemy
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.520]  Trudeau has a 260-plus percent tariff on us on Dario Loan
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.520]  Trudeau is taking the word mother and father out of government documents
[24:58.520 --> 25:01.520]  And out of the national anthem of mankind
[25:01.520 --> 25:04.520]  Trudeau is a globalist, Trudeau is a puppet
[25:04.520 --> 25:06.520]  Trump knows when he's meeting with Putin
[25:06.520 --> 25:08.520]  Or he's meeting with Kim Jong-un
[25:08.520 --> 25:10.520]  Or he's meeting with the Chinese president
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.520]  He's meeting with people that are actually in charge
[25:13.520 --> 25:16.520]  And over in those areas of the world, people hug each other and stuff
[25:16.520 --> 25:17.520]  Unless they're an enemy
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.520]  So Trump is over there buttering that creature up
[25:20.520 --> 25:22.520]  So that, just look, take a bunch of money
[25:22.520 --> 25:24.520]  Stop enslaving your people like a vampire
[25:24.520 --> 25:26.520]  You idiot, you could be like the South
[25:26.520 --> 25:28.520]  So Trump's doing a great job
[25:28.520 --> 25:30.520]  And so these scumbags that normally we're criticizing Trump
[25:30.520 --> 25:32.520]  We could pull this up just six months ago
[25:32.520 --> 25:35.520]  Calling him Rocket Man and a dictator and what we might nuke you
[25:35.520 --> 25:39.520]  Put the pressure on, oh, how dare you talk like this to Kim Jong-un
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.520]  Remember MSNBC CNN, oh, how dare you talk bad to Kim Jong-un
[25:44.520 --> 25:47.520]  Now, oh my gosh, oh, you're so horrible being nice to him
[25:47.520 --> 25:49.520]  Because he's making the deal
[25:49.520 --> 25:51.520]  He made the deal back in March
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.520]  And then the deal's been agreed to
[25:53.520 --> 25:55.520]  And now they've had the public deal
[25:55.520 --> 25:57.520]  That was just the marriage you just saw
[25:57.520 --> 25:59.520]  We were already engaged in March
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.520]  We went through the engagement process
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.520]  Up until now, and now you just saw them get married
[26:04.520 --> 26:05.520]  The agreement's done
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.520]  If they pull out of it, there's gonna be hell to pay
[26:08.520 --> 26:10.520]  That's how real business gets done
[26:10.520 --> 26:12.520]  That's how America used to do things called straight shooting
[26:12.520 --> 26:14.520]  Gaddafi came in, eight years invested
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.520]  Over a hundred billion dollars in the West
[26:16.520 --> 26:17.520]  And everything we said
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.520]  We sent in spies, overthrew his ass, killed him
[26:19.520 --> 26:21.520]  And brought in radical Muslims to blow everything up
[26:21.520 --> 26:24.520]  Because the globalists don't want any independent areas around the world
[26:24.520 --> 26:25.520]  They're doing well
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.520]  They want to keep you like Africa or like North Korea starving to death
[26:28.520 --> 26:30.520]  Just like China keeps its people
[26:30.520 --> 26:31.520]  Here's another clip
[26:31.520 --> 26:34.520]  Here's Chris Hayes saying similar garbage
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.520]  Here's Chris Hayes, and we've got Max Boot and more
[26:38.520 --> 26:39.520]  Here's Chris Hayes
[26:39.520 --> 26:42.520]  I mean, you know, he does have him
[26:42.520 --> 26:48.520]  What he is able to do is not care enough to get through every successive interaction
[26:48.520 --> 26:50.520]  And other people are burdened by caring
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.520]  Other people are burdened by a set of
[26:54.520 --> 26:59.520]  Conceptions of their fidelity or duties to the state they represent
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.520]  Trump is not burdened by caring or actually doing what he says he'll do
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.520]  He's completely doing what he said he would do
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.520]  95% when you guys 95% why
[27:10.520 --> 27:13.520]  Total 180, he totally cares, he's totally committed
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.520]  He's getting nothing but results from the VA, the economy, you name it
[27:17.520 --> 27:21.520]  Unlocking the secret technologies for medicine, all of it like I told you he'd do
[27:21.520 --> 27:26.520]  And then Chris Hayes is inverting reality about how he's unburdened from the truth
[27:26.520 --> 27:29.520]  He's unburdened from caring, he lies
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.520]  These are the ultimate liars telling us this, continue
[27:32.520 --> 27:34.520]  He is kind of unburdened by that
[27:34.520 --> 27:37.520]  And so you've got a situation now where
[27:37.520 --> 27:41.520]  I don't think anyone thinks that Donald Trump cares in some deep way
[27:41.520 --> 27:45.520]  Just as a person about the substance of the matter
[27:45.520 --> 27:47.520]  Like is there verified denuclearization?
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.520]  Is there a move towards liberalization?
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.520]  Are any of the human rights issues?
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  They're talking about, I imagine him making that case
[27:53.520 --> 27:55.520]  He cares about the headlines and everyone knows that
[27:55.520 --> 27:57.520]  Who's on the other side of the table
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.520]  That's good, they're not budging on the human rights
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.520]  It's getting worse, putting the pressure on him killed a lot of people
[28:02.520 --> 28:04.520]  But he had to get them to the table to save the rest
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.520]  Okay, so this is pure crap, they're the ones that helped prop this up
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.520]  The literal foundations that put Mao in and then allowed that war
[28:11.520 --> 28:13.520]  These are the grandchildren of those folks
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.520]  Let's play CNN, this is from when he was going
[28:15.520 --> 28:19.520]  Said he'll be jet lagged, it'll fail, nothing's gonna happen, blah blah blah
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.520]  Now before the agreement's even dry, they're saying it isn't a real agreement
[28:23.520 --> 28:26.520]  Unbelievable, no, North Korea's been begging for a hand
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.520]  But the Chinese communists have kept him down the ground
[28:29.520 --> 28:31.520]  You watch what happens, this is gonna succeed
[28:31.520 --> 28:34.520]  Unless the neocons and leftists kill Trump
[28:34.520 --> 28:37.520]  When we come back, I'm gonna play this clip
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.520]  And then Katie Hopkins from St. Petersburg
[28:39.520 --> 28:41.520]  Totally different area, not Moscow
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.520]  It's a beautiful St. Petersburg, I'm told
[28:44.520 --> 28:46.520]  I'm getting my orders from Putin
[28:46.520 --> 28:49.520]  We're gonna talk to Katie Hopkins, the great analyst from Fox News

[31:27.520 --> 31:29.520]  I personally have been taking for over a year
[31:29.520 --> 31:32.520]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[31:32.520 --> 31:35.520]  When it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get

[31:40.520 --> 31:45.520]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[31:45.520 --> 31:48.520]  Because we need you, the remnant of America
[31:48.520 --> 31:50.520]  To reignite those brush fires the next level
[31:50.520 --> 31:52.520]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[31:52.520 --> 31:54.520]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together
[31:54.520 --> 31:56.520]  We're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[31:56.520 --> 31:59.520]  With ZShield and InfowarsLife.com
[32:27.520 --> 32:29.520]  What we learned was that there was in fact
[32:29.520 --> 32:32.520]  Unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[32:32.520 --> 32:36.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[32:36.520 --> 32:40.520]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[32:40.520 --> 32:43.520]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[32:43.520 --> 32:46.520]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[32:46.520 --> 32:49.520]  Raises the pH of the water
[32:49.520 --> 32:52.520]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[32:52.520 --> 32:54.520]  Can contaminate a rainwater supply
[32:54.520 --> 32:59.520]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.520]  So global peace is breaking out
[33:30.520 --> 33:33.520]  Prosperity also as the return of the West begins to happen
[33:33.520 --> 33:36.520]  As globalism is put on its heels worldwide
[33:36.520 --> 33:39.520]  But I just played clips of you joined us of MSNBC
[33:39.520 --> 33:42.520]  I was Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, you name it
[33:42.520 --> 33:45.520]  Saying that Trump is a despot
[33:45.520 --> 33:46.520]  Trump doesn't care
[33:46.520 --> 33:49.520]  Trump's helping the human rights abuses
[33:49.520 --> 33:53.520]  Trump's going in to get a peace deal to denuclearize
[33:53.520 --> 33:56.520]  And then bring in the West's economic investment
[33:56.520 --> 33:58.520]  To try to save those people
[33:58.520 --> 34:00.520]  Just like we did in East Germany
[34:00.520 --> 34:04.520]  But the media is completely freaking out and demonizing it
[34:04.520 --> 34:08.520]  And I wanted to go to old Neocon Max Boot on CNN
[34:08.520 --> 34:12.520]  Saying that, oh, any president, any president could have done this
[34:12.520 --> 34:16.520]  No, not any president could have gone and got these deals
[34:16.520 --> 34:17.520]  Because they didn't
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.520]  And the West helped prop this up and let China continue to use North Korea
[34:21.520 --> 34:24.520]  For raw materials as a slave state
[34:24.520 --> 34:27.520]  Communist China hates North Korea and has been controlling it all along
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.520]  This is a major move by Trump to go in there and try to free these people
[34:31.520 --> 34:33.520]  And it should only be saluted
[34:33.520 --> 34:36.520]  You know, if Trump hadn't been taken action the last few years as a maverick
[34:36.520 --> 34:39.520]  And winning every time, I'd say maybe it is a gamble
[34:39.520 --> 34:42.520]  Maybe it's a possibly negative gamble
[34:42.520 --> 34:46.520]  But with him coming up like a slot machine
[34:46.520 --> 34:48.520]  You know, triple cherries every time
[34:48.520 --> 34:52.520]  Ten pulls in a row, I'm betting on Trump
[34:52.520 --> 34:55.520]  The guy has got right on his side
[34:55.520 --> 34:57.520]  He's charmed right now
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.520]  And this is amazing, he's shaking things up
[34:59.520 --> 35:01.520]  So here's Max Boot
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.520]  He wants a place on the international stage
[35:03.520 --> 35:06.520]  He wants to be recognized as an equal by the president of the United States
[35:06.520 --> 35:08.520]  He wants to be seen as a nuclear power
[35:08.520 --> 35:09.520]  And he's achieving all that
[35:09.520 --> 35:12.520]  This is a tremendous propaganda victory for him
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.520]  Now Scott just suggested it was a huge victory for Donald Trump
[35:15.520 --> 35:16.520]  Simply to come to the summit
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.520]  Well, you know, I beg to differ
[35:18.520 --> 35:22.520]  Because in fact, any previous president could have easily had a summit
[35:22.520 --> 35:24.520]  With any previous leader of North Korea
[35:24.520 --> 35:29.520]  Because they've all been very eager to be legitimated by the president of the United States
[35:29.520 --> 35:32.520]  And Donald Trump is the first one to agree to do that
[35:32.520 --> 35:34.520]  Well, I mean, this was just a fiasco at the G7
[35:34.520 --> 35:36.520]  I've never seen anything like this
[35:36.520 --> 35:38.520]  And the contrast is all the greater
[35:38.520 --> 35:42.520]  When we see the way that Donald Trump is glad-handing Kim Jong-un
[35:42.520 --> 35:44.520]  Who is the enslaver of his people
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.520]  Yeah, that's right, no, it was his grandfather
[35:46.520 --> 35:49.520]  And it was the big banks that put Mao in and the CIA
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.520]  And they wouldn't let MacArthur defeat the Communist Chinese
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.520]  So it was the West splitting that country up with Communist China
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.520]  And letting China use it for raw materials that did this
[35:57.520 --> 35:59.520]  And now Trump's trying to fix it
[35:59.520 --> 36:02.520]  Max Boot, it's you guys that launched all the illegal Iraq wars
[36:02.520 --> 36:04.520]  It's you guys that helped get Bill Clinton elected
[36:04.520 --> 36:06.520]  It's you guys that helped get Obama elected
[36:06.520 --> 36:08.520]  It's you guys that told us about the New World Order
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.520]  You're the anti-gun, anti-family, anti-American, neocon Republicans
[36:12.520 --> 36:15.520]  That when Trotsky got his butt kicked out of Russia
[36:15.520 --> 36:18.520]  He came here to Mexico and got killed
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.520]  And then Crystal's dad and all of them came up here
[36:22.520 --> 36:25.520]  Literally on record and set up the neocons
[36:25.520 --> 36:27.520]  To take over the Republican Party
[36:27.520 --> 36:30.520]  Well, guess what? We're taking it back from you, Max Boot
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.520]  Now, incredible journalist, researcher
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.520]  Katie Hopkins, contributor to Fox News
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.520]  Is in St. Petersburg, Russia
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.520]  And I want to get her take on this
[36:39.520 --> 36:42.520]  And her whole geopolitical view
[36:42.520 --> 36:43.520]  I mean, what do you think, Katie?
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.520]  Now the neocons, the Democrats
[36:45.520 --> 36:47.520]  All the usual suspects of combined forces
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.520]  And they're saying anybody cut it down this
[36:49.520 --> 36:51.520]  This means nothing, this is bad
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.520]  Just a few months ago, they were saying
[36:53.520 --> 36:55.520]  If Trump could do this, he'd go down in history
[36:55.520 --> 36:57.520]  As a great president, but he couldn't do it
[36:57.520 --> 36:59.520]  So I'm telling you, he could find the cure for cancer
[36:59.520 --> 37:01.520]  And they'd get upset, Katie
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.520]  It's a joy watching their heads explode today
[37:05.520 --> 37:07.520]  Because they cannot cope with this at all
[37:07.520 --> 37:09.520]  And it's been really fun
[37:09.520 --> 37:11.520]  Watching them try to cover it
[37:11.520 --> 37:13.520]  They pull the same faces that they pulled
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.520]  When we got Brexit, when Trump was elected
[37:16.520 --> 37:19.520]  They just don't know how to articulate the words
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.520]  Because they can't bear that he's
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.520]  That's what I want to see today
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.520]  Is the piece prize
[37:27.520 --> 37:29.520]  Because, of course, it's me now
[37:29.520 --> 37:32.520]  That Trump all did the Nobel Peace
[37:32.520 --> 37:35.520]  Having this first meet
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.520]  But, of course, they could never give the prize to a president
[37:39.520 --> 37:42.520]  I think it's a joint state for any Trump supporter
[37:42.520 --> 37:44.520]  And yet another reminder that
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.520]  If you want to silence a Democrat
[37:46.520 --> 37:48.520]  All you have to ask them is
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.520]  Who have you got to beat Trump in 2020
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.520]  And they don't have an answer
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.520]  Katie Hobbs is our guest
[37:55.520 --> 37:57.520]  I am in Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
[37:57.520 --> 37:59.520]  She is in St. Petersburg
[37:59.520 --> 38:02.520]  Right there at the heart of a Russian culture
[38:02.520 --> 38:04.520]  And so much of European culture
[38:04.520 --> 38:06.520]  As well
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.520]  And her skype's a little choppy to me
[38:08.520 --> 38:11.520]  Is that choppy to you or is it just choppy to me, Kroep?
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.520]  Okay, we'll try to work on that chop here
[38:16.520 --> 38:19.520]  Because Katie's always so riveting with her information
[38:19.520 --> 38:21.520]  Looking at this
[38:21.520 --> 38:23.520]  We can pull these articles up, Katie
[38:23.520 --> 38:26.520]  Just six months ago, and just three months ago
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.520]  They were saying how dare Trump be saying
[38:28.520 --> 38:30.520]  Rocket man, we may have to take you out
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.520]  Fire and fury, how dare you
[38:32.520 --> 38:34.520]  Be talking bad about Kim Jong Un
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.520]  He's a leader, CNN said
[38:36.520 --> 38:38.520]  He's a great man
[38:38.520 --> 38:40.520]  I mean, even conservative media said
[38:40.520 --> 38:42.520]  My God, you're like cheerleading
[38:42.520 --> 38:44.520]  For Kim Jong Un
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.520]  That was the process of bringing him to the table
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.520]  As you know, Katie, the art of the deal
[38:48.520 --> 38:50.520]  So we should get the clips of them saying
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.520]  Don't ever be nice to Kim Jong Un
[38:52.520 --> 38:54.520]  Now they're saying it's bad to be nice to Kim Jong Un
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.520]  To get him to come in out of the dark
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.520]  Katie?
[38:58.520 --> 39:00.520]  Absolutely, and I think it's something
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.520]  For anybody that's a Trump supporter
[39:02.520 --> 39:04.520]  Like you or I knew
[39:04.520 --> 39:06.520]  When we saw that the meeting was called off
[39:06.520 --> 39:08.520]  I tweeted, other people tweeted
[39:08.520 --> 39:11.520]  To say, you know, we knew that was going to be back on
[39:11.520 --> 39:13.520]  We knew this meeting would happen
[39:13.520 --> 39:15.520]  This is just the way he works
[39:16.520 --> 39:18.520]  Explain that to people that don't know
[39:18.520 --> 39:20.520]  It's very formulaic, it's very straight shooting
[39:20.520 --> 39:22.520]  It's why people now, foreign leaders
[39:22.520 --> 39:24.520]  People are starting to like Trump
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.520]  It's just what you say, it's what you get
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.520]  If you're going to attack you, if you don't give up the nukes
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  Of money and hotels and your people being rich
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  Or we're going to invade you
[39:32.520 --> 39:34.520]  Because you're threatening everybody
[39:34.520 --> 39:36.520]  You're either going to die or you're going to be rich
[39:36.520 --> 39:38.520]  And live long and prosper
[39:38.520 --> 39:40.520]  Explain the art of the deal to the Lib Tards
[39:40.520 --> 39:42.520]  Yes, so the art of the deal
[39:42.520 --> 39:44.520]  Is always negotiating from a position of strength
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.520]  And you've seen that repeatedly with Trump's work
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.520]  So he will talk about
[39:48.520 --> 39:50.520]  Adding tariffs, of course
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.520]  To oil and gas or steel or whatever
[39:52.520 --> 39:54.520]  In order to put himself in the strength
[39:54.520 --> 39:56.520]  In the position of strength
[39:56.520 --> 39:58.520]  At the negotiating table
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.520]  Meaning other countries have to come
[40:00.520 --> 40:02.520]  To Trump to beg for favors
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.520]  So he's completely turning the tables
[40:04.520 --> 40:06.520]  For America, as he says
[40:06.520 --> 40:08.520]  For too long America has been everybody's piggy bank
[40:08.520 --> 40:10.520]  Everybody's been raiding America
[40:10.520 --> 40:12.520]  He makes it so that America
[40:12.520 --> 40:14.520]  Is in the position of strength
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.520]  Everybody else has to come
[40:16.520 --> 40:18.520]  Crawling to him
[40:18.520 --> 40:20.520]  For him to allow them into the deal
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.520]  And that's exactly what he did
[40:22.520 --> 40:24.520]  With North Korea as well
[40:24.520 --> 40:26.520]  Remember the point where he called off that meeting
[40:26.520 --> 40:28.520]  In order to reassert
[40:28.520 --> 40:30.520]  His position as the position
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.520]  Of strength and for Kim Jong-un
[40:32.520 --> 40:34.520]  To feel in some way
[40:34.520 --> 40:36.520]  Grateful that that meeting happened
[40:36.520 --> 40:38.520]  And we'll see him carry on
[40:38.520 --> 40:40.520]  Doing this throughout his presidency
[40:40.520 --> 40:42.520]  Which is putting Americans back
[40:42.520 --> 40:44.520]  Where he said he would
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.520]  Which is putting America first
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.520]  And it's been brilliant to see the
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.520]  Unix of Europe
[40:50.520 --> 40:52.520]  Merkel, Macron
[40:52.520 --> 40:54.520]  Absolutely fall apart
[40:54.520 --> 40:56.520]  I think you'll have seen that picture
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.520]  Of Donald Trump at the meeting table
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.520]  I was about to ask them
[41:00.520 --> 41:02.520]  To pull it up from my Twitter
[41:02.520 --> 41:04.520]  I know you tweeted it as well
[41:04.520 --> 41:06.520]  From last Saturday or so
[41:06.520 --> 41:08.520]  Where they're all around the table
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.520]  He's sitting down like the king
[41:10.520 --> 41:12.520]  No need to be on a throne
[41:12.520 --> 41:14.520]  He's sitting there with his arms crossed
[41:14.520 --> 41:16.520]  And of course there's video of it as well
[41:16.520 --> 41:18.520]  You've got the Chinese delegation behind him
[41:18.520 --> 41:20.520]  You've got the Japanese
[41:20.520 --> 41:22.520]  And again the United States
[41:22.520 --> 41:24.520]  Paid for this whole world system
[41:24.520 --> 41:26.520]  But then now all Trump
[41:26.520 --> 41:28.520]  Is saying is listen, we're not going to be the only ones
[41:28.520 --> 41:30.520]  Paying for it anymore and they're having to come to their knees
[41:30.520 --> 41:32.520]  And they don't know what to do, please continue
[41:32.520 --> 41:34.520]  It was a perfect picture
[41:34.520 --> 41:36.520]  It's a picture I think that perfectly
[41:36.520 --> 41:38.520]  Encapsulated Trump's presidency to date
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.520]  You've got Merkel leaning on the table
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.520]  Macron trying to get
[41:42.520 --> 41:44.520]  His little face in the picture
[41:44.520 --> 41:46.520]  Because he's desperate for attention at all times
[41:46.520 --> 41:48.520]  And then right in the back corner
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.520]  Just like meat in the room
[41:50.520 --> 41:52.520]  You know, irrelevance
[41:52.520 --> 41:54.520]  There's Justin Trudeau from Canada
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.520]  Who Trump spectacularly knows
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.520]  And then Trump's there
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.520]  He's very much the central figure in that room
[42:00.520 --> 42:02.520]  He's got the Japanese with him
[42:02.520 --> 42:04.520]  It's all about Trump
[42:04.520 --> 42:06.520]  And in many ways that's so true of the whole
[42:06.520 --> 42:08.520]  Media narrative right now
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.520]  It is all about Trump
[42:10.520 --> 42:12.520]  And that's one thing CNN can't see
[42:12.520 --> 42:14.520]  And the liberals can't see
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.520]  They might want to hate him
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.520]  Stop talking about him
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.520]  And that's only going to do great things for 2020
[42:20.520 --> 42:22.520]  But it's amazing to see
[42:22.520 --> 42:24.520]  How weak Europe is right now
[42:24.520 --> 42:26.520]  It's incredibly divided
[42:26.520 --> 42:28.520]  The populists are on the march
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.520]  You know, we've seen the league victory
[42:30.520 --> 42:32.520]  In Italy, very strong now
[42:32.520 --> 42:34.520]  Pushing away the migrants
[42:34.520 --> 42:36.520]  That's what I wanted to hit next
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.520]  Segwaying out of Korea with Katie Hopkins
[42:38.520 --> 42:40.520]  I want to now get into
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.520]  The fall of the authoritarian Europe
[42:42.520 --> 42:44.520]  How Russia ties into that
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.520]  And when the Brexit, she's put at the heart of that
[42:46.520 --> 42:48.520]  And more, Katie Hopkins, Fox contributor
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.520]  Will tell you her websites and more

[46:56.520 --> 47:18.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:18.520 --> 47:20.520]  We now take you live
[47:20.520 --> 47:22.520]  To the Central Texas Command Center
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.520]  In the heart of the resistance
[47:26.520 --> 47:28.520]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide
[47:32.520 --> 47:42.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:42.520 --> 47:44.520]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen
[47:44.520 --> 47:46.520]  On the heels of the historic summit
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.520]  They said it would never happen
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.520]  They said the economy would never go past 3%
[47:50.520 --> 47:52.520]  And the EU would never start breaking up
[47:52.520 --> 47:54.520]  Katie Hopkins isn't just a journalist
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.520]  Isn't just a box news analyst
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.520]  Isn't just a best-selling author
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.520]  A researcher, a writer
[48:00.520 --> 48:02.520]  She's also, I mean, I'm what I would call
[48:02.520 --> 48:04.520]  Just eyes in the ears, top analyst
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.520]  And for everything I'm seeing, the EU
[48:06.520 --> 48:08.520]  Is now in full collapse
[48:08.520 --> 48:10.520]  They finally admitted it's in full collapse
[48:10.520 --> 48:12.520]  Soros is panicking
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.520]  A, is that accurate Katie Hopkins?
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.520]  B, break down the waterfront for us
[48:16.520 --> 48:18.520]  And what do you think comes next
[48:18.520 --> 48:20.520]  To the unelected authoritarian
[48:20.520 --> 48:22.520]  EU? And then Owen Schreuer's in the ATX
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.520]  Studio, Owen, feel free to jump in any time
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.520]  Katie Hopkins
[48:26.520 --> 48:28.520]  It's absolutely correct
[48:28.520 --> 48:30.520]  I think Europe is as weak
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.520]  As it's ever been and more divided
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.520]  Than it's ever been in peacetime
[48:34.520 --> 48:36.520]  So just how that breaks down
[48:36.520 --> 48:38.520]  For you in Italy
[48:38.520 --> 48:40.520]  The populists are resurgence
[48:40.520 --> 48:42.520]  The five-star
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.520]  Plus the league just got in
[48:44.520 --> 48:46.520]  So a populist movement
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.520]  Supported by Putin and others
[48:48.520 --> 48:50.520]  And in a really great move
[48:50.520 --> 48:52.520]  That supported really widely
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.520]  Across Europe, they've just rejected
[48:54.520 --> 48:56.520]  An NGO vote, a
[48:56.520 --> 48:58.520]  Charity rescue vote
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.520]  Across the Med, 629
[49:00.520 --> 49:02.520]  Africans, Libyans
[49:02.520 --> 49:04.520]  On board, and they've said
[49:04.520 --> 49:06.520]  No, you will not dock
[49:06.520 --> 49:08.520]  At this Italian port, Matteo
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.520]  Salvini, fulfilling
[49:10.520 --> 49:12.520]  His election promises saying
[49:12.520 --> 49:14.520]  No more migrants to Italy
[49:14.520 --> 49:16.520]  Fantastic win for the right
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.520]  Wing for populists like myself
[49:18.520 --> 49:20.520]  You've got Victor Orban of course
[49:20.520 --> 49:22.520]  In Hungary, he's absolutely
[49:22.520 --> 49:24.520]  Forcing ahead, secure
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.520]  Borders, Christian culture
[49:26.520 --> 49:28.520]  No Muslim invasion
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.520]  Of Hungary, and then
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.520]  In Austria, they've just
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.520]  Shut down seven mosques
[49:34.520 --> 49:36.520]  And they are going to repatriate
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.520]  The extremist imams that
[49:38.520 --> 49:40.520]  Have been preaching out of the mosques
[49:40.520 --> 49:42.520]  So if you see that's this pattern
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.520]  Building of the populist
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.520]  Resurgence, Merkel was crippled
[49:46.520 --> 49:48.520]  In the polls, the alternative
[49:48.520 --> 49:50.520]  For Deutschland, the populist
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.520]  They are the main opposition
[49:52.520 --> 49:54.520]  Party in Germany, so
[49:54.520 --> 49:56.520]  Everywhere we look, there is hope
[49:56.520 --> 49:58.520]  Now, and we have our little heads up
[49:58.520 --> 50:00.520]  And I really believe with the Spanish
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.520]  Just taking that migrant vote
[50:02.520 --> 50:04.520]  Saying yes, okay, we'll take it
[50:04.520 --> 50:06.520]  The Spanish will be the next to see
[50:06.520 --> 50:08.520]  The populists in power in about
[50:08.520 --> 50:10.520]  A year's time, and I look forward to that as well
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.520]  Katie, you are reading my mind
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.520]  I was telling them earlier
[50:14.520 --> 50:16.520]  Pull up the photo of Trump with everybody
[50:16.520 --> 50:18.520]  Like he's the king, and they're in the court
[50:18.520 --> 50:20.520]  Because we hold the power of economics
[50:20.520 --> 50:22.520]  And history, and we've been financing these globalists
[50:22.520 --> 50:24.520]  And I was just now telling them
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.520]  To be a text message, because I'm in Hawaii
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  They're in Texas, you're in St. Petersburg
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.520]  Or Russia, for those that joined us
[50:30.520 --> 50:32.520]  I'm texting them saying pull up
[50:32.520 --> 50:34.520]  The Zodiac boats landing
[50:34.520 --> 50:36.520]  Just like the old African invasions
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.520]  Of the Moors
[50:38.520 --> 50:40.520]  10 million people, Soros publicly
[50:40.520 --> 50:42.520]  Funding this, saying
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.520]  We're going to Islamify Europe
[50:44.520 --> 50:46.520]  I mean, this is a true invasion
[50:46.520 --> 50:48.520]  Not trying to help these people
[50:48.520 --> 50:50.520]  That's why they're all military aged men
[50:50.520 --> 50:52.520]  They're saying come, invade
[50:52.520 --> 50:54.520]  How did the left think that everybody would accept this
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.520]  Because I saw the thing in Germany
[50:56.520 --> 50:58.520]  Where they had the moment of silence
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.520]  It's on infowars.com
[51:00.520 --> 51:02.520]  Talk about that right now
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.520]  The thing in Germany that just came out
[51:04.520 --> 51:06.520]  Where they had the moment of silence
[51:06.520 --> 51:08.520]  And the left is chanting against her
[51:08.520 --> 51:10.520]  Like when the illegal alien shoots
[51:10.520 --> 51:12.520]  The young woman in the back in San Francisco
[51:12.520 --> 51:14.520]  And the media, you know, defends that
[51:14.520 --> 51:16.520]  And the jury lets them go
[51:16.520 --> 51:18.520]  This is getting insane
[51:18.520 --> 51:20.520]  Tell us about this EU Parliament video we're showing
[51:20.520 --> 51:22.520]  Absolutely, so
[51:22.520 --> 51:24.520]  I think one of the things we've really noticed
[51:24.520 --> 51:26.520]  In terms of this migrant crossing
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.520]  Across the Med
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.520]  This sense, finally
[51:30.520 --> 51:32.520]  So many people like myself since 2014
[51:32.520 --> 51:34.520]  Have been saying stop the boats
[51:34.520 --> 51:36.520]  We must stop the boats
[51:36.520 --> 51:38.520]  Criticised for saying that
[51:38.520 --> 51:40.520]  I spent a lot of time in southern Italy and Sicily
[51:40.520 --> 51:42.520]  Trying to stop the boats
[51:42.520 --> 51:44.520]  And still they come
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.520]  So I think there's a real tension now
[51:46.520 --> 51:48.520]  Macron from France is criticising Italy
[51:48.520 --> 51:50.520]  For not taking the boat
[51:50.520 --> 51:52.520]  All the while
[51:52.520 --> 51:54.520]  Of course Spain will take the boat
[51:54.520 --> 51:56.520]  But the people in Spain aren't happy about that
[51:56.520 --> 51:58.520]  So what we've got are these globalist leaders
[51:58.520 --> 52:00.520]  Fighting against their own people
[52:00.520 --> 52:02.520]  People don't want
[52:02.520 --> 52:04.520]  These migrants in their country
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.520]  Germany's just seen what's happened
[52:06.520 --> 52:08.520]  Where a migrant
[52:08.520 --> 52:10.520]  With a previous conviction for rape
[52:10.520 --> 52:12.520]  He took that 14 year old girl
[52:12.520 --> 52:14.520]  She was strangled and raped
[52:14.520 --> 52:16.520]  And dumped in bushes by the rail tracks
[52:16.520 --> 52:18.520]  She was from the Jewish community
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.520]  And of course it's one of the problems
[52:20.520 --> 52:22.520]  We're seeing a lot in Germany and other places
[52:22.520 --> 52:24.520]  It's the Jewish community
[52:24.520 --> 52:26.520]  Thanks to Soros bringing over these Muslim migrants
[52:26.520 --> 52:28.520]  It's the Jewish community
[52:28.520 --> 52:30.520]  That are persecuted once again
[52:30.520 --> 52:32.520]  And a number of people I know
[52:32.520 --> 52:34.520]  In Germany are looking to migrate
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.520]  Out of Germany again
[52:36.520 --> 52:38.520]  They say that this is the second wave
[52:38.520 --> 52:40.520]  Of the Jewish people needing to leave Germany
[52:40.520 --> 52:42.520]  Which is frightening
[52:42.520 --> 52:44.520]  And I also get emails
[52:44.520 --> 52:46.520]  I sent one to your team earlier
[52:46.520 --> 52:48.520]  If they're able to pull it up
[52:48.520 --> 52:50.520]  Very sad emails Alex
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.520]  From elderly men and women
[52:52.520 --> 52:54.520]  The age of my parents
[52:54.520 --> 52:56.520]  Proud Brits
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.520]  And they say to me
[52:58.520 --> 53:00.520]  They say that I'm glad I'm old
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.520]  I'm glad I'm old
[53:02.520 --> 53:04.520]  And I won't live to see my country fall
[53:04.520 --> 53:06.520]  And they feel sorry for young people
[53:06.520 --> 53:08.520]  In Britain and Europe
[53:08.520 --> 53:10.520]  Because their country will never be
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.520]  The country that they used to know
[53:12.520 --> 53:14.520]  And those are really hard emails
[53:14.520 --> 53:16.520]  To get actually from the elderly
[53:16.520 --> 53:18.520]  I never know quite how to respond
[53:18.520 --> 53:20.520]  Well it's the sad resignation
[53:20.520 --> 53:22.520]  But here's the good news
[53:22.520 --> 53:24.520]  The spirit of liberty is coming back
[53:24.520 --> 53:26.520]  The globalists admit this is an organized invasion
[53:26.520 --> 53:28.520]  To quote in Christianity
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.520]  We have George Soros statements
[53:30.520 --> 53:32.520]  We had Peter Southerland who died this year
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.520]  His statements, these are the admitted
[53:34.520 --> 53:36.520]  Insane statements
[53:36.520 --> 53:38.520]  Why do you think the left and these billionaires
[53:38.520 --> 53:40.520]  Have such a hatred of the west
[53:40.520 --> 53:42.520]  And hatred of Christianity
[53:42.520 --> 53:44.520]  And almost like a cuckolding or a fetish
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.520]  I guess like a satanist wants to torture a child
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.520]  For no reason, they want to destroy something good
[53:48.520 --> 53:50.520]  It'd be one thing if these were real migrants
[53:50.520 --> 53:52.520]  And some migration and people
[53:52.520 --> 53:54.520]  Oh that's wonderful, but total invasion
[53:54.520 --> 53:56.520]  It's saying we're going to overwrite Europe
[53:56.520 --> 53:58.520]  Hollywood, every movie demonizing
[53:58.520 --> 54:00.520]  Christianity or families
[54:00.520 --> 54:02.520]  The top educator in England as you know
[54:02.520 --> 54:04.520]  Just two weeks ago said, thank god
[54:04.520 --> 54:06.520]  We're getting rid of the family, the nuclear family's bad
[54:06.520 --> 54:08.520]  The judge says, well you're seven times more likely
[54:08.520 --> 54:10.520]  To be in prison if you're not
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.520]  I mean what is this full out assault
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.520]  On anything normal
[54:14.520 --> 54:16.520]  It seems to me
[54:16.520 --> 54:18.520]  Observing leaders
[54:18.520 --> 54:20.520]  Across Europe in particular
[54:20.520 --> 54:22.520]  Because they're the ones that have been so determined
[54:22.520 --> 54:24.520]  To see the fall of the Christian culture
[54:24.520 --> 54:26.520]  And so determined
[54:26.520 --> 54:28.520]  To perpetuate this globalist agenda
[54:28.520 --> 54:30.520]  It seems to me that
[54:30.520 --> 54:32.520]  Managed decline, you know, that phrase
[54:32.520 --> 54:34.520]  Of managed decline
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.520]  They make just as much profit
[54:36.520 --> 54:38.520]  They make just as much
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.520]  Political gain by overseeing
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.520]  Managed decline
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.520]  As they do for fighting
[54:44.520 --> 54:46.520]  For anything, so whereas you guys have
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.520]  Trump fighting for America
[54:48.520 --> 54:50.520]  Fighting for Americans
[54:50.520 --> 54:52.520]  We have your
[54:52.520 --> 54:54.520]  Yeah, it's just as easy
[54:54.520 --> 54:56.520]  For our guys to manage the decline
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.520]  Of their countries and make that a profitable
[54:58.520 --> 55:00.520]  Thing for themselves politically
[55:00.520 --> 55:02.520]  Because the more Muslims you import
[55:02.520 --> 55:04.520]  If you're able to attract the Muslim vote
[55:04.520 --> 55:06.520]  Of course you're going to get yourself
[55:06.520 --> 55:08.520]  Re-elected and that's exactly what you see
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.520]  In America, in California
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.520]  With this push for illegals
[55:12.520 --> 55:14.520]  Because it's the only way Democrats to know
[55:14.520 --> 55:16.520]  To get themselves re-elected
[55:16.520 --> 55:18.520]  Is to import voters that will
[55:18.520 --> 55:20.520]  Of course vote for them
[55:20.520 --> 55:22.520]  But the best laid plans of mice and men
[55:22.520 --> 55:24.520]  Often go astray, Katie Hopkins
[55:24.520 --> 55:26.520]  Of Hopkinsworld.com
[55:26.520 --> 55:28.520]  So let me ask you this question
[55:28.520 --> 55:30.520]  As the EU accelerates its collapse
[55:30.520 --> 55:32.520]  As they threaten Eastern Europe with
[55:32.520 --> 55:34.520]  100,000 euro fines
[55:34.520 --> 55:36.520]  They don't take any illegals
[55:36.520 --> 55:38.520]  It seems it's only wagging people up faster
[55:38.520 --> 55:40.520]  Looking at the tea leaves
[55:40.520 --> 55:42.520]  What do you expect to see happening in the next few years?
[55:42.520 --> 55:44.520]  It seems like globalism is just being routed
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.520]  Yes, and this is the exciting thing
[55:46.520 --> 55:48.520]  And that's what that picture said to me
[55:48.520 --> 55:50.520]  Of Trump with his arms crossed
[55:50.520 --> 55:52.520]  With Merkel and Macron and Trudeau
[55:52.520 --> 55:54.520]  In the back of the room stood there with Japan
[55:54.520 --> 55:56.520]  You'll have heard, given that I'm reporting
[55:56.520 --> 55:58.520]  From Russia for you today
[55:58.520 --> 56:00.520]  You'll have heard Trump say very clearly
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.520]  Very carefully
[56:02.520 --> 56:04.520]  On a number of occasions
[56:04.520 --> 56:06.520]  Putin should be back in the room
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.520]  Putin should be back with the G8
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.520]  And that's precisely what I see happening
[56:10.520 --> 56:12.520]  A realignment between Putin
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.520]  America and Japan
[56:14.520 --> 56:16.520]  As the fight back against the globalists
[56:16.520 --> 56:18.520]  Really begins
[56:18.520 --> 56:20.520]  Where people here in Russia
[56:20.520 --> 56:22.520]  They believe they are Russian first
[56:22.520 --> 56:24.520]  And they will put the Russian culture first
[56:24.520 --> 56:26.520]  And they are 85% Christians
[56:26.520 --> 56:28.520]  Here in St. Petersburg
[56:28.520 --> 56:30.520]  Same for America with Trump
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.520]  And I think Japan coming in very nicely
[56:32.520 --> 56:34.520]  This is the fight back
[56:34.520 --> 56:36.520]  Against the globalists
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  And this is where it all starts
[56:38.520 --> 56:40.520]  And I'm thoroughly thrilled and excited by it
[56:40.520 --> 56:42.520]  That's right, well Japan's taking
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.520]  These just like Saudi Arabia
[56:44.520 --> 56:46.520]  And Japan, you look at the photos
[56:46.520 --> 56:48.520]  But also policy, South Korea
[56:48.520 --> 56:50.520]  Fully aligned with us
[56:50.520 --> 56:52.520]  Australia is now aligning the UK
[56:52.520 --> 56:54.520]  Leading the way with Brexit
[56:54.520 --> 56:56.520]  So it's the UK, the United States
[56:56.520 --> 56:58.520]  A few pockets in Europe waking up
[56:58.520 --> 57:00.520]  Australia
[57:00.520 --> 57:02.520]  And just free market people worldwide
[57:02.520 --> 57:04.520]  Brazil starting to wake up
[57:04.520 --> 57:06.520]  Aligning against the communist Chinese
[57:06.520 --> 57:08.520]  The radical Islamists
[57:08.520 --> 57:10.520]  The corrupt Vatican
[57:10.520 --> 57:12.520]  And I think we're going to win this
[57:12.520 --> 57:14.520]  Katie Hopkins, we're going to come back in just two minutes
[57:14.520 --> 57:16.520]  To five more minutes with you

[57:20.520 --> 57:22.520]  You also have it on your Twitter
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.520]  We're going to play some of that when we come back
[57:24.520 --> 57:26.520]  And get Owen Schreuer to pop in with his take
[57:26.520 --> 57:28.520]  Katie Hopkins at Twitter

[1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  I'm also talking to his crew later today
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:00.520]  How that's ignited people
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  How that's awakened people
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.520]  And other tidbits of what you've observed
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  There in Christian Russia
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:08.520]  Thank you, so I just wanted to update you
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  With some breaking news
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:12.520]  This is in the UK
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:14.520]  And today the House of Lords were voting on Brexit
[1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:16.520]  And it's been very tense
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:18.520]  It's about whether a Parliament
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:20.520]  Will get a final meaningful vote
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.520]  On Brexit which meant
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.520]  The Parliament could have overturned Brexit
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:26.520]  So the Remainers could have
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:28.520]  Managed to have a final say
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:30.520]  On the Brexit I voted for
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:32.520]  And Brexiteers voted for
[1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:34.520]  And it's just been announced
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:36.520]  Breaking news, Parliament will not get
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:38.520]  A meaningful vote on the final
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:40.520]  Brexit deal after MPs voted
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520]  To reject the House of Lords amendment
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:44.520]  So what that means is Theresa May
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:46.520]  Goes into this final negotiating round
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:48.520]  With the EU with a much strengthened hand
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:50.520]  Because Parliament will not
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:52.520]  Get a final say
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:54.520]  On the deal and that's a very great thing
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:56.520]  For Brexiteers like myself, so sorry for that
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.520]  But yeah, back to you
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:00.520]  Well, no, please don't say sorry
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:02.520]  We should have led with that
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:04.520]  I didn't even realize that that vote had already come up
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:06.520]  Wow, awesome
[1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:08.520]  I'll say that before I get to Tommy
[1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:10.520]  Because he's important, but wow
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:12.520]  That'd be good news for him as well
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.520]  Just recapping that
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:16.520]  So this is a big victory for sovereignty
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.520]  Yes, so MPs voted
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:20.520]  By 324 votes
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:22.520]  To 298
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:24.520]  A majority of 26
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:26.520]  To reject the amendment
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:28.520]  Past in the Lords
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.520]  Enabling Parliament to take charge
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.520]  Of the negotiating strategy
[1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:34.520]  If MPs voted against the Brexit deal
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:36.520]  That will not happen
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:38.520]  Parliament will not be able
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:40.520]  To take charge of the negotiating strategy
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:42.520]  Which means a much better deal
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  For Brexiteers
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:46.520]  Because we are much more likely to get the Brexit we wanted
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:48.520]  Because MPs
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:50.520]  The people we voted for
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:52.520]  Won't be able to overturn
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:54.520]  The decision of 17.4 million people
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:56.520]  So that's a fantastic thing
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:58.520]  But it does show the House of Lords
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.520]  Working against democracy
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:02.520]  In the UK effectively
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:04.520]  Because the House of Lords
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.520]  Want to put Parliament in control
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:08.520]  And no longer is it actual Lords
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:10.520]  That go back to England
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:12.520]  That's now bureaucratically installed folks
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:14.520]  Almost like the EU permanent bureaucracy
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.520]  It's this dictatorship
[1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:18.520]  It's almost like a communist Politburo
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:20.520]  Oh, absolutely, and I can see
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:22.520]  In my lifetime the House of Lords being abolished
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:24.520]  Absolutely, the British people
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:26.520]  Aren't going to take this lying down at all
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  Most of them are geriatrics
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:30.520]  Over the age of 85
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.520]  Exploring because they're all doubly incontinent
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  So it's time they were all got abolished
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:36.520]  I totally agree, they need to abolish it
[1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  And create another House of Parliament
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:40.520]  You need two systems
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.520]  They all got told last week
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.520]  Sleeping while they're in there
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:46.520]  They get their $500 expenses today
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  I know it's night time
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.520]  Over in Russia and you've got important things to do
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:52.520]  But we've got to do the Tommy Robinson update
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:54.520]  We've got a one minute break
[1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:56.520]  And then I'm going to come back and just give me two minutes
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  On how Tommy is doing
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.520]  I'm not going to do your video, but you'll be gone
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.520]  Katie, thank you so much for just in
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:04.520]  50 seconds we had going to break
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:06.520]  What's the spirit in Russia right now?
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:08.520]  It's fantastic over here
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.520]  We have this idea that Putin's a monster
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:12.520]  It doesn't seem like that
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:14.520]  Everybody's out in the street partying
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:16.520]  It's white nights here
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.520]  Only four hours of darkness a night
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:20.520]  And it's very open, it's very Russian
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.520]  It's very Catholic and Christian
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.520]  There's no litter on the streets
[1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:26.520]  People here don't over-consume, I love it
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:28.520]  So Russia looks strong from your perspective
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:30.520]  Absolutely, it looks strong
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:32.520]  And I think for too long
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.520]  We've made Putin out to be the monster
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.520]  And I don't see a monster here at all
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:38.520]  In fact, I see a Russia very like America
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:40.520]  That's willing to put Russia first
[1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  And that's a positive thing for America
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  And it's a positive thing in the fight against the globalists
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:48.520]  And that makes Hollywood so upset
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:50.520]  Boy, the Hollywood folks that control Russia
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:52.520]  For 80-something years
[1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:54.520]  But that's all coming to an end scumbags
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:56.520]  With Katie Hopkins
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.520]  This is it
[1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:58.520]  Recall 888-2533-139
[1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.520]  Well, this just broke minutes ago
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:24.520]  They have voted
[1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:26.520]  In the UK Parliament to not
[1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.520]  Allow the Brexit to be derailed
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:30.520]  And to have Brexit continue
[1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:32.520]  And to honor the vote of the people
[1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.520]  Despite what Theresa May and the
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.520]  Neocons they've got over there
[1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:38.520]  Doing on the left
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.520]  This is another big defeat for the
[1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:42.520]  Unelected EU bureaucracy
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.520]  This is a big defeat for the globalist
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:46.520]  A big win for nationalism
[1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:48.520]  On the heels of Italy
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:50.520]  Becoming nationalists for the leftist
[1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:52.520]  And nationalist conservative unity government
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520]  You've got elections all over the world
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:56.520]  Similar things happening
[1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:58.520]  Very, very exciting things unfolding
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  Now, Katie Hopkins, journalist
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  Fox News contributor, Hopkinsworld.com
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  She's over at St. Petersburg
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:06.520]  She was just reporting on the Russians
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  Being Christian, vibrant, strong
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:10.520]  Panicking Hollywood
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:12.520]  And the globalist poison dealers
[1:07:12.520 --> 1:07:14.520]  The psychic vampires
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:16.520]  But the sad news is our political prisoners
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.520]  She'll leave us here in a few minutes
[1:07:18.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  We'll air a compilation of free Tommy Robinson
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.520]  And then move to our next big stories
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  But we do have political prisoners
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.520]  They like to make us all political prisoners
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.520]  We forget the EU wants to make it illegal
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:30.520]  To even criticize the EU or talk about
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.520]  How their tax exempt at the top
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:34.520]  The latest on Tommy Robinson
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:36.520]  Yeah, so, you know
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:38.520]  He's inside for 13 months
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:40.520]  And it still is one of those
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:42.520]  Crucial points of argument
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.520]  There's a great deal of people here
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.520]  In the UK that say, well, he knew what he was doing
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:48.520]  He had an order out against him
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:50.520]  He was told not to be outside the court
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.520]  It's contempt of court, he pled guilty
[1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:54.520]  Case closed
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:56.520]  But of course, there's much more rational people
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:58.520]  People like myself who understand
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  That all he was trying to do was shine
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.520]  A light on the Pakistani
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.520]  Majority Pakistani Muslim
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.520]  Grooming gangs, the rape squads
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:08.520]  That have been raping our children
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.520]  And my message to all these people
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  That criticize Tommy is always this
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:14.520]  If he had turned a blind eye
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:16.520]  Just like the police turned a blind eye
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.520]  Just like the social services
[1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:20.520]  Turned a blind eye to the victims
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:22.520]  You know, we wouldn't be in this
[1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:24.520]  Mess in the first place
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.520]  If all those people who had turned a blind eye
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.520]  Continue to speak the truth
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:30.520]  And that's all Tommy Robinson's trying to do
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:32.520]  Is shine a light on this issue
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:34.520]  The idea that he was sentenced
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:36.520]  To 13 months in just
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.520]  5 hours
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.520]  Where was the swift justice for the Muslim
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.520]  Pedophiles that were abusing
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:44.520]  Our children
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:46.520]  And 13 months inside
[1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:48.520]  It's a known fact, some of the people
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  I work with, the work inside prisons
[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:52.520]  That talk to me, they say
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:54.520]  We'll just take one warden
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.520]  Who's paid or bribed by the Muslim gangs
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:58.520]  That control a lot of our prisons
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:00.520]  One warden to be bribed
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:02.520]  To open that cell door
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:04.520]  And Tommy will not survive
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:06.520]  His time inside
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:08.520]  So that's really the worry
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:10.520]  And when I see people criticizing
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:12.520]  Journalists like Majinsky here
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:14.520]  There's a big Majinsky act
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:16.520]  You know, I don't see the UK
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  As being much different
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.520]  The establishment don't like what Tommy Robinson
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.520]  Have to say
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:24.520]  He stands against their ultimate being cowed
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:26.520]  To Islam
[1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:28.520]  And because he got in the way
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:30.520]  They've thrown him inside
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:32.520]  And it's just the same for us
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:34.520]  It's the establishment way of cleansing
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.520]  People whose voices they don't want heard
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.520]  So I don't see any difference between
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:40.520]  Who's leveled at Putin
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.520]  And the actions of Theresa May
[1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:44.520]  And the establishment putting Tommy Robinson inside
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.520]  He definitely needs to be out of prison
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:48.520]  For his own safety
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:50.520]  And there's no reason for him to be behind bars
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.520]  Well, I totally agree with you
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:54.520]  And if the Islamists are so stupid
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  As they've almost killed him before in prison
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:58.520]  To think if they kill him
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.520]  That will defeat him
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.520]  That will only make him 100 times bigger
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:04.520]  It just shows their total and complete disconnect
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:06.520]  But again, people that don't understand
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:08.520]  5-10% of the population
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:10.520]  That votes as a block
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:12.520]  You can then put whatever party you want in
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.520]  Pushing them over the top
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.520]  That's why Europe's rolled out a giant red bloody carpet
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:18.520]  To Islam
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:20.520]  And of course the biggest victim of Islam
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:22.520]  Are Muslims who aren't radical
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  Many Muslims are nice people
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.520]  They're called heretics
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.520]  But the whole orthodoxy is targeting them
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.520]  So I just want to make this point
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:32.520]  Judges using the quote
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.520]  Gag orders inside the courts one thing
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:36.520]  They don't even be out there pointing out
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:38.520]  That there's a trial happening
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:40.520]  That is a absolute violation of jurisprudence
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:42.520]  English common law, our common law is the same thing
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  I know the law, I've talked to lawyers
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.520]  I've talked to lawyers over in your country
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.520]  This is a giant power grab, these denotices
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  All of it, they are using this to suppress speech
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:52.520]  They ban Michael Savage from coming to your country
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.520]  They've asked me when I'm flying
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  Am I going to be political if so
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:58.520]  I can't come in
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:00.520]  And absolutely Russia has targeted a few journalists
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:02.520]  That have been proven to be CIA funded
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:04.520]  Foreign funded
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  Like the rock bands
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:08.520]  They send over their names, I can't even say on air
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:10.520]  Because they have FCC rules
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  But the P riot, they're there
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:14.520]  Admittedly to overthrow the country
[1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:16.520]  Well I don't want China over here
[1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:18.520]  China just got banned from buying up US universities
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:20.520]  And putting out communist Chinese propaganda
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:22.520]  Trump just did that a few weeks ago
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:24.520]  With executive action
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:26.520]  Because that's a foreign power
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.520]  That's what I see Putin doing
[1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.520]  Is going after foreign powers in his country
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:32.520]  But no, in England and the UK
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  It's people standing up for your sovereignty
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  Standing up for your nation
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.520]  Are the ones being targeted and silenced
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:40.520]  That's what I call treason by the government
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.520]  What are you saying, closing?
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:44.520]  Absolutely, I agree with you 100%
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:46.520]  There's this real sense now in the UK
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.520]  That it's the people versus the establishment
[1:11:48.520 --> 1:11:50.520]  The crowds are not dissipating
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:52.520]  They are growing in size
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.520]  In number
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520]  The mainstream media won't report it
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.520]  And I think it will be very interesting
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:01.520]  If Tommy Robinson does make it out of prison alive
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.520]  His voice is going to be louder than ever
[1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  And it's really this resurgent idea
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:08.520]  That the British people are going to be
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.520]  Standing up for Great Britain
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:12.520]  Supported by populists in Europe
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:14.520]  And supported by Donald Trump
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:16.520]  In America and for him and for you
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:18.520]  We're very grateful
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:20.520]  Alright, Hopkinsworld.com
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.520]  Thank you, Katie Hopkins, always amazing
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:24.520]  Thank you
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:26.520]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:28.520]  Robbins is the real deal
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:30.520]  11 years ago finding out
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:32.520]  That we had rape gangs right next door
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.520]  To his tanning salon, he started exposing them
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:36.520]  They got in his face, he got in fist fights with them
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  It's not a win, it's like you've seen all the people
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.520]  Attacking, he fights back, started kicking their ass
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.520]  They were loading girls in cars
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.520]  That's what a normal man does
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.520]  And all these years later, years in prison
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:48.520]  Attack, lost his house, everything
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:50.520]  He's not backing down, it's that leadership
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:52.520]  That ignites real revolutions
[1:12:52.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  And we're going to win
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:56.520]  It makes some big sacrifices
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:58.520]  And Tommy's really made a big one
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  I'm trying to finance him
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:02.520]  An expansion of media with his organization right now
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.520]  And that's just a meeting I'm actually going to have
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.520]  Tomorrow
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  Again, ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:10.520]  I want to do a bunch of stuff, I want to grow
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:12.520]  That's why Soros and Hillary's law firms
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.520]  Are openly suing me, that they brag about it
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:16.520]  The goal
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.520]  They say is to shut us down, the good news is
[1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.520]  The suits are fraudulent, the problem is
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:22.520]  Is they're launching them in areas
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:24.520]  Travis County and other areas where they believe
[1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:26.520]  That they're going to have a group
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:28.520]  Of their own people
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:30.520]  To basically
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:32.520]  Electronically
[1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:34.520]  Lynch me
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:36.520]  It doesn't matter folks, I've already done
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:38.520]  The victories
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.520]  We've already had the, we've already exposed them
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.520]  They're already in flames, they're trying to take us out
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:44.520]  Though we're needed for future battles
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.520]  Now maybe, maybe that's not God's plan
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:48.520]  It's up to you whether
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:50.520]  Info Wars will stand and grow
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:52.520]  Or whether we will be destroyed
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:54.520]  Or reborn or whatever it is
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:56.520]  But right now
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:58.520]  We're in position to do more damage
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:00.520]  To the globalists than we've ever done
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:02.520]  That's why I need all of you, I didn't even plug last hour
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:04.520]  Except for 10 seconds, to go to infowarstore.com
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:06.520]  We have free shipping
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:08.520]  On all of our best selling items, that's got it in this week
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:10.520]  I've extended it one more week, it will end this week
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:12.520]  We've also got
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:14.520]  X2, 50% off, I got a huge run
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:16.520]  We're trying to secure more of the deep earth crystal
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:18.520]  Source of it, but this could be the last run
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.520]  I hope it's not
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.520]  I believe we've got another deeper source
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:24.520]  But we're having it tested right now
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:26.520]  To make sure it's 999999
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:28.520]  Like this
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:30.520]  Okay, these oil drilling companies
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.520]  Put you over a barrel and you're getting it at 7,000, 12,000 feet
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.520]  It's the cleanest, best halogen out there
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:36.520]  Infowarstore.com
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:38.520]  But I've never really, I think I've even done
[1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.520]  50% off by itself before
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.520]  I've done it comboed before
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:44.520]  But I want those of you on the fence
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:46.520]  We know a lot of you already use it
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:48.520]  It's our best selling product along the brain force
[1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:50.520]  They're right neck and neck
[1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:52.520]  But a lot of you
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:54.520]  Don't order things until
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:56.520]  They're, you know, it's the lowest price ever
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.520]  And I want to get you as new customers
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.520]  I want you to see what iodine's done for me and others
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:02.520]  Real iodine, not bound to garbage
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  But pure iodine, remember when BuzzFeed had it tested
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:06.520]  They said it's weird, it's not this type
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  Or that type or this type, it's just iodine
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:10.520]  They didn't realize what they were saying
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  Yes, it's really pure
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:14.520]  It's atomic, it's really
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  Calls it atomic?
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:18.520]  This is as close to atomic as you're going to get
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:20.520]  InfoWarsLive.com
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:22.520]  By atomic, it's not radioactive, it's on the periodic table

[1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.520]  Healthcare reform is confusing
[1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.520]  But whether it's finding an affordable
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.520]  Interance plan, keeping your doctor
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:34.520]  Or being able to afford needed prescriptions
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:36.520]  Navigating the healthcare system has become
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:38.520]  A challenge
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.520]  Control your own healthcare costs and choices

[1:17:04.520 --> 1:17:06.520]  Pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:32.520]  Try ignoring this crowd
[1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:56.520]  Now for playing video from the Free Tommy Robinson March.
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  Despite known risks to his freedom
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.520]  He persisted reporting known facts
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  From the street outside a court in Leeds
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  Where a rape squad faced justice
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:10.520]  He was arrested simply for being there
[1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.520]  Arrested, charged and sentenced
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.520]  In five hours
[1:21:14.520 --> 1:21:16.520]  Given 13 months inside Hull Prison
[1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.520]  For contempt of court
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:20.520]  Together with a sinister media
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:22.520]  Band to silence reporting
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.520]  Of anything to do with his story
[1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:26.520]  And so, here today
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:28.520]  Outside Whitehall
[1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:30.520]  People protest
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:32.520]  Some are here to protest
[1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.520]  The injustice of his sentence
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.520]  The moment we live in a country
[1:21:36.520 --> 1:21:38.520]  Where you can get locked up
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:40.520]  For reporting on industrialised
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.520]  Rape of young white girls
[1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:44.520]  The moment we reach that point
[1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:46.520]  Is a complete disaster
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:48.520]  And the moment we reach a point
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:50.520]  Where you can't criticise something
[1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:52.520]  That's the moment we lose
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.520]  Who we are
[1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:56.520]  This country is known
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.520]  For free speech
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:00.520]  And people being able to say
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  And do what they want
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.520]  And it has to be protected
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.520]  Many can see the cruelty
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:08.520]  Of a system where rapists
[1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:10.520]  And pedophiles walk free
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:12.520]  But a journalist reporting on them
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:14.520]  Is jailed
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:16.520]  There's a problem with a grooming epidemic
[1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:18.520]  From the Muslim community
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:20.520]  And that needs to be tackled
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:22.520]  And there is also
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:24.520]  A massive problem with an epidemic extremism
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:26.520]  I know because I've grown up with Muslims
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:28.520]  We can't say anything about Pakistan
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:30.520]  And where it's from
[1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:32.520]  When we speak about these
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:34.520]  We're called racists
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:36.520]  We're called Islamophobic
[1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:38.520]  But there is something else
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:40.520]  The crowd are drawn by something bigger than Tommy
[1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:42.520]  Something greater than one man
[1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:44.520]  Old, young
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:46.520]  Mothers, daughters and dads
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:48.520]  Drawn together by a shared sense
[1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:50.520]  That our country
[1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:52.520]  Has got it all wrong
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:54.520]  And Britain has lost its way
[1:22:54.520 --> 1:22:56.520]  That we side with the criminal
[1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.520]  And we have to speak out the truth
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:00.520]  Because if we don't
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:02.520]  We're going to end up living in a place
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:04.520]  We don't want to live
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:06.520]  We're already seeing that freedom of speech is endangered
[1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:08.520]  I think Tommy is tremendously brave in what he does
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.520]  He's a very young man
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:12.520]  I'm not a very young man
[1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:14.520]  But I'm going to say what I have to say
[1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:16.520]  Because I feel that I have a duty to say it
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:18.520]  To people who can't
[1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.520]  But Islam is taking over the place
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:22.520]  We used to call home
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:24.520]  To stand up against this persecution
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.520]  Of people who criticize Islam
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:28.520]  When it is a persecution
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:30.520]  And we need to stand up to it
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:32.520]  We need to stand up and oppose it
[1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.520]  And we are not alone in this fight
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:36.520]  International leaders like Gert Wilders
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:38.520]  From the Freedom Party
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.520]  Are here from the Netherlands
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:42.520]  To show solidarity in our battle
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:44.520]  Against the Islamification of the UK
[1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:46.520]  All of us here
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.520]  What has brought these people to this place
[1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:50.520]  Outside Whitehall in London
[1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:52.520]  Is to show
[1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:54.520]  We will not be silenced
[1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:56.520]  We will not be told to look away
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:58.520]  From what is wrong
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:00.520]  British people are here to show
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:02.520]  That there are still right minded people
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.520]  In our country
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:06.520]  Prepared to stand up for what is right
[1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:08.520]  The establishment will not silence us
[1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:12.520]  Tommy Robinson
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:14.520]  For 13 months in prison
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.520]  What purpose does his sentence serve
[1:24:16.520 --> 1:24:18.520]  I wonder
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:20.520]  But to silence his voice
[1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:22.520]  A voice the establishment don't want to hear
[1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:24.520]  We stand together
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.520]  We stand with Tommy Robinson
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:28.520]  And this is just an example
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:30.520]  Of people around the world
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.520]  Getting more
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:34.520]  Activated
[1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.520]  To engage in
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:38.520]  Their politics
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:40.520]  Whether it be
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:42.520]  Women marching for the hashtag
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:44.520]  MeTooThing
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.520]  By Hollywood
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:48.520]  Hollywood creates the rape culture
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  And Hollywood
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:52.520]  Creates the protest of the rape culture
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:54.520]  But people are sick of it
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:56.520]  And
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:58.520]  On both sides of the table
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:00.520]  You are seeing people marching
[1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:02.520]  Getting active about their politics
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:04.520]  But where does the rubber meet the road
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:08.520]  And where do people start to
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:10.520]  Declare victory
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:12.520]  Outside of just elections
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:14.520]  To just put a bow on the
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:16.520]  Tommy Robinson deal
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:18.520]  When you
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.520]  Hear about this case
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:22.520]  And you know that
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:24.520]  It went from
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:26.520]  Tommy Robinson reporting
[1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.520]  In front of the courthouse
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:30.520]  To
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.520]  In front of a judge
[1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:34.520]  To sentencing
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:36.520]  And then jail within five hours
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.520]  Anybody with any legal experience
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:40.520]  Will tell you
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:42.520]  That is so obviously premeditated
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.520]  It's not even funny
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:46.520]  Now typically when you have a situation like this
[1:25:46.520 --> 1:25:48.520]  And you can tell that there's a premeditated
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:50.520]  Conclusion
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:52.520]  To sentencing
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.520]  It's usually because you have
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:56.520]  A set precedent
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:58.520]  In a common case
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:00.520]  Like a drinking and driving
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  Or a speeding ticket or something like that
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.520]  These judges see them all day
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:06.520]  And they know what they're going to sentence
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.520]  It's already built in the books
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:10.520]  But this deal with Tommy Robinson is not like that
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:12.520]  Judges don't hear these cases daily
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:14.520]  Judges don't even hear these cases
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:16.520]  In any way shape or form
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  Annually
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.520]  So they had to preconceive
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.520]  What they were going to do
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.520]  The next time Tommy Robinson landed
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:26.520]  In their courtroom
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.520]  And that was jail
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.520]  Thirteen months is what he got
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:32.520]  So he went from on the street reporting
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:34.520]  In front of the judge to sentencing to jail
[1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:36.520]  In five hours
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:38.520]  That tells you this entire thing was premeditated
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:40.520]  And it's not the healthy kind of premeditated
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:42.520]  You get from judges in the courtroom
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:44.520]  Where you have a case by case basis
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:46.520]  Every day that forms a precedent
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:48.520]  No, this was judges
[1:26:48.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  That have
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:52.520]  Political leanings
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  And then inject their
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.520]  Political leanings into their courtrooms
[1:26:56.520 --> 1:26:58.520]  And they premeditate what they're going to do
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.520]  To people like Tommy Robinson
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:02.520]  That's what this is
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:04.520]  To me that is not just
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:06.520]  Unethical when it comes to justice
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:08.520]  It should be also illegal
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:10.520]  And I also think it should be illegal
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:12.520]  And this is another thing that courts are doing
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:14.520]  All around the world
[1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:16.520]  This happens to Tommy Robinson
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.520]  Where they put you in a bind
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:20.520]  So they arrest you
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:22.520]  Now you're in a total discomfort zone
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:24.520]  Now you're arrested, you're handcuffed
[1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:26.520]  You have no power
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:28.520]  You're powerless
[1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:30.520]  And they put you in this situation
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:32.520]  Then they get you in front of a judge
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:34.520]  And they simply
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:36.520]  Put it in front of you to say
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.520]  Look, basically admit you're guilty
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:40.520]  Say you're guilty, we'll take the handcuffs off
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  And you can go and be in jail
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:44.520]  For 13 months
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:46.520]  So they do this, this is a new tactic
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  And they're doing this in America too
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.520]  This isn't just, they're doing this everywhere
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.520]  They do this all the time in America
[1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  Mostly for petty offenses
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:56.520]  Nonviolent offenders
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.520]  And they'll put you in a powerless situation
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:00.520]  Have you feeling intimidated
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:02.520]  Have you arrested, have you handcuffed
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:04.520]  Sit you in front of the judge
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:06.520]  You don't get a lawyer
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.520]  You don't get
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.520]  Proper proceedings
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:12.520]  For a fair legal trial
[1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:14.520]  You are put in a situation where you're powerless
[1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:16.520]  So that the judge can say
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:18.520]  Admit you're guilty
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:20.520]  And we'll give you some freedom back
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:22.520]  We'll give you some power back
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.520]  And it's a psychological
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:26.520]  Fact, they know this
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:28.520]  They're going to get that
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:30.520]  Admittance of guilt 99% of the time
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:32.520]  That's why they do that
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:34.520]  So there's so
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:36.520]  Many different issues around this Tommy Robinson thing
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:38.520]  But you would think
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  It would be an event
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:42.520]  That would bring both sides of the issue together
[1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.520]  But you're
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:46.520]  Not getting that, are you
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:48.520]  Because they already dehumanized Tommy Robinson
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:50.520]  So half the people
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.520]  Don't want to stand with him for free speech
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:54.520]  They don't think he's human, we'll be right back
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:24.520]  So if you're like me

[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:28.120]  got Howard Kaplan coming up this segment and then wide open so I may even open up
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:33.280]  phone lines later on but first you heard from Howard last week after he
[1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:37.760]  confronted Bill Clinton's book tour I believe that was in Philadelphia and
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:42.760]  that video went viral now check out Howard Kaplan again this time
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:49.520]  confronting Joe Biden well what about the girls that you molested on C-span at
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:34:02.400]  the Senate swearing this is actually incredible this is footage on C-span
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:06.400]  like and listen to how the crowd reacts play it one more time I just want to
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:11.320]  provide a little context to this there are dozens and dozens hours of footage
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:16.040]  Joe Biden groping young girls kissing young girls being awkward with young
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:19.720]  girls inappropriately touching young girls so much so in fact that Jeff
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:25.120]  Sessions is aware of it his grandchild is in the state building Biden reaches
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:29.520]  over for a grab and Sessions slaps his hand away so creepy uncle Joe Biden is
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:34.560]  caught on dozens of of camera reels groping and inappropriately touching
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:38.560]  young women that is a fact now listen to how the crowd reacts when Howard
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:45.360]  Kaplan brings that up well what about the girls that you molested on C-span at
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:35:08.160]  the Senate swearing it's inappropriate for you to ask that question oh but Joe
[1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:16.320]  Biden groping young girls is perfectly fine all right so so the full video you
[1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:21.120]  can find on his Twitter at PG Howie to at PG Howie to is where you can find it
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:26.960]  on Twitter wow you know Howard it's amazing I mean what is it like like you
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:31.680]  just look at the video you just know things you have a memory and you just
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:34.840]  say hey Joe why are you inappropriately touching all these girls and then the
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:40.240]  whole audience comes to his defense I mean and it's just undeniable footage
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:46.680]  here well I was kind of expecting it because that was in Wilming Wilmington
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:52.200]  Delaware and obviously that's his home you know his home turf so you know he
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:57.040]  had a lot of fans in the audience and so I was kind of expecting I was kind of
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:01.480]  expecting that reaction what about the heckling that you received on your way
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:07.760]  out I mean what were people saying to you well I had people behind me they they
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.200]  got into it and they said this is not this is not the time or to place
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:15.400]  something to that effect oh yeah this is inappropriate but Biden you know touching
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:18.960]  girls and the you know government building that's perfectly fine yeah and
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:25.600]  you know usually I usually I'm a little more vocal but I was I mean I was real
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:30.080]  close to him this time oh and I was I see that like right right up against the
[1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:33.440]  stage I was actually apparently I read an article where I was sitting behind
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:42.520]  Biden's sister I didn't I didn't know that and good yeah so the way it went
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:47.360]  down was he was talking about Bo Biden and you know it was a lot it was like
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:52.040]  real teary kind of moment and I'm like trying to plan my strategy because and
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:56.560]  of course just and of course that's his that's his deceased son whose whose other
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:01.360]  son is now I don't know maybe is married to his ex-wife but still married to his
[1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:06.880]  other wife it's a whole weird deal with that too right and so he's talking about
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:10.400]  Bo and this real sentimental kind of way so I'm like alright let me just see how
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:15.320]  this plays out well Bo was like attorney general of Delaware I think and he
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:20.880]  started talking about Bo's passion for protecting children and he went after a
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.560]  child molester who was who was molesting girls as young as four years old like
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:30.840]  he just he just said that out of nowhere and that's when and I wish I got that on
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:34.800]  video but I wasn't like prepared to like confront him at that point and as soon
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.120]  as he said that that's why I just got up and I said well what about the girls
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:45.040]  that you molested on C-Span and that's what I'm saying this is hours and hours
[1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:50.520]  of footage this isn't hidden this isn't secret this should be well known yet
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:55.200]  these people are more offended by you bringing up the truth then by Joe Biden's
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:59.280]  actual actions it's really shocking and incredible to me but that's why what
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:02.520]  you're doing is so important so Howard talk about why it's so important talk
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:07.480]  about why for the second week in a row you confront these criminals these scumbags
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:10.880]  that have infiltrated our government talk about why it's so important to face
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:17.880]  these people down well I mean for me it it's my only opportunity like this is the
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:22.200]  way I can speak you know I got involved in this I got involved in like quote
[1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:27.600]  unquote street action and going to events you know during a during the 2016
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:33.280]  election just because I felt like I had no voice so I said well I can go
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:38.200]  outside and do something I can hold a sign I can go to a rally and I can get
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:43.640]  my voice heard and it just it it just gives you know just gives me the
[1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:49.000]  opportunity and you know with with social media and getting it out there you
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.440]  know it lets other people know that what you're being told is not the truth
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:58.560]  like this is this is the truth and you can go out there and you can confront
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:04.960]  things you know in real life and you know turn off you know turn off the TV you
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:09.800]  know and the incredible thing to me it honestly it drives me crazy Howard you've
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:16.160]  got this whole uprising right now from the radical street activists liberals
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.040]  they'll have millions of people marching in the women's March all this stuff and
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:24.520]  and and the basis is honestly it's all anti-trump they put different spin on it
[1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:27.960]  the women's March the Me Too movement whatever it's really all anti-trump but
[1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:32.240]  that's fine you know they can try to spin it off however they want it shows
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:37.360]  how phony the whole thing is when Bill Clinton goes on a book tour and the same
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:40.720]  people that would go marching the women's March in a Me Too March will pay a
[1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:44.880]  hundred dollars to see Bill Clinton the same people that will march in a Me Too
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.680]  March that will march in the women's March will go stand up for Joe Biden when
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:53.240]  someone like yourself a true American hero and patriot says hey why are you
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:59.200]  touching children on c-span video that I don't even know like it's the most
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:03.360]  preposterous notion but it's real I mean that's what we're dealing with the same
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:08.880]  people that march for the women's March the Me Too March blame it all on Trump
[1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:14.080]  pay money to see Bill Clinton and Joe Biden Bill Clinton settled multiple rape
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:18.560]  cases Joe Biden on camera touching children appropriately I don't even know
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:22.600]  the words to describe it this is beyond brainwashing this is beyond phonyism
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:28.840]  this is beyond 1984 it's like I mean how do you measure this you know this the
[1:40:28.840 --> 1:40:34.080]  same way you know why I confronted Biden one other time up a couple months ago in
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:41.560]  in Long Island and just my my initial thoughts were that the people in that
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:46.600]  audience didn't know like about this about the c-span videos I think the
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:53.440]  people in Wilmington Delaware they know Biden so well I think they know I think
[1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:57.840]  they knew I mean their reaction was immediate in Long Island people were
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:01.960]  confused when I got up and there they knew and they were they were ready to
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.160]  protect them and they don't think it's like they don't care it's like they I
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:10.200]  think so it's like they know they know of the tapes they know of the video they've
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:13.440]  been they've been forced to view it before and they still have that defense
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:17.640]  they still have that Stockholm syndrome defense yeah that that that's my
[1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:22.920]  feeling I mean I can't prove that but that's that's the feeling I get well
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:26.040]  we got a minute and a half left with you just just can you just motivate other
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:29.560]  patriots I mean Philadelphia it used to be the capital a lot of history in

[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:03.480]  me I want to represent them well but once you know once it happens once the
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:07.160]  crowd reaction goes you know your instincts take over and you know what

[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:02.240]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:06.600]  can be found here in Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:11.840]  rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:16.640]  may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:21.800]  water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:27.240]  metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:32.040]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:36.400]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:42.320]  within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:47.440]  out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:51.960]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:58.240]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:03.960]  fueling your body is hard work that's why we've introduced the info wars life

[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:22.600]  broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin Texas you're listening to the
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:32.600]  alex jones show and now your host okay for the rest of the typical broadcast
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:36.560]  here for the three hours before we go into the fourth hour I'm gonna try to
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:40.120]  get through all these video clips and all this news and then in the fourth
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:44.640]  hour I'm gonna open up the phone lines to take your calls in the meantime let's
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:53.600]  get back into the summit with Trump and Kim and look at how the media is
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:58.520]  covering this so this is actually incredible and I'm sitting here in the
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:05.240]  break trying to figure out how I'm going to cover this and and and what the
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:13.880]  angles are and it's just it's all insane that's the only angle to this and we
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.400]  say the left we say liberals democrats and that's fine that the proper nomenclature
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:25.200]  but it's beyond that these are brainwashed minions that's the only way
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:31.080]  you can describe somebody that has zero logic zero reasoning abilities and is
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:35.000]  just essentially a hearsay puppet so so what am I talking about okay let's go
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.480]  through some of these headlines this is from the New York Times
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:44.360]  Nikolas Kriestov maybe he's a Russian agent headline Trump was outfoxed in
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:53.040]  Singapore Trump was outfoxed so like what what does that even mean what
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:58.400]  negativity has come because of this this is how this is what I'm talking
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:06.480]  about you know the big thing is oh they're willing to denuke Trump says
[1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:10.480]  think about the real estate opportunities you know D new quit firing
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:14.000]  missiles think about the real estate and here's the New York Times like haha
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  that's a that's a victory for Kim yes that's good Trump bad we can print the
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.720]  headline Trump bad North Korea and it's like wait a second if anyone else said
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:33.280]  let's get North Korea to turn their missiles into hotels they would be
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:38.080]  celebrating it and here Trump is here's the story from zero hedge Trump to Kim
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:41.800]  instead of missiles you could have the best hotels in the world that's a direct
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:48.000]  quote from Donald Trump why wouldn't the left love that they want you to turn
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.480]  your guns in they want to take the guns from American citizens they want to have
[1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:56.400]  buyback programs to take guns from American citizens oh but they want Kim
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:03.160]  Jong-un to have nukes so let's just get this straight let's follow this path of
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:08.360]  reasoning in America Americans bad Americans need to turn the guns in
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:12.240]  repeal the Second Amendment turn in your guns will even have a buyback program
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:16.200]  Americans can't have guns okay let's apply the same logic to North Korea no
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:21.760]  let's not North Korea needs to have nukes and Donald Trump got outfoxed by
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.560]  North Korea saying they might denuclearize and go into an industrial
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:32.720]  tourism age don't you see don't you see how North Korea won Trump wants North
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.520]  Korea to turn its missile missiles and then military operations into hotels
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:42.960]  and real estate and business opportunities what a fool Trump is what
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:52.000]  a fool and that's what they're saying shocking to everyone Trump pledged to
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:57.400]  halt military exercises surprises Pentagon and see all oh Trump bad again I
[1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:00.440]  thought the left wanted less intervention I thought the left wanted peace
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:06.040]  here's Trump saying look turn your missiles into hotels we'll stop doing
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:09.600]  the war games of South Korea we'll turn our missiles into hotels for you to we'll
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:15.240]  make a big thing of it and the left says no oh no Americans are bad they need to
[1:51:15.240 --> 1:51:19.680]  turn their guns in but North Korea needs nukes and they're outfoxing Donald
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:29.600]  Trump yes yes and then you have this you know what let's just go to the videos
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:37.320]  let's now go to clip 6 listen to our CNN reports on the North Korea summit
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:43.320]  understand it will be one-on-one just the two men and their translators now
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:46.800]  President Trump seems to have slept a little if at all that's the issue with
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:50.640]  Asian jet lag that's a typical actually never sleep 5 a.m. local time this
[1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:53.680]  morning is most recent tweets slamming critics of the meeting calling them
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:57.600]  quote haters and losers Bob a senior Trump administration official is telling
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:01.680]  us they're going to you know go going from the cameras for this first very
[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:05.600]  formal handshake and then there is this one-on-one and and we really do
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:09.640]  understand now he's coming to do the translators inspector general report I
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:13.840]  mean the guy never sleep no no other secondary tertiary sources on what
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:18.280]  actually happens in the room your take that's a bad idea so anyway so you can
[1:52:18.280 --> 1:52:22.320]  pull it down the point is they they keep the old jet lag jet lag is gonna stop
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.320]  President Trump the jet lag oh he can't get a deal done he's got the jet lag oh
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:30.680]  he got the deal done how do you explain that and if it's jet lag that would have
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:33.560]  stopped President Trump from getting the deal done even though he got the deal
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:40.240]  done listen to now clip 10 and ask yourself then what stopped Obama
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.040]  out to you or any of his people reach out to you the president's people anybody
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:47.920]  reach out to you for insight into the other side
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:53.680]  well you know what I've talked to those guys last five years which and we talked
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:57.960]  to I talked I talked to Kim Jong-un and an administration over there five years
[1:52:57.960 --> 1:53:02.960]  ago and he asked me five years ago we sat down for lunch and he sat down and
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:07.800]  asked me hey Dennis I would like to ask you three things if you go back to tell
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:10.880]  the president of the United States these three things and I would be willing to
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:14.080]  talk to him there was Obama and it's a true story I got my people here that was
[1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:20.080]  there they heard the conversation he said things like if they can move the
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:27.120]  shifts back from South Korea I would do what I have to do to listen if you can
[1:53:27.120 --> 1:53:30.920]  move certain things or do certain things you hear what he's saying right here
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:35.560]  ladies and gentlemen he's telling you that Kim Jong-un essentially made this
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:40.200]  offer to Obama and Obama ignored it so then Trump comes in and actually
[1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:44.120]  listens to Rodman and says hey maybe you got some good intel here let's go into
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:48.240]  that gets the deal done let's go back to Rodman here on scene I used to be open
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:53.080]  and I tried to do that to Obama and Obama didn't even give me the time of day
[1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:57.440]  I asked him I said I have something to say from our career no why is this he
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:03.400]  just brushed me off I still could keep going back I kept going back I kept
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:08.280]  going back I showed my loyalty my trustworthy to this country and I said
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:13.480]  to everybody I said the door will open I remember you saying it I remember you
[1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:17.000]  saying it let me ask you something there's a huge viral video too no it was
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.520]  amazing it's amazing it's amazing when I said those things when I said those
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:29.720]  damn things when I went back home now I got so many people breaking down I got
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:34.240]  so many toughness I was sitting up protecting everything and I believe
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:39.000]  the dark career and when I went home I came and go home I came and go home I
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:47.080]  had to hide out for 30 days all right I couldn't even go home you know I kept my
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:51.960]  head up high brother I knew things were to change here's my theory on why Dennis
[1:54:51.960 --> 1:54:59.800]  Rodman is getting so emotional over this you know here's a guy who look it's kind
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:06.600]  of the same thing that burnt me out on sports and sports media it's great it's
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:13.520]  fun but it doesn't deliver you it doesn't it doesn't have anything real to it
[1:55:13.520 --> 1:55:18.720]  it's a child's game and so here's Rodman played prize 15 years in the NBA
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:25.280]  three-time champion you know Hall of Fame basketball player finishes his career in
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:29.280]  the NBA and says I want to actually do something I've got money I've got power
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:34.560]  I've got a platform and so he takes up this North Korea challenge becomes
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:37.840]  friends with Kim Jong-un has an opportunity to reach a deal has an
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:42.360]  opportunity to open a doorway to negotiations and he pours his heart and
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:46.800]  his soul into this and he comes back to America Obama sluffs him off multiple
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:52.440]  times he gets death threats and so now he's having his moment where all the
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:56:00.720]  effort all of the the the thought that he put into getting a deal potential with
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:04.160]  North Korea and the United States on the table finally comes a fruition under
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:09.080]  President Trump and it just you can see the emotion hitting him it's like he had
[1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:14.520]  been betrayed every time he came back to try to get a deal done he kept getting
[1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:19.120]  betrayed and betrayed by Obama by everyone in America and finally Trump
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:22.240]  comes in and says all right what do you have to say Dennis wow that's good
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:25.400]  Intel let's actually look into that and then he gets a deal done and you can see
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:30.120]  he's here breaking down peers streaming from his face on CNN that's how real this

[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:32.800]  lines of the info war and now your host Owen Troyer
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:40.400]  okay I've got a couple more video clips here first off let's go I mean look
[2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:52.120]  again this is so insane it's I don't understand why MSNBC is CNN I don't get
[2:00:52.120 --> 2:00:58.840]  it anymore they've totally fallen off a cliff just look just just go and look
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:05.600]  let's go to clip 13 listen to the Jim Acosta is such a piece of work I mean
[2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:11.080]  this guy his credentials need to be removed immediately listen to Jim Acosta
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:20.480]  inserting himself into the Kim Trump summit
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:26.960]  only one of the media shouting out Trump looks back some song oh this could
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:37.400]  be it this could be it for Acosta the only one shouting at him
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:49.840]  Jim Acosta is an unhinged maniac actually now let's go to clip 12 here's Jim
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:56.080]  Acosta Jim Acosta again trying to insert himself rudely totally classless
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:01:58.840]  into this summit
[2:02:09.880 --> 2:02:14.040]  so there's Trump and Kim talking
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:32.880]  take hands what do you hope to accomplish sir there's Acosta again only
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:36.520]  one now there's actually a third clip actually to I don't know if we have it
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:43.360]  but there's actually a third clip where even after the signing Acosta is
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:47.640]  sitting there is sitting there screaming at Trump asking him a question
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.880]  asking Kim Jong-un will you denuclearize will you denuclearize and so then you
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:57.040]  have a moment where Kim looks at him and he's like what is this guy's deal Kim
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:00.240]  Jong-un would have that guy and arrested immediately in North Korea yeah
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:03.080]  there's the story right there Acosta shouts at Kim Jong-un will you give up
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:08.880]  your nuclear weapons Jim Acosta is so unhinged he's like I don't even know
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:11.600]  this guy needs to have his media credential removed immediately he's
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:16.840]  rude he's disrespectful he's classless and more than anything he's a stone cold
[2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:25.880]  idiot a total boob now it doesn't stop there let's now go to Ben Rhodes this is
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:30.680]  the guy who gets a job at MSNBC after a clip of him unable to even find words
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.080]  after Hillary Clinton lost the election somehow that lands him a job speaking for
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:40.960]  a living listen to the unhinged Ben Rhodes now so that multi national
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:45.600]  agreement did not cover missiles it didn't cover other bad behavior by Iran
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:50.880]  he has now raised the stakes so that this deal has to cover visits it has to
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:57.840]  cover North Korean terrorism with Korean human rights abuses all the things that
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:01.720]  he rejected it also has to include a real baseline a real accounting and
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:07.640]  verification that extends beyond what was achieved in the Iran deal that's right
[2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:11.440]  Andrea I mean you know first of all my concern with this summit is Kim Young
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:14.840]  Moon could make a kind of empty commitment to denuclearize at some point
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:18.400]  in the future but there's no clear road map to get that done there's no clear
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:21.480]  inspections regime to make sure that they are giving up maybe like Obama the
[2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:25.240]  Iran deal is actually a pretty good template for what they should be trying
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:28.720]  to accomplish with the new program because not only did that put strict
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:32.680]  constraints on Iran's nuclear program to prevent them from getting a weapon just
[2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:35.480]  take him off I just don't even know what to say
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.000]  but these people are such liars they're so unhinged they're such phonies that
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:45.160]  everything about them is fake there's no there's no basis in truth there's no
[2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:49.080]  foundation in reality man they're just all unhinged and then you have their
[2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:52.640]  little audience that's that goes out in the streets and shows how unhinged they

[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:23.880]  you know it's funny because there was a story out last week seven and ten
[2:06:23.880 --> 2:06:32.840]  Americans have news fatigue do you see why because news isn't news anymore all
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:40.680]  it is is a cold civil this is a cold civil war that mainline leftist news
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:46.560]  outlets are pushing and fomenting every day that's all this is there is no news
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:52.520]  anymore the only news is like actual news developments what Trump is doing
[2:06:52.520 --> 2:06:56.640]  volcanoes happening earthquakes happening the arrest of all these
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:01.680]  pedophiles the shutting down of the sex trafficking Hollywood being exposed for
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:06.280]  all the rape culture that they've created that's news that is actual news
[2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:12.240]  that is news and developments but that's not what you see when you tune into the
[2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:17.800]  quote-unquote news anymore you get a bunch of nonsense and I gotta tell you
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:24.760]  I'm I'm now hitting this threshold of news fatigue and I don't really know
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:30.560]  what I'm gonna do here but I can't I can't I can't do CNN and MSNBC and a I
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:35.320]  can't do it anymore man I can't do it these people are so fake there's such
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:40.280]  liars I don't know what's driving them anymore is it insanity is it madness are
[2:07:40.280 --> 2:07:43.720]  they truly mentally deranged are they really that stupid are they bought and
[2:07:43.720 --> 2:07:47.000]  paid for they just read off a teleprompter are they so filled with hate
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:51.160]  what is wrong with these people I can't deal with it anymore and now I
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:55.040]  understand why seven and ten people in this country have news fatigue but
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:04.040]  there's a silver lining to this every day when CNN and MSNBC and ABC news and
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:11.200]  CBS news and NBC news and the rest of the global news conglomerate comes out as
[2:08:11.200 --> 2:08:15.400]  anti-American anti-Trump totally unhinged every day they get worse and
[2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:22.680]  worse they're killing themselves why would they do that think about that
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:29.880]  they're so committed to their agenda that they would destroy themselves to
[2:08:29.880 --> 2:08:34.680]  try to save it you ever heard the old cliche cutting off your nose to spite
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:43.640]  your face it's just crazy it's just unbelievable and they're trying to tear
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:48.680]  this country apart at the seams with their fake news reporting their cold war
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:51.600]  of the news yeah there's Chris Hayes I mean could you believe the Chris Hayes
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:58.360]  clip I mean this is let's just go back you know what this one saying if I go
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:03.120]  back to this I'm just gonna go insane again Trump doesn't care about the
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:08.520]  outcome of the North Korea summit what planet does Chris Hayes live on that's
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:15.080]  what I'm saying these people don't even live on earth anymore they're gone they're
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:26.080]  lost they're hopeless but but but but look look at Barack Obama today the
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:31.680]  story from Kit Daniels is at info wars.com Obama praises hockey team but
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:36.720]  not Trump amid North Korea summit now President Obama tweets this out this
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:42.480]  morning congratulations to the capitals for winning the Stanley Cup first
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:47.160]  tweet in four or five days from Obama nothing on the North Korean deal and by
[2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:53.200]  the way the capitals won the Stanley Cup a week ago if you don't think for one
[2:09:53.200 --> 2:10:02.120]  second this is a slime ball Hussein Obama totally trying to take a jab at
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:06.520]  Trump I don't even know what this is this shows you this guy hates America man a
[2:10:06.520 --> 2:10:11.480]  week after the capitals win the Stanley Cup he congratulates them on Twitter the
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:16.240]  morning of Donald Trump reaching a deal with Kim Jong-un having the Korean
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:21.080]  summit what does Obama do? Congratulates the capitals a week after they win the
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:25.720]  Stanley Cup if you don't understand how that is a direct shot at Trump this is
[2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:32.720]  Obama slinging feces on social media that's what this is this is a rejected
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:38.120]  loser failed president whose legacy has not only now been politically destroyed
[2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:43.480]  but once the IG report comes out and the spy gate is all exposed his entire
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:48.200]  legacy not just politically but as a human a scandal-free president both
[2:10:48.200 --> 2:10:53.160]  Barack Obama will go down in history as the biggest criminal that ever occupied
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:58.320]  the White House and he knows it so what does he do? He goes on social media and
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:04.240]  he slings the proverbial you-know-what all over the fan just to get people
[2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:09.400]  riled up just to anger real Americans
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:20.080]  what's Obama's excuse? Why didn't Obama reach a deal with Kim Jong-un? Why didn't
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:24.080]  Obama have the North Korean summit? He had the opportunity Dennis Rodman came
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:28.000]  to him multiple times saying I've got a door open here I've got negotiations on
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:36.200]  the table what did Obama do? Nothing oh don't you see Obama I mean you want to
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:42.760]  talk about agents assets? How is Obama not an Iranian asset? How is Obama not
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:51.360]  an Iranian agent? Completely ignores what would be a real thing to move the
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:55.560]  world forward with North Korea and he ignores that what does he do? He goes
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:12:01.520]  into Iran gives them access to our financial system gives them billions of
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:13.080]  dollars releases Taliban leaders I mean it's unbelievable and then Trump gets
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:19.520]  this out of the Iran deal what's been the difference? The Iran deal was a fake
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:27.440]  deal the Iran deal was us Obama taking a wire from America's prosperity and just
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:34.440]  plugging it into Iran and saying go for it baby rob us dry and it's like I don't
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:37.600]  want to sit here and hate on Iran but then you see the rhetoric that comes out
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:42.040]  of their government anti-American every day you're like well screw you then
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:49.200]  sorry sorry that Obama you know lets you suck us dry but we're not doing that
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:56.520]  anymore and so now Iran's pissed yeah we have an American president now not an
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:01.160]  Iranian president not a jihadi president not a communist president an
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:09.360]  American president and this is what it looks like and John Kerry and John
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:16.800]  McCain and Barack Obama and Valerie Jarrett and all their side deals all
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:24.080]  their corruption and their deal with Iran all gets exposed I mean think about
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:32.440]  some of these names Valerie Jarrett Loretta Lynch Susan Rice Ben Rhodes
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:36.520]  all from the Obama administration James Clapper John Brennan all from the
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:45.120]  Obama administration a bunch of scum a bunch of two-timing scum or just look
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:50.960]  into Loretta Lynch and a Susan Rice just total dingbats total nitwits total
[2:13:50.960 --> 2:13:55.720]  nothings you know I don't know too much about their history but I would be I
[2:13:55.720 --> 2:14:01.400]  wouldn't be surprised if they both went to Harvard University they always come
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:05.200]  out of Harvard folks you think Harvard is an Ivy League school for higher
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:13.720]  education Harvard is a CIA FBI NSA deep-state recruitment grounds and a
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:24.440]  Monday money laundering operation to the tune of billions of dollars okay oh oh
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:27.960]  shocking Loretta Lynch went to Harvard I don't even need to look this stuff up
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:33.080]  folks once you have gone into this and you know the system and you know how it
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:37.800]  works and you know how it's fed you see everything it's like the old Lego movie
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:42.360]  with the master builders at first the character has no idea he can't see
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:45.440]  anything you don't nothing makes sense to him nothing that makes sense and then
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:49.200]  boom he becomes a master builder and you see everything you see all the parts
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:54.480]  you see how they fit you see how it builds you see how you create things and
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:15:00.760]  it's all falling apart right now and so aside from the deep state being exposed
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.800]  and falling apart you also have President Trump actually getting things done
[2:15:04.800 --> 2:15:10.800]  and it shows you all it took was a little will how did how did President
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:15.480]  Trump get the GDP up over 3% he wanted to how did President Trump get black
[2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:21.000]  unemployment to a record low he wanted to how did President Trump save the US
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:26.640]  economy from from going into a deeper recession because he wanted to how did
[2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:31.160]  President Trump get a deal done with Kim Jong-un at a summit because he wanted
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:36.720]  to why did President Trump make Jerusalem the capital of Israel even
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.920]  though every other president said they would do it because he wanted to folks
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:44.200]  he wants to be president he wants to make America great again everyone else in my

[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:30.400]  know my biggest frustration is not that Barack Hussein Obama is a total phony a
[2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:35.380]  total liar my biggest frustration is not that Hillary Clinton hates people my
[2:20:35.380 --> 2:20:41.480]  biggest frustration is not that MSNBC CNN ABC and the corporate news conglomerate
[2:20:41.480 --> 2:20:50.000]  lies all day those are not my biggest frustrations those are a source of my
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:55.480]  biggest frustration which is that people don't see it that is my biggest
[2:20:55.480 --> 2:21:01.800]  frustration people don't see how big of a phony Barack Hussein Obama is people
[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:07.520]  don't see the truth behind agenda driven corporate globalist news media
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:16.040]  corporations people don't see all of the phoniness in the reporting against
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:23.200]  Donald Trump that is my biggest frustration and it's like beating your
[2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:29.000]  head against the wall when you have leftist and liberal organizations funding
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:33.160]  the women's March funding the Me Too movement and then Joe Biden and Bill
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:37.880]  Clinton have the same people that go to those marches pay hundreds of dollars to
[2:21:37.880 --> 2:21:44.920]  see them speak at a book tour whoa man like if that's not Twilight Zone if
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:51.600]  that's not 1984 somebody come wake me up from this nightmare and that's the
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:54.840]  reality of the situation and I was beginning to lose my cool in the last
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:21:59.400]  segment so I'm gonna open up the phone lines and we're gonna go to some of
[2:21:59.400 --> 2:22:03.240]  these callers before I just totally blow up here on air so I'm opening up the
[2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:07.640]  phone lines now well I'm just gonna take your calls just we'll take your calls

[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:18.440]  will be taking your calls for the remainder of the show mainly just from
[2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:22.480]  my own mental health so that I don't go absolutely crazy because it's nice to
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.000]  hear from educated people it's nice to hear from people that care about the
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:31.680]  future and care about this country and understand why America is so important
[2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:35.520]  to the world so I'm gonna go to the audience today to just kind of ease
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:40.400]  some of my frustration at the absolute total ignorance of the population and
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:45.440]  then there's another level of frustration the only way that you're that
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:51.560]  ignorant in the year 2018 is because you choose to be the only way that you fall
[2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:56.720]  for a Barack Obama the only way you fall for a CNN and an MSNBC headline is
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:01.240]  because you choose to be ignorant you choose to be a brainwashed fool it's
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:06.800]  like Kanye West said it's like 300 years of slavery sounds like a choice still
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:11.400]  falling for the fake news on Trump sounds like a choice still falling for
[2:23:11.400 --> 2:23:16.640]  Obama and Biden and the deep state sounds like a choice still falling for
[2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:22.840]  Russian collusion oh my god can you imagine believing in Russian collusion
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:29.840]  oh oh even though it's Hillary and the Democrats with Russian collusion all
[2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:33.640]  over their damn shirt see this is what I'm saying I'm getting mad so we're gonna
[2:23:33.640 --> 2:23:37.200]  open up the phone lines I need to calm down because we are coming back I mean
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:42.040]  we are having the victories I just want everybody on my team man I just want

[2:25:56.080 --> 2:26:01.280]  the 34-hour live broadcast spectacular that we're launching Thursday morning
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:06.560]  8 a.m. with David Knight June 14th that's President Trump's birthday that's
[2:26:06.560 --> 2:26:13.720]  also the day the Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report comes out on
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:19.400]  why Hillary Clinton received special treatment from the Obama Justice
[2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:25.320]  Department and from the Obama FBI it's going to totally destroy this whole
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:33.200]  thing folks and what's crazy about it is it doesn't really seem like it in the
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:41.360]  aggregate but this will actually be the source of everything else that followed
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.440]  the spy gate the Russian collusion gate all of that stuff actually can be
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:53.000]  sourced with James Comey and Loretta Lynch riding Hillary Clinton off early
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:59.080]  now let me explain why that is Hillary Clinton cut deals with Loretta Lynch
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:05.800]  and who knows who else maybe even Obama maybe Comey they cut deals all assuming
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:09.000]  Hillary Clinton would win they had the corporate media behind them they had the
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:13.520]  rigged elections behind them they had all the money behind them they thought
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:16.560]  they had a path to victory but they didn't even think they would be facing
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:20.560]  Trump so when Trump got the Republican nomination all the sudden they had to
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:24.040]  kick it to the next level even though they still assumed they would win
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:28.600]  Trump was a real threat because he was an outsider so if it was Bush that got
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:32.440]  in and probably be fine they wouldn't really worry about it even Cruz you know
[2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:36.200]  he's from the political establishment so okay they can work with that but
[2:27:36.200 --> 2:27:44.600]  Trump an outsider a success story a true story of the American dream that sent a
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:49.720]  little panic so what did they do they spied on him they made up the Russian
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:52.960]  collusion narrative and they did all this stuff and Hillary cut a bunch of
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:28:00.040]  deals but it all originates from Comey and Loretta Lynch dropping the email
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:08.360]  investigation so she would win that's the origins of all of this it was a rig
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:14.440]  from the beginning folks think about it they stole it from Bernie Sanders okay
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:19.760]  and then they put Hillary Clinton in as the Democrat nominee a walking corpse a
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:24.760]  woman who couldn't even campaign because she was so sick a woman who fell down
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:28.160]  multiple times because she was sick a woman who had to wear seizure glasses
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:31.480]  because she was sick a woman now walking around in a back brace because she's
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:37.640]  sick that's who they were going to give you a walking corpse Hillary Clinton do
[2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:41.960]  you see how rigged this is do you see how fake it's all been Trump is the
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:48.600]  realest thing to happen in America since I don't even know I don't even know
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:55.640]  Trump is the realest thing to happen to America probably in my life if you like
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:59.200]  alkaline water or know someone that does you're going to love the Dylan living
[2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:03.400]  water bottle it creates alkaline water on the go while reducing plastic waste and
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:07.040]  saving you money made with surgical grade stainless steel the Dylan bottle

[2:33:16.440 --> 2:33:23.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:27.840]  Alright we're about to open up and go to the phone lines here for the first time
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:31.840]  today. First I just want to hit some news just quickly I promise I'm gonna go to
[2:33:31.840 --> 2:33:36.360]  the phone lines. The stories from the Wall Street Journal FCC chairman still
[2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:41.000]  receiving threats over net neutrality. Of course that's a jeep pie. Now here's
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:48.120]  what I'm covering this. Think about this. Has any other FCC commissioner in the
[2:33:48.120 --> 2:33:53.380]  past received death threats regularly? Has any other FCC commissioner in the
[2:33:53.380 --> 2:34:02.360]  past had to travel with security 24-7? No. Now why would a jeep pie be that guy?
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:06.160]  You'd think that he'd be endeared by the liberal media. I mean after all he's a
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:13.640]  minority. He's not a white male so he's not the devil. But why? And if you
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:19.280]  understand this you understand so much about how the radical left-wing hate mob
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:27.080]  operates. First it all derives from their false narrative on net neutrality.
[2:34:27.080 --> 2:34:32.800]  So first they create a fake narrative around net neutrality. They use Obama's
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:37.040]  face put on net neutrality to try to fluff net neutrality up like something
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:40.840]  you want. They have a false narrative about net neutrality in the media. They
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:44.760]  build it up so the brainwash minions accept it. Yes we love net neutrality.
[2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:49.800]  We don't like internet freedom. Yeah we want net neutrality. We want the big
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:53.520]  corporations in total control and then they can manipulate who gets the band
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:59.360]  with. Yeah that's what we want. So they spin a false narrative. They put Obama's
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:03.640]  face on it to get their brainwash minions to think it's good. But then what
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:08.200]  happens? A jeep pie does his job as the FCC commissioner tells you the truth
[2:35:08.200 --> 2:35:13.920]  about net neutrality and then kills it and says no we're not gonna do that.
[2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:18.600]  We're gonna let the internet operate free as it has and we're not gonna bring
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:22.560]  out these new regulations that are gonna give corporations more control over
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:28.000]  content on the internet. So then what happens? Well the media already created
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.160]  their false narrative on net neutrality and and acted like it was the golden
[2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:36.560]  goose. So then FCC chairman a jeep pie comes around who doesn't cater and cower
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:41.240]  and bow down to the fake news. He stands up for what's right and says no I'm not
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:45.520]  gonna do this. Wow how refreshing. Then what does the media do? He's the bad
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:49.560]  guy. He's the devil. Trump is putting up to it. And then what do the brainwash
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:55.400]  minions do? Now they hate a jeep pie because he killed their golden goose of
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:02.240]  net neutrality. They thought it was so good. They needed net neutrality and now a jeep pie.
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:06.880]  And now he gets death threats every day. Now he has to travel with security 24-7.
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:14.160]  This is how the left-wing radical liberals operate. And this shows you how
[2:36:14.160 --> 2:36:18.600]  manipulated and controlled they are in their thought process. So you sell them
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:22.080]  net neutrality, you sell them a bill of goods, you put Obama's face on it, they
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:28.120]  love it. A jeep pie doesn't bow down to the corporate media, stands up to it, says
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:32.080]  we're not bringing in net neutrality. Then the media says a jeep pie bad. Trump
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:35.800]  telling him to do this and now he gets death threats all day from the loving
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:39.840]  tolerant liberals. Oh and let's not forget today actually I think marks the
[2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:48.000]  year anniversary of the radical left-wing terrorist shooting up the
[2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:51.800]  Republican baseball practice guys. I think that was a year today. See if you
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:56.040]  guys can look that up. So let's just remember, let's just remember what we're
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:37:02.080]  dealing with here and who the real radical terrorists are in this country.
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:08.400]  By the way, US economic advisor Larry Kudlow is in good condition following a
[2:37:08.400 --> 2:37:13.200]  heart attack. You wish the best for him and you hope that he didn't get a heart
[2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:18.600]  attack attack. Now this is declassified stuff ladies and gentlemen. They have
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:24.040]  frequencies and machines that they can point at you to cause a heart attack.
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:29.600]  That is declassified information. So I'm not saying that's what happened to Larry
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.840]  Kudlow but with everything else that's going on, the Intel Alex got about Anthony
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:39.600]  Bourdain. You have to wonder about this stuff. Seth Rich, Sean Lucas,
[2:37:39.600 --> 2:37:46.760]  Barrington Wisenant, yeah the Clinton body count Vince Foster, John Ashe. So you
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:50.280]  just have to wonder but we hope that Larry Kudlow is doing just fine. All right
[2:37:50.280 --> 2:37:55.480]  let me go out to the, was it a year ago today? It was a year ago Thursday. A year
[2:37:55.480 --> 2:38:00.400]  ago Thursday on Trump's birthday. That's right. When the radical left-wing
[2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:03.480]  terrorist went and shot up a Republican baseball practice, which could have been
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:06.720]  a mass shooting. Think about that. That could have been a mass shooting. You
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:09.720]  notice how the media didn't call for gun control after that though because it was
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:13.640]  a good tolerant liberal that did it. All right let's go out to Blake calling in
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:20.000]  from Kentucky. Go ahead Blake. Hey Owen, how's it going? Going good, go ahead. I
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:24.360]  just like to say that people need to go to the info war store and check out the
[2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:29.680]  super male vitality, alpha power, caveman. They're all great. It gives you more
[2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:34.320]  stamina when you're working out. More energy throughout the day. Also I just
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:39.400]  want to say keep your head up man. We're still winning every day. Like I
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:43.920]  appreciate y'all's hard work down there at info wars. I don't want you to think my
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.160]  head is down. Trust me it's not. I'm loving all this right now. I have a
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:53.280]  genuine spirit of unity. Like I genuinely, I don't have to agree with people all
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:56.040]  the time. It's just I want people to understand that we're all in this
[2:38:56.040 --> 2:39:00.840]  together. We're all on this same rock floating through space. One in ten
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:04.200]  trillion odds that we're even here right now. And you just have people that fall
[2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:08.160]  for lies and propaganda and I just want them to open their eyes and see the light.
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:13.320]  That's all it is Blake. No I agree. I agree and Trump just keeps out
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:19.200]  classing them and outsmarting those globalists with every turn. But I do, I
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:23.600]  do hope that they continue to follow up with the Clinton investigations. Not
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.760]  just into the emails but into the Clinton Foundation and AD and everything
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:33.520]  else too. Well I think that the Inspector General's report could be the
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:36.840]  straw that broke the camel's back. We'll see. They're saying they may try to
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:40.280]  smooth it out around the edges. I hope not. I hope they just divulge the whole
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:45.160]  thing. I hope they do too. And that's what this country needs. But here's the
[2:39:45.160 --> 2:39:50.160]  craziest part about it Blake. You could, I mean they could document the entire
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:54.400]  thing about how they rigged the investigation to make sure Hillary
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:57.440]  Clinton could still run for president. How they rigged the investigation to
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:01.680]  make sure Hillary Clinton wouldn't be prosecuted. And they will. And it's
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.360]  already documented. We already have it all. And the left still won't accept it.
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:08.280]  They'll still say it's a right-wing conspiracy theory. I'm telling you. You
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:12.120]  can have, you can have a blade of grass of healthy green grass right in front of
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:15.560]  these people's face and say this is a blade of grass and it is green. And
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:21.320]  they'll say no, no it's not. That's what that's what's gonna happen Blake. Mark
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:28.280]  my words. Alright let's now move on to George in California. Go ahead George. How's
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:34.240]  it going Nolan? Just fine. I just want to talk to you and tell you that you're
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:41.480]  doing a great job man. And only the Liberals get to you because honestly
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:46.880]  they're getting all their information from the Instagrams, the Snapchat, all the
[2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:51.920]  BuzzFeeds and everything that gives them misinformation. So it's just a
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:57.040]  zombie culture. Well and let's be clear. They're not real Liberals. That's the
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:00.880]  modern-day nomenclature because it's where they fall on the political
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:03.800]  spectrum that were presented. But they're not real Liberals. They're
[2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:09.560]  brainwashed minions, they're fools, they're whatever. But huge, again it's
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:14.400]  it's this weird thing where social media, people don't understand this, social
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:21.800]  media literally dominates people's lives. Where they will take up a set of beliefs
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:26.840]  or some narrative just so they can post about it on social media and feel good
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:33.840]  about themselves. And that's what it gives them a source of dopamine. That's
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:37.880]  why people are so obsessed with the Instagrams and everything because every
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:43.440]  light gives them a source of dopamine. So that's what makes them more obsessed
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:52.240]  with the social media. And it's just sad the dopamine receptors that they've now
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:56.800]  been trained to fire off via these social media things and getting likes and
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:04.760]  everything. Man, it's like faux dopamine. It's like decaffeinated coffee. It's not
[2:42:04.760 --> 2:42:09.800]  real. It's a small rush that then you just kind of get like every second
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:14.520]  like this little rush instead of a true dopamine hit which is like going out
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:18.720]  there, challenging yourself, suffering a little bit and then having the success
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:23.000]  and then having the victory. That's a real dopamine thing. That's how you
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:30.760]  actually can get high in real life. I mean look at this. Look at running. As people
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:36.920]  that run, if you run, if you go out and run five miles, your brain is pumping out
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:42.360]  dopamine like a machine. Like a machine. But if you sit on social media all day
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:46.640]  and tweet, you just get like this little, it's like asthma or something, like asthma
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:49.840]  for your dopamine. It just kind of little eats every day and you get more
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:55.840]  desperate for it. You just sit on there all day. It's killing us. We've taken
[2:42:55.840 --> 2:42:59.520]  thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:03.960]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:08.360]  Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:13.560]  metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:17.880]  compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:22.600]  it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:26.600]  personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:30.960]  close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:34.440]  owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of

[2:43:51.080 --> 2:43:54.840]  it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and infowarslife.com.
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:59.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:03.240]  drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:07.960]  Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:13.440]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:18.480]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed a series of tests
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:24.040]  for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact
[2:44:24.040 --> 2:44:29.200]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we tested
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:33.520]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:39.520]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:44.920]  turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[2:44:44.920 --> 2:44:49.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:55.840]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

[2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:14.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:22.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios. You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now
[2:47:22.720 --> 2:47:42.080]  your host Owen Troyer you know I like analogy sometimes because some people
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:45.920]  understand what you're saying better when they can see it through the lens of
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:51.920]  an analogy. You had a viral video recently come from a Minnesota high school
[2:47:51.920 --> 2:47:57.480]  baseball tournament where it's the last inning the last strike and the pitcher
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:02.560]  strikes out the batter to win the game and to go to the state finals. Here's the
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:06.680]  b-roll they're showing it right now the strike out the punch out and then the
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.680]  team goes crazy they're all celebrating but you'll see the pitcher goes to the
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:15.760]  batter that he just struck out and and kind of gives him a hug and so the team
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:19.840]  is all celebrating behind him they just had a great victory and the pitcher kind
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:25.680]  of kind of misses out on that moment to go hug his friend and console him after
[2:48:25.680 --> 2:48:30.800]  the strikeout. Okay Troyer what are you talking about? This is this is my
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:34.360]  analogy this is what I'm saying we are having victory right now so don't be
[2:48:34.360 --> 2:48:38.360]  confused I know we're having victory I know we've been having massive victories
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:43.080]  we are changing the tide we are we are restoring nationalism we are restoring
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:49.600]  human just just general humanitarianism the real humanitarianism not fake foe
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:55.680]  humanitarianism but like that pitcher that just won the game with the strike
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:02.320]  out sees his fellow friend suffering and he goes and consoles him that's my
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:06.680]  frustration that's all of these people that still hate Trump that's all of
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:09.560]  these people that still think America is so bad because of this that or the
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:13.000]  other thing that's all these people that still fall for the fake news at CNN
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:18.920]  and MSNBC I genuinely feel bad for them I genuinely want to lift them out of
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:24.680]  their stupor I genuinely want them to be on the winning team but they don't want
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:30.600]  it and I don't know what to do for these people if they can't read if they can't
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:34.760]  think if they don't have a memory they don't have logic and reasoning anymore I
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:37.240]  don't know what we can do but that that's just kind of an analogy of how I
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:41.480]  feel I genuinely feel bad for these people suffering right now because they
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:44.880]  really believe the fake news they really believe everything about Trump that they
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:51.520]  hear on CNN he's a Russian agent he's racist he's that all fake all fake yet
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:56.800]  that's the bubble they live in they are miserable and I just want to be on the
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:02.960]  winning team speaking of winning teams but look this is actually kind of all
[2:50:02.960 --> 2:50:09.160]  it all kind of comes together here dumb and dumber this is from the times in
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:13.840]  UK dumb and dumber why we're getting less intelligent so now where you had IQ
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:19.520]  IQ scores going up they pretty much peaked at the Second World War and now
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:24.880]  they're going back down well why is that it's the social media it's the dumbing
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:29.320]  down on television it's the flicker rates it's the less reading it's the
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:35.600]  school system but also don't be compute confused by the false assumption in our
[2:50:35.600 --> 2:50:39.160]  own human arrogance that we're the smartest humans ever walk the earth
[2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:44.880]  okay there have been other humans in in history that may have even been smarter
[2:50:44.880 --> 2:50:49.280]  than us may have had more advanced technology than us but but just humans
[2:50:49.280 --> 2:50:53.200]  in general have a psychology to think we're the most advanced we're the best
[2:50:53.200 --> 2:50:58.040]  of the species that has ever had to offer maybe that's not the case and now
[2:50:58.040 --> 2:51:02.440]  you see the trend we're getting dumber again you see it in the streets now a
[2:51:02.440 --> 2:51:07.440]  lot of it health issues have to do with this American toddlers are eating more
[2:51:07.440 --> 2:51:13.440]  sugar than the maximum amount of sugar recommended for adults now you can
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:18.920]  health and what to eat and all this stuff is really relative depending on the
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:22.480]  individual and depending on certain certain circumstances but here's one
[2:51:22.480 --> 2:51:27.320]  fact if the sugar that these toddlers are eating is processed sugar then yes
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:31.360]  it's killing them natural sugar really is people want to make they want to
[2:51:31.360 --> 2:51:35.960]  demonize all these things demonize carbs demonize calories demonize sugar
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:40.240]  but you actually you need all of that stuff and you can actually take it in
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:44.920]  in mass quantities if you wanted as long as you burn it off you're actually
[2:51:44.920 --> 2:51:49.280]  even more healthy but the processed sugar now is what they're finding the
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:53.920]  issue is it's the processed sugar and that's what you get for most of these
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:58.000]  fast food change is processed sugar that's what you get in the soda that's
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.280]  what you get in the drinks that these young kids are drinking so that's the
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:05.560]  problem so it's not sugar you need sugar sugar is fine it's processed sugar it's
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:11.800]  the processed foods those are the ones that are killing the human genome and
[2:52:11.800 --> 2:52:16.040]  but they always demonize it and oh sugar is the problem or oh this is no it's the
[2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:22.040]  process sugar it's the process GMOs that's the problem all right let's go
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:26.040]  back out to the phone lines let's go to Joe calling in from Arkansas go ahead
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:37.320]  Joe hi my name is Gerald okay Joe not Joe anyway I'm hearing what you're
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:44.040]  saying there Owen and and you're right on the money as far as the process
[2:52:44.040 --> 2:52:50.560]  sugar it's the same thing with news isn't fake news I like the truth the
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:54.240]  truth doesn't need to be processed you just tell it like it is right that's it
[2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:59.040]  yeah exactly like real news like actually just giving the news is good that
[2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:02.520]  doesn't need to be demonized like real sugar you can real sugar is fine yeah
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:06.040]  obviously you eat too much of it that's but you know enough sugar is fine you
[2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:10.200]  don't demonize your brother but then you hit on it's the fake sugar just like it's
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:14.360]  the fake news the average person won't get burned out by real news they want
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:17.360]  that they want to know what's going on they want to be informed it's the fake
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:21.440]  news just like the fake sugar that's killing us yeah and here's the thing
[2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:26.200]  everything you're saying the foundational thing is what they've done is
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:31.880]  they turned it around they've taken the lie and they've made it the truth now it's
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:37.120]  not really but it's to see people well you got to do your homework and the
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:41.600]  Bible says search improve all things well God wouldn't say to do that if you
[2:53:41.600 --> 2:53:45.680]  couldn't do it well and now the laziness factor comes into play which is again
[2:53:45.680 --> 2:53:50.840]  that is artificially you know developed with the flicker rates on the TV the
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:56.200]  chemicals in the food and water the fluoride so they even they even make us
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:54:00.320]  lazier you can okay maybe they don't know it maybe there's not some grand
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:03.480]  conspiracy and they really don't know fluoride is bad for you and kills your
[2:54:03.480 --> 2:54:06.200]  pineal gland they really don't know about the flicker rates in TV that they
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:09.520]  tested for five years before they even release it testing it on monkeys so
[2:54:09.520 --> 2:54:12.800]  maybe they don't know that's going on but you hit the nail on the head people
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:17.600]  are so lazy now it's a lot easier to just see something with a flashy light in
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:21.440]  front of you and accept it than actually research it for yourself I got a
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:24.960]  quick question because I hear you talking about it all the time it's on the
[2:54:24.960 --> 2:54:30.720]  news every day how you guys are being kept from from tell being conservatives
[2:54:30.720 --> 2:54:36.840]  on Facebook Twitter and YouTube now I don't know the answer to this but if I
[2:54:36.840 --> 2:54:42.280]  understood you guys right these are all private companies why can't info wars
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:47.880]  start up a competition for Facebook and YouTube and Twitter well you got okay
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:51.560]  now there's a there's a there's a simple answer for that honestly the simplest
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:59.560]  answer is bandwidth cloud space storage time and money okay that requires
[2:54:59.560 --> 2:55:06.200]  maximum amounts of all of those elements if you will to to compete with a
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:10.880]  Facebook to compete with a Twitter I mean look at gab gab I mean in it on its
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.800]  surface and in its principle could easily compete with Twitter but they don't
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:18.880]  have all the money they don't have all the bandwidth and think about this how
[2:55:18.880 --> 2:55:24.600]  much does the average individual in their life pay to be on Instagram pay to be on
[2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:30.280]  Snapchat pay to be on Facebook pay to be on Twitter pay to be on YouTube you
[2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:35.640]  know how much Joel zero now how do you think these companies are making money
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:40.880]  it's like people can't even think that that far ahead duh they're selling your
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:46.440]  information bro it's like it's like two plus two equals four how do you think you
[2:55:46.440 --> 2:55:50.880]  can use these platforms for ten years for free they're selling every piece of
[2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:55.400]  data you give them and you sign your rights away when you click that box it
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:58.520]  says accept so I don't know if that answers your question but we have info

[2:56:08.280 --> 2:56:11.960]  media platforms that's all you see on television that's all they promote
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:16.360]  that's all they advertise because it's all part of the same system gathering
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:21.480]  your data gathering the intelligence mapping the human genome but they roll
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:26.360]  it out as a trendy social media thing so that you love it you absorb it you use
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:31.760]  it for free and then they use that to map out and the whole human genome and
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:35.440]  then to get all the data on you and everybody else that then will be rolled
[2:56:35.440 --> 2:56:41.200]  out with the AI once that comes along to dictate who gets what services and who
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:46.840]  can or can't buy a car etc. what you're doing conceiting defeat man I mean you
[2:56:46.840 --> 2:56:51.680]  got to be smarter than they are you attack instead of defend you guys are
[2:56:51.680 --> 2:56:56.960]  defending yourself too much attack them back I don't get it man I all I know so
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:01.600]  what do you want us to do okay okay here let me put it like this you know
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:07.560]  what the how they control the masses it's money money right you guys have to

[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:26.800]  violating it so you can get on a computer or one and you can create
[2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:31.720]  trains because it's just stupid digits and a computer all right well okay Joel
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:37.560]  I'm not disagreeing with you but it's a little existential I think to try to find
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:41.440]  a solution to now I mean you want to talk about you know the private Federal

[2:59:48.440 --> 2:59:53.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:59:53.880 --> 3:00:09.160]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[3:00:09.160 --> 3:00:14.520]  Troyer all right let me kind of just put a bow on that last caller because I
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:18.640]  understand and to a lot of people that see the issues with the censorship on
[3:00:18.640 --> 3:00:22.520]  Twitter and Facebook and all these social media platforms you you look at
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:26.880]  info wars and other leaders of the the freedom and liberty movement here in
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:30.640]  America and you say you point the finger at us and you say why aren't you
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:36.000]  building something that can compete well many have tried but you have to
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.560]  understand that it's it's an uphill battle and it's a rigged battle even if
[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:45.360]  info wars created a platform that could actually compete with Facebook we
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:49.000]  wouldn't get the traffic we wouldn't get the notoriety we wouldn't get the
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:53.200]  public promotion that Facebook that Twitter that YouTube gets so there's
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.640]  that aspect even if we had it there it still wouldn't get the mainstream
[3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:04.360]  traffic because it's not going to be promoted okay so there's one answer but
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:08.720]  secondly again because I understand where you're coming from but this is one
[3:01:08.720 --> 3:01:15.760]  of the biggest frustrations and so many times people will call up here or send
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:20.600]  me messages saying why aren't you doing this why don't you do this well why
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:25.280]  don't you do that I mean I'm not trying to be rude I understand you know you
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:29.160]  look at us as leaders you want us on the front lines to do more and we're
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:33.920]  trying to do as much as possible but again why don't you do it why don't you
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:38.120]  take the initiative so if you're sitting in a situation and you're saying why
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:43.680]  doesn't somebody do this here's a thought you do it that's how you change
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:51.200]  the world and as far as you know building social media or whatever have it
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:56.440]  okay maybe that's one solution but I've got a better solution get off social
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:02:01.560]  media get off Facebook get off Twitter and I know that I'm one of the voices
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:04.640]  in the wilderness that actually says this a lot of people disagree with me in
[3:02:04.640 --> 3:02:07.320]  fact Ali Alexander would disagree with me maybe we could have a debate about
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:12.000]  this I say just get it all just get rid of all of it just go back out into the
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:16.160]  real world have real conversations with people again learn how to communicate
[3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:20.360]  verbally with people again learn what it's like to go out into the physical
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:24.720]  realm and suffer and stride and then have victory and have success and then
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:29.840]  know what it's like to really get high off life not the fake as medic high that
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:36.160]  you get from social media so that's just kind of my to put a bow on the last
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:40.120]  caller if you're sitting in a situation we say why not you why don't you do
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:43.720]  this milk maybe you look into doing something like that and maybe you feel
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:45.800]  like you don't have the means you don't have the money you don't have the
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:50.320]  wherewithal whatever well maybe we don't either you know we're kind of spread
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:55.640]  thin right now as it is doing everything we do here but again that's a debate you
[3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:00.000]  can have I think the debate you have first is if you see the problem on
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:05.240]  Facebook if you see the problem on Twitter just get off of it just leave it
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:10.520]  nobody's making you go on there nobody's making you post on Facebook nobody's
[3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:16.600]  making you post on Twitter but like they admitted it's like a drug now it's
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:20.560]  like telling the heroin addict to put down the needle it's like telling the
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:27.720]  cocaine addict to quit snorting cocaine it's an addiction now they can't put it
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:34.560]  down it has become a physical addiction and they need that dopamine release
[3:03:34.560 --> 3:03:38.600]  every two seconds so they keep posting and they keep posting and they keep
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:42.960]  posting and they just want to like they could just get the like if they could
[3:03:42.960 --> 3:03:46.720]  just get that follow from Justin Bieber if they could just get that follow from
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:49.960]  their favorite athlete if they could just get a hundred likes if they could
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:53.940]  just get a retweet from their favorite celebrity oh the dopamine hit would be so
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:57.780]  huge and so they just sit there trying to get that high trying to reach that
[3:03:57.780 --> 3:04:05.780]  that plateau and it'll never be delivered. It will never be delivered. You want to get
[3:04:05.780 --> 3:04:14.860]  high off-life? Go get a paddleboard and paddle five miles up the local river. Go get a canoe
[3:04:14.860 --> 3:04:18.980]  and go canoeing in some canals and some creeks that might be a little tough to keep your
[3:04:18.980 --> 3:04:23.980]  balance and then you get stronger and you learn how to canoe. That's how you get high.
[3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:32.140]  That is how you win. So you want to be a loser? Sit on social media all day and post a bunch
[3:04:32.140 --> 3:04:36.780]  of selfies and post your favorite meal and just hope somebody retweets you and likes
[3:04:36.780 --> 3:04:40.780]  it and maybe you'll get a little dopamine hit. But you want to be a real success? You
[3:04:40.780 --> 3:04:46.220]  want to experience being high off-life? Go out into the real world with a goal and challenge
[3:04:46.220 --> 3:04:54.740]  yourself and suffer and strive and have a victory. That is how you really get high.

[3:06:21.580 --> 3:06:31.340]  I just want to put a bow on what I'm saying here. Because it all ties in together. It's
[3:06:31.340 --> 3:06:36.980]  all about striving. It's all about conquering challenges. And people just think because
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:42.780]  a challenge is so big they can't do it. No, you can do it. You are a human. You have incredible
[3:06:42.780 --> 3:06:48.940]  capabilities, man. And I'm just sitting here thinking about how I can kind of personify
[3:06:48.940 --> 3:06:55.380]  this. And I look at myself. You can go look at videos where four or five years ago when
[3:06:55.380 --> 3:06:58.780]  I first started getting to politics. I was in sports media. I was on sports talk radio
[3:06:58.780 --> 3:07:04.100]  and I had a flute in the door in sports media and I could have gone down that career path.
[3:07:04.100 --> 3:07:10.060]  And I remember sitting in my apartment, you know, four or five years ago shooting rinky
[3:07:10.060 --> 3:07:15.340]  dink videos for years. Nobody would watch them. I'd get like 30 views here, 100 views
[3:07:15.340 --> 3:07:20.260]  here, maybe max out at 200 views. But I'd keep doing them. I'd keep cranking them out.
[3:07:20.260 --> 3:07:23.700]  I keep doing it. And people would say, why are you doing this? You're wasting your time.
[3:07:23.700 --> 3:07:27.420]  Invest here. Try to sell more ad space on sports talk radio. You know, you got a foot in the
[3:07:27.420 --> 3:07:31.140]  door here. You're doing, you're spending hours doing these videos. Nobody's watching. Nobody's
[3:07:31.140 --> 3:07:35.580]  watching. You'll never make it anywhere. You're wasting your time. And I just kept
[3:07:35.580 --> 3:07:40.300]  chugging along. I kept persevering. I kept pushing through. And now here I am sitting
[3:07:40.300 --> 3:07:45.580]  in for Alex Jones. There is no obstacle that's too big for you as long as you continue to
[3:07:45.580 --> 3:07:49.500]  fight as long as you believe in yourself, as long as you have the strength and courage
[3:07:49.500 --> 3:07:55.620]  to step out onto the platform, put your neck out there, give it your best. You will have
[3:07:55.620 --> 3:08:00.060]  a victory. You will have deliverance. What you don't think you can make a social media
[3:08:00.060 --> 3:08:05.500]  platform because you don't have millions of dollars. I bet you can if you apply yourself.
[3:08:05.500 --> 3:08:10.860]  But like this whole notion of human capability has just been beaten out of us. Like you can't
[3:08:10.860 --> 3:08:15.100]  do anything without the government. You can't do anything without a bureaucracy. You can't
[3:08:15.100 --> 3:08:23.460]  do anything without help from an establishment. No, you can do everything. So I just want
[3:08:23.460 --> 3:08:27.660]  people to understand that, man. You can change the world. You can be anything. It might take
[3:08:27.660 --> 3:08:31.580]  a year. It might take two years. It might take five years. It might take 10 years, but you
[3:08:31.580 --> 3:08:35.900]  can have your deliverance. You can have your victory. And that's when you will be high
[3:08:35.900 --> 3:08:41.460]  off life and you won't need some stupid social media account to post Twitter hashtags all
[3:08:41.460 --> 3:08:47.060]  day. All right. I'm going to chop that down right there. And I'm going to go back out
[3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:54.260]  to the phone lines. Let's go to Jake calling in from Ohio. Go ahead, Jake. How are you,
[3:08:54.260 --> 3:08:59.820]  Owen? I'm doing fine. In fact, to everybody else that ever calls into the show, I'm doing
[3:08:59.820 --> 3:09:03.900]  great. So don't even bother asking me. I'm kicking ass, Jake.
[3:09:03.900 --> 3:09:10.740]  That's great, man. I'm glad to hear it. I'm stoked. Hey, I just had a question for you,
[3:09:10.740 --> 3:09:16.980]  Owen. I just wanted you to compare and contrast a little bit of Trump and a little bit of
[3:09:16.980 --> 3:09:22.380]  Bush from years ago. I remember Bush always telling us years ago, oh, they hate you because
[3:09:22.380 --> 3:09:26.460]  you're freedom. They hate you because of your freedom. That's why they hate you.
[3:09:26.460 --> 3:09:30.100]  Yeah, that's why the 9-11 attacks happened, right? That's why Islam hates us because
[3:09:30.100 --> 3:09:34.620]  of our freedoms. Right. But now we want to bring them all in, though. But now we want
[3:09:34.620 --> 3:09:38.940]  to bring them all in. We didn't have a debate. We didn't have a moment in time where that
[3:09:38.940 --> 3:09:45.700]  narrative changed. It just happened. Right. And I'm freaking out about this whole thing
[3:09:45.700 --> 3:09:52.100]  with the immigrants and they're trying to bring millions of them in and like they were
[3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:58.860]  saying on the news not too long ago, popping borders at $40,000 a year or that is the phone
[3:09:58.860 --> 3:10:00.780]  number. I'm not exactly sure.
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:07.500]  $50,000, $50,000 illegals trying to cross the border were apprehended in May. $50,000
[3:10:07.500 --> 3:10:15.980]  in the month of May. Oh my God. Yeah, that's staggering. Well, I hope you guys keep up the
[3:10:15.980 --> 3:10:21.060]  good fight and we're all with you out here, man.
[3:10:21.060 --> 3:10:25.020]  Well, thank you for the call, Jake. It's just crazy. There's a story right there. Border
[3:10:25.020 --> 3:10:30.140]  arrest exceed $50,000 for third month in a row. But I want to go back to the point that
[3:10:30.140 --> 3:10:36.100]  Jake made here because this is actually so crucial. And Trump knows this, folks. Whether
[3:10:36.100 --> 3:10:40.420]  he decides to do something about this or not, only time will tell. But what he just said
[3:10:40.420 --> 3:10:48.740]  is so key. Let's rewind the clocks back to 2001, 2002. I believe it was, what was the
[3:10:48.740 --> 3:10:54.780]  official date? See if you guys can find the official date when President George Bush announced
[3:10:54.780 --> 3:10:59.460]  the war in Iraq, the war on terror. I remember the press conference. I remember I was at
[3:10:59.460 --> 3:11:05.900]  my friend's house and I remember hearing it on the radio and it was just like the last
[3:11:05.900 --> 3:11:12.060]  caller was saying, Islam hates us. Islam attacked us on 9-11 because they hate our way of life.
[3:11:12.060 --> 3:11:16.420]  They want us all to die and we all bought into it. Of course we did. They just took down
[3:11:16.420 --> 3:11:22.620]  the Twin Towers. Okay, it was 2013. Thank you, crew. And then they launched the war in Iraq.
[3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:28.260]  No Iraqis involved in the 9-11 attack. Okay, so there's that whole thing. They blame Osama
[3:11:28.260 --> 3:11:33.900]  bin Laden. Osama bin Laden was a CIA operative for decades in the Middle East and in Russia.
[3:11:33.900 --> 3:11:39.700]  Okay, so then there's that angle. Then you have the magic, what, eight passports on a
[3:11:39.700 --> 3:11:46.380]  heap of lava, a heap of burning lava that lasted for two years. No other incidents ever
[3:11:46.380 --> 3:11:51.820]  has there been molten lava at the base of a building that caught fire, a structure fire
[3:11:51.820 --> 3:11:59.380]  that lasted for two years. Okay, but that's just another side issue. Magically, passports
[3:11:59.380 --> 3:12:07.380]  are just on top of the ash heap of Saudi Arabians. So none of it makes sense, but because of
[3:12:07.380 --> 3:12:13.460]  the emotional heartstrings, they say, look at what happened at the Twin Towers. Look
[3:12:13.460 --> 3:12:18.300]  what happened at the Pentagon. Radical Islam attacked us. They hate our way of life. So
[3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:28.180]  we went to war with radical Islam and terrorism. Now we flash forward to today and we never
[3:12:28.180 --> 3:12:32.380]  really addressed that. We never really declared victory over that. We never really said that
[3:12:32.380 --> 3:12:37.940]  that was no longer an issue. But now, all of a sudden, we're saying, Muslim is the religion
[3:12:37.940 --> 3:12:43.380]  of peace and we need to have all of our borders open and we need to bring in as many people
[3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:47.140]  from Muslim countries as possible to be tolerant. And you sit in your scratch your head and you
[3:12:47.140 --> 3:12:52.780]  say, wait a second, we never stopped the war on terror. We never stopped the war on radical
[3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:59.260]  Islam. Why all of a sudden are we bringing these people in? And now you want to go really
[3:12:59.260 --> 3:13:10.300]  to questionable standards. Think about this. And this is where I think for most people,
[3:13:10.300 --> 3:13:18.260]  the logic shuts down. If you are from one of these Middle Eastern countries, whether
[3:13:18.260 --> 3:13:25.540]  it be Libya, whether it be Iraq, that was destroyed because of America's foreign policy,
[3:13:25.540 --> 3:13:31.500]  okay, no matter what religion you are. Let's say you're in Libya, you're in Iraq, your
[3:13:31.500 --> 3:13:37.700]  country was destroyed because of America's foreign policy. You pride family members die.
[3:13:37.700 --> 3:13:42.980]  Now you don't think that there might be an element of citizens from those two countries
[3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:49.380]  that might want to come here and kill us. But they don't even think about that. It's
[3:13:49.380 --> 3:13:53.620]  okay. Let's go bomb the Middle East. Let's go destroy the Middle East. Let's go disrupt
[3:13:53.620 --> 3:13:58.100]  the Middle East. It's a war on terror. And then that just kind of sits out there. And
[3:13:58.100 --> 3:14:01.780]  then 10 years later, we say, look at all the people in the Middle East. We got to bring
[3:14:01.780 --> 3:14:05.020]  them here. We got to bring them all in. We got to be tolerant. We got to bring them all
[3:14:05.020 --> 3:14:11.460]  in. So wait, if we were there unjustifiably to begin with, murdering and pillaging and
[3:14:11.460 --> 3:14:18.220]  destroying countries, wouldn't they want to come here and kill us? Or if we're at war
[3:14:18.220 --> 3:14:22.380]  with Islam that wants to kill us and hates our way of life, and we've been at war for
[3:14:22.380 --> 3:14:29.460]  decades, why do we want to bring them in here? This is the general logic and reasoning that
[3:14:29.460 --> 3:14:34.100]  has escaped the average American. But beyond the average American, it's not even their
[3:14:34.100 --> 3:14:40.020]  fault. This is the average logic and reasoning that we don't even get from our own government
[3:14:40.020 --> 3:14:43.820]  that starts these wars. This is the logic and reasoning that we don't even get from
[3:14:43.820 --> 3:14:49.780]  the mainstream media that lies us into these wars. Okay? So of course, the average minion
[3:14:49.780 --> 3:14:55.700]  out there, think about it. Everybody's probably been through this. You're going through life.
[3:14:55.700 --> 3:15:01.180]  Everything's hunky dory. And you really don't understand how fake television news is, how
[3:15:01.180 --> 3:15:06.620]  corrupt television news is, how corrupt the government is, how literally television news
[3:15:06.620 --> 3:15:10.460]  for the most part, I mean, I'll give Fox News credit. I don't think it's totally controlled
[3:15:10.460 --> 3:15:16.380]  like it used to be. Do most of the people on there have, you know, let's just say Jewish
[3:15:16.380 --> 3:15:21.220]  backgrounds or pro-Israel? Absolutely. But that's not illegal. That's not intentionally
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:24.420]  trying to lie the American public anything. You know, you have people that say that's
[3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:30.540]  going on. But again, it's about the general logic and reasoning that television news fails
[3:15:30.540 --> 3:15:34.940]  to deliver. But as soon as you realize they were never there to deliver that in the first
[3:15:34.940 --> 3:15:39.940]  place, that's when you start to wake up. As soon as you realize the purpose of television
[3:15:39.940 --> 3:15:45.820]  news was not to inform you, but to keep you brainwashed and going along with whatever the
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:49.620]  government wants to do, that's when you start to understand everything. We'll take more
[3:15:49.620 --> 3:15:53.740]  of your calls on the other side. Don't go anywhere.

[3:19:53.180 --> 3:20:17.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening
[3:20:17.740 --> 3:20:29.700]  to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:20:29.700 --> 3:20:39.420]  If you're on any mainstream media outlet, whether it be Twitter, Facebook, Google, you're
[3:20:39.420 --> 3:20:47.980]  pretty much just getting riddled with liberal propaganda nonstop. And it's because of that
[3:20:47.980 --> 3:20:58.660]  environment that they create, they have this false consensus. They create a false consensus
[3:20:58.660 --> 3:21:03.160]  that everybody hates Trump or that everybody feels one way about immigration or everybody
[3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:08.740]  feels one way about this. It's a false consensus that they use because the heads of all these
[3:21:08.740 --> 3:21:16.100]  media companies work together to push out the propaganda that then creates the false
[3:21:16.100 --> 3:21:21.540]  consensus. So then the average street liberal thinks that they're in the right, they're
[3:21:21.540 --> 3:21:26.980]  in the popular opinion because the media outlets they go to, whether it be again Snapchat,
[3:21:26.980 --> 3:21:32.100]  Twitter, Facebook, Google would have you, it all confirms this false consensus that was
[3:21:32.100 --> 3:21:38.020]  never true to begin with. So then when Hillary Clinton loses an election, when Donald Trump
[3:21:38.020 --> 3:21:42.980]  continues to get more popular, they can't even believe it because they buy into the
[3:21:42.980 --> 3:21:48.020]  false consensus that they're getting from their liberal controlled platforms.
[3:21:48.020 --> 3:21:53.740]  Now, it's because of this false consensus that Alec Baldwin can say something as stupid
[3:21:53.740 --> 3:21:59.580]  as this. Alec Baldwin is sure he would win if he ran for president. He says, hands down,
[3:21:59.580 --> 3:22:04.460]  I would win. Well, I'd like to see Alec Baldwin one run for president. And I would bet you
[3:22:04.460 --> 3:22:13.220]  he wouldn't even get out of the primary. There isn't a soul in America that could beat Donald
[3:22:13.220 --> 3:22:19.020]  Trump in a presidential election right now. That's why the Democrats have nothing. There
[3:22:19.020 --> 3:22:24.780]  is nobody can beat Trump. Trump is so popular. Trump is so smart. Trump continues to deliver.
[3:22:24.780 --> 3:22:29.100]  There is absolutely no one in this country right now that could beat Trump in a presidential
[3:22:29.100 --> 3:22:35.140]  election. And they know it. But I would love to see Alec Baldwin fall on his own sword
[3:22:35.140 --> 3:22:38.380]  and run for president and get embarrassed because he wouldn't even make it out of the
[3:22:38.380 --> 3:22:44.220]  primary. So that would be fun. Let's take a look at some anti-American news here just
[3:22:44.220 --> 3:22:49.420]  to show you the state of the country that was created by the bureaucracies. Chopping
[3:22:49.420 --> 3:22:56.980]  down a tree in New York nets a man $22,000 in fines. A Long Island man is being fined
[3:22:56.980 --> 3:23:06.220]  for more than $20,000 for chopping down his own trees. His own trees on his own property.
[3:23:06.220 --> 3:23:14.260]  He now gets fined more than $20,000. How American? Oh, that's so American. That's so independent.
[3:23:14.260 --> 3:23:17.860]  That's so free. And if he was going to like build something with that using the wood like
[3:23:17.860 --> 3:23:21.100]  furniture or a boat or something, that'd probably be another fine. You're not allowed
[3:23:21.100 --> 3:23:26.060]  to be independent in this country. Don't you know this is America? California man has home
[3:23:26.060 --> 3:23:30.900]  rated guns confiscated after trying to register firearms. So here's a guy who actually wanted
[3:23:30.900 --> 3:23:36.740]  to obey the law. Again, a law abiding gun owner. So he tries to register as AR. Guess what
[3:23:36.740 --> 3:23:43.980]  happens? Was it the FBI? I mean, was it local law enforcement or the FBI? I can't remember.
[3:23:43.980 --> 3:23:53.180]  California DOJ raided his home and confiscated his guns. And they say that we're sensationalist
[3:23:53.180 --> 3:23:58.500]  when we tell you that's what they want. That's what they just did in California to a law
[3:23:58.500 --> 3:24:04.700]  abiding citizen. But guess what? All the gangbangers, the Crips and the Bloods, they're not going
[3:24:04.700 --> 3:24:11.660]  to register their guns. They're going to keep their guns. These policies are so stupid.
[3:24:11.660 --> 3:24:17.980]  So the law abiding gun owner gets his house raided and his guns confiscated. So now he's
[3:24:17.980 --> 3:24:23.180]  disarmed. He's a peasant. Meanwhile, the gangbangers and the Crips and the Bloods, they still
[3:24:23.180 --> 3:24:28.380]  allow that. In fact, they're in control now in some areas in LA. The cops won't even go
[3:24:28.380 --> 3:24:29.700]  in.
[3:24:29.700 --> 3:24:38.940]  Let's go back out the phone line. Maybe someone can make sense of all this. Let's go to James
[3:24:38.940 --> 3:24:41.100]  in Ohio. Go ahead, James. You're on the air.
[3:24:41.100 --> 3:24:47.020]  Hey, Owen. Thanks for taking my call. Hey, I wanted to talk about Kim Jong-un, North Korean
[3:24:47.020 --> 3:24:53.980]  summit with President Trump. It would be a great day for the entire world to have world
[3:24:53.980 --> 3:25:03.580]  peace. This is our only shot with North Korea. North Korea has closed their borders, shut
[3:25:03.580 --> 3:25:10.300]  everything down. They don't have the immigration coming in going, not like the scale like what
[3:25:10.300 --> 3:25:12.500]  all these other countries are having.
[3:25:12.500 --> 3:25:17.620]  Yeah, that's true. And nobody gives North Korea a hard time about that.
[3:25:17.620 --> 3:25:24.700]  I mean, they just let North Korea get by with it. But you know what? And then with the IG
[3:25:24.700 --> 3:25:31.540]  report coming out, it'll be a Christmas miracle. Maybe finally, these globalists, it'll break
[3:25:31.540 --> 3:25:36.940]  their backs and it'll throw all of them in prison. And a lot of them deserve to be charged
[3:25:36.940 --> 3:25:38.940]  with war crimes.
[3:25:38.940 --> 3:25:48.780]  And treason. But here's the real hope, I think, James, is no matter what Trump does or what
[3:25:48.780 --> 3:25:56.380]  anybody from the government does, it won't matter if we the people aren't behind it.
[3:25:56.380 --> 3:26:04.900]  So I mean, does that make sense? It's like the next president can come in and revert
[3:26:04.900 --> 3:26:09.820]  everything Trump did if the people still have a veil covering their face, if they still
[3:26:09.820 --> 3:26:14.300]  have blinders on, you know what I'm saying? So the real victory, the real chance for world
[3:26:14.300 --> 3:26:20.900]  peace is that citizens of the world actually understand what's been going on.
[3:26:20.900 --> 3:26:26.700]  So I agree with you that Trump is laying the groundwork for these things to come together.
[3:26:26.700 --> 3:26:32.500]  But for example, if the even if the IG report comes out, totally exposes Obama, totally
[3:26:32.500 --> 3:26:37.500]  exposes Comey, mainly Comey, and that's what we're expecting. But if the people don't
[3:26:37.500 --> 3:26:41.420]  believe it, you know, what do we do then, James?
[3:26:41.420 --> 3:26:47.660]  Well, then that's when I think we need to start criminal investigations and criminal
[3:26:47.660 --> 3:26:54.580]  indictments and start lining up one by one and just basically flat output. You're all
[3:26:54.580 --> 3:27:00.540]  being charged with war crimes against humanity. You're not going to get out out of prison.
[3:27:00.540 --> 3:27:06.500]  If another president comes in, he can't pardon you. So you're stuck in the head and we ain't
[3:27:06.500 --> 3:27:11.700]  got to look at these globalists anymore because they'll be all just stuck in prison somewhere
[3:27:11.700 --> 3:27:12.700]  out of our country.
[3:27:12.700 --> 3:27:17.460]  Well, here's the thing that Trump can do and he can't do it now. He could do this if
[3:27:17.460 --> 3:27:25.180]  he wanted to in his next term. But President Trump wouldn't do that now because he realized
[3:27:25.180 --> 3:27:32.580]  that this is tough. I think that that would actually be good for his ratings. But given
[3:27:32.580 --> 3:27:40.060]  how the media operates and everything else, I could see how he may not want to go down
[3:27:40.060 --> 3:27:45.340]  that line in his first term because he's afraid it could cost him in 2020 and all the negative
[3:27:45.340 --> 3:27:49.860]  media could just divide this country to an even worse extent than it is now. So he's
[3:27:49.860 --> 3:27:53.460]  kind of laying all the groundwork in his first term to get his ratings and his approval
[3:27:53.460 --> 3:27:58.980]  up. Maybe you get justice for these criminals, maybe not. But then in his second term, when
[3:27:58.980 --> 3:28:02.740]  he doesn't have to run for president again, then he can do that. And then he doesn't
[3:28:02.740 --> 3:28:06.660]  have to worry about the negative political consequences. So I think that could be something
[3:28:06.660 --> 3:28:11.020]  we see in the next four years if the IG report doesn't blow this thing out of the water and
[3:28:11.020 --> 3:28:14.820]  even the most brain dead people understand what's been going on. Anything else, James?
[3:28:14.820 --> 3:28:18.020]  No, that's it, Owen. Thanks for taking my call, though.
[3:28:18.020 --> 3:28:22.780]  All right. Thank you. All right. We've got two more segments left here on the Alex Jones

[3:29:23.340 --> 3:29:30.220]  You have been lied to. My name is Kevin Schipp. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally
[3:29:30.220 --> 3:29:34.580]  someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government
[3:29:34.580 --> 3:29:39.780]  ever. We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled
[3:29:39.780 --> 3:29:43.020]  by a shadow government. We got to get this out because just because you're awake folks
[3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:46.780]  doesn't mean other people aren't. This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library,
[3:29:46.780 --> 3:30:13.260]  to encourage them. Get them right now at killingunclesambook.com. Killingunclesambook.com.

[3:30:19.020 --> 3:30:23.500]  You are the info war. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important
[3:30:23.500 --> 3:30:29.380]  than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[3:30:29.380 --> 3:30:34.300]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking

[3:30:49.420 --> 3:30:57.100]  slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning. Patrick in the great nation
[3:30:57.100 --> 3:31:02.220]  of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding. Hey, I've been following
[3:31:02.220 --> 3:31:08.060]  you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when info wars and prison planet, it was
[3:31:08.060 --> 3:31:13.180]  just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial up internet
[3:31:13.180 --> 3:31:17.500]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed
[3:31:17.500 --> 3:31:22.020]  all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of survival shield
[3:31:22.020 --> 3:31:27.580]  and since then I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill,
[3:31:27.580 --> 3:31:32.220]  micro ZX body, it's all amazing. Thank you brother. Yeah and I wanted to say that by
[3:31:32.220 --> 3:31:37.740]  following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[3:31:37.740 --> 3:31:42.540]  you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God,
[3:31:42.540 --> 3:31:46.900]  but the more you chase God and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[3:31:46.900 --> 3:31:56.100]  with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide. Living in volcano may sound
[3:31:56.100 --> 3:32:01.100]  more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Lelani estates,
[3:32:01.100 --> 3:32:05.700]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about
[3:32:05.700 --> 3:32:12.220]  ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[3:32:12.220 --> 3:32:18.020]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests
[3:32:18.020 --> 3:32:23.860]  for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[3:32:23.860 --> 3:32:29.020]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from
[3:32:29.020 --> 3:32:34.860]  our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[3:32:34.860 --> 3:32:41.300]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[3:32:41.300 --> 3:32:46.780]  raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[3:32:46.780 --> 3:32:52.380]  can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system
[3:32:52.380 --> 3:33:18.380]  will purify it.
[3:33:18.380 --> 3:33:24.420]  One of the most important things here, one of the most important things to realize here
[3:33:24.420 --> 3:33:31.940]  and that needs to happen is the facade that somebody on television is the expert. Somebody
[3:33:31.940 --> 3:33:37.940]  on television is the one to trust or that politician, that senator, he must be trustworthy.
[3:33:37.940 --> 3:33:44.420]  She must be trustworthy. Certainly, they're in that position of power. They must be trustworthy.
[3:33:44.420 --> 3:33:52.580]  As soon as that facade breaks, it's game over for fake media and it's game over for
[3:33:52.580 --> 3:34:00.260]  our corrupt government. Think about it like this. I've met Don Lemon before. I've met
[3:34:00.260 --> 3:34:06.540]  Van Jones before. I've had conversation with them. Van Jones, actually a smart guy, actually
[3:34:06.540 --> 3:34:14.700]  can think pretty quick with it. Don Lemon, on the other hand, is the equivalent in IQ
[3:34:14.700 --> 3:34:24.540]  to a lemon head, the candy, the candy, the little candy drop. But let's say Don Lemon
[3:34:24.540 --> 3:34:28.180]  was sitting right here in studio next to me. Let's get a wide shot here. So Don Lemon
[3:34:28.180 --> 3:34:35.060]  is sitting right here and then I'm sitting right here. The average person in America
[3:34:35.060 --> 3:34:40.820]  that watches TV news would assume that Don Lemon has more credibility than me and that
[3:34:40.820 --> 3:34:47.300]  Don Lemon is smarter than me. Why? Well, because he's on TV. He's on CNN. So he has to be.
[3:34:47.300 --> 3:34:53.480]  As soon as that facade breaks, it's game over for corporate media and then it's game over
[3:34:53.480 --> 3:35:00.900]  for the politicians they protect. This has been one of the biggest facades carried out
[3:35:00.900 --> 3:35:06.380]  on the American public in this country's history that just because someone is on TV, they have
[3:35:06.380 --> 3:35:12.820]  to be trustworthy. In fact, quite the opposite. If you see someone on TV, you probably can't
[3:35:12.820 --> 3:35:19.940]  trust them, especially if they're on CNN or MSNBC. But that's the facade that's beginning
[3:35:19.940 --> 3:35:25.300]  to fall and they keep outing themselves more and more every day as the total corporate
[3:35:25.300 --> 3:35:30.820]  stooge is that they are. Now, let me hit some news and then go back out of the phone lines.
[3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:38.660]  Federal government spends $700,000 using the church to tell Latinos to exercise. You know,
[3:35:38.660 --> 3:35:44.220]  this makes no sense. And reading the story, it really makes me wonder if there isn't something
[3:35:44.220 --> 3:35:49.660]  behind this that they're not telling us. But let's just pretend there's not. Why is
[3:35:49.660 --> 3:35:55.700]  the federal government spending almost a million dollars going into Catholic churches with
[3:35:55.700 --> 3:36:05.020]  mostly Latino congregations and getting them to exercise? A, again, what happened to separation
[3:36:05.020 --> 3:36:11.180]  of church and state? But B, $700,000 to do a study on getting Latinos to exercise at a
[3:36:11.180 --> 3:36:19.300]  park and they're using the Catholic Church as their segue into that? Just doesn't make
[3:36:19.300 --> 3:36:28.020]  any sense to me. Mexican politician shot dead immediately after a presidential debate. Or
[3:36:28.020 --> 3:36:30.620]  I don't know if it was a presidential debate. Actually, I forget what the nature of the
[3:36:30.620 --> 3:36:36.620]  debate was. I think it was though. But so he finishes his debate, an election debate with
[3:36:36.620 --> 3:36:43.380]  a rival congressional candidate. This guy was a former, I believe it was a former governor,
[3:36:43.380 --> 3:36:52.300]  Fernando Perón. And he's tough with law enforcement. He's a law and order candidate.
[3:36:52.300 --> 3:36:57.940]  What happens immediately after his debate? He's taking a selfie shot in the head dead.
[3:36:57.940 --> 3:37:06.500]  Now I thought Mexico had a bunch of strict gun laws. I guess those gun laws didn't work
[3:37:06.500 --> 3:37:14.100]  out for the politician when he was taking a selfie Fernando Perón. So yeah, there's
[3:37:14.100 --> 3:37:21.620]  the footage right there. The crew found it. So this is just what you get in the country
[3:37:21.620 --> 3:37:25.180]  of Mexico that's run by the cartels. Now, if you're a law and order candidate, you're
[3:37:25.180 --> 3:37:30.340]  going to get shot dead in the head. Boom. There it is. Okay. But let's bring that here.
[3:37:30.340 --> 3:37:34.820]  And then let's also bring Mexico's gun laws here too. That'll work. And let's bring this
[3:37:34.820 --> 3:37:40.620]  here. Sweden's largest football tournament, bands soccer. Sweden's largest football or
[3:37:40.620 --> 3:37:48.340]  soccer tournament, bands forbidden pork from the menu to please Muslims. Now, can you imagine
[3:37:48.340 --> 3:37:54.540]  going to a baseball game in America and wanting to get a hot dog? And they say, oh, I'm sorry,
[3:37:54.540 --> 3:37:59.580]  we don't serve hot dogs anymore. We're compliant with Sharia law. We don't want to offend any
[3:37:59.580 --> 3:38:06.860]  potential Muslims that could be here today. Not selling hot dogs at baseball to please
[3:38:06.860 --> 3:38:12.020]  Muslims. You better believe that was coming if Hillary Clinton got elected, ladies and
[3:38:12.020 --> 3:38:16.300]  gentlemen. I don't know about you, but I happen to like hot dogs at a baseball game, even
[3:38:16.300 --> 3:38:20.260]  though it's filled with, you know, Carson engines and crap. I still like the traditional
[3:38:20.260 --> 3:38:24.940]  hot dog at a baseball game. So I want to keep that American tradition going. All right, let's
[3:38:24.940 --> 3:38:30.700]  go back out with phone lines. Let's go to Carlos calling in from Montreal. Go ahead, Carlos.
[3:38:30.700 --> 3:38:36.140]  Thank you, Owen. How are you doing? Hey, does Justin Trudeau have fake eyebrows? I mean,
[3:38:36.140 --> 3:38:40.420]  what is the deal with this? I've seen multiple angles. Maybe it's a shadow. Maybe it's not.
[3:38:40.420 --> 3:38:44.860]  But they're they're making Trudeau out to be this this hero now. He's Captain Canada
[3:38:44.860 --> 3:38:48.100]  for standing up to Trump. But really, what is the deal with Trudeau's eyebrows? Are
[3:38:48.100 --> 3:38:53.340]  those real or fake? I don't know either. I think that it's who would let him go out
[3:38:53.340 --> 3:38:57.660]  of the house with fake eyebrows is beyond me. I mean, look at some of the stuff this
[3:38:57.660 --> 3:39:00.780]  guy says in the socks he wears. I mean, I don't really care. I wear goofy socks. In
[3:39:00.780 --> 3:39:05.780]  fact, I think I got some. I got some pretty goofy ones on right now, actually. So let
[3:39:05.780 --> 3:39:10.620]  me let me tell you something about the media. Okay, during World War II, people would turn
[3:39:10.620 --> 3:39:14.420]  to the radio every morning. They would have the radios anywhere, plug them in. If they
[3:39:14.420 --> 3:39:18.900]  had any electricity anywhere to listen to what was said over the radio, and they heard
[3:39:18.900 --> 3:39:24.380]  everything, they heard their goal, and they heard, you know, the government directing
[3:39:24.380 --> 3:39:30.100]  them, the trust in the media was very, very great. It was it was holy. The goal forward
[3:39:30.100 --> 3:39:35.980]  to President Johnson saying Walter Walter Concrete, I think I've lost him shortly after
[3:39:35.980 --> 3:39:41.260]  he resigned. He said he wasn't gonna run anymore. The power of the media is fantastic. It's
[3:39:41.260 --> 3:39:45.580]  the first thing that you take over when you when you want to take over a country. You
[3:39:45.580 --> 3:39:51.940]  want to control the media. So for Canadians and Americans to trust their media is is a
[3:39:51.940 --> 3:39:57.220]  holy thing. It's an important thing. And it's something that has been violated. This is
[3:39:57.220 --> 3:40:01.860]  very profound. I know that info wars. I know that other media trying always to address
[3:40:01.860 --> 3:40:07.220]  the fact that we're not being told the truth. If we were the Sopranos, we would say this
[3:40:07.220 --> 3:40:12.180]  is Crapola. This is not the truth. This is this is just what some marketing idiot or
[3:40:12.180 --> 3:40:19.820]  some global warming, you know, a fake group is trying to make money out of. They're using
[3:40:19.820 --> 3:40:25.180]  something valuable, something that should be really, really important, almost as important
[3:40:25.180 --> 3:40:31.800]  as having a defense against the foreigners. And this actually this principle applies thousands
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:37.540]  of years back in time. But it used to be religion. Religion is what they used to take
[3:40:37.540 --> 3:40:41.260]  control of to manipulate the population. I mean, look at the Catholic Church, look at
[3:40:41.260 --> 3:40:46.660]  the Vatican, the Illuminati took over the Catholic Church hundreds if not thousands of years
[3:40:46.660 --> 3:40:53.620]  ago and now they run the Vatican. Anytime there's a big discovery, specifically more
[3:40:53.620 --> 3:40:58.260]  so in Europe than anywhere else, but it happens in America, the Catholic Church moves in,
[3:40:58.260 --> 3:41:03.580]  takes the property, takes the grounds and then says you cannot excavate, you cannot dig
[3:41:03.580 --> 3:41:07.180]  for history and historical artifacts here anymore. It's like the same thing, but it's
[3:41:07.180 --> 3:41:11.580]  with the media now. The media is the trusted institution. So they trust whatever's digged
[3:41:11.580 --> 3:41:16.500]  up, whatever's found out, the media will tell them it's the exact opposite. But it would
[3:41:16.500 --> 3:41:21.380]  be nice though, Carlos. I mean, I could trust the media a little bit more if I could just
[3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:25.180]  find out the truth about Justin Trudeau's eyebrows because those things are really
[3:41:25.180 --> 3:41:30.220]  doing a number right now. Let's go to Chris also calling in from Canada. Chris, make this
[3:41:30.220 --> 3:41:32.380]  one quick. We got 60 seconds. Go ahead, Chris.
[3:41:32.380 --> 3:41:37.420]  It's actually a quick story. I just woke up this morning. I was having my tea and I turned
[3:41:37.420 --> 3:41:44.820]  on Fox News. And next thing I knew, I hear Trumps, Trump shaking hands at the summit
[3:41:44.820 --> 3:41:50.060]  with Kim Jong-un. And then they're basically celebrating it as the greatest achievement,
[3:41:50.060 --> 3:41:55.140]  yada, yada, yada. So for a laugh, I decided, I thought to myself, well, the liberals must
[3:41:55.140 --> 3:41:59.820]  be just going crazy over this. So I turned it over to CNN. Next thing I know, they're
[3:41:59.820 --> 3:42:05.420]  spinning it the complete opposite. Like it's some sort of mishap, some sort of big trouble
[3:42:05.420 --> 3:42:10.300]  for everybody. Like it made no sense to actually laugh, literally out loud, drop my remote
[3:42:10.300 --> 3:42:13.220]  on the floor. I almost fell in my teeth.
[3:42:13.220 --> 3:42:15.780]  No, CNN is not news anymore.
[3:42:15.780 --> 3:42:21.460]  Like it was great. I just couldn't believe that they were, on one hand, Fox is telling
[3:42:21.460 --> 3:42:25.540]  you, and I don't know if Fox is a bit biased, but either way, it is a great achievement.
[3:42:25.540 --> 3:42:30.060]  And on the other hand, you have CNN singing it like, it's the worst possible thing, worst
[3:42:30.060 --> 3:42:31.060]  possible outcome ever.
[3:42:31.060 --> 3:42:35.300]  But don't you see why CNN would say that? Because CNN's been lying about President
[3:42:35.300 --> 3:42:40.220]  Trump since day one. So because they've been lying about President Trump and they've told
[3:42:40.220 --> 3:42:46.540]  their audience he can't do X, Y, or Z, well, now he does X, Y, and Z, and CNN can't admit
[3:42:46.540 --> 3:42:50.060]  they're wrong. So they have to lie about what President Trump does. I mean, these people
[3:42:50.060 --> 3:42:53.700]  are some of the biggest scum on earth, honestly.

[3:46:11.060 --> 3:46:15.580]  and aren't even as good. It's a great deal normally at $39.95. Rain Force, you've never
[3:46:15.580 --> 3:46:21.220]  tried it. This is a great opportunity. $19.95. Also, Alpha Power is 50% off. If you don't
[3:46:21.220 --> 3:46:26.420]  know what it's done for me and so many others for stamina, focus, libido, it does so many
[3:46:26.420 --> 3:46:31.420]  things. X2. Even though we're having trouble sourcing the deep-earth crystals of the Good
[3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:38.300]  Halogen iodine, I am blowing out the stockpile of it we have at least for another few days
[3:46:38.300 --> 3:46:43.220]  at 50% off. And then after that, it's going to go back to full price until we secure more
[3:46:43.220 --> 3:46:50.140]  of it. InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or triple-A-2533139. And thank you all for
[3:46:50.140 --> 3:47:09.620]  helping fund the Second American Global Revolution.
[3:47:09.620 --> 3:47:22.300]  Here is the passion of slaves and this man knows no fear. He is Alex Jones.
[3:47:22.300 --> 3:47:25.900]  Okay, I'm going to do a quick news blitz here and then I'm going to take a couple more
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:31.300]  phone calls. So let's get right into this. Now, we protested Bill Clinton when he came
[3:47:31.300 --> 3:47:34.660]  to Austin, Texas. There were five people that got inside the event that shouted him
[3:47:34.660 --> 3:47:40.060]  down. Of course, Howard Kaplan protested him in Philadelphia. You had the Bill Clinton
[3:47:40.060 --> 3:47:44.460]  as a rapist contest that we did during the 2016 presidential elections. Bill Clinton
[3:47:44.460 --> 3:47:50.780]  says, norms of what you can do to someone against their will have changed. Just think
[3:47:50.780 --> 3:47:56.660]  about how broke Bill Clinton is that he would come out and say that. See, this is why it's
[3:47:56.660 --> 3:48:00.740]  so important to protest these people. This is why it's so important to stand up to these
[3:48:00.740 --> 3:48:05.020]  people because then they actually show their ugly face for who they really are. They actually
[3:48:05.020 --> 3:48:11.580]  have to answer real questions and have to talk about real issues when it comes to their
[3:48:11.580 --> 3:48:15.660]  behavior. So now Bill Clinton says, the norms of what you can do to someone against their
[3:48:15.660 --> 3:48:22.100]  will have changed. Oh, Bill, did you use to do something to women against their will?
[3:48:22.100 --> 3:48:27.660]  Oh, again, but of course he did. He had to settle rape cases. And then the women's marchers
[3:48:27.660 --> 3:48:32.020]  will pay a hundred bucks a pop just to go see Bill Clinton speak. That's how brainwashed
[3:48:32.020 --> 3:48:38.780]  they are. Talk about one of the dumbest people on television. Chelsea Handler, America is
[3:48:38.780 --> 3:48:46.100]  Russia with Trump running our country. Really? America is Russia. Yeah, I shouldn't even
[3:48:46.100 --> 3:48:53.140]  waste any more time than this. But I mean, seriously, Chelsea Handler, this is one of
[3:48:53.140 --> 3:49:03.460]  the biggest buffoons in television. She has no clue. How does somebody like this even
[3:49:03.460 --> 3:49:09.740]  have a job on TV? They're not funny. They're not entertaining. They're not smart. They
[3:49:09.740 --> 3:49:16.540]  pretty much suck at everything. Oh, I understand. That's why they're on TV. Okay, yep. Tech
[3:49:16.540 --> 3:49:22.220]  firms must stem flow of hate online, says Elton John. Well, Elton, here's the problem.
[3:49:22.220 --> 3:49:27.340]  The tech firms aren't the ones instigating the hate. The hate comes from the fake news.
[3:49:27.340 --> 3:49:32.740]  The hate comes from the Democrat Party and its minions. Then those minions go on social
[3:49:32.740 --> 3:49:37.660]  media and spread that hate. So if social media is responsible for any of the hate being spread
[3:49:37.660 --> 3:49:44.420]  online, it's the censorship of the truth to then force the false consensus of the hate
[3:49:44.420 --> 3:49:49.420]  that's coming from the left. So it's really not really the tech firms fall. I mean, really,
[3:49:49.420 --> 3:49:53.300]  if you want to find the source of the hate, it's from the Democrat Party. It's from the
[3:49:53.300 --> 3:49:58.900]  liberal media. But then the social media giants kind of spark it by censoring the truth and
[3:49:58.900 --> 3:50:02.180]  going along with the false consensus. I don't know if Elton John understands that or not,
[3:50:02.180 --> 3:50:06.180]  but hey, maybe he's listening.
[3:50:06.180 --> 3:50:12.900]  London mayor protests Wikipedia's gender pay gap amid crime surge. So first, he's forced
[3:50:12.900 --> 3:50:19.660]  to admit this is part and parcel terrorism, radical Islamist mayor of London, Sadiq Khan,
[3:50:19.660 --> 3:50:26.060]  the con job, the con mayor. First, he has to come out and admit that it's his fault that
[3:50:26.060 --> 3:50:30.460]  crime has spiked in London. It's his fault that all the violence and hatred has come
[3:50:30.460 --> 3:50:36.820]  to London. Then he puts his foot in his mouth and realizes, oh, I better distract from that.
[3:50:36.820 --> 3:50:41.340]  And so he goes back to the virtue signaling saying, I'm going to stand up for women. There's
[3:50:41.340 --> 3:50:48.540]  a gender pay gap at Wikipedia. How about the way women are treated inside Islamic strongholds,
[3:50:48.540 --> 3:50:54.140]  Sadiq Khan? What a total phony that guy is. Here's one for you.
[3:50:54.140 --> 3:51:02.900]  Pregnant man, yes, pregnant man and flower power at London's men's fashion week. So now
[3:51:02.900 --> 3:51:14.660]  men's fashion includes being pregnant. Okay, this is actually strange. Let me go to the
[3:51:14.660 --> 3:51:19.060]  phone lines. Yeah, there it is right there. A man showing off a fake. It's a I'm pretty
[3:51:19.060 --> 3:51:22.660]  sure it's a fake pregnant belly. Actually, I read the story, but that's trendy now.
[3:51:22.660 --> 3:51:36.060]  It's now fashionable to be fake pregnant as a man. I tell you, if that is not Wow. Hey,
[3:51:36.060 --> 3:51:41.060]  news of the paranormal here. I try to inject a little bit of this into every broadcast.
[3:51:41.060 --> 3:51:46.180]  Missile launch lens flare mysterious objects spotted over Wind Bay Island raises questions.
[3:51:46.180 --> 3:51:50.940]  Now folks, this is not a lens flare. And I'll say if you if you look into paranormal stuff
[3:51:50.940 --> 3:51:55.300]  on the internet, a lot of what you're going to see is lens flares or light reflections
[3:51:55.300 --> 3:52:00.660]  and stuff like that. It can be explained. Not this one. I don't know what this deal
[3:52:00.660 --> 3:52:07.020]  is folks, but that ain't no lens flare. Okay, there ain't a professional photographer alive.
[3:52:07.020 --> 3:52:11.940]  That's going to believe that's a lens flare. Now what it is, nobody knows the Navy said
[3:52:11.940 --> 3:52:17.020]  they don't know, you know, all the locals in in Washington in the government saying they
[3:52:17.020 --> 3:52:22.660]  have no idea what this is. But a shocking image captured by a cameraman is certainly
[3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:26.980]  raising a lot of questions. Again, we don't get into too much paranormal hill, folks.
[3:52:26.980 --> 3:52:32.540]  But let me just tell you if for people that are into that, there is more paranormal activity
[3:52:32.540 --> 3:52:36.620]  happening on planet Earth right now. And I don't know if this is just because it's easier
[3:52:36.620 --> 3:52:42.240]  to to film it and to put it out there for people to see or if it's just generally increasing.
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:46.500]  But it's pretty well stuff if you're into that. A lot of this is not just hearsay made
[3:52:46.500 --> 3:52:52.140]  up stuff. A lot of this stuff you can actually see in real time with the evidence. So that's
[3:52:52.140 --> 3:52:56.900]  that's all going on. Not sure what's up with that. But it certainly is an interesting aspect
[3:52:56.900 --> 3:53:00.540]  right now of life on planet Earth. All right, let's squeeze in a couple phone calls here
[3:53:00.540 --> 3:53:04.780]  guys, please make it quick. Let's go to John calling in from Ontario, Canada. Go ahead,
[3:53:04.780 --> 3:53:05.780]  John.
[3:53:05.780 --> 3:53:16.100]  Hey, John, I don't want to waste anyone else's time. We can't really hear you. Are you on
[3:53:16.100 --> 3:53:17.100]  speakerphone or something?
[3:53:17.100 --> 3:53:27.380]  I'm sorry, John. I can't I'm sorry. I'm out of time, John. I can't I just can't understand
[3:53:27.380 --> 3:53:30.820]  you, brother. I'm so sorry. We he was holding for a long time, too. I'm sorry, John. Bad
[3:53:30.820 --> 3:53:33.420]  connection. Let's go to Adam in New York. Go ahead, Adam.
[3:53:33.420 --> 3:53:38.580]  Hey, I want to thank you for taking my call. Just really quick about the liberal hypocrisy
[3:53:38.580 --> 3:53:42.900]  and brainwashing. I pretty much agree with everything you're saying before. And you know,
[3:53:42.900 --> 3:53:48.140]  I get frustrated, too. But in a way, I think it's good because it kind of shows their hand
[3:53:48.140 --> 3:53:53.060]  when that blade bear kind of shows the people who aren't really awake. It kind of wakes
[3:53:53.060 --> 3:53:57.980]  them up. We're starting to see that now. And sometimes I like to think about one of my
[3:53:57.980 --> 3:54:05.820]  favorite Thomas Paine quotes. I'm going to paraphrase here. Arguing with someone without
[3:54:05.820 --> 3:54:11.900]  reason is like giving medicines to the dead. So I think a lot of these like really dedicated
[3:54:11.900 --> 3:54:15.900]  I call them globalist groupies. You can't really wake them up. Maybe they're beyond
[3:54:15.900 --> 3:54:20.900]  saving. But, you know, I think we just got to keep pointing out the hypocrisy, keep sharing
[3:54:20.900 --> 3:54:28.580]  all the clips and everything, keep sharing the links. And I think it is having an effect.
[3:54:28.580 --> 3:54:33.100]  Well, I think that you're 100% right. And don't, you know, don't be confused by my
[3:54:33.100 --> 3:54:37.900]  coverage of these events. I do believe that we are having massive victories. I do believe
[3:54:37.900 --> 3:54:43.200]  that the population of America that's not politically inclined, doesn't tend to pay
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:48.740]  attention to current events, generally just doesn't care. They are starting to see what
[3:54:48.740 --> 3:54:54.900]  the media really is. And while they don't understand the gravitas of it, they at least
[3:54:54.900 --> 3:55:00.780]  see it for what it is and now have that thought in their head when they see it the next time.
[3:55:00.780 --> 3:55:05.180]  So I do think you're right about that. And that is very key right now that I think, you
[3:55:05.180 --> 3:55:09.180]  know, just the average American that doesn't watch news, doesn't care, sees what the news
[3:55:09.180 --> 3:55:13.940]  really is. Again, they don't understand how deep it really goes. But when it comes to,
[3:55:13.940 --> 3:55:18.460]  you know, just general reporting on President Trump, for example, they understand that pretty
[3:55:18.460 --> 3:55:23.940]  much anything they see on CNN or MSNBC is probably a lie. And then the next level is,
[3:55:23.940 --> 3:55:27.900]  which I think, I don't know if this is what you're getting at, but again, is right on,
[3:55:27.900 --> 3:55:33.140]  they realize these people are genuinely anti-American. That's the craziest part. These people are
[3:55:33.140 --> 3:55:38.740]  so unhinged now, they're willing to come out as just straight up anti-American. We're
[3:55:38.740 --> 3:55:44.580]  now on CNN, they'll cheer North Korea before they will America.
[3:55:44.580 --> 3:55:50.700]  Yeah, it's just insane. And you know, the average person sees that and it really, I
[3:55:50.700 --> 3:55:56.700]  think that's like why their ratings are just in the toilet. You know, people are, it's
[3:55:56.700 --> 3:56:00.820]  taking them a while when people are finally starting to wake up, but we can't get complacent.
[3:56:00.820 --> 3:56:06.140]  We got to keep hammering, hammering on them, you know, keep getting it out.
[3:56:06.140 --> 3:56:10.940]  Well, Adam, we know where feces belongs and that's in the toilet. And that's where CNN's
[3:56:10.940 --> 3:56:14.220]  ratings are. Thank you so much for the call, Adam. All right, we're about to sign off here
[3:56:14.220 --> 3:56:20.860]  again. Again, the big news here today, President Trump, Kim Jong-un, reach an agreement, historic
[3:56:20.860 --> 3:56:24.540]  Korean summit. President Trump, I believe is, I think he's already left and he's on
[3:56:24.540 --> 3:56:29.300]  his way back to the States to get ready for the inspector general's report to be released
[3:56:29.300 --> 3:56:35.100]  Thursday where we're going to be doing a live 34-hour broadcast from Thursday through Friday.
[3:56:35.100 --> 3:56:37.740]  And then that'll conclude at 6 p.m. with the war room, but I'll just go ahead and let
[3:56:37.740 --> 3:56:42.940]  you know there's going to be a little bonus coverage Friday evening, not part of the 34-hour
[3:56:42.940 --> 3:56:46.420]  special, but there's going to be a little bonus coverage out there for you. I'm just
[3:56:46.420 --> 3:56:50.820]  going to leave that out there like leave that little bone out there for you to chew on.
