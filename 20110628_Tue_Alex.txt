[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:32.720]  Hello my friends Alex Jones here live with a bit of a horse voice from screaming at the
[00:32.720 --> 00:37.400]  corrupt House and Senate members in the Texas Legislature yesterday without the aid of a
[00:37.400 --> 00:45.080]  bullhorn inside of the Capitol they also pulled a nice stunt where we got the Patriots into
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.840]  the gallery and then as they came out one by one I could scream full bore over the open
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.320]  door and audibly let them know that we were aware of their treason it was extremely effective
[00:56.320 --> 01:03.480]  just happened spontaneously think of the idea shot a lot of great footage inside we have
[01:03.480 --> 01:09.560]  some terrible news obviously on two different fronts dealing with the fight against the
[01:09.560 --> 01:18.160]  10th Amendment annihilating Goon forces of the TSA and a chronicle of the treacherous
[01:18.160 --> 01:27.200]  activity here in the great state of Texas that has turned the House bill into a toothless
[01:27.200 --> 01:38.280]  creature and the Senate bill into actual pro-New World Order law President setting law that
[01:38.280 --> 01:47.480]  any citizen can be detained without even reasonable suspicion because it redefines reasonable
[01:47.480 --> 01:52.120]  suspicion to not that you pull somebody over for a broken tail light and somebody's beating
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.880]  on the back of the truck saying help me that's reasonable suspicion or you see a heroin injector
[01:57.880 --> 02:06.600]  laying in the front seat of the car that's a reasonable suspicion no now just that anytime
[02:06.600 --> 02:15.360]  anywhere you can be en masse put on a terry stop or custodial arrest and that the proctology
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.840]  exams should then commence and so that is basically what they've done I stayed up here
[02:21.840 --> 02:27.120]  late last night going over the House bill I was unaware of the Senate after we left
[02:27.120 --> 02:33.280]  had passed the Senate bill then I read that this morning scanned over it and we're going
[02:33.280 --> 02:41.520]  to be breaking down for you exactly what's going on coming up at the bottom of this hour
[02:41.520 --> 02:48.520]  but I tend to gain my voice back it's strange once it's gotten the horse after I've been
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.720]  talking a while it's the opposite at least that's how my larynx works so I'm warming
[02:53.720 --> 03:03.160]  up right now and should be able to really properly be well it's like a race car engine
[03:03.160 --> 03:11.040]  or any engine I'm idling right now it's warming up my synapses are beginning to accelerate
[03:11.040 --> 03:18.320]  they're firing and so I'm going to get into that whole area once I've gotten to some of
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.120]  the other news at the bottom of the hour we have colonel Craig Robertson who doesn't
[03:23.120 --> 03:29.160]  do radio interviews anymore and I had to twist his arm last week to come on today he's a
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.960]  great guy he'll be joining us coming up he's a listener of the show he just doesn't go

[03:58.080 --> 04:03.560]  lead helicopter pilot for the police helicopter as well survived an amazing helicopter crash

[04:08.600 --> 04:17.320]  city and found out that well Billy Clinton or William Jefferson Clinton and his deputy
[04:17.320 --> 04:24.080]  attorney general and others at the time were pulling the strings on that event so and then
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.120]  on the subsequent cover-up and then then a lot of folks had to die of course in Oklahoma
[04:28.120 --> 04:33.960]  including a cop of the year in Oklahoma City Terrence Yeke when he wouldn't shut up even
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.080]  called his wife and said they were after him he thought that they poisoned him and he had
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.800]  to get to his locker and get the information out before he died and of course the he called
[04:44.800 --> 04:48.760]  his partner and said the FBI is behind me and well they pulled him over on that road
[04:48.760 --> 04:55.400]  and tortured him to death but we're gonna be talking to him Ron Paul today Webster Tarpley

[08:04.920 --> 08:25.080]  show because there's a war on for your mind it is Tuesday the 28th day of June 2011 I am Alex Jones
[08:25.080 --> 08:32.360]  your host I'm not a conservative I'm not a liberal you can't really call me a libertarian
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.800]  I'm a constitutionalist I'm a freedom lover I believe in right and wrong I don't look
[08:37.800 --> 08:41.840]  at subjects and say well I'm a Democrat so I'm gonna support whatever they're doing
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.400]  or I'm a Republican I'm gonna support whatever they're doing I'm gonna buy into whatever
[08:45.400 --> 08:52.600]  lies they're pushing I am a realist who wants to study reality and study the human species
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.320]  and our history our present and our future destiny and I'm attempting to make the world
[08:57.320 --> 09:03.800]  a better place and no matter how damaging to myself it is and to my name I will say
[09:03.800 --> 09:11.320]  what I believe the truth is period and it is an empowering thing in life to over the
[09:11.320 --> 09:18.600]  years train myself to not care what people think about me and in that I believe is the
[09:18.600 --> 09:24.440]  essence of true freedom the essence of art the essence of discovering more and more of
[09:24.440 --> 09:31.000]  what real reality is life is an adventure it is a quest every minute of it is magical
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.480]  and in understanding that you can also open up wider horizons and not let the Madison Avenue
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.920]  spin doctors make you feel inadequate so they can sell you their modern culture killing new world
[09:42.920 --> 09:54.040]  order system of death now I say this now pretty much at the beginning of every broadcast because
[09:54.040 --> 10:01.480]  it's true the amount of insane crazy out in the open tyranny and and world government open
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.600]  announcements and bizarre globalist activity fulfilling everything they promised that they
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.720]  would do is reaching a crescendo but every time I think we're reaching a crescendo a week later
[10:13.720 --> 10:23.480]  it makes the last finale look like a black cat firecracker compared to a howitzer shell going
[10:23.480 --> 10:29.400]  off above your head it's all getting wilder the world is speeding up life is speeding up
[10:29.400 --> 10:36.680]  up we are headed towards the singularity that Ray Kurzweil talks about but of course he is
[10:36.680 --> 10:42.280]  packaging it as if it's some beautiful wonderful thing it will be the end of this species on our
[10:42.280 --> 10:51.240]  current course we are facing we are facing assured mutually assured destruction and the
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.160]  globalist and the program they have released I've calculated it from every angle is going to bring
[10:57.160 --> 11:03.080]  them down as well and they've shown a complete disregard for the planet's safety while at the
[11:03.080 --> 11:08.120]  same time lecturing everyone all day about how they want to protect the earth and then they target
[11:08.120 --> 11:15.000]  things that they know actually just goes after human activity and not the super sciences and
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.320]  that's a science fiction term from 80 years ago but now today we do see the super sciences
[11:21.320 --> 11:28.440]  things that would have been considered magic just 100 years ago are now real and bonafide
[11:28.440 --> 11:35.080]  and unfolding in front of us let me tell you it's coming up today colonel Craig Roberts had
[11:35.080 --> 11:41.800]  been on about a year always extremely informative he's going to be joining us Ron Paul and Webster
[11:41.800 --> 11:48.280]  Griffin Tarpley from Tripoli to give us reports on what's happening there he will be joining us
[11:48.280 --> 11:59.000]  today as well again if you just tuned in I'm very hoarse from leading a citizen filibuster
[12:00.600 --> 12:07.240]  inside of the capital yesterday for about two and a half hours and it was a much bigger turnout
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.360]  than even we had a month ago pretty much spontaneously with about 24 hours notice or less
[12:12.360 --> 12:17.560]  than 24 hours notice actually I wasn't even sure Sunday if we'd do it by the end of the show I was
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.680]  quasi sure and I announced it at 11 a.m. yesterday that we would be going down there and it is a
[12:22.680 --> 12:28.680]  morass of government deception and dirty tricks but by investigating this it's like a medical
[12:28.680 --> 12:33.320]  procedure that's why they call doctors call themselves practitioners and they call their
[12:33.320 --> 12:39.480]  medical practice a practice and what they're saying is hidden in plain view that they practice
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.200]  the the art of medicine and that they learn from it and everything is a learning process the Pentagon
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.880]  calls all these wars laboratories live fire laboratories
[12:52.360 --> 12:58.600]  that's why I say resistance is victory the act of marching in and letting the state police and
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.800]  letting the state reps know that you're the boss and not cowering and calling government officials
[13:03.800 --> 13:10.280]  or authorities or excellencies calling them servants and learning your own power is like
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.760]  building muscle it's like lifting weights politically be later on the couch you're gonna
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.920]  you know get heart disease when you're 30 if you lay there your whole life and don't do anything but
[13:19.320 --> 13:25.160]  you know not take care of yourself but if you're politically active most people are like you have
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.560]  such incredible courage to march in and go into Perry's office and scream at them and go into other
[13:29.560 --> 13:33.880]  people other globalist offices and do this and aren't you scared of this aren't you scared of
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.280]  that they told us we couldn't film in the senate gallery I said this is the press gallery there's
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.840]  no rule against that and the guy said okay well I'm gonna go get the police and I said go get them
[13:42.840 --> 13:47.640]  and you I mean at a certain point you've just got and in that that's not courage I'm not at
[13:47.640 --> 13:53.960]  bunker hill with redcoats marching up lowering guns saying leave the field or we're gonna shoot you
[13:53.960 --> 13:58.680]  and then they stood there and let the redcoats shoot them let me tell you that please don't
[13:58.680 --> 14:05.960]  tell me I've got courage please I mean like like somebody at Iwo Jima marching up hills with
[14:05.960 --> 14:12.360]  with with with with artillery firing out of the machine guns I mean that it is not courage to go
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.800]  into my servants when they're when they are behaving badly and and and not following the
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.600]  constitution the bill of rights common sense common law and the people's will to go in and get in
[14:22.600 --> 14:31.400]  their face it is the minimum the minimum so it quite frankly disgust me when folks come up and
[14:31.400 --> 14:39.000]  tell me how wonderful I am you don't disgust me it disgust me to be being it's it's disgusting
[14:39.000 --> 14:47.160]  to be have people calling me a hero folks I'm not a hero okay I'm doing my duty the firemen a fire
[14:47.160 --> 14:51.000]  person to be politically correct it goes into a burning building and they die all the time to
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.760]  save a child it goes up in an apartment building or or a or a facility and in the roof falls in on
[14:56.760 --> 15:04.840]  them that's a hero okay that's a hero not doing my duty see we've turned just doing the minimum
[15:04.840 --> 15:12.360]  of what an american is supposed to act like into a hero no no no no no
[15:15.800 --> 15:22.120]  a single mother who quits drinking and quit smoking and works three jobs to take care
[15:22.120 --> 15:28.280]  of her children because her husband's dead or in prison and who and who and who and who breaks
[15:28.280 --> 15:33.240]  her back to raise those children and to make sure that they get into the middle class and
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.160]  are good decent people and there's been a lot of those cases that's a hero let me tell you
[15:37.160 --> 15:43.000]  something as good as I am ladies and gentlemen I like to chew tobacco I like to drink whiskey
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.680]  and I have to be honest with you I have constant struggles constant struggles after a long day
[15:48.680 --> 15:54.840]  to not want to put a big thing a red man in yeah I'm from Texas folks I'm a redneck
[15:55.480 --> 16:00.760]  and to uh you know get a bottle of Jack Daniels I don't even have the self-control
[16:01.640 --> 16:09.960]  the self-control of a single mother to focus despite the incredible mission I've got
[16:09.960 --> 16:17.480]  and the whole world counting on me more and more to be the the the the leader of a movement
[16:17.480 --> 16:22.600]  against tyranny I'm telling you there are people better and stronger and more intelligent and more
[16:22.600 --> 16:31.000]  enlightened than I am I mean I I I realized the response and I want to talk about myself because
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.080]  I got all this news it's just it's just to have hundreds of people coming up with light in their
[16:35.080 --> 16:43.480]  eyes just telling me how great I am it made me feel good but for them and I'm proud of myself
[16:43.480 --> 16:48.680]  at many levels I've got a lot of good attributes but my point is don't look to one person to be the
[16:48.680 --> 16:54.680]  answer to things at the same time I don't even drink that much point is I can go six months
[16:54.680 --> 16:59.240]  without it and then start doing it and when this isn't good I'm gonna quit the point is I'm weak
[16:59.240 --> 17:04.840]  and I wonder how other people can just have total control but we some people have weaknesses that
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.480]  other folks don't have other people have weaknesses that you don't have or I can't control myself I
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.760]  just pull directly into a steakhouse and get the biggest 30 ounce steak they've got and just cram
[17:14.760 --> 17:21.000]  it down with a big thing of cheese potatoes you know all I'm saying is we're all human but it's in
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.400]  that striving it's I mean here's an example I don't use a lot of profanity but over the years working
[17:29.400 --> 17:34.360]  with a lot of other men you know it happens and I catch myself sometimes on the phone in front
[17:34.360 --> 17:40.200]  of my children when something when I hear some news and then oh I just taught my child a cuss word
[17:40.200 --> 17:45.400]  you know and and and it's a trap see the problem is people that are trying to be good that have
[17:45.400 --> 17:54.520]  a conscience we are bound down by by guilt by by by by because we're aware of the fact that
[17:54.520 --> 17:59.800]  we're falling and we're trying to be good that but but at the same time this is an important
[17:59.800 --> 18:08.680]  exercise I believe of truthfulness because because other people out there think it's
[18:08.680 --> 18:13.800]  cool to not have any morals they think it's cool to do whatever they want to themselves
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.480]  and they they they have no mooring no rudder they have no conscience so of course they
[18:19.480 --> 18:26.280]  have no discernment you have to realize how evil you are and how fallen and ugly you are
[18:26.280 --> 18:34.200]  to be able to recognize how beautiful and wonderful and enlightened and empowered you are
[18:35.080 --> 18:41.400]  you've got to recognize your fallibility to be able to also recognize
[18:45.480 --> 18:52.760]  the magic that's in the world by magic I mean just the incredible goodness but evil hides behind
[18:52.760 --> 18:59.080]  good there's so much good there's so much beauty that I noticed the politicians the media you know
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.960]  bomb is like the birds are tweeting the sun's out things aren't so bad they they they always try to
[19:03.960 --> 19:10.120]  arc typally Texas is good because I'm Rick Perry I made it good for you I'm Obama I made the sun
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.520]  shine I made the birds sing remember a few months ago he had this speech he was giving about it's a
[19:14.520 --> 19:19.880]  beautiful day out here we're doing good we're doing good in America and the idea is he's making it good
[19:19.880 --> 19:27.000]  and so evil hides in complexity that's the whole lawyer system of double speak and twisting

[24:58.600 --> 25:05.960]  the sociopaths now before i get into this other news the big news of the day
[25:05.960 --> 25:10.680]  that really struck me like a thunderbolt that i'll i'll cover in the next segment
[25:12.920 --> 25:21.720]  then i'll get into tsa is a french news agency report with the headline chemical
[25:21.720 --> 25:28.680]  in plastic containers makes male mice act like females i think you've heard this before but
[25:28.680 --> 25:36.120]  it's big breaking news now remember uh the george soros publications hundreds of them
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.600]  hundreds that came out in a campaign to try to discredit me last year
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.800]  they thought that this would discredit me all it did was tell more folks about the show
[25:46.680 --> 25:53.960]  headline juice boxes are making you gay uh i i we have the government documents where they
[25:53.960 --> 25:57.960]  say i mean we've made films about it where they said that they would put this in the
[25:57.960 --> 26:03.800]  products in the food and the water um to reduce fertility but also change behavior
[26:04.600 --> 26:10.280]  and it's the biggest reason women there's a cocktail of reasons are dying of breast
[26:10.280 --> 26:14.760]  cancer and and i want to instead of having marches and collecting money for breast cancer
[26:14.760 --> 26:20.440]  the system at the highest levels knows why breast cancer is off the charts they know why
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.400]  uh prostate cancer is off the charts they know because this is these are all
[26:26.360 --> 26:33.560]  areas where sex hormones cause mutations in the tissues and they knew this in the 1930s
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.760]  so this this has been done deliberately there's hundreds of different major calculations
[26:40.040 --> 26:44.680]  formulas for plastics that don't leach these and and they're killings
[26:44.680 --> 26:49.480]  and so i'll i'll get into this more detail coming up in the next segment
[26:51.640 --> 26:56.920]  and see if people could just realize this and and read john p. Holdren's book read the different
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.040]  eugenesis publications read the stuff that came out 70 80 years ago the different reports that we
[27:02.040 --> 27:06.760]  cover here where they said they would do this to us and then if you actually consciously realize that
[27:07.640 --> 27:12.520]  if you're a cop it's not you're with the people you're being attacked as well
[27:12.520 --> 27:19.240]  or if you're a bureaucrat uh i i will bet you money that rick perry is not warned about all
[27:19.240 --> 27:25.400]  these things by the establishment once he's president if that happens they may 99.9 of us
[27:25.960 --> 27:32.680]  are targeted by this through the compartmentalized scientific dictatorship and well i mean here's
[27:32.680 --> 27:38.280]  one headline um dealing with it out of french news agency here's another one worldwide diabetes
[27:38.280 --> 27:44.760]  more than doubled since 1980 well we told you that years ago it's actually uh up fourfold in quote
[27:44.760 --> 27:53.320]  hispanics and that's because the different uh again cocktails the right word of things added
[27:53.320 --> 28:03.080]  to the food uh is race specific and it it it's at hiv um northern europeans do not have
[28:03.080 --> 28:10.440]  have coupler points for the virus and it's nearly impossible for northern europeans uh to get it
[28:11.240 --> 28:15.240]  and that came out in the 80s of course they knew that then that's in medical journals literally
[28:15.240 --> 28:24.600]  hundreds of different studies it's a race specific weapon as well um so if you like being targeted
[28:24.600 --> 28:30.760]  because the globalist are racist but they pose as liberals and and then they run all the programs
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.600]  and and finance all the quote minority leadership councils and of course most of those people are
[28:36.600 --> 28:43.560]  compartmentalized and don't know what they're doing see we have studied the elites operations and so
[28:43.560 --> 28:49.800]  i'm here telling me what's being done this is 100 percent now all over the western world our water
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.120]  is so polluted with this stuff um these sewage treatment that's dumped into lakes this is always
[28:56.120 --> 29:01.640]  in lakes and rivers that that that are having a sewage a treated sewage dumped into them here's
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.600]  a discovery news you can get literally thousands of reports on this all over the world more hemaphridide
[29:06.600 --> 29:14.280]  fish in us rivers and and and that's what i said at the time um you see for me it's all scientific
[29:14.280 --> 29:21.160]  i i'm not here attacking people because they're attracted a woman's attracted to a woman a man's
[29:21.160 --> 29:27.800]  attracted to a man i'm here telling you that in cultures and history there there has been some
[29:27.800 --> 29:36.040]  of that but in lower numbers regardless of a moral uh point i'm not even debating that so i can get
[29:36.040 --> 29:43.720]  through to you it it's being scientifically done now and we have the government documents so you
[29:43.720 --> 29:50.760]  should know why this is happening it's happening to the animals as well they're right back we're
[29:50.760 --> 30:01.320]  on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones with
[30:01.320 --> 30:06.120]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[30:06.120 --> 30:11.080]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.080 --> 30:16.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.280 --> 30:21.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas
[30:21.880 --> 30:27.000]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.560]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local

[33:09.000 --> 33:19.240]  well so does he live from the info wars comm studios it's alex jones
[33:20.280 --> 33:29.000]  you know i talk about news coming in so fast we can't even cover it anymore and i know that matt
[33:29.000 --> 33:36.840]  drudge because he's tweeted it um is a listener of the radio show and i don't i rarely ask drudge
[33:36.840 --> 33:42.440]  to link to something because he already links to us so much it's it's more than i could ever ever
[33:42.440 --> 33:49.080]  you know even ask for i mean it's it's literally like uh you know the god of internet zoos throwing
[33:49.080 --> 33:54.200]  down the lightning bolt you know giving it to man then there is no bigger news site there is no
[33:54.200 --> 33:59.720]  site that drives and sets agendas like drudge and he is fighting the tsa he is exposing the world
[33:59.720 --> 34:04.840]  government i mean he literally has done more for the movement against tyranny than any other source
[34:04.840 --> 34:10.280]  i can think of because he's legitimized our reportage other reportage he links to european
[34:10.280 --> 34:15.800]  mainline news about world government and he's forced mainline conservative radio to start
[34:15.800 --> 34:21.960]  admitting this stuff in the last three years and uh the fox pundits and the rest of it uh and the
[34:21.960 --> 34:28.760]  fact that he's breaking the back of the tsa with the rest of the citizenry together uh but i i well
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.600]  actually i'm not going to get into it but i'm i'm i'm even reach out on this and i need to
[34:35.160 --> 34:38.920]  during the next break because this news that i just read during the break is so big it's been
[34:38.920 --> 34:45.480]  out for 30 minutes it's at info wars dot com and prism planet dot com and it turns out uh in the
[34:45.480 --> 34:55.880]  article and so even if drudge links to us so much he's welcome to link to tg daily uh or obviously
[34:55.880 --> 35:01.720]  epic uh the electronic privacy information center got the documents um
[35:04.200 --> 35:11.480]  wusa tv and dc's covering it uh it turns out in boston and with four other airports since
[35:14.200 --> 35:21.640]  2003 they've had body scanners and and it turns out this is just so off the chart
[35:21.640 --> 35:31.400]  that they've known all along that it was giving them cancer and that they went ahead and ordered
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.440]  them for all the rest the major airports 214 nationwide and here's the headline cancer
[35:36.440 --> 35:42.360]  surgeon body scanner operators tsa launches cover up and the documents have now been leaked
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.080]  and uh they're confirmed to be accurate by epic that the tsa knowingly covered this up
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.320]  well ladies and gentlemen it's even been in the new york times top scientist who helped develop
[35:53.320 --> 35:57.960]  these systems came out and said the radiation depending on the machine is 20 to 50 times what
[35:57.960 --> 36:03.800]  they told you and that it's not even so much people that go through it a few times a year that's bad
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.840]  but it's it's being around these i mean these put off more radiation than a dental x-ray we've
[36:08.840 --> 36:13.000]  had radiologists on to break it down and that's a dentist goes and gets behind a lead wall
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.680]  but my dad does x-rays or the dental assistants do they you know they go get behind a lead wall
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.960]  and they put lead shielding over your chest and genitals and you notice that the thickest part
[36:23.960 --> 36:29.160]  of the shielding goes over your your waist because that's uh thin skin to the testicles
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.040]  and it can go right in and as you would expect they're getting testicular cancer they're getting
[36:34.600 --> 36:41.320]  brain cancers it's it's killing them and again this is all part of the plan i've had top scientists
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.760]  on like dr busby saying that many of the globalists in europe know that radiation levels are going up
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.520]  all over the place but they don't care because it reduces fertility this is a plan and and and
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.960]  there was a couple of former tsa people at the protest the capital yesterday one lady and one
[36:57.960 --> 37:02.760]  man there was a homeland security ice agent he gave me his car i looked him up there he is
[37:02.760 --> 37:09.720]  but he said hey i'm american too i'm allowed to come protest um i mean it blew me away and they
[37:09.720 --> 37:15.640]  said no everything you've said about the tsa is true and they said you know uh that they quit over it
[37:15.640 --> 37:24.760]  but this is so off the charts uh cancer surges in body scanner operators tsa launches cover up
[37:25.320 --> 37:29.560]  and uh there's no doubt this just came out uh watson ferreted the news and saw it in
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.840]  different regionals and put a boil down article together but um i don't even care of uh now that
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.360]  i think about it drudges you have to link to us i'm sure he'll link to some of these articles
[37:38.360 --> 37:45.800]  uh but cancer surges in body scanner operations tsa launches cover up this is so
[37:46.600 --> 37:56.280]  this is so huge in fact i can just get online iphone here right now live and get a little
[37:57.160 --> 38:03.560]  i'm i'll do it later um that's another radiation killer right there where they knew 25 years ago
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.200]  what it was going to do they're just giving us devices that kill us but a cell phone compared to
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.760]  these scanners is nothing but in the aggregate it's like a cigarette that's even what the e u's had
[38:12.760 --> 38:18.840]  to admit their health ministers um again government doesn't have total control it was the e u medical
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.560]  board came out a year and a half ago two years ago now and said this whole swine flu things fake
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.920]  the vaccine's deadly and then later that was confirmed to be true uh and we had the head of it
[38:28.920 --> 38:34.360]  wolfgang woodard dr woodard on to break it down and the e u's also come out and said it's like
[38:34.360 --> 38:39.720]  smoking cigarettes you do it over and over again cell phones it's it's it's in fact they found
[38:39.720 --> 38:45.960]  some of the studies it may be worse than smoking cigarettes and then you add to it the gmo you add
[38:45.960 --> 38:53.560]  to it the bisphenol a and other chemicals uh that are in the plastics this is so incredible i mean
[38:53.560 --> 39:00.360]  we already knew this but to have it confirmed that they cold bloodedly know that it's a death
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.840]  sentence for all those people this tsa thing is key in the whole globalist operation it's about
[39:06.840 --> 39:12.520]  stomping on the state's rights it's about training you to be a prisoner and to be humiliated and have
[39:12.520 --> 39:17.400]  your private parts touched i mean ladies and gentlemen i've talked a lot about this i remember
[39:17.400 --> 39:24.760]  going on dates in high school and you know taking a girl to the movie theater and you know having
[39:24.760 --> 39:31.400]  them reach over and you know touch on you and it was electrifying it was almost uh you know
[39:33.400 --> 39:38.520]  it was all i mean you liked it but it was also kind of kind of freaky can you imagine what it's like
[39:39.080 --> 39:44.280]  to have people you don't know in a public setting grabbing you and actually squeezing
[39:44.280 --> 39:49.400]  that's why they've had on record airline pilots military veterans us troops coming home
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.840]  having their space violated having their basic humanity and that's why troops have gotten angry
[39:56.840 --> 40:02.120]  and been arrested uh they've thrown up airline pilots have had refused to fly and gone home
[40:02.120 --> 40:06.600]  it's been in the news and thrown up in their parking lot when they get home and people like
[40:06.600 --> 40:11.160]  well you're a wimp no it's because you're not a wimp that you can't handle it it's your dignity
[40:11.160 --> 40:15.160]  i mean um
[40:18.200 --> 40:23.720]  it's it's it's it's it's sexual assault that that's why under common law and common sense in every
[40:23.720 --> 40:29.960]  culture you get killed for going up and grabbing on a woman or grabbing her genitals you know in
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.000]  the woods out by the well a thousand years ago the town would get together and take you and have
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.680]  a trial and hang you high just for grabbing on a woman because you don't touch people that this
[40:40.680 --> 40:46.680]  is about this is about your personal space it's about mating it's it's about choices you make
[40:46.680 --> 40:50.840]  you leave people alone this is a big deal so it's about 10th amendment violating it's about
[40:50.840 --> 40:54.760]  training us to be slaves about getting in our person and it's about creating an army of people
[40:54.760 --> 40:58.680]  and we reported over a year ago and then had had internal sources and it was later confirmed in
[40:58.680 --> 41:04.120]  mainstream media that they call tsa and and said you have a concern about radiation and if you say
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.000]  yes they give you a pink slip in two weeks uh and don't even tell you why they say it's a layoff
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.120]  even though they're hiring if you have a trouble groping people you're fired so it's kind of like
[41:14.120 --> 41:20.600]  panning for gold they see people that are stupid or tyrants or pedophiles it's a spectrum that
[41:20.600 --> 41:25.880]  they're panning for they see all the people that that are decent as like dirt as rocks they want
[41:25.880 --> 41:31.400]  to get rid of and the little gold chunks they're panning for in the stream of employees are the
[41:31.400 --> 41:40.040]  folks that'll do this they're people that will sit there baking baking around the scanners all day
[41:40.040 --> 41:47.720]  long and and and this story is so big and so huge and everything else i've got so big and so huge
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.280]  i don't even know what to say i'm gonna say it again and it's all part of a conditioning process
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.000]  this is psychological warfare we're supposed to just learn that they 11 years ago signed a secret
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.360]  deal with major insurance companies the pentagon did to take all the death benefits from trips when
[42:02.360 --> 42:07.160]  they die and don't give their widows or widowers the money that they paid into out of their check
[42:07.160 --> 42:13.160]  for decades that's just hiding in plain view nobody gets in trouble um the big bank had
[42:13.160 --> 42:18.520]  steel trillions they don't go to jail but then you know some low level guy at city bank steals
[42:18.520 --> 42:24.920]  19 million because he stole from the bank he gets indicted and that's how they operate or they bust
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.240]  blagojevich for engaging in standard corruption boss hog stuff but then when kissinger openly says
[42:31.240 --> 42:35.720]  the u.s policy is genocide against the third world we're gonna kill him in state apartment
[42:35.720 --> 42:41.240]  memorandum 200 he's oh that's humanitarian or or holgen writes books like this and it's oh that's
[42:41.240 --> 42:48.520]  humanitarian so so the big flaming crimes like huge bonfires of obviousness that's not a problem
[42:49.560 --> 42:54.360]  and they cold bloodedly because remember it was it was four airports starting in late 2002
[42:54.360 --> 43:02.440]  into 2003 we pull those articles up we're testing the body scanners and so now they've got seven years
[43:02.440 --> 43:07.640]  in some cases seven and a half at boston logan and others where these went in where they have
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.080]  cancer clusters and the tsa people that have worked there for years are dying and it's like when you
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.600]  know they go to a town they wonder why everybody you know people in a certain neighborhood have
[43:16.600 --> 43:21.080]  double triple cancer and it's more than that in these studies they go we better test the soil they
[43:21.080 --> 43:28.520]  go oh some some company before this subdivision was built dumped dioxin into the soil there was a
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.800]  there was a factory here and the developers didn't tell you and you know about the love canal there's
[43:33.800 --> 43:39.800]  there's thousands of these superfund sites much of houston is one that's why houston has much higher
[43:39.800 --> 43:45.960]  cancer rates per capita than any other city in the united states new orleans is next because of all
[43:45.960 --> 43:54.760]  the toxic waste that runs into the mississippi from the midwest and then down there it's incredible
[43:55.640 --> 43:59.560]  it's incredible and there's this cutthroat attitude by the establishment that hey it's all
[43:59.560 --> 44:04.440]  social Darwinism let everybody die but then i see it even affecting the elites it's swimming
[44:04.440 --> 44:14.440]  it's like it's like a nihilistic psycho madman i mean this is madness to cold bloodedly know
[44:14.440 --> 44:18.760]  there was even just a few years of the scanners and in previous studies when they were developing
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.880]  they've studied the government studied everything 90% of research and development at universities
[44:23.880 --> 44:32.760]  is under DARPA alone now an example they knew bisphenol a combinations and major studies you
[44:32.760 --> 44:39.480]  can pull up in the 1940s they were looking for a plastic liner that would reduce fertility but
[44:39.480 --> 44:44.920]  also male aggression and then there's all these white papers on it that we've republished at
[44:44.920 --> 44:50.520]  info wars from the rocker feller foundation you and others they and then they get it deployed
[44:50.520 --> 44:57.080]  and then they even do rebates and things to factories and companies to then make sure that
[44:57.080 --> 45:05.320]  bisphenol a was adopted in the majority of plastic formulas if you wanted a formula from
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.720]  dal chemical you can research this or other companies that develop these systems there's a
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.160]  whole class of plastics that have the bisphenol a in them it's in printer ink it's probably in
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.720]  this printer ink right here but i'm too dumb to check and stop it and it's infertility everywhere
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.440]  and and and then they'll only give the license to factories for this i mean the so they'll
[45:26.440 --> 45:32.040]  sub license it to the chinese the indians the mexicans you know sub companies in the united
[45:32.040 --> 45:37.480]  states and europe knowing they went and found it then wrote white papers on it we've written
[45:37.480 --> 45:44.280]  articles about this then they deploy it and then now decades later french news agency chemical
[45:44.280 --> 45:51.160]  and plastic containers makes male mice act like females and then they had george soros funded groups
[45:51.800 --> 45:56.680]  come out last year literally hundreds of articles over a month period thinking it would hurt me
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.120]  me taking out of context what i said saying juice boxes are making you gay well i was
[46:02.120 --> 46:09.480]  reading studies on air that that it's it's causing hermaphrodite developments in fetal
[46:09.480 --> 46:16.840]  brains of mammals um you know not just the not just the genitals but but but but but in the brain
[46:17.560 --> 46:25.080]  and that's what's causing sexual confusion and that's and it's not again coldly it's not an
[46:25.080 --> 46:31.800]  issue of your identity and and and and they and they do this to you then they have a media system
[46:31.800 --> 46:36.040]  that says it's your identity you know everybody needs to be nice to people well absolutely
[46:36.760 --> 46:40.440]  uh you should people should be nice to you but and the and the religious folks
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.400]  shouldn't even be attacking people because separately from even a religious debate this
[46:45.400 --> 46:56.200]  has been done to you this has been this has been done to you and and then you'll watch the george
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.280]  soros crowds the chemical you know engineer promoters they'll come out and attack this again
[47:00.840 --> 47:06.040]  because i'm here telling you i mean i mean is it homophobic to to say that these mice had this done
[47:06.040 --> 47:13.000]  to them no it's a scientific discussion of how to create infertility and to stop the males and
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.480]  females merging and producing more offspring for a global program of depopulation that that your
[47:19.480 --> 47:24.920]  choice has been taken away from you and and this has been done because it affects the brain it affects
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.600]  the different uh endocrine systems it affects the genitals to the point of that all over the world
[47:31.320 --> 47:37.400]  in some major studies upwards of half of the fish and frogs and other amphibians including
[47:37.400 --> 47:47.160]  reptiles like snakes uh have both sexual organs it's so pronounced just what's going into the
[47:47.160 --> 47:53.960]  water as runoff in the embryonic development in the eggs of the fish and the frogs that this is
[47:53.960 --> 48:01.640]  happening now mammals are bigger and tougher but it's it and their study this was all done
[48:01.640 --> 48:08.440]  okay and and and the point is if this has been done to you and you like it that's because that's
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.760]  now your chemical physiology you've been re-engineered i'm not making a moral statement on it get
[48:14.760 --> 48:23.400]  past the mind control i'm saying to you do you understand that this is a public plan and has
[48:23.400 --> 48:30.920]  been done male mice who are exposed as babies to bpa a chemical common and canned foods and plastic
[48:30.920 --> 48:36.680]  containers it lines the 10 cans everything act more like females and are seen as less desirable
[48:36.680 --> 48:44.280]  mates a us study shows monday the findings should have implications on how bpa and bisphenol a
[48:44.280 --> 48:49.000]  may affect human development and behavior and the study published in the proceedings of the
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.160]  national academy of sciences that is the most prestigious the bpa exposed deer mice and the
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.480]  study looked normal but there's nothing obviously wrong with them yet they are clearly different
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.320]  so the lead author at the university of missouri females do not want the mate bpa exposed male
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.760]  because they're giving off different pheromones they're giving off a female pheromone and bpa
[49:08.760 --> 49:15.160]  exposed males perform worse on spatial navigation tasks it also stunts you development you go do
[49:15.160 --> 49:20.040]  you go to a restaurant both most of the boys now just look like mutant brain damaged people i mean
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.960]  i'm sorry it's it's just you know it's hardcore the girls are hyper-female they're growing taller
[49:25.960 --> 49:33.560]  they're growth hormone they're having a really a form of sub acromeglia and that's why the women
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.600]  what if there's a quadrupling now in breast cancer in the last 20 years oh yeah let's just
[49:38.600 --> 49:45.240]  forget the whole obsession over you know uh uh men suddenly you know everywhere it is happening
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.520]  and the media then saying it's good do it do it do it you should know you're being chemically
[49:50.520 --> 49:57.560]  programmed i'm not making a judgment about because that's a distraction okay you understand this is
[49:57.560 --> 50:01.240]  being done to you now now let's get off the sex stuff because everybody gets obsessed with that
[50:02.040 --> 50:05.800]  this also increases cancer in males and there's literally thousands of these studies going back
[50:05.800 --> 50:12.520]  to the 20s and 30s and current ones hundreds of current ones women women they're not going to tell
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.840]  you why you get that breast tumor and and why they then fry you with radiation and and bug poison
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.480]  known as chemo and suck all the money out of you and then you you'll die and you'll be putting a box
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.760]  so let's get off the sex stuff now because you know the sorrows will still twist that and that's
[50:28.760 --> 50:34.840]  fine because people will actually find the truth you need to know women that the males are feminized
[50:34.840 --> 50:40.600]  you are hyper-feminized that's why puberty was 13 14 now on average it's 10 in the west everywhere
[50:40.600 --> 50:46.440]  where this is done and now some girls as young as three tens of thousands now by age five are going
[50:46.440 --> 50:54.040]  into puberty you're hyper-aging as well and the the tissues that are affected more by this hyper-age
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.240]  so you have the breast of a 95 year old woman at 30 they've killed you just like the tsa agents i'm
[50:59.240 --> 51:03.320]  sorry they soft killed most of us this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider
[51:03.320 --> 51:08.360]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[51:08.360 --> 51:13.640]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[51:13.640 --> 51:19.000]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.360]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[51:24.360 --> 51:30.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[51:30.360 --> 51:35.000]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.360]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.840]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[51:44.840 --> 51:50.680]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[52:12.280 --> 52:18.040]  underneath the americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress
[52:18.040 --> 52:24.200]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[52:24.200 --> 52:29.720]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[52:29.720 --> 52:35.240]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[52:35.240 --> 52:40.360]  tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[52:40.360 --> 52:46.040]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[54:12.200 --> 54:19.800]  don't call my name out your window you know people ask why aren't europeans
[54:19.800 --> 54:25.640]  why aren't americans having children why does europe have a 1.3 replacement rate you know your
[54:25.640 --> 54:36.440]  granddaddy and grandma had your your mom your dad um they go out they have children they go out and
[54:36.440 --> 54:42.360]  meet people marry them why aren't people having children why is fertility way down why is cancer
[54:42.360 --> 54:51.880]  off the chart why is diabetes off the chart why uh are men looking more feminine behaving in feminine
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.520]  ways not not not acting the way males have always behaved in europe they're passing laws you're not
[54:56.520 --> 55:02.520]  allowed to call boys boys at school they're not allowing gender it's because and this is in the
[55:02.520 --> 55:06.680]  globalist documents and all this huxley wrote about this in his non-fiction books his brother
[55:06.680 --> 55:13.480]  headed up the program at the un at yanesco julian huxley that they would create a hemaphrodite drone
[55:13.480 --> 55:22.840]  that didn't even breed i mean the look truth is stranger in fiction um i just unplugged my headset
[55:22.840 --> 55:31.000]  here let me get it and so i had all this other news to cover and i'll get into what happened with
[55:31.000 --> 55:38.440]  the tsa here in texas but uh here is the article by paul joseph wantson cancer surges and body
[55:38.440 --> 55:44.760]  scanner operators tsa launches cover-up and they've finally been forced to release some of the um
[55:45.400 --> 55:52.280]  nift documents but they've blacked out the radiation meter levels um continuing uh they also
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.880]  have measurements of the type of radiation leaking outside of the containment facility but
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.240]  then they spend it and say but we say that's safe but then all the other independent studies say
[56:03.240 --> 56:08.840]  it's not safe and now we have reports of higher cancer rates and that the tsa uh is extremely
[56:08.840 --> 56:14.680]  concerned about all of this fearful of provoking further public resistance to naked airport body
[56:14.680 --> 56:21.400]  scanners the tsa has been caught covering up a surge of cases and tsa workers developing cancer
[56:21.400 --> 56:27.400]  as a result of their close proximity to radiation firing devices and again this is classic lawyer
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.520]  speaking the document i scanned over earlier nist blacks out the numbers because they don't want
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.080]  other engineers ever seeing it and going that's deadly they block out the numbers then they say
[56:37.080 --> 56:43.320]  oh this is safe but we did measure these numbers outside of the machine splattering it's like the
[56:43.320 --> 56:48.840]  tsa saying we didn't make that 95 year old taker diaper off we just said you can't fly if you don't
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.920]  see it's all these lawyer tricks perhaps the most shocking revelation to emerge from the latest
[56:56.920 --> 57:01.400]  freedom of information act documents obtained by electronic privacy information center after
[57:01.400 --> 57:05.880]  union representatives at boston discovered a cancer cluster amongst tsa workers linked with
[57:05.880 --> 57:12.120]  radiation from body scanners the tsa sought to downplay the matter and refused to issue employees
[57:12.120 --> 57:19.480]  with uh dosimeters to measure levels of exposure now let's stop right there it is federal and state
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.400]  law i know my dad's a dentist but anybody that's been in a hospital anywhere around x-ray machines
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.400]  um you know on record that there's a radiation officer they have to wear the badge they have to
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.400]  have the groups come in every month check the calibration of the machines because they get
[57:35.400 --> 57:41.560]  off very often and and we'll fry you and you've heard about uh mri's being calibrated wrong and
[57:41.560 --> 57:47.320]  people's hair falling out and getting cancer they're so strong so it's a serious issue to and that's
[57:47.320 --> 57:53.000]  what these are are lower intensity mri's really uh and and and and so they're covering all this
[57:53.000 --> 57:59.080]  up and it turns out for years knowing about the cancer clusters and finally the tsa are waking up
[57:59.080 --> 58:03.880]  and getting concerned the problem is they'll the smarter ones will just quit and they'll hire even
[58:03.880 --> 58:11.960]  more crazy goons and so they refuse to set up the proper radiation monitoring of course they could
[58:11.960 --> 58:17.400]  be like the uh epa now when radiation went up in the u.s from fukushima they just raised the levels
[58:17.400 --> 58:22.040]  of what they say is safe more games the documents indicate how a large number of workers have been
[58:22.040 --> 58:26.200]  hauling victim to cancer strokes and heart disease the department rather than acting on it
[58:27.000 --> 58:33.400]  or explaining its position seems to have just dismissed it and it just goes on as it breaks
[58:33.400 --> 58:39.400]  down this article is so huge we'll get more into the chemical assault on humanity when we get back

[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:41.400]  we are now into hour number two and if you just joined us we have congressman ron paul scheduled
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.920]  to be joining us in the middle of the next hour we have a colonel craig roberts joining us coming
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:53.080]  up in 30 minutes we'll go over a host of important news and information and get his perspective
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:01:02.600]  on things but this is just such incredible news speaking of radiation cancer surges in body
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:08.840]  scanner operators tsa launches cover-up the union according to watson's article and he's got links
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.240]  to some others reports that they've had big increases in cancer one of the first airports
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:19.640]  many years ago to test the scanners out that there are charging has been a cover-up also coming to
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:26.840]  a store near you radioactive fish that's up on info wars dot com also they're reporting all over
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:33.000]  the news that fukushima's continuing to dump massive amounts of radiation into the pacific ocean
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.360]  and it's now been confirmed that part of the nuclear power plant has been flooded here in the
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:49.000]  united states in nebraska and there's a headline what the fukushima is going on in oma hall that's
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.920]  from local talk news and the history of government cover-ups we don't know what the truth is we know
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:03.880]  that there was a disaster right around a few days after fukushima started uh months and months ago
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:09.000]  up in an area of canada and they released a bunch of radioactive waste into the lake and said don't
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.040]  worry about it and radiation levels have gone up and the media has been told by the government hey
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.640]  we're just raising what we say is safe you know being shot in the head with 377 magnum would probably
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.200]  kill you at least hurt you but if the government just said hey 357 magnum rounds fired into your
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.680]  head at point length range no longer hurts you would that suspend the laws of physics in nature
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:35.640]  no they wouldn't do that now i meant to come into the show today and get into this incredible
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:43.960]  report and again there are thousands of studies all over the world going back 80 90 years dealing
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:51.720]  with plastics and that they are oils they're they're oil-based and many of the drugs that
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:57.720]  big pharma has made are petrochemical based because they can manipulate it and that the
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.240]  bisphenol a that's been adopted in most plastics the liners of tin cans plastic juice boxes you
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.720]  know all of it even the paper ones have that lining it's how the paper doesn't you know doesn't get
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:16.440]  soggy it doesn't break through normal paper box wood that it leeches estrogen mimickers
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:25.240]  and it also causes endocrine disruptions overall disruptions and we covered that report and of
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:31.240]  course you literally hundreds of these if you just type in hemaphrodite frogs hemaphrodite fish
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:38.280]  sterile fish sterile frogs i've seen studies with upwards of half of them in the southern
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:44.120]  mississippi now being sterile or having both sexes and it's also changing the brains of the
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.640]  frogs now the globalists would spin this as a human right the frogs have a right for us to dump
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.280]  us in the water and make them hermaphrodites or make them confuse see it's a scientific issue
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:59.960]  but they would say you're being a hemaphrodite frog a phobe and i'm like what does this have to
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.920]  do with people's sexual preference i'm saying they're choosing it for you and that it's not
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.040]  like a preference they have biologically altered who you are and that's been the plan all along
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:16.200]  and we cover it in the in-game extras the university documents where they talked about doing this and
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.080]  now we got holder and all the others this is what they've done and they're keeping it in the plastics
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.600]  it's they're keeping it and everything they're doing it they don't care and they're not going to stop
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.160]  you have to stop eating and drinking out of what they're doing and then you've got the gmo crops
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:35.560]  every major gmo crop in every major even internal study has the quote side effect it's the real effect
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:41.320]  it's the perfect place to hide it in in in that genome that's so complex that only the
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.560]  the genetic engineers who are inducted into this malthusian eugenics school at the major
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:53.160]  universities and then if they buy into it they get the grants they get the jobs they then know
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.560]  what they're doing of course they're all obsessed with organic food because they know what they're
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:04.520]  doing everybody else it's a cult hi folks this is alex jones i'm looking for people that have

[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:04.520]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.840]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.880]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:19.480]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.600]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:29.880]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.520]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.880]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.280]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:50.200]  one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:16.200]  i want to commend everyone that marched into the capital for the second time in a month yesterday
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:21.960]  in texas to try to ensure that a true bill to defend the fourth amendment to defend the tenth
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:29.320]  amendment to defend our dignity of our women and children would be passed and they got it at seven
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.280]  waves this sunday i'm going to be breaking that down but resistance is victory uh we've been talking
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.200]  to the reporters on the ground it looks like now even the senate and house version won't be able to
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.560]  be merged so it'll probably die but it goes into special session we've got to continue to analyze
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:50.040]  this bill and probably try to kill it um but we're going to break that down if not today tomorrow but
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.960]  and and i haven't decided yet i'm going to go back down there today uh so much is coming in fast
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:04.440]  and furious uh if you just joined us uh breaking cancer surges in body scanner operations tsa
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:12.840]  launches cover-up and television in dc uh is reporting on this and the head of epic the
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.200]  electronic with privacy information center great folks uh mark rottenberg we've interviewed him
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.280]  they've talked to the unions and others and it's been going on for years there at boston
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:31.160]  and other airports where the tsa has has been testing since late 2002 the scanners huge cancer
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:36.760]  clusters and uh they used all the other private studies and even university studies have said
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.920]  it's deadly they've misrepresented john hopkins and the head of the study went public last year
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:46.040]  and said my study said it'll cause cancer you misrepresented in the news saying i was for this
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:53.400]  it's the same thing with uh nist nist will well nist has changed its story on building seven
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.720]  falling at freefall and how it fell five times now now they say they don't know why building seven
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:03.400]  fell on 9 11 so it's a very disreputable you know corrupt government funded agency and what do you
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:11.160]  expect uh i mean nist has agreed with the un that the sun doesn't affect climate and they're backing
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:16.680]  carbon taxes uh with fake science of course the sun drives climate it's the main driver anyone who
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.280]  says otherwise is completely insane according to all the top meteorologists we've interviewed but
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.600]  your common sense ladies and gentlemen you know knows that it affects and drives the climate
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.560]  we would be absolute zero in a matter of days if the sun disappeared i mean it's it's just
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:35.880]  asinine and the sun's fluctuations uh like i like the the heat on a fire you know when you're frying
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.920]  eggs it when the sun fluctuates up and down and the heat it's putting off i can't believe i mean
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.280]  having to explain this you know that okay so they put out this report that they wouldn't give congress
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:51.400]  last year finally it's come they wouldn't give congress this the numbers are blacked out and
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:57.320]  they're saying yeah there's some radiation leaking out of these uh but uh we we say it's healthy for
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:05.640]  you but then they black out what the radiation level is uh and so it is on the fact that they've
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.320]  covered up the cancer clusters and this report is up at info wars dot com this could break their back
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.560]  the fact that it's not just travelers going through the the porno scans that store an image of your
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.360]  body or that they're frisking you with dirty gloves that they don't change but every hundred or so
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.640]  searches that violates the fourth amendment trains kids to be molested that's the equivalent of walking
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.640]  down a dark alley you know in the worst area of new york or chicago or houston every time you go to
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.040]  the airport you don't know what's going to happen to you untrained people on power trips told to
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:40.040]  do this stuff they themselves victims of their own tyranny uh they're being roasted by the machines
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:45.160]  as i've kept explaining we've had we've had the uh we're going to get more on as well the scientists
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.640]  we've interviewed the radiologists but i mean again my dad's a dentist they have they have a
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.440]  radiation officer they have to wears a badge they're they're checking it monthly companies have to
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:00.680]  come in and calibrate it and check it and do readings uh but the federal government just says
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.400]  are we're exempt from our own laws that they don't even have a regulation that does that and they
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:12.840]  don't want to give congress the numbers so here is a tv newscast uh dealing with it in fact uh
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.720]  it'll just put the video paused up there on screen i can give folks the call letters of the tv station
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:26.520]  thank you in fact i even have the print out here um yes w usa uh nine and i've got those reports
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:33.720]  printed i just can't find them in my stack uh but we'll go ahead and play that news clip here uh as
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:40.600]  a public service uh warning especially to the tsa people here it is there are new questions this
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:46.120]  evening about the safety of those body scanners being used at the nation's airport yeah questions
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.800]  like do they expose tsa workers and passengers to unsafe levels of radiation and tonight's
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.320]  stop story gary neurenberg is here with what is now an uncertain answer gary well uncertain
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.520]  darryk because some prominent scientists say there just isn't enough data hasn't been enough testing
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:09.080]  to demonstratively prove the machines are safe the government says the scanners are safe but
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.720]  documents secured by the freedom of information act have raised questions we think that the
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.040]  department of homeland security has not been forthcoming with the public about the true
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.480]  extent of radiation risk uh with the airport body scanners he points to a national institute of
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.200]  standards and technology memo saying that the department of homeland security had overstated
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:33.720]  that agency's support for the program the union representing tsa workers wants the simeters to
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:39.560]  measure the radiation workers are exposed to but that has been denied in boston a union memo
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.600]  cites a growing number of workers diagnosed with cancer we certainly feel that the program should
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.600]  be suspended uh pending an independent investigation we in a letter to the president science advisor
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.560]  university professors agreed saying safety tests of the machines were performed by the
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.720]  manufacturer and questioned the science of the safety studies they conclude important information
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.880]  has not been provided to the public saying there is still no rigorous hard data for the safety of
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:14.840]  x-ray airport scanners dr john cedat telling nine news now we do not know what the dose is the dose
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:21.880]  can be a lot higher than they say it is if you go through you're taking your chances he says tsa
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.240]  issued a statement saying it has implemented stringent safety protocols to ensure that technology
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:33.000]  used at airports to screen people and property is safe for all passengers as well as the tsa
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.720]  workforce each individual machine that uses x-ray technology is regularly tested to ensure the
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.920]  radiation emitted falls within the neck i got caught lying last year about that despite those
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.320]  assurances those scientists in rotenberg from the electronic privacy information center
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.120]  want independent tests of the machine outside homeland security and they want a moratorium on
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.000]  their use until those tests are conclusive now what machines are we talking about in general
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.240]  if the scanner revolves around you or if you're told to raise your arms to be scanned
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.200]  that's the technology at issue i need it and then he's got more links other articles with the union
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:16.520]  concerned about this in the cancer cluster so that article is up at info wars dot com
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:22.440]  and prison planet dot com cancer surges and body scanner operators tsa launches cover up
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:28.920]  up and again i'm not blaming even that local news they they did a good job i i don't most people
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:35.320]  don't study every facet every angle of an issue but last year and this year in fact i'm gonna get
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.280]  pulled around another article or get steve or erin or kurt to do it i know we wrote articles
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.680]  about it where congress asked for it they said we've studied it they just gave him a boil down
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.800]  then it turned out they hadn't tested the machines aren't following federal and state law for radiology
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.480]  testing of the equipment and that there was a cover up so uh then to have tsa tell the news
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.600]  we test it it's rigorous it's it's it's there they won't even give congress this information
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.880]  because it turns out they're not doing it because criminals don't want a paper trail of what they've
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:13.800]  done they could care less what happens hey rob how you doing what's going on come on in what's
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:24.120]  going on okay oh thank you yeah okay thank you so much for that information
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.200]  yeah this is an oh this is a different memo the one he linked to yeah we're getting more
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:36.600]  documents in here thank you so much okay um now continuing uh here ladies and gentlemen
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.080]  i haven't even gotten to the financial times of london that is the globalist mouthpiece
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.800]  that openly calls for world government they're foreign editors wrote an article called uh now
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.880]  for world government saying gets its stealth yes it's authoritarian it's for your own good
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.480]  you conspiracy scum you know basically uh they've have a new one out a dollar scene losing global
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.120]  reserve status and they talk about basically the end of the united states because all we've got
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:07.560]  less the dollar it's being devalued but when we lose it ladies and gentlemen all hadies is going
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:13.000]  to break loose and you've got on average a nation of drug doubt this phenol a uh
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.280]  weirdos uh who who don't want to tie their shoelaces it's not that they can't tie their shoelaces
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.480]  they've been chemically lobotomized they've been victimized to the point they can't even operate
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:34.200]  and again here is um the french news agency chemicals in plastic containers make mice
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:39.720]  uh make male mice act like females and there's all the other studies about the reduced fertility
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:47.000]  this has been done uh also in humans um that's why areas of europe have banned it but it's a little
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.560]  too late because now it's basically in everything it goes on but but what they don't cover in this
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.120]  study is what the other studies show of the breast cancer in women and i warned you about this
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:03.080]  over and over again so we're going to pull up the next video here uh where i got demonized by
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:10.840]  by all the big uh media manners type outfits that i was being homophobic uh let's let's get all that
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:18.120]  aside okay uh you understand if i talk about mice becoming feminine and uh in the studies uh that
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:25.640]  are out there the same with the fish dogs they've done it they they begin to to want to be mounted
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.160]  by males because it because it affects the area of the brain i mean if this stuff's so strong
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:37.240]  and fish that it's making them have both sexual organs or lizards or snakes or amphibians like
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.760]  frogs and toads and i read those articles earlier what do you think it's doing to humans you know
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.800]  the point is this is going on and you should know about it so instead of the george soros outfits
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:53.160]  they come out and attack us saying we're bashing gay people it has nothing to do with that i mean
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:59.400]  if i'm talking about mice being turned into basically females males am i am i now homophobic
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:07.480]  against gay mice it's it's chemicals being done to us be be adults um we'll come back from break
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.120]  and play you know the clip that they edited together and took out a context where i was talking about
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:20.200]  juice boxes and how how it has bisphenol a in it but but but let's just say it's a gift from the
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:28.600]  globalist to make men becomes sterile part or reduced fertility and to develop the area of
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.600]  their brain you're feeding the brain female hormones they begin to become attracted to males
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:38.280]  because the the olfactory nerve smells and that's what's happened with the mice in the studies the
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:45.320]  females don't want these mice but other males that haven't been given it they then want the male
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:51.320]  mice that have been given it so your olfactory nerve picks up the pheromone you know that's what
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.680]  that's why your underarms stink that's your must for the for the brain to to to pick up it's it's
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.080]  how mammals operate i'll explain it when we come back since 2007 the federal reserve and the u.s
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:07.800]  government have injected as much as 20 trillion dollars into the economies of the world and yet
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.160]  the globes economies continue to contract our government is borrowing 58 thousand dollars
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.600]  per second if they stop spending the economy collapses if they continue spending the economy
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:25.000]  collapses and if they raise interest rates the economy collapses prepare now call ready reserve

[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:19.080]  on the long alone some highway east of my heart
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:25.240]  you listen to the engine the morning out is one of song
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:34.600]  you think about the woman the girl you knew the night before but your thoughts will soon be
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:44.920]  wandering the way they always do but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:53.960]  all right let's go ahead and get back to the hardcore news now remember almost all just type
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:03.080]  it in most receipts in us most printer cartridges are pure bisphenol a the toner medium the color is
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:10.600]  something else but the the the liquid is liquid plastic bisphenol a just touching a few receipts
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.320]  lowers fertility i'm so weak minded that i still use a cell phone the point is they just put it
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.960]  into our environment knowing we're designed to live in our environment i still use a cell phone
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:25.720]  admitted massive brain tumors again even as much as i know they have made this our environment
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.200]  where i always catch myself somebody gives me a 10 can of water or whatever you know flavored
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.840]  water and i go oh my gosh and i cut the can open its plastic line bisphenol a i look on the bottom
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:43.480]  between all a so i'm like super male high testosterone but it's a lot lower than it would be so i'm weak
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:49.960]  now a male that wouldn't be dominant is extremely feminine that's why the male genitals across the
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:54.440]  western world anywhere between all is using generation of generation getting smaller you
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:59.800]  don't even have testosterone it's why cops now even police chiefs are saying openly take testosterone
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:04.920]  because they're not males anymore they have to take stare i may reverse myself on steroids
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.160]  something i've always been against from research but if we don't have them
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.680]  it's almost like cushing syndrome we need the steroids now i mean this this is hard
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.400]  core ladies and gentlemen but remember the media is going to spend this and go alex says
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.400]  juice boxes make you gay like they did last year when i was reading mainline studies then
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.720]  but never telling you i'm reading a study they cut that out they'll cut this out as well the
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.320]  soros people will now but it won't matter because then people in the comments of the articles go
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:38.920]  away he's talking about bisphenol a why is this all cut up again they know and don't want you to
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:45.640]  know because their population exterminist now let's play one of the edited clips of of many
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.560]  online but it's still clear what i'm saying about bisphenol a with bob Chapman a year and a half ago
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:53.320]  here it is but the reason there's so many gay people now is because it's a chemical warfare
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.000]  operation i have the government documents where they said they're going to encourage homosexuality
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.680]  with chemicals so that people don't have children i i even catch myself bob drinking out of these
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:08.040]  estrogen uh mimicers but you'll probably say if it's lined with it inside the plastic packaging
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.720]  oh i wonder if this spring water natural lime flavor i'm drinking i know full well hgbs put
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:19.080]  the fluoride in this why am i drinking this i know full well these kettle chips say that they
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.440]  don't have msg but they've got the yeast extract thing that says it's msg what's wrong with us
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:32.040]  why won't we stop why am i so weak and they know cutting open the juice box us in this bob
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.000]  for those watching on prism planet dot tv here's the inside of this juice box
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:43.320]  and if you and if they zoom in anymore see that thin plastic it's got it and i'm letting my children
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.880]  drink this why is after you're done drinking your little juices well you i mean you you're
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:55.240]  ready to go out and have a baby you're ready to put makeup on you're ready to wear a short skirt
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:01.080]  you're ready to go uh you know uh put together uh you know a garden of roses or stop right there
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:06.440]  ready to put lipstick on look that now now again before all over the world puberty was 13 to 14
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:12.440]  in girls now in the west it's 10 on average as young as three don't believe me just type it in
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.400]  mainstream news three year olds going into puberty hundreds of thousands in the us five
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:24.120]  year olds so again the media spins this like he's attacking our wonderful gayness everyone's
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.680]  turning gay it's wonderful i'm not making a judgment about that that's how mind controlled
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:33.640]  you are it's under chemical attack they're changing who we are so we don't have children
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.400]  i'm not getting caught up in your distraction i mean if they put a microchip in our head to
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:45.800]  make us automaton drones you know would they say don't discriminate against drones it was artificially
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.760]  done that's why there's the explosion but let's get all the gay stuff out of it why are little girls
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:57.000]  going into puberty well next it'll be you're against discriminating against the five-year-old girls
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.960]  that want to dress like hookers and are running around you know going into puberty early people
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:07.240]  wonder why they see like 10 year olds with breast and and and and all this crazy sexual

[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.800]  formulations that they could have deployed they've had an industrial global standardized
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:44.360]  continuity within a decision to put this into everything and the sperm counts are down over
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:49.320]  80 percent the genitals are shrinking in the males the males are feminine the female are

[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:16.360]  talk to roberts about that in a moment we got a bunch of other issues operation fast and furious
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.720]  obama shipping the guns into mexico uh the globalist putting the muslim extremist in power all of
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.920]  the middle east what's what's behind that his view on uh the tsa we're just gonna pick his brain

[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:55.160]  then you get the female disdain of the male and that's what's happened and it's a fact and they
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.680]  know it and it's it's in the printer cartridge i know i've been taught repeat that over and over

[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.000]  so much of what you wrote about 15 20 years ago coming through well you know it's amazing alex
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.240]  because uh you know i had police officers that i worked with that uh on the department that several
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.880]  i thought i was absolutely off the deep end and was wearing a tinfoil hat when i went home because
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.680]  i was talking about all of this stuff well in advance i talked about 9 11 well in advance of
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.920]  what had to happen i wrote about it in the medusa file talking about the different types of terrorist
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.040]  targets when we were working in oklahoma city bombing i thought i you know having uh my intelligence
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.200]  background in the military being trained as a counter terrorist there you know we know there's
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:57.560]  five types of of uh terrorist targets you know we got mass transportation ground mass transportation
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:03.000]  air a large gathering of people which we call the black sunday or the super bowl effect uh
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.400]  then we've got a public building and a private building in 1993 they blew up the world trade
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:14.040]  center tried to um you know the ramsey joes of case and uh that was you know that was a public
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.840]  or a private building the next thing we had was the oklahoma city which is a public building
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.000]  which is a government building the next thing we had was the amtrak derailment out in california
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.280]  or out in arizona uh which was mass transportation ground and then next thing i said we're gonna
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.040]  have a we're gonna have a major airliner go down and and it wasn't just a few months later we had
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:37.320]  tw 800 get shot down and it was shot down and everybody thinks it was a center fuel tank explosion
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:43.320]  is living in lala land uh then we predicted 9 11 is a large gathering of people happening some place
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.520]  and it happened and uh so you know we talked about all this stuff and you know here 15 years later
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.800]  i've got these uh same police officers have come to me and said do you know any place out in the
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.800]  country we can buy property and move to because the whole world's going to do exactly what you
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:01.560]  said it's happened it's the economy's going belly up there's traders in the in the white house uh
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.880]  you know the entire world right now is on the brink of total disaster these are guys that that 15
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:13.720]  years ago thought i was a lunatic and now they're coming to me for advice so uh you know when you
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.600]  have cops do that and then you better you better stand by because there's a lot of people who work
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.840]  in cubicles you know they may listen to the radio they may watch from tv but they're more wrapped
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.920]  up and you know they're they're saturday and sunday and monday sports and you know what they're
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.400]  going to do when they get off that nine things like that and uh unless they lose their job and get
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.440]  desperate they don't pay attention to what's going on in the world and right now today we're seeing
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:41.480]  all kinds of stuff not happening just here where this country's getting ready to go belly up financially
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.200]  uh but we're and we're in our food supplies are you know we're having problems with that we're
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.480]  having problems with our water supplies you know there's all these things that are happening we're
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:56.200]  having more um major emergencies in the world today than we have ever had before and you know
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.520]  you're looking at tsunamis volcanoes earthquakes hurricanes florida alone what last giant fires
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:10.920]  reactors in nebraska flooding lying about fukushima and uh you go over all of this i mean
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.720]  there's obviously a hand involved we know they have weather weapons there's so much to get into
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.680]  with you today but you mentioned financial collapse here's the financial times of london today
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:26.680]  dollars seen losing global reserve status i don't think people realize that america has to be brought
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.080]  down before the world government which they've openly announced i mean think about that all the
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:37.640]  publications now saying a world government is the answer to our problems a world private bank
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:43.320]  that's what we always knew was coming now it's here america has always been the castle on the hill
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:48.520]  the rest of the world has always been the peasants outside the castle they are now storming the castle
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:55.000]  they're doing everything they can't wear under siege economically and uh commercially and uh you
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.560]  know our borders are wide open and we've got the globalist you know in washington dc in the government
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:06.280]  right now from the white house on down they're doing everything they can to turn this into a
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:12.760]  global socialist society and when you don't enforce your own voters and you send you know the legions
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.360]  far afield so to speak we've got them in afghanistan and iraq and south korea and who knows where
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:23.240]  and there's no one home to watch the chickens that we are ripe for the picking it right now
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:28.920]  that's where we're at and they're succeeding in doing what they want and ignoring the law ignoring
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:34.920]  the constitution ignoring the voices of the people and they're totally out of control of the people
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:40.680]  but they're not out of control of the globalist the council of 13 the council of 33 for george
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.320]  soros all the rest of those groups that are all intertwined and doing everything they can
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.920]  to bring bring this country and by the way the cia us intelligence you've told the stories
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.160]  people in high-level intelligence they all know this this is not a secret uh and expanding on that
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:05.960]  they're they're creating the crises to then offer the solution um going through these issues one by
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:12.600]  one um breaking down the fact that the first world trade center the fbi cooked the bomb train
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.480]  the drivers uh it we're not saying there aren't muslim extremists the point is there's an unseen
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.760]  hand the underwear bomber helped to get on the plane by the u.s state department now on record
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:28.200]  over and over again in egypt they're putting them in they're using al qaeda to go after qaddafi this
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:33.880]  is all admitted from your research into this can you explain uh for newbies what the new world order
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:40.360]  the globalist council is what their goal is uh and how they use terrorism to take our liberties
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:47.000]  well you know the uh what we call the new world order is not new at all it's you know at least
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.640]  200 years old and it goes back to the to the ancient families of europe who uh you know conspired
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:57.880]  together to take over the various monarchies of europe you know you can talk about the rough
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:03.000]  child's and all the rest of them the bowers and so on so forth but the bottom line is there's a core
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.600]  group of pure evil and uh they conspired you know decades and decades ago to come up with a plan
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.920]  on how to take over the world will you do it one country at a time or two countries at a time by
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.400]  pitting those two countries against each other you know the rough child plan said you know you
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.440]  support both countries during war and along the money and at the end it doesn't matter who wins or
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.880]  loses because they're both in your debt and debt is power now they they turn around and they run
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:35.000]  the economic systems of countries and they can control the jobs they could control the banks
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.560]  they can control the flow of money they can control the value of money they control the gold
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:44.280]  and the silver and the other precious metals they control the jewels and then that is total control
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:48.680]  politics political control means nothing to these people as long as they're the ones calling the
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.960]  shots and they've been doing this you know for decades and decades and what they've decided
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:00.920]  was the way to rule the world is to rule the world by a big by controlling the world's assets
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:08.120]  that means the food the oil the water the air we breathe the weather now i think today they that's
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.920]  an asset uh because if you can make it rain you can make it flood if you can make it dry you can
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.760]  make it drought you know and so they're able to control these different various things and uh right
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.280]  now the the whole thing is being able to take all the countries in the third world status
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:30.200]  and elevate them the first world status and because you improve those countries they're
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.720]  they're all in your debt and they're all very grateful to you and they follow your orders
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:39.160]  but to do that they have to get this redistribute the wealth and open the borders of the first
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:45.400]  world countries you know i used to give lectures and i would say uh can you name one second world
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.240]  country there'd be a hundred people in the room and no one even knew what i was talking about what
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:53.320]  even a second world country well we talk about the first world countries and we talk about
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:57.720]  second world countries this is what we've been programmed to believe exist but can anybody
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:04.440]  name a second world country and basically a second world country is what you have when you
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:08.680]  redistribute the wealth and that includes the assets and the resources from the first world
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:14.600]  countries to the third world countries open the borders you know take from the rich give to the
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.480]  poor all the rest of that communist nonsense and you elevate them to second world status at the same
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:26.040]  time you reduce us to second world status and then we have a one world order or what we used to call
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:33.320]  the new world order everybody's in the same plane except the rulers the mega rich uh basically
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:37.960]  creating a collective a society where the general public is absolutely dependent on them and will
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.120]  do whatever they're told this is domestication now part of this program is the police state and
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:50.520]  we talked about that this morning your view of the tsa the clergy response teams the spy grids
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.200]  that are going in and when you get the internal documents that we were sent years ago by law
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:48:00.440]  enforcement none of that even has to do with al qaeda it's all about gun owners landowners
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:06.520]  ron paul supporters people that want to end the new world order uh expand on that well it all has to
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:11.480]  do with control if you can't control every element of society you're not the boss you're not in control
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.640]  yet so you have to be controlled one of the one of the things you have to do if you're you know if
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:21.640]  you're trying to subjugate a population you have to disarm it you know doesn't do any good for the
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.880]  peasants to have pitchforks because you might get stuck so you have to do everything you can to
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:32.040]  disarm the peasants and if you can't disarm them at least reduce their firepower uh you know we're
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.080]  just talking about the guns alone in this country you know we had the gun control act of 1968 uh
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:41.400]  we've had the brady bill go through we've had all of these things that started out back you know
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.480]  in the 1930s you could own a thompson submachine gun and buy it at any hardware store today you
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.760]  have to get a special license to own an automatic weapon uh you can't own anything larger than a
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:57.560]  certain size caliber blah blah blah then uh you know that that takes us into this operation gun
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.920]  walker and so on and so forth if they can't legislate uh through congress more gun control than
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:09.320]  they've already got what they want to do is they want to regulate us through emergencies uh such
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.640]  as uh gee look at all the guns that are going to mexico and causing all of the uh the havoc
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.200]  below the border with the drug cartels all the drug cartels are getting these guns out of our gun
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:25.000]  shops there's no control over the gun shops blah blah blah well anybody who believes that has never
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:31.160]  bought a gun if you go into a gun shop today you fill out a two-page form with all your your
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:36.680]  statistic on it you answer questions and if you answer any of them wrong including straw purchaser
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:41.800]  that's a felony and you can go to federal prison but we know the vast majority of guns in mexico
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.760]  where they have a total gun ban society are bought from the military their grenade launchers
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.240]  they're fully auto they're german and so the white house two years ago sort of demonizing and said we
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:58.920]  want to ban multi-yo sales semi-auto via fiat uh via emergencies you said those memos are now public
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:05.640]  like and now we've caught them because good at f guys went public and that they were knowingly helping
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.320]  get them shipped down to mexico uh and and and then they lied to congress i mean this is incredible
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:16.360]  oh yeah and and you know you've got you've got people going in there buying hundreds of guns
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.440]  and a gun dealer and a gun dealer screaming hey this is not right i shouldn't be do this you got
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.960]  atf people saying no go ahead and do it we're in charge everything's okay so the atf is telling
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:33.000]  me uh private business to violate the law and become criminals themselves and be felt by violating

[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.480]  obligated to do this and when they do it they're putting themselves in jeopardy so now if they
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:45.000]  turn around and say no well we'll file charges on you because of what you already did in the past
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.520]  that's right it's a whitey bulger tactic i mean it's it's it's the government coming mafia
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  we'll be right back uh with colonel craig robbers we're going to continue to look at

[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:39.000]  but everybody knew that was ridiculous it's the corrupt society the drug war all of it
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.080]  they lie and say it's our guns so they start going to gun shows they did in austin
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:47.560]  and have any legals go in and all day try to do a private purchase not not not from a gun dealer
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:52.760]  but somebody trying to sell their private gun to shut down quote the gun show loophole which is
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.160]  nothing but gun registration and then they go into these gun shops and tell them you're going to
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:03.080]  sell hundreds of guns and now it's starting to come out it was basically the atf had set the
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:09.000]  whole thing up it was their sub sub criminal group that's what they're scared is about to come out
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.640]  fully coming in and buying them then bringing them back and then trying to get them back into the
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:19.640]  u.s. or trying to connect them to crimes in mexico to frame the second amendment and and i said this
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:26.040]  a year and a half ago now they've been caught doing it uh kernel craig roberts looking at this
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:30.200]  there should be an immediate move for impeachment immediately i mean is this not
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.240]  uh seditious behavior against the republic well absolutely it's you know i mean when you go out
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:43.800]  and purposely violate the law violate your own laws uh you know how where does it stop you can't
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.560]  do that you can't have you know we just had three police officers here uh go to trial and one of
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.400]  them ended up going to prison after doing over 20 years on the police department he was already
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.680]  retired because at one time that the way that they handled their their informants and the drug
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:03.560]  deals and the drug money and what they were doing with it and so on down the line uh and they ended
[01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:07.320]  up as i mean as soon as this one guy got convicted he when he stood up two marshals grabbed him and
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:12.520]  hauled him off and he'd been a police australia's life and that was very small compared to what we
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.880]  see uh that happened in arizona with his gunwalker thing where it went on and on and on and on and
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.160]  they're saying well we're following these guns you can't follow those guns across the border the
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:24.680]  mexican government wasn't even involved in the mexican law enforcement which is about as corrupt
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.680]  as the government it wasn't involved in it there was no way to track these guns what they were
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.440]  doing was they were making sure that hundreds if not thousands of guns were ending up south of the
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.080]  border that could be traced back here so that when they did end up in crimes on our side of the border
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:44.760]  we could say look these came from american gun shops because they knew that if they didn't supply
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.320]  the guns uh and make sure that they got down there that the guns they did find would have come from
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:57.720]  columbia uh you know panama uh costa rica you know guatemala uh el salvador germany yeah germany now
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.400]  remember though this is the same atf that likes to pull stunts like weco and they did the little
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:08.600]  detonation test blowing up a rider truck months before okc and they were the boys that showed up
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:13.480]  a minute after in their full bomb suits and told folks patch him up they've been on the nine floor
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:18.520]  i mean these are some really nice people at the higher levels but then you've got the good atf guys
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:23.720]  blowing the whistle on this uh internally i mean i mean this is a group of criminals well yeah and
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:28.920]  here you know now here's another deal you got you got one just one drug cartel down there has 19
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:35.080]  airliners four engine two engine jet airliners that they can fly anywhere in the globe hauling
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.280]  drugs they can fly to russia they can fly to the middle east and they can trade those drugs for
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:47.320]  all the fully automatic collection of cops and ar or m16s or fnfl's they want and bring them back
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.520]  by the caseload and grenade launchers and rpg's and they could buy tanks if they wanted them
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:58.120]  you know by the way now they've got giant armored vehicles that look bigger than uh black waters
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.800]  grisly yeah they call them the narco tanks i mean these these are they got that at a gun shop
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.720]  colonel yeah right they just went in and got one uh they had probably a dozen of them out back

[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:19.480]  the money in the world to do it with they've got all the contacts to do it with they don't need
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:25.320]  some piddly gun shop in tucson arizona to sell them guns our government has people in it that says

[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:36.440]  country hostage the foreign banks saying turn your entire population's GDP over to us so we're
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:43.480]  going to bankrupt you uh the project gun runner whistleblower is under fire even though the head
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:51.480]  of the atf has been caught lying uh in emails uh now we know lied to congress that they did
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.800]  know it was going on they said they knew nothing but it turned out the highest levels ordered it
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:00.760]  and had video cameras installed in the gun shops i mean this is a big deal kernel roberts because
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:07.160]  if they've been caught uh setting this up lying to congress lying to the public and doing it to
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.600]  blame the second amendment and they already launched the demonization by the time they
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:16.520]  got caught uh and and the head of the atf is refusing to step down where is congress
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:22.280]  hauling this guy in where's the justice department oh the head of the justice department
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:27.320]  was the deputy head of the justice department who helped cover things up at okc now i understand
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.880]  why nobody's getting in trouble well you know we first we've got a week congress there a bunch
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:35.640]  of weak sisters up there you know the tea party guys went up there but i haven't seen it really
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:42.360]  do a lot yet uh and that they all get up there drink the Potomac river water and they all become
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:47.960]  part of the system it's it's just uh you know uh it's just out of control but the thing about is
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:52.840]  every one of these people in this chain of command did not only pop this up but implemented it
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:56.520]  and then and i'm not talking about the field agents that were told to do it i'm talking about the
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:03.560]  brass needs to go to prison it's as simple as that they broke the law intentionally and they
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:09.320]  did it uh for some very terrible evil purposes and that was to subject it to constitution pure
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:13.400]  and simple now i mean let's just get to the point here and everyone needs to go to trial and they
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.240]  need to go to federal penitentiary because if they don't no one in the world can be guilty
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.840]  of a crime again period in this country it's that's just the way it is if they skate everybody
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:25.080]  skate they might just open up all the prisons and let everybody out because you know it's
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:29.480]  there's no such thing as someone that's immune from the law just because of their position or
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.520]  who they work for and uh you know we we got police officers go to jail all the time politicians
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:39.800]  sometimes go to jail but you know i saw this blue up blagall of it what's his name blagall of it
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:46.600]  yeah blagall of it yeah i can never say it but anyway he gets convicted on what 17 counts yes
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:50.440]  and i don't see him in jail yet i don't see him doing the perp walk yet i don't know more than that
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:55.960]  he's obviously a slime bag but they've destroyed most the tapes we know obama and all of them are
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:02.200]  involved in the same stuff and and and obama getting free houses and all this and we see a
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:08.440]  low level vice president at city bank getting uh you know indicted for supposedly stealing 19 million
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:17.720]  but he stole it from the bankers but then when mega banks like wells fargo and uh their subsidiary
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.880]  are caught laundering 376 billion in two years confirmed they did it they don't even get in
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:29.720]  trouble so so they always burn little low level people oh yeah yeah and if you know if you start
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:36.440]  if you start chasing it like i did uh in some of my books if you start chasing the narco money
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:43.240]  over the last 30 years or all the way back to vietnam let's go all the way back to uh uh uh
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:48.680]  the the golden triangle days when shackley and clines and and all that bunch were there uh and
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.040]  now all the opium was coming out of the golden triangle and laos uh and you start following
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:59.800]  everything from the nuke and hand bank to the wdn bb or whatever was bank and honolulu to the uh uh
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:06.680]  bcci uh you know the bank of north mclittle rock and all the rest of these banks that are involved
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:11.400]  in money laundering and to iran contra and to the cocaine coming out of the median and cali
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:17.320]  cartels that were set up both by the cia or at least by ted shackley uh you start chasing all this
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:22.600]  stuff and then you find the money goes into middle eastern banks it goes into the caymans and it goes
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:27.240]  into the new york city mega banks and that's where it gets laundered so the all the drugs that they
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.480]  buy in mexico eventually gets laundered through new york city of the mega banks so they're protected
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:40.120]  it's incredible and uh they then bought some of the low-level competition and then fill the

[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:22.920]  knows what's going to happen lost alamos has had fires go right up to their facilities and that whole
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.560]  area is radioactive from testing so the fires reignite that and put into the atmosphere radiation
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.240]  levels are going up so the epa has just raised the level what they say safe also cancer surges and
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:38.280]  body scanner operators tsa launching cover-up this could bring the whole thing down that the
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:44.680]  government knowingly they've got the internal memos uh from the tsa people that uh of them
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:49.160]  covering up that the cancer clusters and the fact that they're being blasted with radiation just
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.480]  incredible information and paul joseph watson's article please get this out to everyone cancer
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:59.320]  surges and body scanner operators tsa launching cover-up uh also uh greek prime minister says
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:04.360]  austerity is patriotic duty even though 90 plus percent of the money is not owed by the greek people
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:08.200]  is the central banks bought off their president and finance minister and got them to sign on to the
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.880]  debt it's called too big to fail then you give them your tax money then they charge you interest
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:19.480]  for you giving it to them yeah that's how dumb they think we are uh continuing a final senate
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:26.040]  version of tsa bill in texas instead of stopping the tsa groping authorizes it now now that's
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:31.640]  incredible the first bill said fourth amendment you have no reasonable uh suspicion you have no
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:36.760]  probable cause well now the bill says will texas redefines reasonable suspicion so the bill was
[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:43.320]  going to put them in jail um and it would force them to actually engage in regional suspicion
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:47.960]  now they're saying reasonable suspicion is just that you're at an airport and it's actual the
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:53.480]  texas law enforcement association made up a political you know police chiefs are mainly federalized
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:59.400]  they came out and went to texas and said we don't like this we we want to do what the feds are doing
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:05.480]  this is a great new horizon so they so david dohurst the minion and also straff the speaker of the
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:13.560]  house along with uh algors former campaign chairman uh rick perry they killed the they killed the
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:19.240]  bill and brought it back and changed it saying that basically the tsa can give your one-year-old
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:25.160]  a proctology exam now that's political spin we're going to tie your hands by by throwing
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:29.400]  you in the briar patch exactly what you want colonel craig roberts what's your view on the tsa
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:35.880]  as a marine as an army colonel as a as a police officer an investigator what is your view of the
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:41.640]  tsa well it's a typical deal it's uh it's an agency created out of thin air all of a sudden
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:46.440]  overnight utilizing personnel that had no training no experience and no expertise in very little
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:52.360]  education uh i remember right after nine eleven they they just made waved a magic wand and all of
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:59.400]  these uh lower low-grade uh magnetic gate screeners that they had hired off the street as civilian
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:03.800]  contractees that worked for civilian companies with a different company at every airport all of
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.840]  a sudden became federal agents no training no academy no understanding of the laws nothing
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.960]  and so you had a lot of these people who've got the uh the the uh wider syndrome power went to
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:18.440]  their head i've got a badge and i'm powerful and i can be tough and and look at me and and i get to
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.240]  be the the drill instructor here at the airport you're going to line up and do what i say it may
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:30.120]  have been uh uh also on purpose that they did this because you've got people like that who are
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:36.440]  basically like the brown shirts uh that all of that eventually because you have to go someplace
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:39.640]  because you have to get on their plane because you have a schedule to keep because you've got
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:45.560]  relatives to visit business to do whatever you comply with get in line shut up take a number
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:54.520]  do as we say and once we get that uh that cattle uh mentality and uh we submit to that then it's
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.920]  very easy to control a population you control a population many ways but one of the ways
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:05.720]  is by making them psychologically malleable to uh following orders don't ask questions bingo and now
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:11.480]  it's spreading to high school proms with the tsa now it's spreading with the tsa is going to train
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:17.800]  and and wave a magic wand and now texas police new york police are suddenly allowed to grab your
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:24.520]  genitals and go down your pants and now they're changing the definition of uh reasonable suspicion
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:32.360]  to well you're at a public place or uh we just feel like it i mean this is really the end of
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:37.320]  our common law the end of basic liberty and it's the same thing that the british citizens
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:42.520]  went to war with the king of england over because they he was stomping on their rights and doing
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:48.200]  the exact same type of garbage okay now here's the deal there what do we do to stop it well it's
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:55.240]  real simple but no one's addressing the issue what people don't understand is we we've become this
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:59.720]  follow orders do as you're told don't make waves that the the nail it sticks up get the hammer
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.360]  keep your mouth shut and it'll get somebody else they won't bother you you'll be able to go on your
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:11.160]  way what you have to understand is that is when you look at the mechanism as a whole you cannot
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:16.600]  look at the tsa as this big machine with the federal government that has all this power the way you
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:21.400]  have to look at it is you don't fight city hall you fight the individual in city hall that you're
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:29.000]  going after and what you do is any tsa agent that violates your constitutional rights such as the
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.400]  groping and the fourth amendment stuff and all that sort of thing you file on them you sue them
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:42.760]  personally under 42 usc 1983 that makes them personally their their government position cannot
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:49.640]  protect them in a 1983 lawsuit well you know as well as i police have authority to make arrests
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:56.440]  to do all those things because they they are making a citizen's arrest and in the incorporated
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:04.280]  city under state law the people are hiring you to be designated citizens with special training and
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:11.400]  weapons uh but but but hired by us to serve to go out and it's the same power of citizens arrest
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.000]  that does that as soon as an officer steps out of the constitution bill of rights they no longer
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.760]  have immunity citizens have immunity to shoot a robber coming in their house just like a cop has
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:27.720]  the immunity to shoot a robber if he comes to a house and catches a minute and the robber tries
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:33.160]  something so it's the same power they're trying to train us that we don't have that power or they're
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:38.680]  trying to tell us that out of control police are above the law or tsa are above the law but as soon
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:44.600]  as they step out of the constitution they're wide open well that's exactly right and and you know
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:50.680]  20 years ago i had to go to in service at the academy one day i went in and the lawyer was there
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:55.240]  talking to us about 1983 lawsuits because they were starting to occur around the country i've
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:16:02.680]  never even heard about it and uh basically it was if we stepped outside of our our our uh privileges
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:07.000]  given us as law enforcement officers by the constitution and given to the citizens by the
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.120]  constitution that we violated their civil rights uh you know whether it's our the fourth amendment
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:17.960]  or whatever if we violate we became then personally responsible and we're not under the protection
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:24.120]  of the department and on top of that you can add vicarious liability vicarious liability says
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:28.280]  i'm not only going to sue you i'm going to sue your boss and your boss's boss and your boss's
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:33.640]  boss individually and go after your bank account your pensions your houses and everything and
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:39.960]  you can't be protected and this is a big secret like ventura is personally suing um uh i was about
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:46.920]  to say renao same same lady different time uh napolitano mr napolitano sorry mr madow i'm
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:52.760]  sorry janet napolitano i get them all confused but you know the point is they are uh you're going
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:59.000]  after her and even if they in their kangaroo court beat it you you know what cops say you beat the
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:05.160]  rap you can't beat the ride yeah well uh when you start saying vicarious liability and that i'm not
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.160]  only going to sue you son i'm going to sue your boss and your boss's boss and i and here it is a
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:14.440]  42 1983 lawsuit they know what that is if they don't they'll have somebody tell them what it is and
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.600]  they're going to back off real quick because right then they become personally responsible they don't
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.320]  hide in the crowd anymore and once they become personally responsible and it's their bank account
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:27.240]  their pension and their job you know what their bosses are going to say they're going to say hey
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.320]  we don't you know he was working out of bounds he was done either he or she were on their own but
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:37.720]  the problem with that is a vicarious liability law lawsuit says failure to properly supervise failure
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.440]  to properly train and that does not let the boss off the hook at that point well i was a few years
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:47.880]  ago protesting rick perry and austin police commander came over with riot cops getting dressed
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.720]  we were on the sidewalk not blocking anything and he said i'm going to arrest you if you don't
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.680]  leave and i said well austin's lost lawsuits over this and he said i don't care and this is on video
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:02.440]  and i said well listen i'm going to sue you personally and i said and he and this went on
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:06.280]  he said i'm still going to arrest you and i said you go ahead i'm in the right you're in the wrong
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:10.600]  why on earth would you want to violate the first amendment that protects you and your family
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:16.840]  and he finally went away uh but i mean cops just need to know the the bill of rights and constitution
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:21.400]  is there to protect them as well as everybody else well the problem is there's a lot of departments
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:25.000]  especially your smaller ones they get very little training on that you know they get a little bit
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.720]  constitutional law when they go through the academy and after that except for a while at in service
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:35.400]  they really don't get it reinforced there's a busy busy with their nose and the municipal code and
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.440]  the state statutes that uh uh they don't pay any attention to the federal law they don't pay attention
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:44.520]  to the constitutional law you know when jack mclean was traveling all around had passing out
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:49.240]  constituted you know pocket constitutions and lecturing on that the police officers around the
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.720]  country it was like he was he had a whole bunch of brand new rookies that didn't know any of any of
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:59.080]  that existed so it's all in education and training and supervision and if they don't get that then
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.760]  that's what you're going to run into and it's really bad in the rural areas and the small towns
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:08.040]  and the sheriff's departments we've only got one more segment coming up and there's so many issues

[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.840]  there's there's there's a lot of questions that are coming up now on the middle eastern connection
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:51.160]  which is what we were really leaning on back you know at 95 and 96 and that uh reno and and and
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:55.960]  free and and uh clinton all said there is no middle eastern connection and at that point the
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:59.400]  fbi just said okay we're not going to deal with it where there is no middle eastern connection
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:05.560]  we'll go chase you know wild geese someplace else well we have documents that have surfaced
[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:10.280]  from the philippine intelligence services where nickles you know had gone to the philippines on
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:14.600]  several times several occasions did not have a job had no money yet he was able to fly back and
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:19.240]  forth to the philippines stand hotels and go to meetings with ablicey f and the documents
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:25.240]  had surfaced from the philippines named the names of who he met over there and one of them
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:30.760]  was uh uh mohammed walley con who was tied to the shake holly mohammed well shake holly mohammed
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:37.720]  of course was you know one of the right-hand men of uh in al-qaeda and uh his his nephew was ramsey
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:43.720]  yosef and ramsey yosef whose real name was was bassett uh was the planner for operation bojica
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:49.480]  which was going to you know block uh a dozen american jumbo jets and that failed when his
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.800]  apartment caught fire and they had now you talked about this a decade ago but but but now more
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:58.760]  documents have come out right but but people get confused you're saying clearly atf involved
[02:25:58.760 --> 02:26:03.480]  you got mcvay now they got sworn affidavits from nickles and others that he was sheep dipped out
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:08.440]  of special operations uh you've got german intelligence there you got jane graham seeing
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:13.720]  mcvay in the building the gray sticks of butter this is a classic criminal network operation
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:18.920]  because that's what clinton would hire would be a group so that it's so confused just like with
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:24.840]  kennedy nobody can understand how it was run is that i mean is that where this is going well yeah
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:31.240]  pretty much it's it's uh you know now we have documents but the name and and pretty much date
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:36.200]  nickles and the philippines meeting with with members of al-qaeda and and it goes all the way
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:41.800]  to a guy nick that then we called usama bent laden with a u uh which is his actual real name
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.760]  and they changed it to osama some sometime later on in fact i even mentioned him in a medusa file
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:52.920]  back before 9 11 uh no one ever acted like they ever heard of this guy before but we stumbled
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.040]  on to him but then we've got those documents showing there's a definite middle eastern
[02:26:56.040 --> 02:27:01.960]  connection it goes to where pakistan and it goes to uh the the area between the pakistan border
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.880]  and and uh the afghan border and then across the border into the terrorist training camps that were
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:10.680]  originally set up by the cia to train the bougie dean to fight the russians and and we've got all
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.960]  of this evidence plus we've got the names of americans that are involved uh that ran a travel
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:22.120]  service to the philippines out of scott stale arizona and all of this was you know uh a lot of this
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:27.080]  i went to janet davis and janet took it to the us attorney took it to the fbi they didn't want to
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:31.640]  see it they didn't want to touch it they did it's a craig we're almost out of time from your deep
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:37.080]  research of this uh best we can tell who was running the operation how were the different
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:42.680]  players involved well you know it it's hard to put your finger on who exactly pushed the green
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.560]  button to so make it go but we know who was covering up the operation and that tells us a
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:51.240]  lot you've got the entire clinton regime that covered up the actual leads of the oakland city
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:56.040]  bombing you had special agents of the fbi out of out of new york i think it was they came in
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:00.680]  and refused to investigate those the the actual leads that we came up we've got they had a counter
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.200]  terrorism was there the night before and got caught lying about it well and we got you know we've
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:08.600]  had them change reports change witness statements intimidate witnesses karen schnacky of course he
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.840]  ended up dead uh several other people ended up dead that that saw things they should have seen
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.560]  that talked about it jane graham who saw andris grassmeyer in the basement of the of the murray
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.240]  building we've got all of these things but you can't get anybody to do anything about it because
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:25.880]  that tells you if you do do something about it it's going to lead someplace to what is that
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:31.640]  mean when you got muslim extremist terrorist you got german intelligence you got mcvay running
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:38.040]  around you got the atf running around i mean it's incredible yeah and and you know it's it's a soup
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:43.800]  sandwich and the thing about this when you do come up with good leads and you've got the federal
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:48.520]  government who refuses to address those leads who doesn't want to see it doesn't want to touch it that
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:52.440]  tells me everything i need to know you know if i'm going to arrest the guy and i can't get the
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:59.720]  prosecutor to go along with it i'm powerless incredible um and of course you know about uh
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:06.600]  the case where uh the lawyers have been getting uh different fbi documents where one sets blacked out

[02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:21.400]  got congressman ron paul for the next 20 minutes and i know he's the hardest working person in
[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:26.920]  congress and i feel a little guilty taking his time up but he's got so much important information
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:32.600]  and i know our audience is always chomping at the bit whenever he joins us normally every month
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:38.120]  but now every couple months because he's so busy and i've got a whole cornucopia of things to cover
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:43.960]  here the wars the constitutional crisis the tsa the dirty tricks the media has been running on
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:48.280]  ron paul and he's a he's a good sportsman so he never really talks about it but i think it needs
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:53.880]  to be discussed but obviously he's a presidential candidate he's the only candidate that is a
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:59.800]  constitutionalist and that has the solutions to help get this country on the right track all the others
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:06.920]  are rhinos or globalist or neocons and we've got to get behind ron paul but thank god he ran for
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:11.320]  president because by running he's injecting real issues we got him for the next 20 minutes and then
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:17.640]  he's gone sir there's so much to cover but the financial time says the dollar is seen losing
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:24.520]  global reserve status the bankers are engaged in economic terrorism in greece uh the others saying
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:29.880]  it's going to spread here the recession never ended uh you've been proven right again sir what can
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.440]  you say because you're on the banking committees what can you say about the state of the world economy
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:39.880]  right now i think it's sick and getting sicker i did read one article you probably saw today they
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:45.000]  said that the dollar the reserve standard as the reserve standard of the world will be coming to
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:52.120]  an end and they added within 25 years i would suggest that uh it's going to come much sooner
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:57.560]  i just don't believe it'll last for 25 years where it'll be the dominant reserve currency of the
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:02.680]  world the big problem though is uh who's going to pick up the pieces they're getting together
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:08.360]  and they're trying to have another international paper currency put together but then they throw
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:14.280]  out a few tidbits and say well maybe we ought to put a little bit of gold into that as well
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:21.240]  but uh they um the problems we have are really very overwhelming they cannot sustain this so
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:26.600]  so i would say that it's not going to be 25 years but i don't know you know nobody knows
[02:35:26.600 --> 02:35:31.720]  exactly the date but it could come sooner a lot sooner to come a year or two or who knows when
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:38.760]  depends on what event might arise but these the the problem they face is the one that we face in
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:45.000]  trying to figure it out is the dollar is a terrible currency but when you compare it to the euro that
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:50.440]  has to bail out the greek economy you know all of a sudden people people look to us because
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:54.360]  traditionally we've been so strong economically and militarily they say well at least we could
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:59.480]  park our money in treasury bills you know for another month or two or three someday they're
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:04.360]  going to run out of this in the momentum we against the dollar and uh not too many years ago the
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:10.920]  dollar got in big trouble and we had to go begging to the imf and that was in 79 and 80 uh people
[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:16.440]  thought it would be that lose control but uh the time is coming and that will be a much bigger event
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:23.160]  than we've just experienced you know from 08 up until now and the current crisis that we're in
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:29.080]  the middle of because i think it'll just drive us that much deeper into a economic crisis well the
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:34.040]  chinese as you know just two weeks ago said the united states is already technically defaulted
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:38.840]  the federal reserve is buying most of the t-bills and for the average layman out there they're like
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.720]  why does that concern me well that's the faith and credit of the united states and that's a tactic
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:49.240]  i've seen where they'll say 10 years 25 on something that's going to happen to introduce the idea to
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:54.840]  you so you accept it but don't panic a lot of the experts i read and uh who've been accurate in the
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:37:00.440]  past they say two three years but then they point out it's a global concerted devaluation
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:04.920]  so it's not even that the dollar is going to lose its reserve it's just going to lose its value
[02:37:04.920 --> 02:37:10.600]  that's right and you know they they're trying to frighten the members of congress into you know
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:14.600]  voting to raise the debt limit like they did about the bailout you know the end of the world will
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:20.600]  come uh there will be a default but the default is i mean our country is known for default i mean
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:26.040]  all the way back to the civil war period they defaulted on on promising to pay gold we did it
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:32.840]  in the 30s with roosevelt then we did it to all foreigners in 1971 we just say well no yes we promised
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:39.320]  you uh announced so gold for 35 dollars but we're not going to do it anymore so and even now they
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.160]  they keep saying well you have to raise it because we don't want a default on the debt
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:49.400]  but if prices are going up for the average person which they are and they're probably going up uh
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.760]  five to ten percent at least at the minimum uh somebody's defaulting constantly that means
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:00.680]  they're losing 10 cents on the dollar every year it'll get much worse so that is the default
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:05.560]  but that's the deception matter of fact it's deliberate policy because they know what we know
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:10.600]  they know that debt can't be paid there's no way they can meet there there's not enough people working
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.840]  to pay off the debt but the private central banks they get first use on the money and so
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.840]  they're more than happy and as we get more bankrupt they're going to be there loaning us
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:25.960]  whatever the new currency system is in the future so they come out on top with their new
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:31.560]  vaunted bank of the world that george soros says is going to save us yeah and they and they pay zero
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:36.520]  percent interest on it and then they buy some of this government debt and do these kind of things
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.080]  and they make two three four percent but you know if you're retired and and think you have this
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:45.480]  obligation to take care of yourself and say well i'm going to have a cd because i can't trust this
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:50.600]  you know the stocks or anything else they get cheated because they make essentially nothing
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:54.840]  on their on their savings and then they have to pay taxes on it then they wonder why the people
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:00.040]  don't take better care of themselves you know but it's a deeply flawed system it's a deeply flawed
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:05.320]  system of money and the welfare ism and central economic planning through the Federal Reserve
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:09.880]  it's all deeply flawed and though many of us have talked about this for many many years
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:16.440]  it's coming through fruition and most people are realizing it it's also the reason that especially
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:21.160]  the young people are realizing how much they're being dumped on and i know you reach a lot of
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:27.560]  young people as well talking to how they're getting ripped off because there's not and there's no way
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:31.240]  even if they could get a good job they can't pay off these obligations but they're not getting
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:36.840]  any good jobs so we are really really facing a major problem and it has to be a dollar
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:42.440]  coming in our in our future well what about Bernanke last week saying he's puzzled that the
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:46.920]  economy isn't getting better you with total precision have predicted exactly what would
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:52.440]  happen because it's sound laws of economics uh Bernanke knows full well as you just said they
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:57.160]  know what they're doing and in telling us we're not in a recession i mean that's another lie
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:04.200]  congressman shifting gears into the campaign you are the only candidate you know decades ago
[02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:08.600]  telling the truth about issues now in the presidential race the only one who's telling
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.920]  the truth and who has the track record to be trusted mit romney you know helped write what
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:20.040]  became obama care uh the rest of them i mean this is a pack of people who are just completely
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:25.560]  unqualified at this point we've got uh seeing in uh ignoring their own polls and running
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:32.120]  uh internet polls with 54 people and then showing you for zero in their own polls show that you won
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:37.000]  you're winning most the straw polls second new hampshire i hear mainline conservative radio
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.640]  talking about republican candidates they won't even mention you despite the fact that you're
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:47.480]  right there in the top three candidates that shows that the system is scared of you what can you say
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:53.400]  to the dirty tricks uh that they've been trying to pull on you i don't think you could stop them i
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.280]  mean they're they have too much power and control because they own the media and they own a lot of
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:04.200]  these outlets so talking to people like you that will get the truth out but also the internet is
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:10.920]  a good way to do this but as bad as the system is it still operates reasonably well that is that
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:17.160]  you know over the years i've been able to run for congress and get elected and now i am still able
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:23.160]  to compete even up against these odds and and these tricks because you know we can get in
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:28.280]  and organize and our numbers are growing we're able to raise the money that is necessary and we
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:33.720]  continue to do that as long as as long as we keep adding volunteers and able to raise the money we
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:39.320]  are going to compete but obviously it is more difficult because there's still a large number
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:44.040]  of people if not even the majority get their information from the evening news the ordinary
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:50.280]  news and from their politicians and if uh if they can discredit you you don't get credibility and
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:57.000]  last go around you know the first two major debates one right before iowa one before new hampshire
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.560]  you know they exclude me from the debate this year they're not going to they're not going to be able
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:07.080]  to do it so that we we have made progress and that's been because there's a growing number of people
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:11.320]  who are on to their tricks and are watching them rather closely and they're going to hear from
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:17.800]  from the supporters if they start doing that so uh in spite of the obstacles our job is to keep doing
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:23.160]  what we're doing and and just gain supporters well i want to talk about some of the things on the
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:27.960]  positive front and and specifically the websites and how people need to get involved now but
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:31.880]  you at the start of the race last time weren't even in the top 10 then you were in the top four or
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:36.760]  five now out of the gate you're winning most of straw polls you've won the big coveted c-pack
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:42.520]  two years in a row so fox cuts to a year old clip of you being booed i mean all sorts of tricks i mean
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:48.680]  it is it is showing that they're scared of you showing you are viable uh the the new talking
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:54.440]  point is you're not viable and you're fighting for credibility uh which again is just a pure
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:43:00.040]  hoax if you just look at the polls and the numbers they are horrified of you and we have
[02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:05.000]  jim tucker and others that have given a sterling intel from inside belterberg the last five years
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:11.320]  running you are discussed every year and they say even if ron poll doesn't win it's it's the third rail
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:17.960]  in colleges now not liberalism or fake conservatism but you know true freedom um uh you you're in the
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:23.400]  debates you're exposing the imperial presidency you're exposing the dollar devaluation i mean they
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:31.880]  they are like vampires to a cross and ron paul is the cross they are scared of you well i don't
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:38.280]  know how scared they are i think they do have concern but uh you know the one place where we uh
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.080]  think they're revealing that we all we are starts making progress if they're starting to support some
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:48.680]  of our positions whether it's you know backing off on some of this warmongering stuff and saying
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:55.240]  some things about auditing a bid so we're making that progress and what they believe is that if
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:00.760]  they just appeal or neutralize that a little bit and they can get elected one of them get elected
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:05.640]  to support the same policies they don't have to follow through with the policy so they recognize
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:11.320]  our views are popular but they also know that you can say a lot of things in campaign and as
[02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.800]  long as we elect you know they're a particular kind of people they don't have to follow through on
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:21.720]  their their promises that was my next point uh while they're attacking you and and and and and
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.200]  you know saying that you're weak when you're the opposite they're all even mainstream media admits
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:32.200]  that suddenly the entire republican field is acting and talking like ron paul so when they
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:37.720]  can't beat you they they try to counterfeit you yeah and they they certainly wouldn't say well
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:44.840]  you know uh he has a good point there or there but uh the the rude laughing and the ridicule uh
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.840]  i think that's going to go away so far it's gone away and i don't know whether they'll go back to
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:55.160]  that or not so that there's reason for us to say there's a good reason to keep doing exactly what
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:01.560]  we're doing and using what is available to us uh you know which radio shows and which uh internet
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:06.600]  programs and there's there's just a lot available to us it's not like when there were just three
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:13.560]  major networks and hardly anybody on talk radio that would you know defend our position so that's
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:19.080]  where you know i'm optimistic but on the short run there are days when i think about the overwhelming
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:24.280]  problems we face and you know we're just starting to see what happens when the government can't come
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:29.800]  through you know like in places like greece where the promises can't be fulfilled people get angry
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:33.880]  that'll be that's going to be happening here too well you there's a good chance you're going to
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:39.240]  become president but regardless we've got a supercharger campaign so you can be one at the
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:45.000]  very forefront the entire time injecting real issues so that as the implosion comes in the
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:51.160]  future people will know what you said and our movement for liberty with you as a focal point
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:56.840]  will be that much bigger and stronger to offer real solutions and we'll end up having a president
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:03.480]  poll one way or the other so folks need to have a long term vision do you agree with that absolutely
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:10.360]  we have to have a long term plan because nothing happens overnight and uh if you'd have asked me
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:17.480]  five years ago how far along we would be uh in this effort i would have not been very optimistic
[02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:23.640]  that we could have achieved what we have so far so things are moving but we it means that we still
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:29.240]  have a long way to go too and there's lots of grabs and and when people lose power they can get
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:34.280]  pretty pretty nasty because they do not want to give up that power and people who control the money
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:39.720]  and the system and the appropriations process and the international affairs and and all these
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:47.320]  things they will not go away quietly uh they will be uh you know pretty determined to cling to their
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:51.080]  power kicking and screaming all right we've only got four or five minutes left running through these
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:56.040]  quick questions uh i was surprised to see congressman nadler big democrat come out and say
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:03.400]  obama is becoming an emperor uh just as you said weeks ago the last nail in the republic's coffin
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:08.440]  if congress lets the president not even consult congress and say my authority comes from the
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:17.240]  un quote i've done this for the for the legitimacy uh of the un i mean sir is that not seditious is
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:23.000]  that not treason is it not impeachable uh what president obama has done with this with this whole
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:29.000]  libya thing uh and now they're getting the ground invasion ready oh sure and in a different age uh
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.920]  it would have been impeachable and it would have probably followed through but up until recent years
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:40.680]  they've either gotten permission or token permission but it's uh it's been bad for a while truman
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:47.240]  certainly did not do anything to notify congress he just marched in under un uh you know into korea
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:52.920]  and uh they got token permission you know for vietnam and these other events but once again
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:48:01.000]  bosnia bosnia was no permission no consultation and this is the same way in libya but uh there
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.640]  you know although the congress is waking up and there's a pretty good coalition of of of uh
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.080]  liberals and conservatives publicans and democrats coming together and trying to
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:14.680]  blow this thing up and say the president has no right to do this at the same time on this dod budget
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:21.640]  off uh authorization you know they inserted in there an expansion of the power actually if that's
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:26.840]  if it's passed by the senate and put in the law we've literally literally legalized we put into
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:31.960]  the code even though not at the constitution put into the code that the president doesn't have to
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:36.920]  come to us they've expanded the definition of our anime today it's al qaeda and they're
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:43.960]  are ought to do almost anything there but they've expanded it can include the taliban and anything
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:48.520]  which is considered an associated force the associated forces the president has the right
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:54.600]  to go after it no matter what country or including our own so this to me was one of the most
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:49:02.920]  dangerous changes in our our law was given legitimacy to our president uh on what he's
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:07.880]  been doing and of course there's not much resistance either from the republicans or the democrats on
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:13.640]  this but uh hopefully we can wake the american people up to that change what about obama
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:19.720]  admittedly gonna have feds posed as people calling doctors to see if they're taking medicare
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.520]  medicaid patients which is their right to not do as you know uh this is really freaking doctors out
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:32.440]  that now the feds are going to be spying spying on them yes and uh i would i would assume uh that uh
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:37.240]  most of people don't realize that's against the law to do those kind of things i mean why should
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.760]  they violate the privacy you know of a doctor patient relationship and come in and fake it's
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:47.880]  fraud it's deceitful it and what kind of punishment might these doctors what did the doctor say i don't
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:54.920]  take medical care patients you know uh who knows what kind of list you get put on there but uh no
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:50:00.360]  that's just uh one thing leads to next always another unintended consequence everything every
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:05.160]  time the government does one thing and it creates two or three new problems congressman just a couple
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:09.960]  questions left here and then we're going to ask you how we support the campaign again uh operation
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:14.920]  fast and furious just remind listeners they had the atf caught lying to congress saying you didn't
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:20.040]  know now we have the emails memorandum they were running the operation to ship guns into mexico
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:25.400]  to then claim that we're causing the violence down there a form of false flag a staged event
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:31.640]  to frame the second amendment that he's caught lying um can you or others call for congressional
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:39.880]  hearings and haul these people up and uh i mean expose what the uh dreaded atf has done well i'm
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:45.480]  sure uh that would be legitimate if somebody so motivated i don't happen to be on that particular
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:51.240]  committee but uh yes government oversight could do that they could call up and get to the bottom of
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:56.680]  it but uh i haven't heard a whole lot talk i don't have any special information on that but they
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:03.320]  certainly can and they certainly should yeah in closing on the political issues there's new reports
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:10.280]  out in mainstream television and newspapers that cancer is surging uh in body scan operators the
[02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:15.080]  tsa at the boston airport where it's been for seven years and they've had an internal cover-up
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:20.680]  of the fact that they know that radiation is leaking out of these could this be the nail in
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:27.480]  the coffin of this this federal tsa that they knowingly uh are not following radiation rules
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:33.640]  or radiology rules that you'd follow it in your practice and well this hope so but isn't it sad
[02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:39.400]  that they have to come to that conclusion after somebody's made sick or get uh get cancer but
[02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:43.160]  the big thing is is we got to get the government out of that business so if they get rid of the
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:48.920]  machines and they're going to do a lot more probing and prodding and poking everybody so it's it's
[02:51:48.920 --> 02:51:54.920]  really tragic i think what's happening at airports is the is the litmus test if the american people
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:52:01.160]  can sit back and look at some of those pictures and not be outraged and not demanding changes
[02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:06.520]  i i those that when i see that that's when i have some pessimistic thoughts about what's
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:12.040]  going to happen this country so this hope that uh they will so i those pictures will so outrage the
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:17.480]  people that uh we'll we'll end up doing something about it speaking of the tsa i've got sources
[02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:22.280]  inside the perry campaign and at fox news as you know rick perry the governor is planning
[02:52:22.280 --> 02:52:27.080]  to run i would imagine you've got the same intel and he's going to run on a ron paul platform
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:33.000]  so he's really going to be the guy you uh face from our uh analysis and rick perry quietly
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  tried to kill the good bill they've rewritten it uh where it actually puts in the code that the tsa
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:44.520]  can do this now uh in texas and they're calling in an anti tsa bill kind of like what we saw
[02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:49.240]  with the war powers uh double speak of saying they're against what obama's doing but trying to
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:54.520]  give him the power right that's typical you that's why you can never look what they do on the surface
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:59.080]  when they want it when people want something done they'll pass the bill and it'll do the opposite
[02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:03.400]  whether it was the war powers resolution of this recent episode of that bill they tried to pass
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:09.480]  which literally legalized the war so uh yes that's what they do and then they claim victory what's
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:15.480]  your view of perry what's your view of perry well i've never i've never i might have shaken hands
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:19.800]  with him but i don't even remember that so i've never i don't know him well personally but i would
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:25.400]  think that he and i wouldn't have much in in agreement on policies well he was al gaur's
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:31.000]  former campaign manager in texas i don't think that's a very good uh i don't tell it that i'll
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:37.640]  tell a few people something well congressman you seemed really happy because you're always so focused
[02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:41.080]  because i know you're a very disciplined man but when i talked to you in the break before you came
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:46.920]  live i don't think i've ever heard you so happy uh am i right in that i mean you said well i'm
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:51.480]  sad for the country but overall i'm happy that folks are starting to wake up i mean you are happy
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:57.000]  yeah i am and things who've personally with family and everything have been has been going
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:04.200]  pretty well and uh that's what uh i guess cheers me up well thank you sir in closing what i mean
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:09.480]  because i've got millions of listeners a lot of new big stations across the country we're not talking
[02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:13.320]  to just a million every day we're talking to three million every day on the radio alone
[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:18.200]  not just internet later we're reaching about 10 million a week talking to the millions of new
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:22.440]  listeners who've never heard you in a long form they've heard you on tv being interrupted constantly
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:29.560]  what can they do to be part of this second american revolution or the restoration of the
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:35.640]  republic give us the orders from headquarters what do we do to to to supercharge a campaign that's
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:43.080]  already on fire well uh in in very general terms uh slightly separate from the campaign what everybody
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:47.720]  has to do is be informed get the information and find out where the problem is and what the
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.600]  answers are and why philosophy is important when they're informed then they have to do something
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:57.240]  and they can make choices they can get involved directly they can become candidates or support
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:01.960]  candidates they can get into education they can get radio talk shows they can get on the internet
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:08.840]  to promote this this message but then when it comes more specific uh for what i've been doing you
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:14.120]  know we had the educational opportunities through my foundation as well as campaign for liberty but
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:19.560]  right now we were very much engaged in the uh presidential campaign people who are interested
[02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:26.840]  in that can go to runpaul2012.com and find out what they can do because uh that's where we need
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:34.040]  to help we need people uh to volunteer we need to raise money and right now the next big event
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:40.360]  for us is to try to find people in iowa anybody knows anybody in iowa that would be willing to
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:45.160]  support us and make an effort and come out on august 13th that would be very helpful to hang
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:50.120]  and uh when's the next money bomb and folks can give right now at runpaul2012.com well there is
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:55.640]  an effort right now because on the 30th of this month uh the books close and you know there's a
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:01.640]  there's a big that report is significant because it will be blasted all over the country on who
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:07.720]  raised what and we won't be the biggest fundraiser but we're going to have raised a lot but they were
[02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:13.400]  trying to push for uh you know first for three then somebody said maybe we can raise five and i think
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:18.840]  it's uh not quite at four million right now so the next couple days we're hoping to boost that up
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:24.120]  and have a good showing uh for the uh financial report for this quarter all right congressman

[03:02:01.320 --> 03:02:10.360]  number to join us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 webster griffin tarply good to have you pop in with us
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:18.920]  today hi alex how are you good man well we're hanging on here uh the bbc is hyping some great
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:26.120]  gains by the rebels a little bit southwest of here people here are very skeptical about that the bbc
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:32.600]  has a track record of taking these manic statements by the uh the bangazi rebel council and putting
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:40.280]  that on the air rather there's here a uh i think a great deal of confidence by the libian government
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:48.360]  that the rebellion in the city of mesurata or mesurata was that it's uh in its final
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:53.960]  throws in other words that it's going to be over there in something like seven to ten days and that
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:59.560]  was an important place for the rebels to go into because that is the steel mill that is one of the
[03:02:59.560 --> 03:03:08.920]  biggest steel mills in africa and it is as far as i know capable of manufacturing the biggest steel
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:15.560]  tubing in the world and this has to do with with the uh kedafi uh project right infrastructure
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:22.200]  project called the great man made river which is 32 billion dollars taking the water from under the
[03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:30.440]  sahara desert and piping that north towards triply bangazi and the other cities so that you know in
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:36.280]  in yemen we're told that within a couple of years there's going to be no water in yemen and the guy
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:42.680]  that i heard talking about this the expert anyways said that uh that doesn't mean a shortage of water
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:48.760]  but actually no water so the future of human life in yemen may be very dubious but in libya
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:55.880]  it is assured at least in the sense of water and you've got to put in water as one of the main
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:02.280]  things that these nato imperialists and oh they said that's the next thing they're going after
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:07.720]  globally is the blue gold for those that don't know uh just what 50 000 years ago they know the
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:13.000]  sahara was full of lakes and crocodiles and hippopotamus and all of it and that and that the
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:19.240]  water went underground uh with desert vacation uh and that and that it's there and kedafi's bringing
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:25.480]  it up and becoming a a spoke for development all over africa that can't be allowed right so that's
[03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:29.880]  that's the vendetta they have going so they're one of the key parts of that project instead of
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:34.760]  just importing this stuff they said let's build our steel mill here in miserata right on the
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:40.200]  coast you can get the raw materials in but then we'll we'll manufacture these huge tubes so not
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:46.440]  minus amount of germany usually the gold standard for steel tubing not somebody in japan or or in the
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:53.160]  far east but but libya which had been one of the poorest if not the poorest in certainly in africa
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:57.720]  maybe the world stay there webster let's break it all down and where this is going and how he's
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:03.240]  handing out millions of firearms stay with us there's a man named dr wallach who is anything
[03:05:03.240 --> 03:05:09.080]  but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician doc asks why does the united
[03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:15.320]  states spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:20.280]  he believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition taking
[03:05:20.280 --> 03:05:25.800]  charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition not by toxic
[03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:31.320]  prescription drugs leading to side effects this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:35.960]  wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of americans who are waking up to all the
[03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:40.840]  big government big pharma manipulation of our health care system i like what doc wallach is
[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:45.640]  saying and doing to enlighten people about health care and have joined forces to help this tireless
[03:05:45.640 --> 03:05:51.720]  crusader spread his message visit info wars team dot com and listen to dr wallach's deadly recipes
[03:05:51.720 --> 03:05:57.720]  lecture it makes a lot of sense and i want you to join our info wars team go to info wars team

[03:06:16.840 --> 03:06:22.840]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all

[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:40.600]  from tripley we've got some questions from listeners out there so it's not just old alex
[03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:48.360]  jones uh bringing up points the toll free number to join us is 800 25 at 992 31 webster's leaving us
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:52.440]  at the bottom of the hour and i'm going to get into a whole bunch of other news i haven't covered
[03:08:52.440 --> 03:08:57.720]  yet and also take some of your calls but webster continuing they want the water they want the
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:02.920]  trillions in oil uh obviously madson talked about and i've seen some of this in the news
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:07.640]  that billions of dollars of libyan government oil money that was invested with goldman sacks
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:13.000]  and others and sarcosi was stolen has has been swindled so they have another reason it's more
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:18.760]  like a mafia hit taking him out we have a constitutional crisis ron paul the congressman
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:23.640]  the presidential candidate agreed with us last hour that this is impeachable offense against
[03:09:23.640 --> 03:09:30.840]  obama uh but the the the the ruling class has gone collectively mad dog with hubris or is it
[03:09:30.840 --> 03:09:36.120]  desperation i want your view on that where they are just getting more and more crazy
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:41.240]  more and more out in the oven more and more naked brazen uh whatever you want to call it
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:49.080]  why is this being done well let's just on the obama issue remember he's he's now long past
[03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:53.880]  the deadline on the war powers act so that means he is impeachable so please add that one to the
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:10:02.040]  bill of impeachment along with the number of other uh charges we just passed 100 days of bombing
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:10.440]  and uh people here uh compared this to the bombing of syria back in 1999 went on i believe
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:18.280]  and it is believed here for 68 or 69 days and of course in that situation there was no ground war
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:26.680]  war so libya has successfully stood up under 100 days of nato bombing with the attacks of al-qaeda
[03:10:27.240 --> 03:10:33.960]  terrorists masquerading as pro-democracy rebels here on the ground so serbs of course notoriously
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:40.680]  tough uh but the conclusion is libyans even tougher so if you look at libya i think this is
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:46.040]  the last place in the world anybody would want to invade uh and just a couple of other things
[03:10:46.040 --> 03:10:54.360]  historically uh libya is the country which was the victim of the the first military use of poison
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:11:02.760]  gas was by italian colonialists against libya in the years after 1911 and in the course of a
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:12.120]  anti-colonial struggle the libyans had approximately one million casualties um unbelievable uh
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:19.240]  excesses of the italian imperialists at that time so what it shows you is that there's no limit
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:23.960]  to this resistance and the cohesion of it of course coming from the from the tribes this included
[03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:29.400]  standing up against an electrified fence and minefield that went over just about the well
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:35.080]  not the whole length of the border between libya and egypt but but a lot of it so that's that's
[03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:39.720]  one thing note in terms of the insanity of the ruling class i have to point out the international
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:45.800]  criminal court so-called and this guy okampo uh this is this scoundrel right this baker who
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:52.200]  was organized that thing into a kangaroo court internationally right we're still waiting for
[03:11:52.200 --> 03:12:00.040]  the indictment of bush of rumsfeld of cany of wolfowitz all the neocons who scheme to you know
[03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:07.000]  to bomb uh afghanistan and then to invade iraq then no no indictments on you know 9 11 crimes
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:15.240]  or anything like that but okampo sees it as his job to go after the people who who resist this
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:22.600]  imperialist power be it general basheer of uh of sudan or milosevic and the case of milosevic
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:28.120]  of of serbia also reminds us that this place is it's a murder incorporated in its own right
[03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:34.680]  that you get milosevic there and then he mysteriously dies of an unexpected heart attack so
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:41.560]  so yeah they gave him an eater poison something like this so they've they've put out a uh an
[03:12:41.560 --> 03:12:48.360]  indictment of colonel qaddafi his son saif that is the surviving son saif because the other one
[03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:56.520]  was killed in with the same name but saif uh a rob saif el islam the surviving one of uh is
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:05.080]  the uh it is uh also indicted and uh a guy called son usie who's the the security chief and uh this
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:11.080]  has got all of these these uh accusations the stuff that this is based on is complete fabrication
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:17.720]  and complete hearsay uh what happened in the middle of february february 12 13 14th was that
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:27.640]  you had mobs of these uh rebels right under al-qaeda leadership storming military bases and arms depots
[03:13:27.640 --> 03:13:33.720]  especially in the bangazi area with the goal of starting off not armed but to get armed as soon
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:41.960]  as they could with this with the the various um you know machine guns uh bazookas rpg tanks of
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:46.840]  any kind artillery so they might have been disarmed or unarmed at the beginning but they
[03:13:46.840 --> 03:13:52.040]  didn't stay that way for long and the goal was to have an armed rebellion so there is absolutely no
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:58.520]  evidence that the the libyan government uh was wantonly out there you know shooting at civilians
[03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:04.600]  who were carrying out a peaceful protest uh in fact quite the contrary that that this that there
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:10.440]  were peaceful protests that were going on that were somehow used as the as the screen to begin
[03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:14.680]  some of these things right to get people together because there had been peaceful protests every
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:20.680]  week or so for some you know economic grievance or something like this very limited and that
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:26.120]  then became the screen to go after them so this is one side the other side is this unbelievable
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:31.640]  fictitious story about viagra and rape which i don't even want to go into but it the thing falls
[03:14:31.640 --> 03:14:37.800]  to the ground of its own ridiculousness i have here a uh a well-informed middle east source who
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:44.280]  says that okampo should stop talking about rape because he is alleged to have uh indulged in
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:50.760]  this himself and that somehow the the international criminal court did some dirty things to get him
[03:14:50.760 --> 03:14:56.840]  off the hook on some of those charges so this man is an adventurer uh and and and a fraud
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:03.560]  um that is the uh the new thing that is that has happened here today it's a it's a kangaroo court
[03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:09.160]  of hypocrites and uh i guess we have to be thankful that the u.s is not in it right that's some
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:14.600]  little mercy in this this whole terrible situation the thing about the the insanity of the ruling
[03:15:14.600 --> 03:15:20.920]  class is of course that right when you have a ruling elite that's based on derivatives and
[03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:27.080]  other kinds of finances and when they see these castles of the cards that they've built come
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:32.120]  crashing down before their eyes they go collectively insane and they lash out let me just give you an
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:39.400]  example in uh september 21st 1931 you had the bankruptcy of the british pound the central
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:44.440]  event of the last depression was the bankruptcy of the pound in september 1931 when the bank of
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:50.360]  england sees gold payment uh and within about a week of that i think a couple of days before
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:56.600]  you have the japanese uh setting off this provocation so they can invade manchuria so the idea that
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:03.560]  that um when you see a really acute economic depression taking shape this is often immediately
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:13.000]  accompanied by most insane military adventurism of the type that we that we see here well webster
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:18.760]  my my issue is this i mean obviously george washington said don't get involved in foreign
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:24.600]  entanglements but then thomas jefferson my big hero you know when our ships are being attacked then
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:29.720]  you go and defend them but that's when you're attacked and of course that happened uh as you
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:35.640]  know in the Mediterranean and and other areas dealing and and in the gulf dealing with uh
[03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:41.400]  arab pirates but qaddafi's not attacking us he tried to work with the west he's been cheated
[03:16:41.400 --> 03:16:46.920]  now they have had generals in congress as you know two days ago say yes we're getting ready for a
[03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:52.040]  ground invasion but it's going to be humanitarian i've confirmed it uh from first a letter i got
[03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:57.080]  from fordhood and we put out feelers to our sources over the telephone and callers that it was
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:02.360]  happening now it's pretty much admitted and it's the very grips we were told they've been told they
[03:17:02.360 --> 03:17:07.880]  are going in now that could be stopped but uh talking to all the military statisticians talking to
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:14.280]  you know military affairs reporter uh previously before he did national security wane madson
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:19.720]  who just returned from libya and he's been there before uh qaddafi has bought especially from the
[03:17:19.720 --> 03:17:25.160]  british incredibly high tech weapons he's just waiting and he's begging for the world to stop
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:31.640]  this this this naked aggression but when the u.s troops go in there um it is it it's going to
[03:17:31.640 --> 03:17:36.760]  probably a many are estimating going to be worse than iraq uh dealing with these six million people
[03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:44.120]  armed uh with grenade launchers rpgs and that's just the citizens qaddafi reportedly has very
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:49.800]  nasty anti tank weapons that he bought from france and england and the russians as well some of the
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:55.640]  latest stuff and these are small that one man uh can carry uh that are that are going to just
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:18:02.520]  that are reportedly du tip so they're not going to be fighting just iraqis with ak-47s uh and uh
[03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:06.600]  even if they try to go door to door kicking indoors to confiscate the guns house to house
[03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:11.640]  if one percent of the six million population fights back that's hundreds of thousands of combatants
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:19.000]  uh this this could make uh this could make uh iwo jima in places like that uh look like a picnic
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:25.320]  it's an active incalculable folly if they do it and above all the the really terrible thing
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:30.680]  about it is out of all the places in the middle east this this is a population that wants economic
[03:18:30.680 --> 03:18:37.400]  development they're not interested in uh you know the more benighted forms of islamic fundamentalism
[03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:44.040]  it's a secular state uh it's based on economic development they they have this political system
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:49.960]  which they will describe as the equivalent of a new england town meeting and the globalists hate that
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:54.360]  they'll every time they get in charge they do put the muslim extremists in i mean i mean look
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:59.320]  at what they do in every country this is incredible when and again i think i told you think the roman
[03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:04.040]  catholic bishop is concerned about what what might happen to them to the uh the catholics here
[03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:08.360]  there are a lot of filipino guest workers a lot of them a catholic so the there's a lot of social
[03:19:08.360 --> 03:19:14.280]  services from the bishop of trippoli Giovanni martinelli and he um you know he's concerned about
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:19.720]  the the islamic fundamentalists coming in here and uh what you'll hear from the libyan government
[03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:25.080]  i think is very important for people to bear in mind there is an alliance between the cia and the
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:29.560]  muslim brotherhood and the muslim brotherhood are the benighted ones those are the backward
[03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:36.040]  uh opponents of uh of modern civilization uh in the middle east in general according to people
[03:19:36.040 --> 03:19:44.760]  that i've uh talked to here are various uh nations uh you've got the iranian networks the pro roughs
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:50.040]  the pro akhmedinijad networks stay there yeah let's break down the factions from trippoli with

[03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:09.560]  is huge news so this really shows how evil this government is and now it's turning out that pistol
[03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:17.480]  pistoli is lying about them not telling her to um take the diaper off playing these word games of

[03:25:23.320 --> 03:25:31.400]  say take the diaper off you know all these word games twisting the meanings playing games um
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:36.840]  just incredible meanwhile they're throwing the book at people army vet in jail after
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:44.520]  marking wrong box on passenger application uh also the drudge report just updated washington post
[03:25:44.520 --> 03:25:51.240]  white house chief for sale obama court's big donors and obama is doing white house fundraisers
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:55.960]  in the white house which is illegal uh webstrand don't mean to get off another issues but oh you
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:59.080]  got to stay longer now because i promise to go to calls for you so hopefully you can stay in the next
[03:25:59.080 --> 03:26:05.000]  segment this is a short one sure it's like a time warp on this show with but it's just government
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:10.120]  at every level just just doesn't care about the law anymore and that always i guess happens when
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:18.360]  you go into these degenerate phases well i mean certainly one one thing you see here is just an
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:23.880] archy right you've you've got on the one side you've got a government which is functioning
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:29.960]  on the whole rather well given the circumstances on the other hand in vanghazi you've got you know
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:35.960]  35 factions and and then you know they they're trying to get each faction is trying to get nato to
[03:26:35.960 --> 03:26:41.800]  bomb the other faction by inciting in false reports to nato and then you've got in the world
[03:26:41.800 --> 03:26:45.640]  right at the level of the u n you got total don't want to be there because there is this
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:50.920]  un charter it does say the only way that they can apply military force is supposed to be
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:56.200]  for threats to international peace and security and not anything to do with the internal affairs
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:27:01.400]  of sovereign states so they basically trampled that so the security council has violated the
[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:07.960]  charter and then there's the problem with that whole system that there's no mechanism to you know
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:14.680]  to strike down and uh what you'd call an unconstitutional decision by the by the by the
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:20.280]  the security council so this a lot of people here say get out of the u n right get create a
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:25.880]  parallel institution or just get out of it uh the the prestige of the u n could hardly be
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:31.160]  at a lower point than it is here what about the no bell committee i mean it'd be like giving hitler
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:36.040]  stall and now they'll be surprised yeah i mean or maybe some of them are going to resign or maybe
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:40.280]  i don't know maybe some of them will will do something to draw the consequences of their
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:44.280]  of their idiocy the other thing though is remember when you're in a world depression
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:51.560]  and we are then that's when you know respectful law breaks down look at the 1930s depression leads
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:58.440]  to dictatorship and uh and the you know the domination of of you know unbridled caprice
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:05.080]  and unbridled willfulness by some you know powerful dictator or other figure and then that
[03:28:05.080 --> 03:28:07.880]  leads to world war so we're stuck right in the middle of that right now
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:13.960]  well it looks like they're planning to go home with the ground forces they're hoping they can
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:20.520]  assassinate the qaddafi but obviously he's scurrying around the different warrens so the
[03:28:20.520 --> 03:28:24.760]  he's good at hiding doesn't look like that's going to work too well this is someone again who has
[03:28:24.760 --> 03:28:34.360]  survived for uh 42 years in a hot corner right and there have been you know more assassination
[03:28:34.360 --> 03:28:39.800]  attempts than you can count right reagan tried to kill him with an air raid in 1985 killed his
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:48.120]  daughter the british gave 100 000 pounds to an al-qaeda group in 1995 96 tried to kill him didn't
[03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:55.880]  get him killed some civilians and it just goes on and and on and uh now we've got this terror the
[03:28:55.880 --> 03:29:01.080]  terror that uh the arrow that flyeth by day and the terror that stalketh by night and the terror
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:07.960]  that stalketh by night around here is the nato bombing which has been contained but uh uh terry
[03:29:07.960 --> 03:29:13.640]  maysal was on the rate on the television here last night and uh obviously nato nato didn't like
[03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:18.200]  what he was saying is they went and bombed one of the relay towers of the television signal
[03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:25.160]  and again tell folks who that is for those that don't know terry maysal is one of the first people
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:30.200]  in the world to say that there was no bowing at the pentagon that was in terms of 9 11 truth
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:38.840]  he's one of one of the first right uh very early on uh talking about wow he is he he is he is inside

[03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:32.600]  all right my friends we are back live and i want to go to your phone calls for webster griffin
[03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:38.120]  tarpley but uh webster any other things that you can report to us that you think are very important
[03:33:38.120 --> 03:33:49.160]  from tripoli uh and uh where you see this going well i i think we pretty much covered it the the
[03:33:50.600 --> 03:33:57.560]  the the determination here is very great and they they they think they're winning and uh
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:02.920]  they're fiercely proud of the fact that they've stood up to the nato bombing for quite a bit
[03:34:02.920 --> 03:34:10.120]  longer than Serbia and there's also been a a ground war going on so again looking at those
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  assault rifles and those rpg's and that tribal structure i think it's the last place in the
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:22.360]  world anybody in his right mind would want to invade and i i sincerely hope that this won't
[03:34:23.080 --> 03:34:27.160]  happen and again i would urge people get get busy if the congressman is going to be around for one
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:32.840]  of these uh fourth of july recess town meetings get in there and say this has to end this is a
[03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:40.600]  this is a crime against humanity this is savage barbarity and uh it it's uh it you mean it's
[03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:48.360]  you mean it's a peace prize humanitarian aid mission yeah right all right and and that guy of
[03:34:48.360 --> 03:34:53.720]  course uh he's impeachable for a number of reasons but one of the one of the ones in the first rank
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:34:59.320]  is violating the war powers act i'm sorry that's a public law president shall take care that the

[03:35:19.800 --> 03:35:26.040]  no i don't think so i'm just uh you know i'm i'm a um an observer of you know a foreign reporter
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:30.440]  no no i know i'm joking but i can i can see you like the uh you know but
[03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:35.560]  brigades in the spanish civil war tarply out there with a helmet on
[03:35:38.040 --> 03:35:43.640]  no i'm i'm not a combatant in any way i'm just a uh a commentator i understand that and well
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:47.640]  you've got a lot of courage you know you were privately and i've been invited by some aid groups
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:53.400]  and media groups previously um synthia mckinney and did and others to go like i was invited to go with
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:36:03.160]  her uh to trepole and i have to say um it's not even of so much as a fearful thing i i fear more
[03:36:03.880 --> 03:36:11.960]  bed bugs in a tunisian airport and the cigarette smoke uh then i fear uh you know being shot down
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:17.080]  in an aircraft or being killed in a bombardment i actually actually fear going through customs
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:23.640]  when i come back more than i uh i just you know what i hate air travel these days uh but i'm tempted
[03:36:23.640 --> 03:36:29.080]  to go over there just i'm told north africa is beautiful in its own mysterious way this is
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:36.040]  this is the the golden south here right this is the the Mediterranean and all of its splendor
[03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:42.680]  there are these beautiful trees with red flowers on them they look at the uh the port of triple
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:36:49.560]  leave is basin that they've got it in the afternoon it turns silver and gold with the Mediterranean
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:56.440]  sun palm trees everywhere it's not humid it's uh the temperatures have been i would say moderate
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:04.680]  sort of in the 70s to 80s uh and again a very modern city and uh i get i'm amazed that there's
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:10.840]  not animus against the nato uh current foreigners coming from nato state because with what they
[03:37:10.840 --> 03:37:16.840]  these nato guys have done to libya you'd think that foreigners would be getting lynched but there's
[03:37:16.840 --> 03:37:23.080]  not even the breath of this there's a desire to have have people come i mean you would be
[03:37:23.080 --> 03:37:28.520]  extremely welcome i think it would be uh no it sounds like they're pretty dated it sounds like
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:35.800]  they're pretty sophisticated yeah they are these are uh highly educated people uh there was a whole
[03:37:35.800 --> 03:37:41.880]  program of sending people to europe to the united states to australia to malaysia to all kinds of
[03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:48.840]  places to build up an educated working population of you know people who can contribute and you
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:56.200]  really see the benefit the uh the uh the people who are who are in in the top positions uh you
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:03.320]  know date back to the to the late 60s and 70s but their their children and the other sort of younger
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:09.000]  age cohorts they're all people with uh you know they've all got you know degrees from from this or
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:15.560]  that u.s or european university you know you can pick french or italian or english or all of those
[03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:22.760]  are going to get you just about anything you need wow and meanwhile we're told that it's another
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:27.640]  evil middle eastern group that has to be destroyed yeah again and the people that you're supposed
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:33.880]  to support are indeed these characters with the beard the benighted ones whose favorite occupation
[03:38:33.880 --> 03:38:39.320]  was setting the roadside bombs in in afghanistan and iraq and of course when they were in iraq they
[03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:47.480]  were killing more iraqis than us but they killed quite a few u.s troops also but we're told al-qaeda
[03:38:47.480 --> 03:38:52.040]  is now good i mean we're not going to agree with that but that's because we're on american uh let's
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:58.360]  let's let's take a few calls for webster griffin tarply tarply dot net uh let's talk to jack and
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:05.720]  pennsylvania jack here on the year hello um i have a question for webster um do you think you
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:10.040]  recently you just said that there's no animus towards the foreigners do you think this has
[03:39:10.040 --> 03:39:14.680]  anything to do with uh like water fluoridation programs or anything that are going on the
[03:39:14.680 --> 03:39:19.560]  middle east because i and i have no no idea about any of that it i think it's just that this is a very
[03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:25.480]  very educated and civilized population and they've they've had the benefits of progress right they went
[03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:31.320]  from the again the very lowest rung of the of the sort of international statistics to being
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:36.680]  where they are now which is they are the most educated most developed population in africa
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:42.200]  bar none and somehow that's that's a crime and and how you can accuse a government that's done that
[03:39:42.200 --> 03:39:48.360]  of having no merit you know and they have to have to go i just makes no sense it's more welly and
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:56.360]  it is or welly and jack anything else uh no i just want to say you're a big fan alex keep doing

[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:36.200]  ran into alex jones learned about du and uh september the 11th uh and i've been a truth seeker
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:42.680]  for just about my entire life uh my thing and i'm i'm sorry i'm a little nervous because it's
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:47.320]  hard to get a hold of it i'm so glad the word and the message and you have a lot of callers but um
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:56.760]  my point is um uh where's the christian voice and uh all these beautiful souls overseas being killed
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:41:04.680]  by these uh wendy i want to cut but wendy's little drones that are just being sent everywhere like a
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:13.880]  they're flown by cowards and uh what kind of way is that to fight a war uh we have let's see why can't
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:20.520]  people see the same people who created these derivatives uh the state derivatives and sold them
[03:41:20.520 --> 03:41:25.400]  all over the world they're going to bring the drones here that's the way it's going to work
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:33.320]  it's not going to stop over there it's coming here why can't people see what's going on well this
[03:41:33.320 --> 03:41:38.600]  was the first big issue in world war one because now people are just killing each other in mass
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:44.760]  there was zero chivalry uh involved and then world war two the dropping of bombs on civilians as
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:51.560]  targets and uh both sides doing it and and then now today uh you have people thousands of miles
[03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:57.160]  away in an office park flying drones you know going in and killing men women and children and calling
[03:41:57.160 --> 03:42:05.480]  it uh humanitarian uh more and more as we become removed from the war through the uh technological
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:15.000]  you know apparatus uh it allows more and more of a delusional oh this is peace uh and because
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:21.560]  people aren't seeing the sausage uh being made and i think it it shows the we have been such a
[03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:27.240]  wealthy society that we've become decadent and slob like uh in one group other people are working
[03:42:27.240 --> 03:42:33.160]  harder than ever as the economy begins to unravel and so you kind of have those two worlds colliding
[03:42:33.160 --> 03:42:37.800]  and you know most americans don't have passports they've never traveled we kind of live in our own
[03:42:37.800 --> 03:42:44.200]  bubble here uh and i think that's what's happening i appreciate your call jim uh any uh comments on
[03:42:44.200 --> 03:42:50.840]  that uh web sir well the voice of christianity here is the roman catholic bishop who you know
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:56.680]  points out that you can't have christianity and bombs these don't mix sorry to anybody who thinks
[03:42:56.680 --> 03:43:03.880]  they do uh you know that was the prince of peace and that uh under qaddafi uh say what they will
[03:43:03.880 --> 03:43:10.120]  there is uh total religious freedom and actually a very tranquil religious situation this country
[03:43:10.120 --> 03:43:19.000]  is 99 percent sunni muslim and uh this is not an issue and the government is you know respects
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:28.280]  religion but is not based on any any uh you know religious spaces not a theocracy this is a secular
[03:43:28.280 --> 03:43:36.600]  state let's talk to chance in indiana you're on the air go ahead hey how you guys doing good um
[03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:41.880]  alex want to say good job yesterday at the state capitol i watched the guys online thank you thank
[03:43:41.880 --> 03:43:48.840]  uh guys did an excellent job uh real quick couple things um about libya i wanted to uh let you and
[03:43:48.840 --> 03:43:52.920]  your viewers know reaffirm more you guys are talking about whether we are aren't going to libya it's
[03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:59.400]  kind of confirmed now um i recently had it confirmed to me through a family member that he is
[03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:06.600]  um going to a training uh you know like a two week training thing within the united states and then
[03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:11.560]  he is going to libya so i just more to more reaffirm that there are reports out there and other
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:19.880]  stuff to forthood and stuff um and then second for uh dr tarpley i just wanted to uh end you out
[03:44:19.880 --> 03:44:25.560]  so i wanted to ask both of you uh real quick what you would what do you think the best thing for
[03:44:26.520 --> 03:44:34.200]  the common person you know such as myself to do as far as affecting uh local you know federal
[03:44:34.200 --> 03:44:40.840]  legislation to to get us out of of uh you know libya and any other countries that we just have
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:46.840]  no business in it well webster talks about will any what 40 or so votes to get the votes you ship
[03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:54.280]  30 votes in the house and you've passed the uh the bill to cut off the funds now that doesn't
[03:44:54.840 --> 03:45:00.920]  you know there's still the senate right and then there's still obama but uh what obama is doing
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:05.400]  right now is he's he's you he's bootlegging money in other words there's money lying around in the
[03:45:05.400 --> 03:45:13.720]  pentagon and they they redirect it which really is illegal but um i i don't what mean to say that
[03:45:13.720 --> 03:45:20.280]  that having this uh funding cut off past the house would be the end of it it probably wouldn't
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:27.480]  because obama would keep you know squirming and and uh lying and and whatever but uh it would be a
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:33.400]  big step and 30 votes now some people are going to be interested in the fact that that the rebels
[03:45:33.400 --> 03:45:37.960]  are from al-qaeda other people are going to be interested in the fact that black africans and
[03:45:37.960 --> 03:45:44.360]  black libyans are getting preferentially massacred by these people in Benghazi and uh you know there
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:50.040]  some other people may have just humanitarian concerns there are still such people but um
[03:45:50.040 --> 03:45:56.760]  shift 30 votes and make that a project for the for the fourth of july uh recess because this
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:46:02.920]  stuff has got to end somewhere right if the u.s is simply just on a on this rampage through the world
[03:46:02.920 --> 03:46:08.840]  right it eventually you're going to collide with some large thing that resists and can defend itself
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:14.520]  be it russia or china or iran or whatever it is so the quicker we end this stuff the better it is
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:21.560]  and the the uh political calculation is that you know 180 votes in the house to cut off money
[03:46:21.560 --> 03:46:26.600]  for a war in the middle of the war that's unprecedented that's the best result of that
[03:46:26.600 --> 03:46:31.880]  kind that i've seen in my lifetime they can't say that you're you're cutting off the money to the
[03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:36.440]  troops in arms way because obama has guaranteed that there are no troops in arms way well there
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:41.320]  really are but we'll take him at his word there are no troops in arms way so there's no political
[03:46:41.320 --> 03:46:46.760]  price to be paid for cutting off the funding so cut off the funding dear congressman cut off the
[03:46:46.760 --> 03:46:53.480]  funding and if obama persists the one thing that the house can do if he just says i'm just going
[03:46:53.480 --> 03:46:59.480]  to ignore you and keep spending because i i can stop this in the senate well what the house can do
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:07.400]  is impeach him so impeach him uh i i appreciate your call caller if you got any other comments
[03:47:07.400 --> 03:47:13.720]  i'd like to hear before we go to keith but look this is how the psychology works especially with
[03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:20.840]  a country like the united states that is taken on preemptive war as part of our macho uh identity
[03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:26.680]  i mean it's the opposite of what this country was founded on but once we're committed and once the
[03:47:26.680 --> 03:47:31.560]  u.s troops start dying the social engineers know the opposite's going to happen there there isn't
[03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:37.400]  going to be more calls for pulling out it's going to suddenly be we've got to hang that guy kadafi
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:43.640]  and then they'll say that they're you know raping easter bunnies with elves you know attending and
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:50.200]  that sea serpents were seen involved with it you know so so so they'll make up some ridiculous
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:56.360]  story of baby incubators you know santa claus things like that um and that's why they want to
[03:47:56.360 --> 03:48:00.920]  go ahead and just get in place get it ready get the intel move the troops in and say this is not
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:08.760]  a war he killed our humanitarian troops rolling in on abram's tanks uh and uh it's just it's just
[03:48:08.760 --> 03:48:18.360]  incredibly cold-blooded uh webster any comments on that webster tarple can you hear me sorry i missed
[03:48:18.360 --> 03:48:22.760]  the last part well no i mean they know once they get ground troops in there that then will people

[03:48:58.600 --> 03:49:03.720]  playing doppelgast and some interesting stuff i found about form for the future the three groups
[03:49:03.720 --> 03:49:07.880]  that are heading up the campaign that produced some of these films out there yeah webster that's
[03:49:07.880 --> 03:49:14.040]  these malthusian films they show kids that actually show an incredible tyranny where you can't travel
[03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:19.960]  you don't get meat everything's surveilled the there's basically families don't exist and they
[03:49:19.960 --> 03:49:26.520]  show it with straight faces to children and now uh they're expanding into maryland where you live
[03:49:26.520 --> 03:49:31.960]  ads environmental literacy in high schools everything has political correctness everything
[03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:39.320]  is uh flogging humanity teaching teaching you to hate humanity and that carbon is evil uh
[03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:44.840]  and and now maryland schools they'll be even less time uh in california is moving to get rid of
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:50.120]  homework uh so there can be more time for the kids to watch television to be programmed that way

[03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:05.960]  the christmas day underwear bomber that was the thing that pushed the the whole system into the
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:11.560]  body scanners and you remember the eager lobbying of michael chartoff the former head of homeland
[03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:16.920]  security who was out there as a as a paid lobbyist but doing commentaries on all the television
[03:55:16.920 --> 03:55:23.160]  networks and and and of course we didn't need body scanners did we we needed a mold detector at the
[03:55:23.160 --> 03:55:31.640]  fbi and the cia to find out who were the which federal agency was the one that said no mutala
[03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:36.440]  is going to keep that visa we've got eyes on him he's going to lead us to the big fish that was
[03:55:36.440 --> 03:55:41.400]  that interagency meeting with the state department of these claimed later and this was uh i guess
[03:55:41.400 --> 03:55:46.280]  under secretary of state kennedy that the state department wanted to pull this visa which would
[03:55:46.280 --> 03:55:53.560]  have kept him off the plane and some other federal agency uh said no no no they said intelligence
[03:55:53.560 --> 03:55:59.960]  agency yeah help get him on the plane jumping back to calls uh lily uh in france here on the
[03:55:59.960 --> 03:56:05.320]  air with webster griffin tarpley go ahead yeah thank you alex for taking my call i know you're
[03:56:05.320 --> 03:56:13.560]  really busy busy there many headquarters um yeah i've noticed uh across the street over there in
[03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:20.920]  pakistan iran afghanistan that they had a meeting last week ended iran uh president from pakistan
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:27.320]  and karzai and they've all agreed to uh get together and not allow the americans to set up
[03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:34.040]  their bases there till 2017 has webster heard anything about that at all or yeah webster what
[03:56:34.040 --> 03:56:39.560]  she's saying is in the news so the whole world is lining up now against uh the u.s england and
[03:56:39.560 --> 03:56:46.360]  europe and as you know pakistan has run to china uh and so is saudi arabia with russia go ahead
[03:56:46.360 --> 03:56:51.720]  webster i'm i'm afraid i'm not as well informed as i usually like to be just because of the the
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:56.680]  difficulty here we had a couple of days when the internet was down completely because of the
[03:56:56.680 --> 03:57:02.600]  wonderful uh nato contributions to democracy playing havoc with the with the internet here
[03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:08.840]  and and even telephone's difficult in some areas but uh it's it's bounced back so i i would just
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:15.640]  say that the general idea is that uh karzai whatever he is of afghanistan he's he's you know
[03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:21.560]  looking to china and russia for his future and pakistan of course to china and perhaps also to
[03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:30.120]  to some others and uh iran i've been i've been discussing akhba dinnerjad of iran and it turns
[03:57:30.120 --> 03:57:37.240]  out that he is the uh the industrial military scientific complex of of iran it'd be sort of
[03:57:37.880 --> 03:57:42.840]  you know modernizing side remember he's a military guy comes from the revolutionary guard
[03:57:43.560 --> 03:57:50.360]  and against him you've got rap son johnny who is corruption personified who supposedly has got
[03:57:50.360 --> 03:57:58.200]  tremendous amounts of money stashed away in the u.s and europe so um better rob better uh akhba
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:03.160]  dinnerjad than the mullahs i guess that's the bottom line well there you go again being a muslim extremist
[03:58:04.120 --> 03:58:09.000]  you don't support al-qaeda and you don't support the mullahs you're a bad guy you would be pro america
