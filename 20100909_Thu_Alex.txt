[00:00.000 --> 00:15.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:15.720 --> 00:23.880]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well he's the former head of the Green
[00:23.880 --> 00:30.600]  Party in England championship goalie international BBC presenter multi-time best-selling author and
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.120]  somebody who's really expanded people's paradigms and got them to look into a lot of very interesting
[00:36.120 --> 00:41.720]  places and so much of what David I predicted more than 15 years ago unfortunately has unfolded I
[00:41.720 --> 00:47.760]  agree with him that we're on the verge of a world transformation an awakening the system is panicking
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.960]  with divide and conquer there's no doubt they blew the oil well there's no doubt they're now
[00:51.960 --> 00:56.760]  admitting we're going into a depression trying to start world war three they know they're losing
[00:56.760 --> 01:01.320]  control and let me tell you this is the most important time in human history up to this point
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.320]  he's with us for the next hour David Ike thank you for being on with us well we were just talking
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.280]  during that one-minute break and and you were saying that you do believe this is the quickening
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.760]  or the beginning of the acceleration of a real paradigm shift there's a lot of issues I want to
[01:16.760 --> 01:23.000]  go over but what's on David Ike's radar screen that you think is most important right now well I
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.320]  think you know what we're seeing on the surface horrendous as it is is a manifestation of something
[01:29.320 --> 01:36.040]  that's actually much much deeper than this there's no doubt whatsoever I mean I've seen it so blatantly
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.080]  over the last 20 years gathering pace and gathering pace there is an awakening going on it's not the
[01:41.080 --> 01:47.480]  majority yet but minds are opening now as minds are opening they're seeing what they couldn't
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.160]  see before and what the cabal wants to do is keep those minds at shot and one of the most
[01:53.160 --> 01:58.280]  effective ways of doing this is why we've got to stay really strong and focused in this period
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.280]  we're going through now there's going to be a number of years of major challenges the way that
[02:04.280 --> 02:11.000]  they are seeking to keep us from awakening to keep our minds closed is to keep us focused
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.440]  on fear keep us focused on survival keep us bewildered keep us in a state of constant anxiety
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.800]  about what's happening what about the future what about the kids what about the job the way of life
[02:23.800 --> 02:29.480]  and the gulf has gone oh my goodness a war in Iraq in Iran now what's going on but now there's
[02:29.480 --> 02:37.240]  an economic depression oh my this is all orchestrated to throw everything not just the kitchen thing
[02:37.240 --> 02:45.480]  but the plug as well at humanity in general so that we are so focused on on survival and
[02:45.480 --> 02:52.520]  fear and anxiety that we don't go and continue this process of awakening so we can actually
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.600]  expand our minds to see what the closed minds before could not see it's a battle for our minds
[02:58.600 --> 03:06.920]  it may not seem like that it may seem like it's it's just another manufactured catastrophe in
[03:06.920 --> 03:13.480]  the Gulf another war in Iran another economic collapse but all these things are orchestrated
[03:14.040 --> 03:22.760]  to to to fire at our minds and and our minds are the target because from our state of perception
[03:22.760 --> 03:28.520]  of self in the world comes our behavior and our actions that's right i've noticed the globalists
[03:28.520 --> 03:34.280]  dominate by just getting our attention and always creating new crisis so we watch the
[03:34.280 --> 03:39.720]  mainstream television so we pay attention to them and they dominate how we dress and what we think
[03:39.720 --> 03:47.880]  and what we eat and and and just literally get us sucked into this false tapestry this false
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.840]  reality that they are projecting and now they're openly saying they want to start shutting off
[03:52.840 --> 03:57.800]  the web which shows that they realize they wanted to use it as a tool of domination but that it's
[03:57.800 --> 04:04.920]  backfiring against them that's the word alex attention it's a battle for our attention because
[04:06.280 --> 04:15.960]  the idea is to hold humanity in a state where we are filtering and seeing ourselves in the world
[04:15.960 --> 04:22.840]  only through the five senses we are multi um dimensional consciousness awareness we are
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.120]  far far greater than what we appear to be when we look in the mirror and say that's david icall
[04:28.120 --> 04:35.960]  that's alex jones or that's um ethos smith and what they want us to do is is is keep our attention
[04:35.960 --> 04:42.360]  on the five senses and that's what we do when we are in fear when we are in anxiety when we're
[04:42.360 --> 04:48.920]  worrying about the future when we have this um sense of fear of not surviving that pulls us into
[04:48.920 --> 04:54.040]  the five senses and that's what they try to do and then the system poses as the saviors and says
[04:54.040 --> 04:58.920]  we'll keep you safe just let us run your life stay there david icke back in three minutes a lot of

[07:15.480 --> 07:20.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[07:20.760 --> 07:25.720]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[07:25.720 --> 07:30.840]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[07:35.560 --> 07:40.440]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[07:40.440 --> 07:44.040]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[08:09.800 --> 08:15.800]  gcn radio network well we've got david ike with us for the rest of the hour if you just joined us
[08:15.800 --> 08:21.640]  former head of the uk green party champion golly a bbc presenter bestselling author
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.560]  and always interested to get his perspective on things i always find it thought-provoking and uh
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.440]  very uh apropos what's happening in our world we always find his perspective to be enlightening
[08:35.160 --> 08:40.920]  david uh instead of us getting into you know generalities or uh you know myself getting
[08:40.920 --> 08:46.120]  into you know long diatribes about my view of what's happening today i really want to try to sit back
[08:46.120 --> 08:49.320]  we'll see if i can do it because you bring up so many points that make me want to chime in
[08:49.320 --> 08:56.680]  and just throw out questions and get your take on it uh the globalist uh are overrunning the west
[08:56.680 --> 09:06.520]  with third world populations uh why are they doing this well it's two two things uh we need to know
[09:06.520 --> 09:11.720]  to get a perspective on the world is where this cabal wants to take the world and the then the
[09:11.720 --> 09:17.080]  methods they use to take us there and where they want to take the world of course as we well know
[09:17.080 --> 09:25.480]  is to a global um fascist dictatorship with the end of countries the end of borders um where
[09:25.480 --> 09:30.440]  basically you just have the world government dictating to massive regional blocks and anything
[09:30.440 --> 09:39.160]  below that is just irrelevant and one of the great barriers um to that happening is the people's
[09:39.160 --> 09:47.640]  sense of their own culture their own country um their own sovereign nation if you like and because
[09:47.640 --> 09:53.960]  people if they have a real sense of of of country and you know i i'm not saying that i'm into all
[09:53.960 --> 10:01.000]  this but a lot of people are and this is the point from the cabal's point of view um they will resist
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.720]  giving that power away say from the united states to the north american union in in britain to the
[10:07.720 --> 10:15.800]  european union and so the idea is to break down that sense of culture by basically breaking down
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.560]  the culture and you do that by opening borders to other cultures now i'm not saying one culture is
[10:21.560 --> 10:25.640]  better than another i'm just trying to explain here what they're doing from their perspective
[10:25.640 --> 10:32.920]  and that you let um different cultures pour into into the same area and suddenly it becomes a cocktail
[10:32.920 --> 10:39.080]  and there is no single culture anymore that people can identify with and that is all the time
[10:40.200 --> 10:48.280]  loosening and weakening people's sense of need to resist the uh giving away of sovereignty to to
[10:48.280 --> 10:53.000]  unions and to a world government because they've lost the sense of culture that they had before
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.200]  this is why what we're talking about here is happening all over the world because of course
[10:58.200 --> 11:04.520]  it's a global agenda in europe the european union has brought down the borders all over europe and
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.800]  every time another country comes into the european union their borders come down and and their the
[11:09.800 --> 11:15.480]  borders between them and every other country comes down and so from uh eastern europe for instance
[11:15.480 --> 11:21.880]  people pour into western european countries and it becomes again exactly the same thing a cocktail
[11:21.880 --> 11:27.560]  of uh cultures which eventually becomes just nothing that really is something people can
[11:27.560 --> 11:32.440]  identify and the globalists can also play those different groups off against each other not only
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.760]  will they give up their rights but then i see the trendies always counter back oh well it's
[11:36.760 --> 11:41.480]  like star trek which we know is predictive programming uh oh you know we'll all be unified
[11:41.480 --> 11:47.800]  in love but this isn't some loving world government that we decided to lovingly join this was covertly
[11:47.800 --> 11:54.360]  built they now admit it was a covertly built and it's authoritarian dehumanizing and it's admitted
[11:54.360 --> 12:00.840]  in game is global depopulation yeah exactly and this is a very very interesting point a very important
[12:00.840 --> 12:08.200]  point about uh playing one off against the other you know the the people that pour uh it from from
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.040]  the uh the poorer countries into the richer countries uh through through the the borders
[12:14.040 --> 12:20.680]  coming down so just as much um pawns in this game as those in the countries of the indigenous
[12:20.680 --> 12:27.240]  population that are affected by that it's not good guys and bad guys we're talking about here it's
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.400]  it's different aspects of the human race being used as pawns in the same game and this is why
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.920]  instead of fighting each other we need to start uh looking at what uh unites us all which is the
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.680]  fact that we're all the target of this this cabal this this global fascist dictatorship in the
[12:44.680 --> 12:51.080]  in the making of the very fast making i mean we have proof in this country um a few um months ago
[12:51.080 --> 12:59.000]  now but during the um the Blair administration they were allowing people um immigration into
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.520]  Britain on a scale they weren't admitting to it came out one of the people involved uh
[13:04.520 --> 13:11.480]  blew blew the whistle on this and um what they were actually saying is they wanted to um have
[13:11.480 --> 13:18.680]  so much immigration into Britain that it would this is the quote change British society forever
[13:18.680 --> 13:24.600]  and in that one quote we have the prime reason for bringing the borders down this is what they've
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.480]  done in Europe i mean the government here now the new government of Cameron saying oh we must we
[13:29.480 --> 13:37.720]  must slow down immigration into Britain but they don't say immigration they say non EU immigration
[13:37.720 --> 13:44.600]  because they have absolutely no power whatsoever because of the European Union laws now and and
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.680]  the giving away of sovereignty to stop um anybody coming in from the European Union into Britain
[13:50.680 --> 13:55.240]  and that's exactly the position they want they're doing the same in America of course is listeners
[13:55.240 --> 14:00.360]  to this program will well know and so anyone that the challenge is this in in America for instance
[14:00.360 --> 14:04.440]  they're called racist and and they're they're targeted by the federal government as we're seeing
[14:04.440 --> 14:09.960]  in uh uh some some states of America have tried to try to make a stand on this and it's all
[14:09.960 --> 14:17.240]  orchestrated to break down and destroy a sense of what is it what is America of what is Britain
[14:17.240 --> 14:22.120]  uh what is all these countries that are targeted and like i say this is not an attack on what we
[14:22.120 --> 14:28.520]  call immigrants it's absolutely not because they are as much um pawns in this game as anybody else
[14:28.520 --> 14:34.120]  and david let me just add a brief caveat to that absolutely i mean it's simple whatever the global
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.080]  is for whatever they're really promoting in their councils we've got to be against if they're against
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.560]  disarming us it doesn't mean there aren't some accidents and problems with having an armed society
[14:43.560 --> 14:49.000]  we've still got to be for it uh if they're trying to socialize health care you get the legislation
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.960]  it's a it's a eugenics takeover lowering the quality raising taxes we've got to be against it
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.520]  they want to launch a new war we've got to be against it they want open borders we've got to
[14:58.520 --> 15:04.200]  be against it i mean it's very simple we know these are evil anti-human anti-freedom people
[15:04.200 --> 15:10.120]  and we must stand against everything they stand for now we can intellectualize and then always go
[15:10.120 --> 15:15.000]  down the road and look at why that's the case but their interests are not the interest of free
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.600]  humanity so it's very elementary for me that's a very very good point um let's get it real straight
[15:22.600 --> 15:30.280]  these people not only don't care about us they are uh antagonistic uh towards us they want to
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.640]  destroy the human race and bring it under the heel of their global fascist dictatorship they
[15:35.640 --> 15:41.640]  want to irrevocably change what humans are in our society the family everything till we are just empty
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.160]  biological androids and their words that they program this is the end of humanity this is the
[15:47.160 --> 15:52.840]  extinction of humanity is their stated goal in every document i've got by their transhumanist
[15:52.840 --> 16:00.120]  futurist these are human hating scum this is what we're dealing with and therefore as you quite
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.800]  rightly say if they're for it then it's bad for the human race and and we've got to be a bit more
[16:05.800 --> 16:12.600]  kind of uh streetwise about this and and and not see everything um in black and white the the
[16:12.600 --> 16:18.600]  question of gun ownership i've never had a gun i don't want a gun um i i i i i i don't want to use
[16:18.600 --> 16:24.520]  a gun i'm not into any of that stuff but a lot of people have guns in america the question uh that
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.560]  comes up is should people have guns or should people not have guns and that's a debate okay
[16:29.560 --> 16:35.320]  but it's not the debate but that they at heart what's happening now the question should be
[16:35.320 --> 16:42.920]  why do the people who have a deep um hatred but for humanity why do they want to disarm the american
[16:42.920 --> 16:48.360]  population now that's the key thing we ought to be looking at we can have these the debates about
[16:48.360 --> 16:55.720]  this and immigration the question is why does the cabal want to do it and the answer is always
[16:55.720 --> 17:01.640]  because it advances their agenda towards the global fascist dictatorship in which uh as you
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.760]  rightly say it won't just be an economic dictatorship a political dictatorship we're talking about a
[17:06.760 --> 17:14.920]  genetic dictatorship where they will um not only own our bodies and and have um uh literally
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.320]  lawful ownership on our bodies that's the way they're going but they will genetically
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.640]  control us and control us through microchips that's where they want to go and if we're going to get
[17:23.640 --> 17:29.560]  pulled away into diversions of debates about this and debates about that there's one debate at the
[17:29.560 --> 17:35.640]  moment until we've sorted this why do they want to do a b c and d and that's the question we need
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.920]  to keep asking all the time to keep uh uh on top of where we're going and we know what they want
[17:40.920 --> 17:46.600]  they're so arrogant that they all write white papers on government health care on the environment
[17:46.600 --> 17:52.440]  movement on cap and trade they admit it's the shutdown industry bankrupt everyone have a huge
[17:52.440 --> 17:57.880]  state that's the only thing that's funded that literally absorbs humanity and begins accelerating
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.040]  their soft kill operations we know they've already been introducing poisons into our environment
[18:02.680 --> 18:06.440]  and into the vaccines and foods we've caught them we've got countless documents where they admit
[18:06.440 --> 18:12.120]  they're doing it now they want to accelerate that up to a hot kill level like we've seen in areas of
[18:12.120 --> 18:18.840]  africa and uh thank god you're out there exposing these people well you know there are people that
[18:18.840 --> 18:24.280]  know there's a conspiracy there's people that know that there is a ridiculously few people
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.480]  who are pulling the strings of the world but um we've still got a lot of what long way to go with
[18:29.480 --> 18:36.040]  with a lot of people um to fully understand the scale of what we're dealing with the rabbit hole
[18:36.040 --> 18:43.960]  goes so deep it's staggering and uh we're not even uh dealing with just human entities we're dealing
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.200]  with non-human entities we're dealing with entities that operate outside the the field
[18:48.200 --> 18:53.080]  of vision of what we call visible light which uh which our eyes can see and appears to be
[18:53.800 --> 18:59.560]  this world there are other worlds um well david i'll say this to penetrate this one and and and
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.840]  and we that it's involving those two so this is really really deep stuff that we're we're dealing

[24:10.200 --> 24:16.280]  david ike is our guest so we got into the border issue and how they're overrunning sovereign
[24:16.280 --> 24:21.720]  nations because the globalists want to remake the world in their system so any culture whether it's
[24:21.720 --> 24:26.600]  good or bad they want it out of the way or the corporate culture this is a short segment let's
[24:26.600 --> 24:34.040]  get into the oil spill uh david ike the oil spill what's your research on that well the um
[24:34.040 --> 24:41.000]  um appalling things happening in the Gulf of Mexico now are a classic example of the the way
[24:41.000 --> 24:48.120]  the uh web the illuminati web um interfaces with uh different aspects of itself to create
[24:48.120 --> 24:55.160]  a coordinated uh policy and a coordinated agenda i mean you've got um someone for instance like
[24:55.160 --> 25:00.600]  peter d southerland uh who was a non-executive chairman of bt bp until a few months ago he's
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.920]  also non-executive chairman of goldman sex international he was the director of the world
[25:04.920 --> 25:10.360]  trade organization he was the director of uh actually actually uh the director general of
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.600]  the world trade organization he was a director of the bank of scotland uh in the run-up to the
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.520]  period where he crashed um in 2008 and had to be bailed out by the taxpayer he's on he's been on
[25:20.520 --> 25:24.680]  the steering committee of the builder group he's a chairman of the trial actual commission he's a
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.320]  chairman of the london school of economics one of the great illuminati universities on the planet
[25:29.320 --> 25:34.760]  created by the fabian society his financial advisor to the vatican brought up in a jesuit school the
[25:34.760 --> 25:39.960]  jesuits of course are a major major player in this global web he's been one of the major people in
[25:39.960 --> 25:45.320]  europe pressing for more and more power for the european uh union and um while he was
[25:46.200 --> 25:52.600]  non-executive chairman of bp you had a guy called lord brown who's uh who got out before the the
[25:52.600 --> 25:59.560]  stuff hit the fan over the gulf of mexico um he was so appalling as uh the executive chief executive
[25:59.560 --> 26:05.320]  of bp that tony blad described him as his favorite businessman so you can see how bad he was and it
[26:05.320 --> 26:14.040]  was lord brown who um instigated the policy at bp of cutting safety and cutting uh all uh they've
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.920]  got more violations in houston alone i saw the number it's like over a hundred times what other
[26:18.920 --> 26:24.920]  oil companies have combined and they're the top fake environmentalist company that with enron
[26:24.920 --> 26:29.960]  created the carbon tax scam with al gore exactly and this is this is how it all interfaces this is
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.720]  well how the how the web works you you see bp but it's not just bp bp is connected to goldman sacks
[26:35.720 --> 26:40.920]  goldman sacks is connected to halibut and so it goes on and don't forget queenie she owns a big part
[26:40.920 --> 26:47.960]  of it yeah lord lord lord brown um was um chief executive of bp when you had that massive explosion
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.560]  at the refinery in texas city which people of course were killed in it another environmental
[26:54.120 --> 26:59.880]  disaster in so many ways and and he instigated this bp policy not because they were struggling for
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.880]  money we must cut costs no because he wanted to expand and expand the profits of bp and one way
[27:05.880 --> 27:13.080]  he could do it was to was to cut costs so we cut costs on on on safety on checks and all the rest
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.120]  of it and that was that the sequence of events that eventually led to what happened in the gulf of
[27:18.120 --> 27:23.960]  mexico and then when you look at um goldman sacks again as i mentioned with p2d suberland
[27:23.960 --> 27:29.480]  that's selling 44 percent of its shares in bp in the run up to what happened in the gulf totally
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.920]  hayward the chief executive of bp that followed lord brown sold a lot of his shares in the run up
[27:34.920 --> 27:42.520]  over a third obama dumped his vanguard stocks in it they all dumped it's it's got so many red flags
[27:42.520 --> 27:50.280]  all over it um but it was a prior knowledge and and b that the thing was a disaster not waiting
[27:50.280 --> 27:56.600]  to happen the disaster was made to happen and then you you look at what happened after that and so
[27:56.600 --> 28:04.280]  many uh mysteries um kind of fade away when you know the story of what the goal is so the next
[28:04.280 --> 28:12.680]  mystery in all this is why the bp and the federal government clearly have no real interest in reacting
[28:12.680 --> 28:18.840]  to this uh disaster to to cleaning up the beaches to doing what is necessary why people countries
[28:18.840 --> 28:24.520]  would turn away when they offered help it's because they want this disaster to be as big as possible
[28:24.520 --> 28:31.720]  a yes to um offer solutions like uh the carbon tax and all the rest of it now they their climate
[28:31.720 --> 28:38.440]  change uh scam has been falling apart but also there is a war by this cabal against the united
[28:38.440 --> 28:44.680]  states they want to destroy the united states militarily but destroy it uh economically they
[28:44.680 --> 28:50.360]  want to destroy everything it stands for because that has to be brought under that under the heel
[28:50.360 --> 28:57.720]  of the global uh cabal um if the world government is to have total power no more superpowers otherwise
[28:57.720 --> 29:03.400]  you don't have total power you've got the 10 regions as the un says with the 10 global directors
[29:03.400 --> 29:07.320]  this has been on record since the 60s which they're now moving towards and that's what's so amazing
[29:07.320 --> 29:13.960]  they use the us as their henchmen as their funding mechanism while the us gets all the blame for the
[29:13.960 --> 29:19.240]  global imperial takeover and now as they get ready to destroy us they're moving towards devaluing
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.320]  the dollar the imf world bank or criticizing our monetary systems the un is posing as the savior
[29:25.320 --> 29:31.080]  with the global cashless currency so they use us for their dirty work and then flush us down the

[33:20.440 --> 33:25.960]  being forced to drive through x-rays that shoot through cars with gamma rays i mean this makes
[33:27.960 --> 33:33.320]  this makes chest x-rays look tame in comparison some of the units the car is driven up and then
[33:33.320 --> 33:39.000]  it scanned others that they drive the car through it and i guess they tell the foolish troops to do
[33:39.000 --> 33:44.440]  it oh it's okay go ahead and do it they're setting the precedent to literally microwave us in front
[33:44.440 --> 33:49.800]  of everyone uh well watson did research and he's got an amazing article here new york national
[33:49.800 --> 33:57.480]  guard involved in mass arrest of u.s citizens and we got links now to mainstream news in part two
[33:57.480 --> 34:03.000]  how great it is that the guard has arrested 2000 citizens for petty crimes including gun
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.240]  possession i mean this is martial law new york national guard involved in mass arrest of u.s
[34:09.240 --> 34:15.240]  citizens troops assist in over 2000 arrests last year alone as america sinks in a total martial law
[34:15.240 --> 34:18.840]  and the same things happening all over the country and that's why we saw the marist connectivity
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.360]  a few months ago call for martial law in that little sleepy town so we're going back to david
[34:24.360 --> 34:32.520]  i can a minute um don't forget we have made films like in game invisible empire a new order to find
[34:32.520 --> 34:37.640]  and of course the obama deception that go into who these bankers are how they're controlling society

[35:24.440 --> 35:30.120]  in a moment but david segueing from the oil where do you think that's going a and b the media is now
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.800]  shifted in europe as you know england and the u.s is saying okay it is a depression after telling us
[35:35.800 --> 35:41.560]  in a recovery now it's a depression what do you see unfolding with that leading into a possible
[35:41.560 --> 35:47.080]  strike on iran what do you see from studying the globalist behavior in the past which is
[35:47.080 --> 35:52.120]  psychopathic and and and they do it in patterns what do you see unfolding well on the gulf they
[35:52.120 --> 35:56.280]  wanted to get as bad as possible to so they can exploit it as much as possible with with
[35:57.160 --> 36:02.520]  solutions to to the problem they've created in terms of the the economic situation i've been
[36:02.520 --> 36:09.640]  saying since 2008 that there's there's a three-point plan here one was to crash the economy in 2008
[36:09.640 --> 36:16.840]  so people could see there was a major problem this um then justifies it doesn't really but uh in uh
[36:16.840 --> 36:23.400]  in their efforts to justify it they say it justifies uh a massive a staggering we we still don't
[36:23.400 --> 36:30.360]  understand the scale of the transfer of wealth from the population to the banks and the elite that
[36:30.360 --> 36:36.200]  has gone on as a result of this bank bailout i was reading the other day um an article about
[36:36.200 --> 36:41.080]  the fact that these toxic assets of these banks which the taxpayer money was supposed to have
[36:41.720 --> 36:48.440]  been paid over to uh to to sort out the banks still own the toxic assets but um from what this
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.560]  article was saying they don't have to appear on the balance sheet until they're sold so you've got
[36:53.560 --> 36:57.800]  a ticking time bomb there and you've got balance sheets that are being produced by banks that are
[36:57.800 --> 37:06.600]  absolutely nothing like the actual um financial state of that bank but the the second point in
[37:06.600 --> 37:13.080]  this three-stage plan that i was talking about this 2008 was to empty the coffers of governments
[37:13.080 --> 37:19.400]  in terms of reacting to the economic situation and we have reached that now i mean what we're
[37:19.400 --> 37:29.000]  having in britain is absolutely savage beyond belief uh cuts in public expenditure by by the
[37:29.000 --> 37:37.080]  government um to to react to the incredible debt that they've been uh but the taxes go up so so
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.520]  a larger percentage of the taxes goes directly to the bankers who were the ones that created the
[37:42.520 --> 37:49.000]  600 trillion conservatively uh in fake assets and and they won't tell congress or parliament where
[37:49.000 --> 37:56.360]  the money went exactly the same the same thing over here in europe in britain uh during the the
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.320]  brown uh labor government uh that was replaced recently this amazing transfer of wealth went
[38:03.320 --> 38:10.600]  from taxpayers to the the the banking system and uh and to to the cabal network in general
[38:10.600 --> 38:16.680]  and now unbelievable levels of uh uh cuts in public expenditure are being instigated
[38:16.680 --> 38:22.520]  because they say we're in so much trouble because of the debt now wait for this mate i talk about
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.240]  you know i talked about earlier about everything connects into everything else the david cameron
[38:27.240 --> 38:33.480]  government that has replaced the uh the the brown labor government has appointed someone
[38:33.480 --> 38:40.760]  to oversee um where these savage cuts of billions and billions of pounds are going to be made
[38:40.760 --> 38:45.400]  that are going to fundamentally affect the lives of everyone in this country guess who they've
[38:45.400 --> 38:52.760]  appointed lord brown former chief executive of bp who was responsible for the decisions
[38:52.760 --> 38:58.120]  that led up eventually to the Gulf oil disaster well that's like having all these former goldman
[38:58.120 --> 39:01.560]  sacks i'm laughing at us mate i mean that's like exactly that's like having all these former
[39:01.560 --> 39:06.600]  goldman sacks people running every position in the federal government getting the bailout money
[39:06.600 --> 39:11.720]  and then giving it to goldman sacks and jp morgan i mean it is a new level of crime and and now in
[39:11.720 --> 39:17.320]  the u.s of the the federal uh federal reserve expansion empowers they're being given a new
[39:17.320 --> 39:23.800]  secret office with unlimited funds to quote take over any area of the economy they wish so they're
[39:23.800 --> 39:29.160]  being given dictatorial power right now and the same things being done in greece and everywhere else
[39:29.160 --> 39:36.280]  this is their global coup d'etat they're going for it all and then that segues into the un and the
[39:36.280 --> 39:43.240]  imf announcing we need to start phasing out all the currencies and going to an sdr basket and we
[39:43.240 --> 39:48.920]  need a global government that you pay your carbon taxes to to finance this and who are the biggest
[39:48.920 --> 39:55.080]  investors in carbon credits well it's the goldman sacks jp morgan chase bp and a handful of others
[39:55.080 --> 40:02.680]  it's always the same inner cabal exactly and you've got this guy in america who um was uh the great
[40:02.680 --> 40:09.720]  new messiah obama who if anything is worse than bush and that whole period because it's speeding
[40:09.720 --> 40:17.240]  up now i mean this man is uh is not even subtle he's just agreeing to everything necessary to to
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.760]  allow this to speed up and speed up and speed up and i say this to people you know all that's
[40:22.760 --> 40:30.200]  happening now was predicted a long long time ago not because of people sitting in darkened rooms
[40:30.200 --> 40:37.000]  smoking something and coming to some conclusions but from hard research from documents from from
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.520]  from written material saying what these people were planning to do and it's unfolding now it
[40:42.520 --> 40:49.640]  wasn't prophecy it was research now we have to then decide where do we draw the line here um we
[40:49.640 --> 40:54.120]  didn't draw it when it was first pointed out because oh it's just conspiracy theorists well
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.160]  are we going to draw it now or are we going to draw it a few months down the road when it's even
[40:59.160 --> 41:04.760]  worse a year or two down the work down the road when what's happening today will be nothing compared
[41:04.760 --> 41:10.920]  with then when are we going to draw the line there's nothing nothing in anybody's life i don't care
[41:10.920 --> 41:16.920]  who they are i don't care where they are there's nothing more important in anybody's life than
[41:16.920 --> 41:22.920]  focusing on what is going on and we coming together as a population irrespective of race
[41:22.920 --> 41:29.000]  religion color creed income bracket and saying what are we going to do together to stop this because
[41:29.000 --> 41:36.040]  at the moment we have got a tail actually at the core a tiny tail wagging a massive dog and
[41:36.920 --> 41:43.000]  unless we uh start focusing on this and cut out the diversions that are designed to stop us
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.760]  focusing on this then it's just going to get worse but the power is still in our hands but there are
[41:48.760 --> 41:55.560]  so many of us and so few of those in full knowledge who were actually manipulating us come on wake up
[41:55.560 --> 42:03.800]  up do something i guess there's never nothing but we can do what can i do well sit down i can
[42:03.800 --> 42:08.920]  you make a contribution to this how can you communicate this information even if it's calling
[42:08.920 --> 42:14.440]  into a radio show in the mainstream or something i just saying this is going on go to this website
[42:14.440 --> 42:20.440]  go to this radio program they'll tell you uh what's going on there's nothing but there's already a
[42:20.440 --> 42:26.200]  huge awakening happening we've got to accelerate it because not only is that little tail wagging
[42:26.200 --> 42:33.080]  this giant dog they're going to pose with their false solutions to the crisis they created that's
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.520]  their methodology as you know problem reaction solution to bring us deeper under their control
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.400]  unless we're there every step of the way going you're the crooks you're the social engineers
[42:43.400 --> 42:47.960]  you're the controllers you're the one that did this how assinine to give the federal reserve
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.760]  that engineered this even more power how assinine to give the bank of england who engineered this on
[42:52.760 --> 42:57.880]  record more power look at your connections look at how you're involved in this look at what you've
[42:57.880 --> 43:02.440]  done we've got to be there that's why they want to shut down the internet because they're panicked
[43:02.440 --> 43:07.000]  now let's talk about that chinese net style censorship now coming to australia coming to new
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.960]  zealand coming to idly coming to france open announcements in our news that yes it's going
[43:11.960 --> 43:16.280]  to be more draconian but to keep you safe because al-qaeda is about to shut the internet down so
[43:16.280 --> 43:20.120]  we've got to have the power to shut it down to save it we're going to track everything you do we're
[43:20.120 --> 43:25.240]  going to block what websites you can visit already in full wars dot com prison planet dot com are
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.160]  already censored on the free broadband in many cities in europe we've confirmed that the government
[43:31.160 --> 43:35.720]  here the fcc saying they're going to take it over cast sunstein saying is going to censor it
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.800]  there's no doubt that line in the sand if we don't stand up against tyrants is whatever we'll put
[43:41.800 --> 43:48.040]  up with is thomas jefferson said they aren't going to push it to the limit and so again showing that
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.920]  we have power david doesn't that indicate it that now they are moving against the web even though
[43:52.920 --> 43:58.040]  that exposes them because they realize that that there is an accelerated awakening happening
[43:58.040 --> 44:05.880]  let me give you an example just a simple example of which is an example that can be expressed
[44:05.880 --> 44:11.560]  globally one of the appalling horrific things that's going on in the world again part of
[44:11.560 --> 44:18.920]  the agenda is for social services and police to steal children from their parents in extraordinary
[44:18.920 --> 44:27.480]  numbers now in america all over the world in britain um on the basis of uh fake uh uh and
[44:27.480 --> 44:32.600]  and it's now mainstream news in england i mean i mean for those that just tuned in that they've
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.120]  actually got quotas before a baby's even born and they admit they trump it up these are children
[44:38.120 --> 44:43.960]  snatchers they are they're stealing children and in in in at least in parts of america like
[44:43.960 --> 44:47.480]  california there i mean i think it's all over america there are there are federal
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.240]  financial incentives for social services to take more and more children from their parents
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.360]  but the point i'm making here is that there's a lady her name's maureen spallock in liverpool
[44:58.360 --> 45:03.480]  in england and she had her children stolen three of them years ago now and they were they were
[45:03.480 --> 45:09.560]  given away to um to foster parents by the social services and in the previous sense the liverpool
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.080]  police and social services have run a vendetta against this woman um as she tries to get her
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.600]  children back she was actually arrested she's just one example i could i could list a number of
[45:20.600 --> 45:28.120]  outrageous things that happened um she was arrested and taken to court for sending a birthday card to
[45:28.120 --> 45:34.520]  one of the children that the state stole the other day a few days ago um the liverpool police
[45:34.520 --> 45:42.120]  picked her up again for for sending a text message to someone um they put her in in jail um um in
[45:42.120 --> 45:49.640]  liverpool and the reason that the family courts that decide all this are held in secret is not
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.040]  to protect the children as they claim is to protect the system and the greatness and the
[45:54.040 --> 46:00.920]  pedophiles from stealing the children through social services the point i'm i'm leading to however
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.720]  is this i put on my website when i heard about this um how gutless disgusting and pathetic
[46:07.720 --> 46:14.360]  the liverpool police were and a number for liverpool police to um let people say what they thought
[46:14.360 --> 46:19.640]  about what they were doing to this woman she was in custody at the time and um a few hours later
[46:19.640 --> 46:25.000]  they let this lady go and they dropped the charges because they're compute they're a phone system
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.280]  crashed so many people rang in to to complain of what they were doing to this lady that they
[46:30.280 --> 46:35.240]  hold uh phone they couldn't keep their child kidnapping going so they said open the phones
[46:35.240 --> 46:40.120]  up we got more kids to grab but it's actually come out the telegraph and it's actually come out here
[46:40.120 --> 46:47.480]  in the us that they have uh quotas on what color hair eyes they that before a mother has a child
[46:47.480 --> 46:53.000]  they're already planning the fake charges and it's come out over and over again that that so many
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.440]  of the cps workers are pedophiles exactly because they can get away with everything they're pedophiles
[46:58.440 --> 47:01.960]  and they're satanist not all of them nothing like all of them but the people that run the show
[47:01.960 --> 47:06.040]  invariably um are i've been researching this for decades no i mean it's in the newspaper every day
[47:06.040 --> 47:12.280]  that they catch top top cps workers the short point is though alex but when people the public
[47:12.280 --> 47:18.360]  um phone this police station in large numbers and said this is disgusting we're not having in other
[47:18.360 --> 47:26.200]  words the secrecy and and and the shadow level that they do this on was taken away this lady
[47:26.200 --> 47:33.000]  was released and the charges were dropped we have the power they're terrified of of the public
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.600]  that's why they're arming against this that's why they're surveilling that's why they're
[47:36.600 --> 47:41.080]  admitting they're surveilling now because they know they've committed crimes they know they're
[47:41.080 --> 47:49.640]  run by crooks and they are scared yes but what we have to do is understand our power to change this
[47:49.640 --> 47:55.640]  you know we're talking about a handful of people in full knowledge manipulating the lives of billions
[47:55.640 --> 48:01.240]  what are we doing well that's why you've written the new book uh mankind get off your knees yeah
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.920]  human race get off your knees it's called um it's just out and uh the the subtitle is uh the lion
[48:06.920 --> 48:15.320]  sleeps no more because within us is a lion it is it is um the real human being um being suppressed
[48:15.320 --> 48:21.480]  by the the uh the the the human being that has been uh programmed to think it has no power the human
[48:21.480 --> 48:28.760]  being to to to to fear authority to fear the consequences of taking on authority or refusing
[48:28.760 --> 48:34.280]  to cooperate with authority that's the lion i'm talking about within people and that lion is starting
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.920]  to come out but he needs to come out in very much larger and we need the police and the
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.000]  military and others who are starting to wake up to realize you're compartmentalized as well the
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.120]  globalists have genetically modified the gmo food to sterilize and give you cancer they've they
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.280]  add the chemicals of the water to sterilize you and give you cancer we have the all the government
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.880]  documents we've covered even fox news reported yesterday that marilin has banned the uh by uh
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.920]  senile a that they're putting in the plastic products that does sterilize men i mean the
[49:02.920 --> 49:08.040]  white house science are admits they're doing this you are under attack too and david you've
[49:08.040 --> 49:13.800]  talked about compartmentalization we need to get the police and military to realize even if they
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.680]  consciously see themselves as on the winning team and part of the new world order they're not
[49:18.680 --> 49:24.360]  they are seen by the new world order as an even bigger enemy than the general public in the globalist
[49:24.360 --> 49:30.280]  documents we've gotten that this is a point i i think is very important to stress uh to those
[49:30.280 --> 49:35.000]  in uniform and to those in the dark suits in government who are serving this uh system
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.360]  while not actually instigating that they're instigating it they're serving it you have no
[49:40.360 --> 49:47.000]  power i don't care if you're in the military i don't care if you've got how many a kind of
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.760]  stars on your on your uniform i don't care what level of the police force you're in i don't care
[49:52.760 --> 49:57.720]  if you're doing roadblocks i don't care if you're pulling people off the street i don't care what
[49:57.720 --> 50:07.240]  you're doing you have no power your uniform has the power take your uniform off okay put it in
[50:07.240 --> 50:14.280]  the wardrobe where's your power go and get another job without that uniform where's your power you
[50:14.280 --> 50:21.240]  have no power you are employed to animate that uniform which is an extension of the state
[50:21.240 --> 50:28.600]  and that's all you are and therefore you are expendable while you give your soul away while you
[50:28.600 --> 50:35.480]  give your mind away while you give your morals and decency away advancing this this uh fascist
[50:35.480 --> 50:43.160]  dictatorship you will be okay with the fascist that you're serving but your children and your
[50:43.160 --> 50:49.400]  grandchildren have to live in the world you are creating i want that you're gonna have to understand
[50:49.400 --> 50:54.600]  that and i don't envy you that moment because it's going to be horrific when it dawns upon you
[50:54.600 --> 51:00.360]  the world that you've actually created the people in uniform the dark suits that administer the system
[51:00.360 --> 51:07.400]  while not um being the originators of it they have to start breaking ranks okay get some backbone
[51:07.400 --> 51:15.240]  open your mind look at what's going on and get some freaking backbone before you uh administer
[51:15.240 --> 51:21.560]  and impose and enforce a world that will be grotesque for your children and grandchildren in fact
[51:21.560 --> 51:25.960]  not even not even that for yourself yeah you're not gonna have to wait now for your kids to be
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.920]  destroyed no no you know absolutely and and and david very well said there i want to try to keep
[51:30.920 --> 51:35.800]  you five minutes in the next hour before sheriff ritchard max so we have as much time as possible
[51:35.800 --> 51:42.440]  to go over uh issues but but i really do see the denial lifting uh people a lot of them don't have
[51:42.440 --> 51:46.760]  you know even a partial view of what's going on but they know something's wrong and that's why
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.640]  i challenge people to don't expect you're going to save the world by yourself or overnight hollywood
[51:51.640 --> 51:56.680]  pushes that image of arnold swartz and agar or john wane saving everybody and if people always look
[51:56.680 --> 52:01.720]  to me they look to you others you know ron paul you got to save us no it's that act of defiance
[52:01.720 --> 52:07.240]  that act of awakening that act of courage resistance is victory and it's understanding the enemy
[52:07.240 --> 52:12.600]  and it's everybody speaking out you know one little cricket isn't very loud but you get a field
[52:12.600 --> 52:18.200]  of those it is a deafening roar and we're a lot bigger and more powerful than a cricket and we've
[52:18.200 --> 52:25.320]  all just got to do little things every day and realize what's going on and this system will
[52:25.320 --> 52:30.680]  come to a halt and they know that and they are desperate to throw us into a crisis to make
[52:30.680 --> 52:36.280]  themselves matter to make us beach ourselves on their government on their corporate structure
[52:36.280 --> 52:40.520]  and so many people within their system are starting to defect so many people that have
[52:40.520 --> 52:45.400]  become powerful off their system call me contact me talk to me off record and they say i wish i
[52:45.400 --> 52:50.360]  would have known this i wish i so many people that even work for the system are compartmentalized
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.960]  and now through my broadcast your work and others they can finally see the larger paradigm around
[52:55.960 --> 53:01.640]  them from the cog that they filled and so by getting that full spectrum analysis they can
[53:01.640 --> 53:06.760]  then see the full spectrum dominance that the globalist have built i mean roth cop who we had
[53:06.760 --> 53:13.080]  on the show who wrote superclass says there's less than six thousand people that rule the world
[53:13.080 --> 53:19.480]  and only 20 families that they serve so this is now admitted publicly and and and we can defeat
[53:19.480 --> 53:27.640]  these people we must defeat these people i've got two words to say indra harnesson who's uh uh come
[53:27.640 --> 53:33.960]  out and and and done so much great work exposing what bp are doing in the Gulf of Mexico and how
[53:33.960 --> 53:39.320]  the the whole cleanup stuff is a sham how the the fishermen and other people are being uh
[53:39.320 --> 53:44.120]  exploited and treated appallingly now they've lost their uh their way of life they have to serve
[53:44.760 --> 53:52.280]  bp and bp's not sending them checks that was yeah yeah she is a shining light of what can be done
[53:52.280 --> 53:58.680]  a few a few days ago a week or so ago i mean she was a mother and now she's standing up to these
[53:58.680 --> 54:04.520]  people and doing a magnificent job and anybody can do it it's just and if they arrest her it's
[54:04.520 --> 54:10.360]  going to backfire and if they arrest her it's going to backfire yeah of course and you know no one
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.720]  said it was going to be easy i mean i mean this is the question are we going to draw the line now
[54:15.720 --> 54:22.280]  alex and and take the challenges and sacrifices that that takes to say here and no further or are
[54:22.280 --> 54:28.040]  we going to wait a bit a bit longer until they get more and more uh control and try to do it then
[54:28.040 --> 54:33.320]  and when this agenda is further down the road than it is now all right then a bit further then when
[54:33.320 --> 54:39.960]  are we actually going to say enough you know because you know it's like um uh that famous phrase
[54:40.920 --> 54:45.640]  by the christian pastor in uh after nazi germany first they came for the jews and i was not a jews
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.160]  so i did nothing then they came for the trade unionists i was not a trade unionist so i did
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.800]  nothing then i they came for the communists i was not a communist so i did nothing you know this is
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.800]  about all of us it's not about um one group of people one income bracket one race one religion
[54:59.800 --> 55:06.440]  these are all fault lines for uh engineered divided rule the target is all of us so all of us
[55:06.440 --> 55:12.760]  need to come together put our hands together put our minds together and and say here and no further
[55:12.760 --> 55:18.200]  when we stop cooperating with the system the system cannot operate they cannot operate the
[55:18.200 --> 55:23.560]  system without our acquiescence we must stop acquiescing and we must do it now human race
[55:23.560 --> 55:29.960]  get off your knees we have been there for long enough no more well the human race is getting
[55:29.960 --> 55:35.960]  up off its knees and that's why the system is howling uh with anger um let's get into the
[55:35.960 --> 55:40.440]  police state and the minutes we've got left david and i want to hold you five over if you can do it
[55:40.440 --> 55:46.600]  okay uh but uh i mean the police state it's even shocking me how fast they're moving we have now
[55:46.600 --> 55:52.360]  discovered just today this is unbelievably important news that all over the country not just new york
[55:52.360 --> 55:58.680]  but illinois you name it the military marines army national guard are arresting citizens
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.120]  nationwide with police and this has been going on for several years and i wasn't even aware
[56:04.120 --> 56:09.800]  now they're putting it out on tv like it's a good thing i mean again i didn't even know the magnitude
[56:09.800 --> 56:16.440]  david this is incredible yeah and it is what i call over the years the totalitarian tiptoe um
[56:16.440 --> 56:20.760]  where you're you're at a and you know you're going to bed but if you go in too big a leap
[56:20.760 --> 56:26.440]  then people um look up and say what's going on because um the change in your in your your society
[56:26.440 --> 56:32.040]  is is is so blatantly obvious so they do it in in in steps but of course the nearer they get to the
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.240]  goal the steps get quicker and quicker because it's a simple equation the more you centralize
[56:37.240 --> 56:42.360]  power the more power you then have to centralize even quicker and that's that's why the the um
[56:42.360 --> 56:48.040]  the momentum of centralization and dictatorship gets faster and faster because the more power you
[56:48.040 --> 56:52.040]  have the quicker you can push it on the more power you have the quicker you can push it on
[56:52.040 --> 56:57.320]  and with this is why we reached the point now where they've centralized so much power in so many
[56:57.320 --> 57:03.000]  areas of our lives that they can now push this this whole agenda on across a great spectrum of
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.120]  subjects in areas of our and they use every new crisis as a way to say no media no local officials
[57:10.680 --> 57:14.680]  no one's allowed you and you're not getting your checks for the fishing we've shut down
[57:15.240 --> 57:18.920]  you know you're not allowed to have a gun you're not allowed to protect yourself and we're like
[57:18.920 --> 57:25.000]  where's the law and they said we don't need any stinking law yeah what they've done in a series of
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.640]  steps getting faster and faster is these take away the checks and balances the checks and balances
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.920]  the checks and balances they did it most blatantly with the checks and balances they took away to
[57:34.920 --> 57:41.320]  stop the free for all in the financial markets the financial industry and look what that led to
[57:41.320 --> 57:47.480]  and every single time one of these checks and balances has been suggested to be taken away
[57:48.040 --> 57:52.760]  every time the people that could have stood up to that and thought well you know i'm not even
[57:52.760 --> 57:57.800]  can't be bothered all this i have no power to do that what can i do then they have played a part
[57:57.800 --> 58:04.600]  in where we've reached now so can we learn from that please and say okay we've made mistakes in
[58:04.600 --> 58:09.160]  the past when we didn't stand up to what we should have stood up to and so we better learn from
[58:09.160 --> 58:13.640]  those mistakes now and start standing up here because if we don't then it's going to be a
[58:13.640 --> 58:19.720]  lot more difficult down the road David Ike is our guest we're gonna do five more minutes with him

[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:15.000]  david ike is our guest for another five minutes and i was during the break i said what do you
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.200]  think is most important to finish off with and he said albert pikes letter and i've read his
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.960]  book morals and dogma of course this letter is reported to be at the british naval museum
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:31.400]  he was a confederate general the founder of the clan a british agent trying to break up the
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.440]  u.s. with the civil war and all of that's been confirmed but this letter is just amazing the
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.200]  way it predicted everything they've done so go over some of that letter the three phases in the last
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.560]  five minutes david go ahead well albert pike who of course was a uh a massive massive uh
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:53.080]  freemason an absolute freemasonic god because he's um his statue is uh in washington dc right
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.120]  next to washington dc police headquarters which is quite appropriate i would say we're dealing
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.400]  with freemasonry and it's a letter that he wrote this letter to a guy called mesenia very infamous
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.600]  illuminati operative um and uh he predicted in this letter three world wars that were coming it was
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.760]  alleged to have been sent in uh all written in 1871 and the first world war he talks about
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.920]  the overthrow of the zars in russia and and and making the country a fortress of atheist
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:34.440]  communism etc he talks about bringing the british and germanic empires into the war uh the second
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.640]  world war must be fermented by taking advantage of the differences between the fascist fascists
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.080]  and the political zionists and talks about um things that happened then but the point the point
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.440]  that um it leads to is the third world war which really um i mean i've been saying for years that's
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.440]  that that's the that's the plan which which it is and um the description in in the letter of the
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.160]  third world war is absolutely describing the the period we're going through now he says this
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.240]  the third world war must be fermented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the azion
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.160]  tur azion tur of the illuminati between the political zionists and the leaders of the islamic world
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:18.760]  the more must be conducted in such a way that islam the muslim arabic world and political zionism
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.800]  the state of israel mutually destroy each other meanwhile the other nations once more divided
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.040]  on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical moral spiritual
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:34.280]  and economic exhaustion we shall unleash the nihilist and atheist we shall provoke a formidable
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.960]  social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.200]  atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.160]  obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries will exterminate
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:57.000]  those destroys of civilization and the multitude dissolution with christianity whose deistic spirits
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.480]  will from that moment be without compass or direction anxious for an ideal but without
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.440]  knowing where to render its adoration will receive the true light through the universal
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.640]  manifestation of the pure doctrine of lucifer brought finally out into the public view this
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.480]  manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.560]  destruction of christianity and atheism both conquered and exterminated at the same time
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:26.680]  and he talks about the fact that they're going to make in effect the global society so full of
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:34.760]  turmoil so full of upheaval that the people will turn to the few the cabal and say save us from it
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:41.320]  and the cabal will then say well to do that we must do this and we know in 1919 these are confirmed
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.440]  lord milner repeated it about creating a germanic superstate to start a new war and we know they
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:51.160]  used world war one for the league of nations we have the carnegie documents about world war two
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:57.640]  being engineered i mean i mean this is real yeah i mean milner was the the head of a secret society
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.600]  in london called the round table which spawned the tri-lateral commission and the cfr council
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.360]  of correlations the royal intrusive international affairs it spawned of course the club of roam

[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:15.240]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:20.600]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.800]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.560]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:18.360]  the gcm radio network
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.360]  you
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:38.760]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining us today and we've got
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.200]  here in the final 52 minutes of this radio broadcast we have sheriff richard mac author
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:49.480]  speaker former sheriff richard mac has served in a wide variety of roles and over the course of his
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.680]  nearly 20 year career in law enforcement which began in provo utah that began his career with a
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:01.960]  provo police department and of course he then became a sheriff and he of course was involved in a
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:07.720]  famous supreme court case defending the second amendment and now he's traveling all over the
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:14.360]  country in high demand educating people about the 10th amendment the 11th amendment the 9th
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:20.520]  amendment the power of states rights and the fact that the legislature creates the county
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:28.680]  cities are then chartered under the state we have the cities trying to take over the states now
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.720]  i mean that's basically what's happening you have cities trying to take over the counties
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.600]  which is an extension of the state and so this is completely backwards it's just like globalists
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.760]  have come into austin and they have financed austin raising a 2.6 billion dollar tax doubling
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.720]  our energy cost in the next three years they're seizing mopak to put toll roads on it admittedly
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:56.040]  illegal it's an existing road uh but they don't care i mean because the cities aren't following
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:00.600]  the 10th amendment they have been taken over just like the federal government's been taken over
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.280]  so we've got our had them off at the past taking our counties and our states back so it's not just
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.400]  10th amendment nullification of unconstitutional federal laws and taxes that's moving forward
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.920]  and you're seeing that of course with arizona saying they're going to defend the border down there
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:21.880]  but it's expanding to uh now the county sheriffs as well and for you know over a decade sheriff
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.680]  richard mac has been exposing this he also has a book on the subject but but a sheriff before we
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.720]  go any further and get into that talk about the state of the second amendment and for folks that
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:38.520]  aren't aware of it your uh your supreme court uh case and your take uh on what the supreme court
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:44.760]  ruled on a few weeks ago uh but uh good to have you here with us well thanks alex it's always
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.360]  great to be with you and i appreciate you giving me some time today and uh man yes i am really busy
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:57.240]  and i'll be uh in fresno this weekend and on monday i go to amarillo uh and we're going to have uh
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:05.240]  several uh sheriffs there and i'm teaching my uh constitution class for peace officers there uh to
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:11.000]  public and uh peace officers alike and i'm doing that all across the country and i really do feel
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.560]  that the uh the title of my book the county sheriff america's last hope uh really basically tells it
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:24.440]  all uh that's a state sovereignty issue arizona is now exemplifying uh the power of state sovereignty
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:31.880]  it is the only answer left i don't see any other recourse for the states or for personal freedom
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.560]  other than states standing against the incursions of the federal government sheriff i want to i mean
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.960]  i want to get to that in a moment but i want to go back first to your history for folks who may not
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.960]  know who you are when a lot of new stations since you were last gone with us and oh yeah kind of talk
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:53.880]  about your awakening so other officers can you know basically see it from that perspective and then
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.200]  let's get into your uh supreme court case and where you see the second amendment being then we'll
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:04.040]  spend the rest of the hour on the states rights movement all right well fantastic uh well when i
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:11.000]  was uh elected sheriff here in southern arizona it was a grand county back in 1988 and i was reelected
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.080]  in 1992 and then the brady bill came out in nineteen uh well it was signed into law by bill
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:26.360]  clinton at the end of 1993 and it went into effect february of 1994 and uh the key part of that whole
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:32.040]  thing is is that there was a component within the brady bill that required local officials
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:39.160]  and it was in most cases the sheriff to conduct background checks on citizens before they could
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:46.360]  buy a gun so we're being forced uh under a threat of arrest uh there was no money attached to this
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:53.160]  alec says you'll recall but there was a threat of arrest if we fail to comply so this is the first
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:13:00.920]  time in u.s history that the united states congress wished to uh compel and commandeer the office of
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:07.560]  sheriffs for federal bidding so this is the picture this is the perspective local officials
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:14.120]  elected by four and of the people to serve their needs and to serve their constitutional rights
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  are now being uh dragoon as one of the judges called it we're now being dragged into into
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:28.360]  federal service and forced to violate our oath of office and to violate the rights of our citizens
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:35.160]  to keep in their arms and if we don't do it they threaten to arrest us you're being pressed into
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:42.440]  service you're being literally shanghai enslaved drug on uh to the to the federal reservation
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.800]  with an unconstitutional law thank god it's it's it you know to some extent been thrown out right
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.240]  but still there uh you know some remnants i mean this is amazing that this is going on and it's an
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:59.240]  unfunded mandate it's literally indentured servitude i mean there's so many issues here continue
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:05.800]  well and it's funny that you mentioned uh indentured servitude because i actually filed on the 13th
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:12.360]  amendment which was you know again you know just what you said you have unlawful servitude
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.120]  yes and uh uh to the federal government and the federal government cannot tell your sheriff
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.440]  what to do there is no one not the epa not the fbi not the president of the united states and i
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.960]  don't care who the president is i don't care if it's george washington himself he has no reporting
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.000]  to tell your sheriff or your local officials what to do that she that's why they usually that's the
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.080]  whole point of the states and and and if we allow the feds to tell us what size toilet we can have
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:46.520]  and what our kids can eat and what the sheriff can do i mean why even have states exactly that's
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.200]  that's a key point and so now the states can't even control their own land or their own resources
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:58.520]  uh in fact arizona nevada in utah are all about 85 percent owned by the federal government my county
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.240]  of graham county arizona is 95 percent owned by the federal government i wonder when we're
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.600]  going to wake up and say you know this isn't arizona we're federal enclave number 48 because we were
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:15.960]  the 48th date uh so it's time that the uh governors of every state tell the federal government to get
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:23.640]  out and my case can prove it now what i did is i said look i'm not going to go along uh there's no
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.640]  way that i'm going to violate my oath for the federal government for the clinton administration
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.240]  for this stupid thing called the bradyville and so i was the first sheriff in the united states to
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.320]  file a lawsuit against my own government and uh the decision was just between me and my wife and
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:46.120]  the lord that was all it was and the next day uh the historical perspective of this is that i called
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:50.920]  the an array i had no place else to go i wasn't a member of anything i wasn't a member of the
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.800]  an array i'm still not today but i called them and i said what can i do to stop this
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.680]  and they said uh we've already been working on this case and we needed a sheriff to call so we
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:06.040]  could have standing and i said well uh let's do it i want my own lawyer though and they recommended
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.320]  the lawyer for me that i hired personally out here in arizona by the name of dave hardy he worked
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.520]  with the an array lawyers and we got this thing filed the very day the bradyville took effect on
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:24.360]  february 28 1994 then some other sheriff joined the case and there was only five or six uh that
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.960]  came in sheriff prince from montana and i ended up at the united state supreme court in december
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:37.720]  of 1996 and on june 27 1997 the united state supreme court ruled that the bradyville was
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:42.520]  indeed unconstitutional that the federal government cannot tell the states what to do
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:48.600]  that they cannot and this is in the ruling itself and let me let me tell you what this is so they
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:53.800]  indentured yes so they indentured the gun dealers instead and it should be thrown out on that but
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.560]  the point is you took action you sued you got involved americans want to know what solutions are
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:04.920]  everybody just start standing up to the feds will win lose will draw but we know if we lay down
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.440]  we're gonna lose go ahead well that's right and uh and listen to this i mean this was so well
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:16.280]  hidden from the public and bill clinton may made the media go along with him and making sure that
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:22.680]  the citizens of this country never heard what this decision really did now listen to this this is
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:29.480]  the order of the court the federal government may neither issue directives requiring the states to
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:36.840]  even to address particular problems nor command the state's officers or those of their political
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:43.640]  subdivision and you just did you just addressed what those are cities and counties to administer or
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:53.320]  enforce a federal regulatory program such commands are fundamentally incompatible with
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:59.000]  our constitutional system of dual sovereignty and what does that say what a that's a supreme court
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.960]  ruling that you never hear about what does that say for cap and trade what does that say with the
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:09.880]  feds showing up on shore in louisiana mississippi florida alabama now texas telling county commissioners
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:15.640]  and sheriffs they can't be on the beach some little some little bp goon i mean that's why this
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:21.080]  stuff's important because i mean that's what the 11th amendment says i mean you have foreign powers
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.840]  coming by off presidents and congress we gotta have state rights so they can't have bp i mean what's
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.080]  next is bp gonna tell us move out of our house they're going to move in next we got to give our
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:38.680]  daughters to bp like prima noctua 600 years ago in england yeah prima noctua was uh yeah you're
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.920]  starting to wonder because they're sure raping our land all the time now it also says a lot about
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:51.160]  nationalized socialistic health care alec as you well know because if if the states cannot be forced
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.920]  to participate in a federal regulatory program then we have 30 states suing right now that don't
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:05.000]  need to sue at all all they need to do as is ask for summary judgment based on our case this case
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.480]  already proves that nationalized socialistic health care is unconstitutional and the states
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.840]  do not have to go along and but the romans knew that roads were key to controlling areas
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.680]  that's why all roads led to rome in the old world 2000 plus years ago uh that's why they brought in
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.640]  nafta super highways and the federal highways now they can tax and control those and control the
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:33.480]  communities they take our tax money send it to washington then build the roads it's incredible
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.920]  sheriff mac amazing that's why i wanted to go over that key supreme court ruling that you got uh to
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.160]  show the power of the individual the power of the ruling and illustrate the 10th amendment
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.480]  now we're going to come back and talk about state powers with the borders and everything else
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.040]  and not just to take over the legislatures that's our right and duty but the sheriff's department

[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:32.840]  regarding this case of the most powerful and monumental tenth amendment decision in the
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:39.640]  history of our country this was all about stage right it talks about the epa being unconstitutional
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.400]  it talks about the states not being puppets of the ventriloquist congress it talks about the
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:51.240]  supremacy clause and that is a key component of this whole thing because barack obama is saying he
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:58.600]  wants to sue arizona on the supremacy clause well just as khalia already says that the supremacy
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:05.480]  clause does not give the federal government supremacy it says that the constitution is supreme
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.120]  not the federal government and that's a huge difference and one of the key components of this
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:17.320]  case is that the the decision is based on this and just khalia who wrote the decision says this
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:24.840]  over and over in the decision and i quote state legislatures are not subject to federal direction
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:31.240]  end quote so if we are not subject to federal direction and if we indeed as this case says
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:38.040]  if the states are indeed sovereign then that means that the federal government is not our boss
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.560]  they cannot tell us what to do they cannot issue directives to the states they cannot control our
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:50.680]  land our water our education our health care or anything else that they're trying to shove down
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:55.960]  our throats so where do we go to make sure that we know and understand this the same place i went
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.800]  now alex you mentioned i was a rookie cop in brobo utah when i was there i made a huge mistake
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:09.480]  i actually read the constitution i took my oath of office after that very seriously i dedicated
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:15.000]  it are you there yes sir okay good i got my phone went dead they're not in your click go ahead okay
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.800]  good but uh i i made a commitment to myself that i would never go against the constitution
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.480]  that i would uphold and defend the constitution just like i promised to do and if we wake up local
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:35.160]  officials to that uh principle that they'll keep their word when they swear an oath an oath that
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:40.840]  is required by article six of our own constitution that the founding fathers put in there that all
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:48.200]  state and local officials would be required to swear allegiance not to the king not to the president
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:55.240]  not to some bureaucracy not to the governor but to the people that we promised that we would uphold
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.760]  and defend their constitutional rights and if we had everybody in local government doing just that
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.360]  and
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.520]  actually keeping their oath and defending the constitution against all enemies both foreign
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.880]  and domestic if we actually had that alex we would get our freedom back tomorrow oh it would
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.440]  paralyze the new world order and that's why they're demonizing you that's why they're so

[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:53.080]  your book gets into more detail and it's also people don't respect books it's important to have them
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.880]  you explain the power of the states it's written from a sheriff's perspective a guy that's one of
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:03.400]  the supreme court you have a lot of gravitas again give people the website or a number
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.400]  so they can get your book and get it in the hands of sheriffs this is like a steak through the heart
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:17.320]  of vampires every sheriff that we wake up well that is a sheriff mac dot com sheriff one r2s and
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:24.200]  mac mck just go to sheriff mac dot com and the book actually needs to get to county commissioners
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:30.280]  and county attorneys most of the sheriffs in the country have the book however you need to follow
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.080]  up and make sure they read it just as you said no one can guarantee they read it we also have it on
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.920]  cd so if somebody doesn't want to read they can listen to it and it is me reading the book
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.960]  and then you can get these little booklets and every state legislator every county commissioner
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.800]  every state and local official should see this little booklet this the victory for state sovereignty
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:57.160]  because it reviews what we've been talking about here on the show and it's a pocket size form and
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:03.320]  in 10 minutes your state rep or your local county commissioner or your local sheriff can see what
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.000]  this case actually did to restore state sovereignty in this okay we're going to talk about your plan
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  and versus what the feds are doing the alternative here in a moment but i want to
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:20.040]  since you are a sheriff from the west i want to you know draw this analogy here and then get
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.280]  involved with what's happening on the arizona border right now in this act of treason by obama
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.440]  but but going back we've all seen westerns alex let me let me just reiterate something that you
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:36.120]  said this is about solutions this isn't just talking about things that are horrible and going
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.400]  on in our country we could do that till next year and still not finish this is about a solution that
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:50.760]  is reasonable effective quick and doable and constitutional and it's the law and we're going
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.960]  to get into that moment but i want to just give people so they have a mental image of what's
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.440]  happened so they can have respect for themselves again okay we've all seen those westerns and
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.520]  matt dillon and john wane and i always thought growing up as a kid you know those are just
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.560]  movies where where there's a corrupt town with bad guys in it robin and rapin and you know oppressing
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.520]  and taking farmers water and taking their daughters and finally people stand up but or i thought it
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:18.280]  was a louis lemore novel now i've read a lot of histories of the west and things that happened
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:22.360]  in this country and even after world war two in a tennessee town when the vets came home and there
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:27.320]  was a corrupt government they had to run them out but this is what happened in 1776 it's what
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:32.200]  it's what andrew jackson fought against it's always a repeat of the scallywags the carpet
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:38.040]  baggers the corrupt interests that come in uh the rockefeller uh you know men sending pinkerton
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:43.320]  security like in that uh clenicewood movie where the mining town and the in the railroad men come
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.440]  and are killing people to take their claims that that's a composite of thousands of true events
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.600]  but more often than not people stood up because they were armed and fought back and you know the
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.640]  issue here is what's happening with the feds what's happening in our society we see that hollywood
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:04.840]  image of the town finally standing up that's what america is that's what our counties are
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.720]  that's what our societies are and people you've just got to get angry you got to start talking
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:14.440]  you got to turn the television set off you got to get to the commissioner's court you got to
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.680]  get with others you got to get angry and you got to get the facts and the constitution
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.400]  because i'm going to say it again it is like a stake through the heart of these vampires
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:28.440]  because our country was born in the fight for liberty it we've been through this over and over
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.160]  again we're not the first people to go through this and we've got the blueprint of how to beat
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:40.520]  these people we do and it's it's every bit uh constitutional it's every bit uh lawful and
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:48.600]  it is a peaceful process uh this will not hurt anyone uh except the traders in washington dc
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:54.040]  there is no answer in washington dc uh it is the most corrupt place on the face of the planet
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:40:00.200]  but we can make headway uh in our counties and we can take america back county by county and state
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.760]  by state but it's got to start with you every one of your listeners you've got to know and
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.640]  understand the principle of state sovereignty your sheriff has got to know and understand the
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:15.960]  principle of state sovereignty and local autonomy and that's exactly what my lawsuit was about now
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.480]  judge john roll said and that's also quoted in my little booklet that i have here in my hand
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:28.600]  the victory for state sovereignty he said mac is thus forced to choose between keeping his oath
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:34.520]  or obeying the act subjecting himself to possible sanctions well my question is to every peace
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.560]  officer and sheriff in this country when you are forced by the federal government and the lawmakers
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:46.920]  around you to choose between your oath or following laws and statutes which one are you going to do
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.520]  are you going to side with the people and freedom or are you going to continue to acquiesce and follow
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:58.440]  the uh well the founders had us swear to this oath because they wanted to point out this is the real
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:06.680]  law this is the power this is the america this is the republic not what some flim flammer comes
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.680]  along later with them and that's what thomas jefferson george washington said over and over again
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.280]  you got to stick to this not what lawyers come and invent later or what they try to twist out of it
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:23.160]  that's exactly correct and this is all foundational it's all fundamental and the first page of my
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.720]  book i'm glad you you talk about thomas jefferson because i quote him on the very first page of
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:33.720]  my book and he says when all government shall be drawn to washington as the center of all power
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:39.080]  it will render powerless the checks provided and become as venal and oppressive as the government
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:45.560]  from which we separated the question is alec to whom can your people turn the people in often texas
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:50.760]  or the people in southern arizona or the people throughout this country who can they turn to for
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:57.240]  peace safety and protection when government from washington dc has become venal and oppressive
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:04.040]  and the answer is your county sheriff and your local officials all right well let's describe the
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:09.480]  true role of the sheriff because people never been taught this i mean versus what's happening all over
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:14.680]  the country where the feds come in and we'll put tens of millions of dollars in to and buy off
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:22.280]  sheriffs and counties to get the city to absorb the county uh when the county is the unit of the
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.560]  state i mean this is treason i keep using that word they know exactly what they're this is this is
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:34.840]  federal conquest of the states in a very sneaky way well my case even addresses that and scalia
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:41.880]  brings up the issue of uh compromising local authority in order to take uh federal grants
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:47.480]  and federal money the federal government is very wise uh let's not pretend anything here
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:55.480]  this plan of attack to destroy state sovereignty and local autonomy and the power of the county
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.920]  has been an orchestrated event uh they've even voted sheriffs out in connecticut there are no
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:06.920]  more sheriffs in connecticut massachusetts is trying to do the same thing ohio now has one county where
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.960]  the sheriff is no longer elected but appointed and every sheriff that i've talked to and i've been
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:18.520]  talking to hundreds of sheriffs uh this past year every one of them uh well not every one of them
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:23.160]  but there's about a half of them that are worried if they take strong stands against the federal
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.920]  government and do what my book suggests that uh they might lose federal funding and again that's a
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:34.280]  coward's mindset we've gotten to this point of the sheriff being abolished because the enemy
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:39.960]  is attacking the constitution and our republic and instead of saying oh i better coward you know for
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:51.960]  the five years or whatever you're in massachusetts is trying to do the same thing ohio now has one
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:57.080]  county where the sheriff is no longer elected but appointed and every sheriff that i've talked to
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:03.560]  and i've been talking to hundreds of sheriffs uh this past year every one of them uh well not
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:08.040]  every one of them but there's about a half of them that are worried if they take strong stands
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:13.640]  against the federal government and do what my book suggests that uh they might lose federal funding
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.760]  and again that's a coward's mindset we've gotten to this point of the sheriff being abolished
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:24.360]  because the enemy is attacking the constitution and our republic and instead of saying oh i better
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.520]  coward you know for the five years or whatever you're in you want to think about your kids and
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:34.040]  grandkids and you should get up there and stand up i mean how do we come from the toughest roughest
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:39.400]  smartest people to a bunch of castrated cowards i tell you those sheriffs are pathetic well it's
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.920]  all it's all about the money and i have said this and i say this in my book that anyone in this
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:50.280]  country i don't care if it's a sheriff state rep county commissioner or anyone else if you're
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.800]  willing to compromise liberty if you're willing to compromise the freedom of your citizens to
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:02.760]  continue to take money then you sir are the trader and you have uh betrayed your own people
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:09.240]  this is time to stand in and when i when i sent this book to sheriff print i said sheriff tell
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:14.760]  me honestly is this book true and is it the answer he says of course it is the problem is
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.840]  you've got too many damn wimpy sheriffs and and alex that's i'm just going to tell her like it is
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:27.080]  if the sheriffs in this country have the courage to stand that the only thing we lack now is courage
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.920]  within our local communities courage from county attorneys courage from county sheriffs and county
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.760]  commissioners to uphold and defend the constitution for the people and stop taking the money throw
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:45.080]  this yeah we don't need quasi federal deputized federal totes we need the counties and people
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.960]  not liking the feds that was back when america was free and people were smart i mean going back
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:56.280]  to our founding uh not these little pathetic totes uh and creatures of the feds we need men
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.120]  we need strong leaders who are loved in their communities to bring back true peace officers
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:08.120]  not these law enforcement lackeys who desecrate the constitution and enforce all this made up
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.680]  crud now i want to bring up a subject here with you uh while we've got you sheriff mac we'll have
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:18.600]  you back soon uh but i want to read to you from encyclopedia britannica and it's the same thing
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.080]  and the definition wikipedia they've all got it high treason the definition of high treason
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.600]  participating in a war against one's country attempting to overthrow its government spying
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.560]  on its military its diplomats or its secret services for a hostile and foreign power or
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:37.880]  attempting to kill its head of state and it goes on are the best known types now the most
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:44.040]  classic archetypal is enemies inside the gates who are traitors opening the drawbridge to let
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:50.520]  the enemy in now we've got the states 80 to 100 miles a third of arizona where you were a sheriff
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.360]  has imploded sheriff babbo is begging for help there's death threats they've killed thousands of
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:01.720]  law enforcement uh peace officers but they are law enforcement down in mexico in this war they're
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:11.400]  now literally roads highways uh the parkland uh off limits uh obama tells senator kyle treacherously
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:17.080]  i want to keep that crisis going so i get amnesty that's on record so we have all of this happening
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:22.120]  is that not high treason i have the article obama commits act of high treason sides with foreign
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:27.400]  power against arizona i have all the facts i have the eleventh amendment saying the feds can't sue
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:33.640]  a state or an individual citizen on behalf of foreign power uh or an or an alien because
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.880]  that was the first amendment they passed after the first ten because you know the states knew the
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:43.880]  feds could be bought off by foreign corporate powers is this not an act of treason by obama
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.640]  going in there trying to block the state when it's trying to not collapse like mexico
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:53.800]  well it is and not and not only that but there's more uh on the record uh about what obama has
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:48:01.560]  done now remember he brought presidente felipe calderon from mexico to our own united states
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:09.720]  congress inside our u.s capitol to assail and criticize our own constitution our own freedom
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:15.880]  our own country our own laws and then he got a standing ovation from the liberals and the leftists
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:22.440]  and the traders in washington dc all that was treason every bit of this you cannot show me anything
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:29.640]  that washington dc has done in the past 10 20 years and get giving our authority to the wto
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.440]  on elected corporate board the spp that they kept secret the judicial watch got said we've
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:39.480]  got to keep this secret in the founding document uh that the president signed we got to keep this
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.160]  secret we got to bring a carbon tax in to erect a north american union government i mean that is
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:52.920]  the definition of high treason uh anytime that you want to destroy or have politicians who attempt
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:58.760]  or want to destroy our own constitution i believe the founding fathers intended that to be treason
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.640]  and and there's only three law enforcement authorities granted to the federal government
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:10.280]  within article one section eight of u.s constitution behind the scenes like roaches in a cheap motel
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:17.160]  spending all their time hating veterans conservatives libertarians gun owners ron paul myself you
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.360]  i mean they are just just just doing nothing but trying to brainwash police and sheriff's
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.880]  departments that we are the devil i mean that really shows you who these people are we're saying
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:32.280]  we want america back and they're saying if you got a portrait of john wane in your house you're a
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.640]  terrorist yeah and uh the southern property law center i've been fighting them ever since i uh
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:44.120]  uh filed my lawsuit back in 1994 they're writing those reports and oh gosh and these guys are
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:54.360]  absolutely out of control they are the acorn of of politics in america acorn uh being also a branch
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:58.840]  of the treason from the federal government but southern property law centers just like acorn
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:06.280]  they get a lot of money from the federal government to lie and to uh do just the opposite of protecting
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.800]  our constitution they want to destroy our constitution and i'm proud to be listed with you
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:18.520]  and other patriots of this uh country i'm number eighteen uh on that list and i'm very proud to
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:25.000]  stand with you and ron paul and chuck baldwin and jill banister and others uh uh steward roads of
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  oath keepers and i'm proud to be uh on the board of directors of oath keepers and this is all boiling
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.560]  down to whether or not the peace officers in this country the sheriffs of this country will do one
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:43.400]  thing and that is to uphold and defend their oath of office to uphold and defend the constitution
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:49.800]  god bless you absolutely our names are on that john hancock they're on that constitution
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.560]  that's an enemy warrant against us by these traders and they are traders we'll be right back with

[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.440]  occasion will we rise to the occasion or will we go into slavery because it was too fun to drink
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:32.520]  beer and watch tv well i'm afraid there's one way to prevent it and it's at your local level the
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:38.200]  answer uh to that question if you want to stop tyranny if you want to stop the un if you want
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.800]  to stop the global gun grab if you want to stop the the land grab if you want to protect your
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:49.560]  children and your family's freedom and liberty if you want to protect your constitution you must
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:56.520]  start with your local sheriff your county commission and do it in your own town and in your own county
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:04.200]  that's the only land answer left we can do it i'm having emails from sheriff candidates all
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:10.520]  across this country i'm helping them with their campaigns i was contacted by ap talking about
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:15.640]  all the sheriff races across the country that are concentrating on which candidate will be the most
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:21.800]  constitutional sheriff if you have a constitutional sheriff who will protect you from all enemies both
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:27.000]  foreign and domestic who will protect you from the gun grabbers and protect you from the globalist
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.760]  you will win and you will get your freedom back and it will be done peacefully effectively and you
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:38.440]  will be able to live in freedom once again and if it's nothing more than your county then so be it
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:45.160]  and if we can convert if we can convert uh the massive tea party energy not just in the congressional

[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:21.560]  government is telling on themselves alex talks about all these conspiracies and what's going on
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:27.320]  how the banking community has rigged the system and has you know that things are going according
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:34.520]  to plan on them well the federal debt and risk of financial crises document describes that to the t
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:40.760]  i mean they are saying that we're going to be like argentina or or brazil or you can compare us to
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:46.680]  the uh greek economy uh the united states is in trouble but the neat part about it is is they have
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:53.320]  a graph on the federal public debt held by the public here and it goes all the way from 1790
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:59.240]  up to the year 2010 and you can see when these elite people had stepped into the marketplace
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:07.800]  in 1913 creating the federal reserve system and and also in 1913 the the income tax the federal
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:13.000]  income tax and almost immediately thereafter the world war one starts then we have the great
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.040]  depression world war two goes beyond that you can just see this debt thing growing and you can see
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:24.040]  the whole economic turn you know turnaround from that start to where we are today and this is the
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:31.160]  from the the uh congressional budget office i mean it is just absolute pinpoint on the money
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:36.200]  and it's coming from congress everybody should have this document might as has it will print it
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.880]  off or mail it to you will email it to you whatever you need to get this document read it
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.360]  and you need to give it to your friends and the neat part about it is it's coming from congress
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:52.360]  so it won't sound like it's coming from a tin hat wearing a looney like me it'll sound more like
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.760]  it's coming from our government which what is what it is i'm not saying that i've been wrong all
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:01.080]  these years about what the government's doing been doing nor has a alex we've certainly
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.920]  have backed up everything we say with documentation so you can use that documentation but this is
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.960]  like a silver bullet that's going to put the you know the werewolves out of business i mean it
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.880]  really is it's called the federal debt and the risk of financial crisis by the cbo it was written
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:23.960]  on july 27th i've been advertising it but i'm not kidding you man i want you to read this thing
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:32.920]  secondly secondly gold has hit a high now of 200 1200 and uh and 64 dollars an ounce which means
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:39.320]  that it's just sitting right behind its last market peak and i'm still offering the frank deal for
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:46.200]  the the international forecaster for a year and the frank for 270 dollars now if you take the 159
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:52.840]  year subscription that i'd buy for you off of that price you come up to 111 a piece or 555

[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:27.880]  these people that are sitting with their money in the bank right now in the stock market i mean you
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:33.560]  name it all this stuff is you know it's all in trouble and you can protect yourself by calling

[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:48.120]  liberty half presently right now for 975 which is 11 dollars on the internet now which is a huge

[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:26.440]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always

[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:09.480]  because there's a war on for your mind we've got 52 minutes left in broadcast today
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:17.480]  on wednesday july 7th 2010 and i know that the holocaust city bombing of the opera
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:22.600]  humor building was 15 years ago but it's more important than ever because on all these television
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.000]  documentaries they're invoking it again and saying that people that are against the new
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  world order and people that are against the federal government taking over in health care
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.280]  they're terrorists they're going to kill you and alex jones wants violence he wants to kill you
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.000]  when we actually call for the opposite and so it's clear that they're getting ready to play that card
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.680]  the hitari i even seven months before they got busted so they've got infiltrators in there and it
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.360]  turned out they had two the feds have covered up who they are but i think the fact that people
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.400]  exposed that there were some fake arrests there with at least two of the nine people
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:01.000]  caused that trial to fall apart and the judge said this was politically motivated and just a pr stunt
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  kind of like weiko yeah they were doing some weird stuff most of it exaggerated they could have
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.040]  picked up vernon howe aka david crash any day he went into town every day had an auto parts
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:16.120]  repair shop two miles away they wanted that big stunt and that came out of course in the atf documents
[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:21.480]  and then that really blew up in their face so the feds bombed oklahoma city and the evidence is
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:26.680]  just a hundred percent in triplicate up one side and down the other that the feds bombed oklahoma
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:31.160]  city and people who work for the federal government need to realize that none of you are safe so we're
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:35.240]  going to be talking to some very interesting individuals and well we've got two of them in
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.320]  here now towards the end i may try to get one of the other fellows in here who i've interviewed
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:45.000]  before who's got great connections and research between oklahoma city 15 years ago and 9 11
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.480]  nine years ago so that's coming up but in other news this is the type of stuff comes across my
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:55.880]  desk every day this is out of the korea times and it says can good emerge from bp oil spill and this
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:01.960]  is by kenneth rogoff and rogoff was the chief economist of the international monetary fund
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.240]  which is openly trying to set up world government and he says the fact that bp oil spill is on the
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.680]  cusp of becoming a political game changer of historic proportions we may get a carbon tax
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:17.720]  long advocated by a broad spectrum of economists it is a generalized version of a gas tax that
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.440]  hits all forms of carbon emissions including from coal and natural gas in principle one can create
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.400]  a cap and trade system of qualitative restrictions and accomplishments much the same thing and it
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:33.240]  seems to be more palatable to politicians who will jump through hoops to avoid using the word tax
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:39.400]  so the world bank and the former imf head because it's one group they're basically saying we're
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.800]  going to get a carbon tax out of that interesting little tidbit but don't worry we got thousands
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:49.640]  of emails with the heads of the un program hiding the fact that the earth's been cooling for 10 years
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:57.240]  uh stopped warming 15 years ago because the sun cooling off uk inquiry finds emails do not undermine
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:02.440]  climate science uk inquiry finds emails do not undermine climate science and then of course
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:07.880]  we wrote months ago about this inquiry it's all headed up by top global warming globalist this
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:16.520]  is like having uh joseph gerbils run the nurenberg trials on hitler i mean it or or having bubsi
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:23.480]  seagull run the trial of al capone or having the jenna visi's uh investigate uh the gambino's i mean
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:30.120]  it's it's incredible i mean it's worse than the fox guarding the henhouse and we have a key article
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  by steve watson up at prism planet dot com climate gate whitewash complete third inquiry clears
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:43.800]  everyone involved and then we have our top stories today they're up on gcm live dot com that's gcn

[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:50.120]  them to just spend four or five minutes a piece explaining why oklahoma city is important giving
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.280]  the basic facts and then you had some nice government documents about jolly and west

[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:10.520]  stuff this bizarre and in our face uh so we'll talk about that today and who you think macvay
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:15.560]  really was uh so chris emory why don't you take it first well thanks for having us on alex uh
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.680]  the reason oklahoma city is still relevant today is that it is a script that the federal
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:28.040]  government has followed for the last i'd say 35 years and it's easy to see when an action comes
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:33.560]  up like 9 11 or these uh militia raids and so forth you know pretty much you set up a clip
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:38.520]  when you know exactly what's going to happen and even before i get into filmmaking and uh the truth
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:42.440]  movement so to speak of research and this i was listening to your shows and i said you know what
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.160]  alex is right you hit all of the points and it's it's easy to see how they do this and they have
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.760]  no compunction they're not embarrassed they're actually very proud of the fact that they repeat
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.960]  these and it's insidious it doesn't get any worse than that people need to wake up and they need to
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:01.800]  know not only oklahoma city but wake up it's a consistent trail of events and it gets worse
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:06.600]  the the body count is worse as it goes along what we're trying to do with this film is bring out
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.520]  a lot of the information that people haven't been exposed to of james is going to elaborate
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:14.200]  on footage that has never been seen before that we've come our way we're going to highlight that
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:17.880]  you're interviewing uh terrence yakey's family about how they murdered him and you're getting
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:23.160]  all the interviews yes sir so uh anyway we want to have bring a completely fresh perspective on
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:28.040]  this uh information that has never been revealed before and we are very grateful for having the
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.200]  opportunity to be on here uh to reveal this information oh i'm glad to have you here this was
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:35.800]  just a the afterthought that you're here to interview me for the film i'm honored to be part of that
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:40.920]  yes but i mean but i mean get into just the let's say you had three minutes on national tv uh
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:46.360]  what would you say to the public about oklahoma city to get them to realize what really happened
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:52.680]  12 people were involved that we know of it as many as 18 uh the the scripted two perps and nobody
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:57.560]  else involved is complete bunk it is that is a slap in the face to the victim his family members
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:02.760]  and survivors people need to realize that we are going to expose information we choose to remember
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:07.320]  the deaths of these people in the truth versus a lie uh the second thing is that there were so many
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:12.120]  people so much resources there was more money spent covering up this case than actually investigating
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.760]  the proper manner the federal government actually went backwards they did a complete u-turn on all
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.400]  of the ethics all of the integrity all of the resources the professional everything they had
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:24.920]  they threw it out the window just to make sure that this was covered up because we know that
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:29.720]  there were actually assets government assets both in the united states and and elsewhere overseas
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.960]  that were involved and making sure that this thing came down they were supposed to stop it at
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.600]  last minute it backfired right in right at their feet well and that's what they always tell the
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:43.640]  mid-level people is oh we're going to stop this just like in uh the first world trade center
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:50.120]  attack right before weco i mean they hired an egyptian security agent amad salon had him
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.320]  cook a real bomb and he's going look here and let the bombing go forward he knew they were setting
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.960]  him up exactly so he recorded them and that came out in the new york times in cbs and they said look
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:03.320]  let it go ahead and happen we're going to do this and so that's how they always do it uh but i mean
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:08.120]  you have jane grand everybody else in the building seeing mcvay and the other guys in there planting
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:12.680]  the bombs and she thought it was gray sticks of butter it's right james you wanted to go and add
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.680]  a few things on there yeah um i think the one thing that stood out to me the most is i'm doing my
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:21.640]  research was the the ample bomb the story that it was it was ample that was used the ammonium nitrate
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:27.160]  and fuel oil mixture would create a cloud of nitric gas well we know because of the tarenchiki
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:33.480]  story that he was there within minutes of the bombing point tom hall out nobody had any problems
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:37.880]  with respiration we know vz lotton he was there he's a survivor nobody smelled it it would i mean
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.760]  and of course general part in the building blown out not in right and so i mean if it was not if
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:47.320]  it was info there would have been a huge nitric gas cloud over the building and initially right
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.560]  the minutes after the bombing this the wind was blown right into the building where vz lotton was
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:56.680]  nobody had any problems with that so i mean that that disproves the that info was used uh we have
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:02.440]  evidence uh the 40 year anniversary of a bombing uh in madison wisconsin is coming up this august
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:07.960]  and 23 people were sent to the hospital after uh the first responders were sent to the hospital
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.280]  because they were overcome uh with the uh the fumes you know so we know that that's the the
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.200]  pattern of it and they expect us to believe this it gets so cartoonish it's almost like
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:20.360]  wiley coyote tiptoeing in with the acne bomb you know and this is what they expect the american
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.840]  people to believe then we have the footage of them removing the other bombs that didn't go off
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:28.440]  i mean in the in parts of the building blown across the street the opposite direction of the
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.000]  truck bomb i mean it just goes on and then kill him the cop that was exposing it torturing him to
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.200]  death and and just just just i mean he goes on and on well the story of uh of taryn cheeky you
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:42.120]  mentioned the video that we did on that uh we just thought was important for that story to be told i
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:46.600]  mean that man was a was a real hero he worked himself beyond exhaustion to save people that day
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:51.480]  and he he said that that was the official story was not how it happened and you know i mean he was
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:55.480]  he was concerned for his safety right before they tortured him he thought he'd been poisoned right
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:59.240]  yeah he was sick he was they were talking about getting him to the hospital and he i think to
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:04.120]  protect his family he kind of isolated himself from them and he was on the way to a meeting
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:09.400]  that morning and uh he never made it you know and the they found him tortured to death yeah the
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:15.400]  the uh rope burns the possible rope burns on the neck uh the angle of the shot uh he uh bled out in
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.720]  the car uh went a quarter of supposedly walked a quarter of a mile after bleeding out and then
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:24.840]  shot himself at a downward angle you know it again it ruled suicide immediately and it's absurd
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.520]  the information that we're getting alexie let's know how you're doing on a break
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.440]  is that uh both there are good members of law enforcement local county state and federal
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:38.040]  level that have come forward either uh admitted their identity or wanted to be uh you know anonymous
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.040]  and there's a consistent pattern of okay this is the information that makes sense what the
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:46.360]  federal government and their like you said the cartoonist story simply can't hold its own there
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:50.760]  there is no factual foundation on it so we go back and we say okay we're going to present the
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:54.840]  information that we know is factual reams the documentation every single thing that we're
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:59.160]  going to have on the film we'll have a bibliography and there's going to be reference on all of that
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.320]  so there's no question and we're going to paint a completely different story we need to get the
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.080]  truth out on this people will have that as a foundation just like a lot of your movies to
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:10.920]  make a judgment call and what's going to happen in the future they have to know well then you've
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:16.440]  got the fbi coming and brandishing guns at hoppy heidelberg the head grand juror's house and telling
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:20.840]  him you're not going to call these witnesses you're going to shut up i mean you have the the motive
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:25.480]  i mean bill clinton on air force one a year after the attack he they said why did you get reelected
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.920]  your approval rating was way down it went way back up he said oklahoma city got me reelected
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:33.640]  well i mean that's why hitler fire bombed his own Reichstag the the whitewater documents were
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.840]  housed in the building for the whole investigation now he was going to go down like a light balloon
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:42.120]  was unbelievable may of that year congressional hearings are going to take them down on the

[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:25.720]  making a Oklahoma city film set to come out in the winter of this year okay you were going over
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:30.920]  incredible information about jolly and weston you know other tidbits things that are documented on
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:35.880]  record but are so bizarre it's we're true the stranger than fiction get into it we've got a
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:40.200]  researcher wendy painting that has been uncovering these documents and she's actually getting through
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:47.000]  information that the fbi hadn't even seen that was the actual records for the defense and we've
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:52.280]  got a hold of jolly west resume and i always that's mcphage doctor from the time he gets arrested to
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:58.760]  his execution yes um and i always suspected that he there was some link with you know mind control
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:05.160]  psychological warfare and sure enough on the second page of his resume we've got where he worked
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:09.880]  for the tavastock institute which is the top british mind control operation and then of course
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:14.920]  he came he was in the mk ultra 77 hearings as the number two man in the world in the mk ultra
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:20.760]  program under ewing camera and now this is has a tavastock institute has direct links back to
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.720]  when the fabian fabians absorbed the national socialist science through project paperclip
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:32.360]  uh so i mean this guy was really the inheritor of that knowledge uh and now he goes in uh to the
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:38.920]  the location there in el Reno in fact guys do i got a document cam shot of this i'll keep going
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.680]  and uh in el Reno and what did the warden say there well the the warden says he runs a clean
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.360]  operation that was at the federal correctional facility a mile and a half from where terry icky's
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:53.800]  body was found by the way and when he found out that there were um hypodermic needles on mcbay's
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:59.080]  trace is that's it i do not allow drugs that allow paraphernalia nothing in my prison what's
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:02.920]  going on here two weeks later who's relieved he was transferred to another facility and that's
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:10.200]  how the japanese created their mind control assassin uh uh ninjas was drugs and sex but
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:14.920]  please continue well uh we see that uh they said that he was so drugged up that mcbay was so drugged
[02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:20.440]  up at that point that he would have admitted to assassinating abraham lincoln um then uh jolly
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.200]  west proje took over after that uh dr john smith now he is currently in in psychiatric department
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:31.000]  at guantanamo bay so again these guys are there's a constant and they admit guantanamo bay has a
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.880]  cia base on it where they do mind control study that i mean that's msnbc wow man this is amazing
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:45.000]  and there's transcripts that show where jolly west is talking about working with jack ruby i mean he
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:51.400]  goes back that far um you know and and the the type of situation that jack ruby was going through
[02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:56.360]  in the the mental stress that he dealt with in comparing that with mcbay mcbay showed signs of
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  post-traumatic stress uh gulf one sorry gulf war syndrome prior to being deployed um dental visits
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.600]  i mean just a enormous and a number of dental visits in the military uh you know that that
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.120]  doesn't happen you know what were they doing with this guy it's that's where they knock you out you
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.760]  disappear a few days and all right and it's enough to pose solid questions you know well the state
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.880]  police when that when he got pulled over they said he was just you know uh uh really anger yeah go
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:27.560]  over what the cop said i mean he was out of his gourd he was surprised to see that mcbay was packing
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:34.280]  heat and he had uh several magazines of rounds and on on himself and in the car but the peculiar
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:38.760]  thing about charlie hanger a lot of folks don't realize it was his day off he's 62 miles outside
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:45.160]  of his precinct one of the world is charlie hanger doing zooming up by 35 going after in fact he
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:49.480]  didn't he wasn't chasing anybody in particular he was just cruising and he stopped mcbay for
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.880]  speeding violation and then to find out his his tag was off uh he wasn't registered with a lot of
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:58.520]  things that certainly pose a lot of questions number one charlie hanger wasn't supposed to be there
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:03.720]  so that's a huge red flag right no chemical residue on mcbay at all no explosive residue they
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:08.120]  checked his ears and i mean nothing and of course the feds have grabbed all these surveillance
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:13.080]  tapes and and fbi agents told the la times they've seen them it shows mcbay with these other men
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.960]  sure the feds have these tapes they're saying they don't exist how many tapes did uh did they copy
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:24.600]  over 580 tapes were actually uh actually copied and contracted for by the federal government uh
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:29.960]  there were survivors that sued for 24 the fbi lied said well they didn't exist and they said well
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:35.960]  we lied but here's another lie so out of a 580 tapes there were 120 of interest which means
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:40.600]  they had three copies of 120 tapes that's five times more than the original amount that the local
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:44.360]  news talked to the fbi agents they say there's one from right over the truck and you can see
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.000]  john of number two in mcbay biggest dallas so all of these things this body of information
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.440]  literally comes at us by accident or by people that are conscientious uh sitting on it for several
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:58.360]  years and they come and say look we need to get this out what do you make of all these people
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:03.640]  that were in prison with him and uh terry nickles and others with these signed affidavits that mcbay
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.840]  was like yeah i was in black ops we were setting up malicious i mean that fits with the mo we had
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:12.520]  their family was surprised mcbay's family was surprised he they said that he you know he worked
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:16.520]  for the government he wrote the letter saying that uh you know he was working for the cia smuggling
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:22.440]  drugs in uh so i mean they just assumed that he was he was black ops now this is on an fbi 302
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:26.120]  witness statement it's bonafide people were not pulling this stuff out of her ear this is
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:30.520]  documentation the the federal stay there we go long segment i'm gonna try to quit injecting
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:35.960]  points there there's so many but let's go over who mcbay was let's go over what's admitted i mean i mean
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:41.320]  this guy and for all you black ops people out there you know they're gonna set you up too okay they

[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:18.600]  about just you know all the bizarre things here in these fbi uh reports and and and now the affidavits
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:23.400]  and and all these witnesses and and mcvay telling people yes i'm a government agent and one day
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:27.320]  this is all going to come out and then you see him on tv doing interviews just looks like he's
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:31.720]  bombed out of his mind looks like a complete drug addict on the side of the road and he's got the
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:37.480]  top mind control doctor living because cameron had died by then uh jolly and west there in you
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:41.720]  know shooting him up with this stuff i mean this is incredible well you know if they would just
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:47.800]  show us the tapes you know there's there's how many tapes that um uh jesse trying to do i try to get
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:52.040]  jesse had contacted myself and a couple of the survivors member of the of the bombing committee
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:56.280]  and he says what locations should we ask for the tapes and we gave it to him he went to the federal
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:01.480]  government they obfuscated they delayed they gave him stuff of video footage of people walking in
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:05.640]  buildings two blocks away had nothing to do with the mirror building and hallways and and building
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:10.600]  next door i mean yes it was a complete garbage and uh so he was able to get about 20 tapes but
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:15.240]  they were useless i told jessia says jesse they have 118 in their possession that we know of
[02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:20.440]  that they duplicated three and three copies of so we know that was as they say of interest
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:25.320]  ask for every single one of those tapes he didn't get them they say national security um they say
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:30.040]  that i saw that in the news and the and and papers and national security on these videos
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:35.560]  because it's national security that the globalist blew that building up right and that's why we're
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:40.040]  calling the uh documentary a noble lie that's from plateaus the republic where it's the lie that the
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:44.760]  elite tell to maintain social harmony in their in their position you know because i mean there was
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:49.640]  just again it was so ridiculous they just keep perpetuating this lie and expect people to believe
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:54.120]  it i guess for you know national security it would be it would be against social harmony um
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:58.520]  if they would just show us the tapes you know it would answer all the questions it would answer
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:03.720]  the john doe questions um you know as as far as who was in the truck let's go back before we get
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:09.240]  into that because we we left off of that who is mcvay i mean i mean this guy disappears out of
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.640]  the military he's showing up at all these militias all over the country he's telling family on black
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.600]  ops infiltrating militias he's telling others i'm bringing narcotics in for the government he was a
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:22.920]  sharpshooter in the u.s. army during the first uh prison gulf war in fact he was so good that he was
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:26.920]  on the security detail for a general schwarzkopf which means you really have to get your numbers
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:32.760]  accuracy and everything and he was commended ironically enough he was giving a uh a medal of
[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:37.480]  commendation when he was in prison actually in the county jail in denver awaiting trial um that's
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.600]  how good he was the army was obligated to give him that medal after he got out um the fbl
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:47.880]  track of him for well we know at least four months as as long as six months and that's when he turned
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:54.200]  up uh with the bill bean story up in uh south dakota or north dakota at uh uh see here was the
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.360]  national guard training base yeah we're they actually train in explosives so and there's
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:03.000]  clear video of him at the explosives base a year after he supposedly out of the military and that
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.040]  that's all been vetted out by linguistics experts from the university of utah mr bean did a very good
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:13.640]  job superb job everything thorough research right there so that's our clad um he had at least four
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:19.000]  different identities that we know of uh south dakota um driver's license michigan driver's license
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  arizona driver's license in arkansas driver's he's just like lea harvey oswald who has now
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:30.680]  has been declassified was at a cia base in uh japan and was allowed to infiltrate russia and
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.400]  they're allowed to come back to the us i mean here are these spies you know shooting the president
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:39.240]  now the people that's it's one thing to ask mcveigh it's the people that he actually surrounds
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:43.800]  himself with andrea straussmeyer national from west germany dad's number three with a homo col
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:49.160]  administration traveling throughout the u.s with a expired visa for four years no gainful employment
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:53.720]  all of his credit card bills are being paid for come to find out he actually uh had the passcode
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:57.720]  to the federal billing at downtown four worth while he's in trying to infiltrate these different
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:02.920]  militia groups both in texas and in oklahoma four weeks before oklahoma city bombing happened
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:07.560]  he was literally kicked out of texas by the militia groups they actually scouted him going
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:13.240]  into the rear door of the federal court courthouse punching the keypad the security keypad 24 hours
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:17.240]  later they said look you got you got three days to get out of this the state or else we can't
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.800]  guarantee your safety where's he go element city in oklahoma unbelievable and that's got the southern
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.600]  prairie law center running it absolutely they're all over that like white on rice so anyway you
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:30.840]  wanted to talk about the tapes i guess we had other information on that well now we covered
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:34.520]  that i mean basically they're just that they if they just told us they caught on fire or something
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:38.760]  it'd be at least more believable but they just you know they're like well no uh they're that all
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:43.000]  of the tapes outside tapes in all the separate buildings through separate security systems
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:48.040]  all change their tapes at the same time you know it's it's absurd but we have fbi agents who told
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:52.760]  the la times and others because i've had these articles that they have seen the videos and it
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:57.800]  shows tim mcvay with yondo number two secret service uh memorandum actually two weeks after
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:01.640]  the bombing it's right there and that was uh actually entered in the state trial for terry
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:06.760]  terry nickles in march of 2000 and nickles is signed an affidavit saying that mcvay was black ops
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:11.160]  yes he has no reason to make this stuff up terry has everything to lose and nothing to gain
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.040]  by that click what about the new guy that i interviewed him he's not new he's been around
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:20.360]  for years but we were able to get the first interview in over a decade uh and uh mr cooper and he was
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:26.840]  saying uh that uh you know mcvay basically told him the same thing and they told him we won't execute
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:32.920]  you you'll just shut up david paul hammer hammer hammer not good yeah i'm sorry uh there's there's
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:38.840]  some very good information to support that again david has some solid info and wendy has been able
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.720]  to corroborate a lot of that yeah and chris was actually able to go out and scout some locations
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:48.120]  that was talked about in the book that that there's no way that uh david paul hammer would have that
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:53.240]  knowledge of that unless someone that was there you know told him about it if i may preface this
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:57.720]  elix before i decided to really jump feet first into this project i took compact evidence with me
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:02.600]  and we had a small film crew we literally toured five miles around the crime scene and we're trying
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:07.080]  to piece all of the stuff from the official story together didn't make any sense then we went back
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:12.440]  to what the committee had gathered in a 572 page report the ogloma's uh bombing investigation
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:16.920]  committee okay see bombing gotten out if you don't mind we'll uh plug yeah led by charles key
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:20.920]  unbelievable state rep so we went through that book over a matter of about four weeks and we're
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:25.400]  looking at all of these locations and we're literally painting a mosaic of yes this does make
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.200]  sense physically these guys the 12 perps and the additional six there may or may have not
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:34.680]  known that they're working for the government in various capacities they were at these locations
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:39.960]  and it was a at least four different groups working together in concert to make this thing go off it
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:45.000]  wasn't too lone not striving at a info truck above in front of the murray building it's ludicrous
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  you know 30 minutes or more for them to drive from that park in kansas to the location in
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.720]  oklahoma city and by that point the money of nitrate fuel mixture goes inert they would have
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:02.440]  to stop it along the way and remixed it the arab's uh at least 3000 plus brought in by uh
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:07.400]  george bush senior than a couple thousand by clinton the media investigating them claiming
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.720]  that they were connected in with some of these other people from your deep research is that a
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:16.280]  red herring because that looks like classic government ops where they just have all sorts
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:22.120]  of other operations coming in at the same time to create a fog of war yes it is and uh there were
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:26.120]  actually stunt doubles of mcvey that we know of there were two teams that carry this thing off
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:30.840]  one to actually do the dirty deed and of course mcvey and his useful idiots to take the fall
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:36.200]  there were many concentric circles and in play exactly we we of course none of them know all
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.800]  of it i mean it's like the london 90 uh the uh seven seven bombing clearly if you research that
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.600]  they hired these guys to be part of a drill they had the drill and uh they they blew them up on
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:51.320]  board the uh the bus and the train some of them got away it was even in the news at canary wharf the
[02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:56.200]  police machine gun them and just said you didn't see that i mean it's so easy to do this stuff
[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:00.360]  it's it's amazing it just they run the same script and it is it's so disgusting and just
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:05.320]  it's appalling to see how they they pull this off continuing with the concentric team sorry
[02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:12.280]  uh we have uh basically the two teams downtown uh there were at least uh 12 individuals uh
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:17.720]  they recited as early as six o'clock that morning actually running jogging the route the escape routes
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:22.680]  they were going to take well at the same time the okloma bomb squad is at the courthouse across
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:30.040]  from the mural building uh looking for explosives and they never found any there that says reports
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:35.240]  eyewitness reports and that is earliest with 6 a.m. 6 6 15 a.m. there was the okloma county sheriff's
[02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:41.320]  department and the at of uh actually doing a uh a roadblock a bottleneck 10 uh blocks away checking
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:47.080]  vehicles for incendiary devices and what about the head of the fbi anti-terrorism crew lying and
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.240]  saying he was in dallas and then got a flight but then later it was proven credit card receipts he
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.440]  was there days before dandy colson drove up at least 18 hours before the credit card receipts
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.320]  at the embassy switches us cooperate that so we're not quite sure why he chose to as they say distort
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:07.640]  the truth but that's his his deal so the credibility right it was gone he i can't believe anything he
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:13.480]  says ironically uh janerino removed him from the case four days after the bombing because he had
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:17.800]  basically turned this is look i show up for work every day i'm supposed to do a good job on here
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:21.800]  i want to investigate this case correctly and she says no we don't need you on the team here
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:26.440]  we're bringing in another team to completely corrupt this what about atf uh because you had
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:32.120]  some of the emergency crews saying atf was there in bomb gear and and and in their raid gear saying
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.280]  bandage me up i was on the ninth floor and they're like everybody it's on record that that thing was
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.080]  empty and they weren't on the ninth floor the elevator was blown out that's right exactly in fact
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:45.640]  there was uh dr chumlee that uh told these guys to take a flying leap uh tiffany bible she was a
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:50.440]  paramedic uh she arrived four to five minutes um after and they she said that there were agents in
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:56.840]  uh full full gear um and then you've got other witnesses saying that uh they overheard the atf
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:01.160]  says this is why we got the page not to come in today so i mean there there is a amount of
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:07.240]  evidence of foreign knowledge um the fbi evacuation of the building a separate building that morning
[02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:11.560]  and it's because the very small part of the government's involved with foreign black ops and
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:15.240]  others that this does come out people always say well this stuff would come out of it was real it
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.120]  did come out yes and it's it in fact it's out in full view right now and that's why we're able to
[02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:24.680]  assemble out of the information folks i can guarantee you right now you have never heard i'd say
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:29.320]  probably 70 percent of this has never been uh posted well i'll tell you what for your safety i mean
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:33.960]  obviously the film's coming out in the in the uh winter and i can't wait to carry that info wars
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.720]  dot com and get it out to people i know you guys are great researchers have done a lot of original
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:42.040]  work but for your own safety and for you know knowledge out there i know you already released
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.000]  some of this footage it's so important tell people some of the new developments you've
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:50.120]  discovered we have yeah we have over 10 hours of footage that hasn't been seen by the general public
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:56.760]  before and we and over a thousand photographs we've got excellent footage of the crater and it's
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:01.560]  completely offset from the large bite in the building and as general parton said that the
[02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:07.720]  building with the the first bomb would have been around the third floor well you can actually see
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.760]  i mean it's probably you know 30 40 feet offset from the the small crater where the car bomb was
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:17.880]  and then the floors are actually contaved around the third floor so you could see where that was
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:23.880]  the biggest bite in the building where it blasted that out um you had people said that they heard
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:30.520]  what sounded like a rifle shot a high-powered rifle shot which is um uh it works the same way with
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:36.600]  c4 it wouldn't have been as loud of an explosion and that's where uh you hear all of the the survivors
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.360]  talking about rubble coming down people getting under their desks they had time to get under their
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:46.360]  desk and then the car bomb goes off outside you have the bus tilts twice twice six blocks away
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:51.320]  14 people were in that building had enough wear with all the cognitive ability to take cover
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:55.480]  that simply wouldn't have happened if they would have been hit just and you see the repeat with
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:01.720]  the feds they love to have uh their diversion you know the plane flies in then the buildings blow
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:07.080]  up and then no one notices the 47 story building not hit that falls in perfectly we interviewed
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.080]  the guy who was the deputy of emergency management he says yeah there were bodies you know they blew
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:16.600]  it up then he dies mysteriously uh but i mean it's the same thing here yeah real bombs go off
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:21.000]  diversionary truck bomb because the public's gonna go well how do they get bombs inside
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.800]  i mean it's just sick how they how they're how their psychopathic brains work it's criminology
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:30.600]  they do the same stuff over and over again and the lack of humanity i mean the the children
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:35.080]  that were in the building well it's a gambit i mean when you understand the the the military officer
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:39.720]  mind and this goes back thousands of years they write about it now you know let's say you're
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:43.960]  alexander the great or your julia caesar or somebody else if you send out a detachment to
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:48.680]  say 50 guys uh into a valley where you know an army is yet but you want to draw them out and see
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:53.320]  their numbers you know your 50 guys are going to get cut off and killed but now your argument is
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:57.880]  that'll save a hundred thousand of your main army because now you've gotten that intel means just
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:02.840]  by the means and so the ends justifies the means that the noble lie and so america needs to take
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:06.680]  over the arabs are dangerous we're going to blow these buildings and when we need a pearl harbor
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:11.320]  level event as the pinac document said by the vice president right to get this done and it's the same
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:16.040]  thing oklahoma city they've got their collectivist world government all these states were moving to
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:19.720]  get out of the un and declared to detent the amendment well we'll just blow the hell out of
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:22.680]  this building and blame it on the patriots and that's what they did within 10 minutes they'll
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.840]  let them said talk radio rush limbaugh it's your fault you know and they're already digging this
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:31.640]  this back up to uh demonize the renewed patriot movement in this country uh you know uh we've
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:37.240]  got a researcher k beach is you know gonna uh talk about the um uh myac report and the department
[02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:42.600]  of homeland security right-wing extremism lexicon and how they they use the the uh oakland city
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:48.120]  bombing uh to to demonize the tea party it's like oh if you believe in supporting the constitution
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:52.200]  and you oppose tyranny well you're you're a mcvay you're one of those government hate oh no they
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:57.720]  say i'm a mcvay and well i tell you the southern prairie law center and that and that uh chris
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:01.880]  matthews document or they call me by my first name oh alex we we're not saying he's going to
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:07.080]  cause violence but his followers are so so now i guess i'm i've never talked to these people but
[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:10.680]  they're on a first name basis that's how much they're because i know they don't like it that i talk
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:15.400]  about how they were running out uh elliems city well we were doing the 15th anniversary of the
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:19.160]  oakland sea bombing press conference at the same time there was a tea party gone going on outside
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:23.720]  at the in oakland city and this is uh at the at the time that uh there was a lot of talk about
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.960]  militias again and nobody was really even talking about they were talking about like a volunteer
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.280]  force to take uh take over because all the national guard is deployed uh and we you know we have a
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:35.880]  lot of natural disaster in oakland they wanted to have some volunteers ready to go in and help
[02:48:35.880 --> 02:48:40.440]  and that's all that charles several defense yeah 22 states have charles key wants a militia to
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.320]  attack the government and all of that information that came out was not on the tape it was not in
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:50.440]  the interview the editor took the the reporter's story and completely uh fabricated all this stuff
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.120]  well no that's like rand paul you there's like a two second delay and he's like excuse me yes
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:01.240]  yes i can hear you oh you you agree with getting rid of the civil rights act uh no i don't and then
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:05.960]  they ran the headline he says get rid of the civil rights act i mean these are hoaxers sure these
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:10.360]  are slime bags these are crooks and it makes you wonder what they're cooking up because in the public
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:16.920]  mind they're trying to link you know patriot movement to militias to uh violence muslims yeah
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.440]  so so now they're trying to say that the militias have linked up with al-qaeda can you believe those
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:27.800]  dirty american i mean yeah the good old boys are working with al-qaeda and when that's admitted cia i
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:31.640]  mean folks they're getting ready to set you up the offshore banks know you're awake to what
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:35.880]  they've done and they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on you unless we trump them with the info
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:41.000]  and let me tell you this hidden 15 years ago people know about false flag terror now it has entered
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.440]  the lexicon and that's why it's so important for this information to get out now because they're
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.800]  again they're using it to demonize the renewed patriot movement in this country you guys better
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:54.840]  hurry they could they could stage uh they could stage uh more uh stack attacks more Oklahoma

[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:15.560]  because literally cognitive and mentally it was so overwhelming it was so bad it was so deep it was
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:21.400]  so far down the rabbit hole but um well when you know they're lying about that then then you start
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.320]  everything's a lie exactly well that's why we want to get the truth i mean i believe that bravery

[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.720]  fellow who i've interviewed before we'll have him back on when the film comes out but he's done
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:55.240]  deep research and he's part of the film team holland uh you've you've worked on the oklahoma
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:55:01.320]  city uh connections to oklahoma just real fast rattle some of those off well we have very uh a
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:05.640]  lot of concrete connections for one who's saying now who's saying he who was named as john doe number
[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:12.520]  two by jana davis at kflor tv in oklahoma filmed named specifically by witnesses on the scene as
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:17.640]  that was the man who was in the truck who say now who's saying he he later works for a boston's
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:22.200]  Logan airport on the day of 9 11 he was a baggage handler and as i recall two of the hijackers
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:26.040]  floater there and that's where their luggage who went through and they found incriminating will
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:31.640]  and so forth and then you have like melvin latimore a man who's uh original credit cards were used
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:36.760]  in the first world trade storm bombing in 1993 he was a known confederate of tim mcvay and the
[02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:43.480]  tim mcvay in 1995 before the bombing and later on he was a roommate of the 20th hijacker the 20th
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:48.920]  uh 9 11 and the guy that got his head sawed off he was at an air base and loaned uh his laptop to
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:53.960]  one of the 9 11 people was on a bus in oklahoma city and loaned his laptop to one of the hijackers
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:58.760]  who used to email the 20th brought a bus actually loaned it to someone an unknown person who used
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:04.200]  it to email the 20th hijacker in minnesota but this was like in in year 2000 i mean they didn't
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:08.200]  have wireless access on buses back then i don't think they even have it now the point is this is
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:13.080]  a spy nest yeah so i mean there was there was at least one researcher researcher who appeared
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:17.720]  before the 9 11 commission to testify that norman oklahoma was home to an al-qaeda cell prior to
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:22.280]  9 11 well no one's ever been prosecuted arrested in this cell so obviously what was going on there
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:26.600]  may have been some kind of logistic logistics or support cell going on but there were a lot of
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.560]  things going on and the only way to view all of these events uh world trade center 93 okam city
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.880]  9 11 is that it's it's they're not isolated they are connected they use some of the same people they
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:41.560]  use the same so p's the same cover-up methods they disregard the videotapes the videotapes of the
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:45.640]  pentagon we've never seen a plane crashing into the pentagon um you know we've never seen the
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.040]  videotapes what happened in front of the murray building they wire building fly a plane in yes
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:54.120]  wire building bomb a truck it's not bad enough that they blow up a truck bomb outside the building
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.040]  they fly a plane in the building they got a wire the building with explosives to increase the body
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:03.400]  count the same so p and in less than one of the points about this movie is unless we confront
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:07.240]  the people are doing this freedom of justice this is going to keep on going it's going to keep on
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:12.520]  happening and each time it's going to get worse how did you get involved in this um i'm from
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:17.560]  oklahoma i started research in case and i started doing some research on my own putting out a
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.320]  handprinted newsletter that would hand out and i met chris emory at an event where he's handing out
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:25.560]  copies of final report september of 05 we started to collaborate we start collaborating other
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:30.920]  uh conferences or truth conferences low power fm's radio shows and this is uh
[02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:33.960]  just another step in trying to expose the truth that's been an honor it's been
[02:57:34.520 --> 02:57:38.760]  you know this meeting chris really sent me on the path to find the right finding the right thing
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:44.520]  to do here and that's holland o vander new and hoff and now it's alright vand in new and hoff vand
