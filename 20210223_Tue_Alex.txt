[00:00.000 --> 00:17.240]  Oh, got my bag, and we're going to go outside, we're going to refuse the stupid test, until
[00:17.240 --> 00:32.520]  everybody refuses the stupid test. So, yeah. Hi. Yes, we have a medical condition, so I
[00:32.520 --> 00:37.000]  don't need to wear one. And I'm also a Canadian citizen, and this is a violation of our charter
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.000]  rights section six, and a violation of the emergency act 14.1. So I'm going to be declining
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.200]  your test today. Thank you very much. No problem. I'll happily do that. Everybody in here.
[00:47.200 --> 00:53.440]  If you are a Canadian citizen, simply deny the test, deny their quarantine, and there's
[00:53.440 --> 00:59.640]  nothing you can do. They cannot stop you. They cannot force you. You are a citizen. You have
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.920]  rights. If you want to win the life for two hours, let them put your nose, go right ahead.
[01:04.920 --> 01:12.640]  But if you have a brain and you have balls, they say no. That's fine. I have a body. I have a
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.080]  camera on as well. So, yes, everybody, this is what you do. You say no to their test, no to
[01:18.080 --> 01:22.280]  their quarantine, and if you're a citizen or a permanent resident, there's absolutely nothing
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.920]  they can do but acknowledge that you have rights, and they have to respect that. Is that not true?
[01:26.920 --> 01:35.080]  Say it's true for the camera, everybody. Say it's true. I do, of course. That's not a problem.
[01:35.080 --> 01:41.000]  I refuse to take your test. I refuse to take your test a million percent. And everybody in here,
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.840]  Canadian citizens, you can refuse the test. Just say no. Don't wait in line, and there's
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.720]  nothing they can do. Okay, I will not yell. That's true. But I just want you guys to acknowledge
[01:53.720 --> 02:02.560]  for 91,000 people watching that anybody can refuse the test. Perfect. Thank you. You guys
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.560]  hear that? Straight from the horses' nose, straight from the police, refuse the test.
[02:06.560 --> 02:13.120]  Oh, I'm getting a ticket. Oh, not another one of those tickets. You know, tell everybody how
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.560]  many people have been convicted of those tickets in Canada. Answer? Zero. How many people have
[02:18.560 --> 02:24.720]  been charged? Thousands. How many people convicted? Zero. Why? It's a violation of our charter rights.
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.840]  So when that ticket goes to court, they throw it the f*** out. It's that simple. So I'm waiting
[02:30.840 --> 02:36.360]  for my little five. Thanks, guys. I just want everybody to acknowledge that this is perfectly
[02:36.360 --> 02:44.440]  legal, perfectly acceptable. Thank you. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Another
[02:44.440 --> 02:53.360]  transmission, another edition of the Alex Jones show. Thank you so much for joining us here on
[02:53.360 --> 03:04.080]  this February 23rd, 2021 broadcast. That man's name is Chris Sky. I want to get him on the show.
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.080]  And it's the same thing in the UK. Multi-thousand pound fines if you refuse the test. Since when
[03:10.080 --> 03:16.120]  can the government outside of even a law, they didn't pass a law, tell you under a regulation
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.920]  they're going to do this. But that's what Boris Johnson has done. That is what Trudeau has done.
[03:22.920 --> 03:29.040]  And let's not forget, we'll play it for you next segment. We'll play it for you next segment. And
[03:29.040 --> 03:36.680]  that is the information where Mr. Trudeau said he wants to model Canada off of communist China's
[03:36.680 --> 03:46.440]  basic dictatorship. Just, you know, basic dictatorship. Your basic Mao Zedong, your basic
[03:46.440 --> 03:53.280]  Adolf Hitler, your basic Joseph Stalin, your basic Fidel Castro, with a bunch of cooing,
[03:53.280 --> 04:01.320]  slithering women that are, again, acting like they're at a male strip club or something. It's
[04:01.320 --> 04:09.120]  just disgusting how cool it is with women to live in tyranny. But actually history shows,
[04:09.120 --> 04:15.360]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men. That's why
[04:15.360 --> 04:22.760]  80% of advertising globally on average is targeted at women, because women lead the culture. And if
[04:22.760 --> 04:29.240]  men won't be leaders and stand up against other corrupt men that are manipulating women, society
[04:29.240 --> 04:38.520]  absolutely falls apart on us in a big, big, big way. All right, start your engines. The main
[04:38.520 --> 04:46.880]  transmission begins in T minus 60 seconds, and we are absolutely ready and prepared with incredible
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.280]  information as humanity awakens and begins to fight back against the globalist tyranny.
[04:51.280 --> 04:59.480]  Implewars.com is fighting on tomorrow's news today, today, today, today. I shall
[04:59.480 --> 05:06.040]  supplement for two reasons, because they work, they're real, they're powerful, and because it's a
[05:06.040 --> 05:12.800]  giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works. That's why it exponentially
[05:12.800 --> 05:21.320]  grows. So whether it's sawpaw meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, prostaguard,
[05:21.320 --> 05:27.360]  or whether it is the super high grade organic bottom of B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the
[05:27.360 --> 05:35.320]  PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force, or the pure deep breath crystal iodine X2, these are all the very
[05:35.320 --> 05:41.760]  best supplements you're going to find in already great market of high quality products out there,
[05:41.760 --> 05:45.960]  and it funds the Implewars. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are,
[05:45.960 --> 05:51.240]  you're fighting the Implewars, you can't lose. Implewars delivers in spades. Please visit
[05:51.240 --> 05:55.640]  Implewars.com and get the products today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on
[05:55.640 --> 06:19.880]  air at ImplewarsStore.com. From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones. It's
[06:19.880 --> 06:27.960]  Tuesday, February 23rd, 2021. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We are living in incredible times.
[06:29.160 --> 06:38.440]  If this broadcast was able to get out to the governments of the world and to the peoples of
[06:38.440 --> 06:43.320]  the world, we would not be going into the horrible nightmare situation rendering. The good news is
[06:43.320 --> 06:48.360]  for many years, it was able to reach the general public. We still reach a giant audience of hardcore
[06:48.360 --> 06:54.440]  folks that are awake and informed, but when it turns to reaching new people unfettered every day,
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.600]  I am locked up in a phantom zone. You are locked up in a phantom zone until you use your email and
[07:02.600 --> 07:08.920]  your text message and your word of mouth to direct people to Implewars.com, newswars.com,
[07:08.920 --> 07:14.840]  and band.video. I will remind you at the start of the transmission to remember how important you
[07:14.840 --> 07:23.240]  are and how powerful this information is only when you take action. Okay. We are seeing the
[07:23.240 --> 07:30.680]  normalization of depopulation. The globalists will run a scientific dictatorship where the
[07:30.680 --> 07:37.160]  science of tyranny is law, and they have us all in a giant Milgram experiment where they found
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.600]  that upwards of 90% of people, if they're told by authority figures, by successive approximation
[07:42.600 --> 07:47.640]  by incrementalism, will kill men, women, and children in order to do so by the government,
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.920]  by authority figures. And so this is a giant Milgram experiment similar to the Stanford research
[07:56.040 --> 08:00.920]  incidents as well. So that's why I'm begging you, when I talk about these things, write these
[08:00.920 --> 08:06.680]  things down and then go look up the information because look at these headlines and I see these
[08:06.680 --> 08:10.840]  every day and they try to suppress them. We're going to post this Implewars.com,
[08:10.840 --> 08:17.400]  it's from naturalnews.com. Immunologists warns Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccines
[08:17.400 --> 08:23.720]  may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. It's in the prestigious,
[08:23.720 --> 08:30.600]  from a prestigious scientist group, it is in the prestigious paper published in the Journal of
[08:30.600 --> 08:40.280]  Microbiology and Infectious Diseases by Dr. Klassen. We're immunologist Jay Bart Klassen.
[08:40.280 --> 08:43.240]  We're going to be looking at all this, but oh, let's just not believe him.
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.120]  Here's another headline in FullWars.com, December last year. Doctors raise alarm over
[08:50.120 --> 08:55.480]  COVID vaccine linked to infertility. That was just one part of it. Here's the actual lawsuit
[08:55.480 --> 09:02.120]  filed with hundreds of pages of exhibits and videos and major studies by Dr. Michael Yedon,
[09:02.120 --> 09:08.440]  the former chief scientist at Pfizer. Oh, you see where are the whistleblowers? Well, there he is.
[09:08.440 --> 09:17.720]  And medical doctor Wolfgang Wudard, head of the EU advisory main commission. Very prestigious.
[09:17.720 --> 09:23.160]  You read this, it says the same thing, that the protein in it is associated with Alzheimer's.
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.400]  Everybody knows that it's a certain protein in the brain that people have with Alzheimer's.
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.120]  Guess what? It's the same protein this produces in your cells. Isn't that loving?
[09:34.120 --> 09:43.640]  Isn't that liberal? And there's nothing like dying that way. It's so fun. So I guess, you know,
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.960]  his father died of Alzheimer's, so Bill Gates wants to pass on the love. Because the main
[09:47.960 --> 09:58.520]  vaccine he's behind is the mRNA Pfizer operation. So we're going to go over that for you today.
[09:58.520 --> 10:04.680]  And of course, it attacks the placenta, and it then loads the cell full of the protein,
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.280]  doesn't just slough it. And then when that cell dies or divides, you could have a major autoimmune
[10:10.280 --> 10:14.440]  response. But that's down the road. And you won't know quite exactly what happened to you when it
[10:14.440 --> 10:18.680]  hits you. See, old Billy Boy knows how to kill you in five, 10, 15 years. You'll get a certain
[10:18.680 --> 10:22.520]  percentage drop over dead in a couple of days, like, hang on, Aaron, you'll get a certain percentage
[10:22.520 --> 10:25.880]  of nursing homes that drop dead. They're already so old, they kind of deserve it. You know,
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.680]  hell, you get 15% of a ward or a nursing home dive. They take it. But that's in the
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.360]  VARS or a reporting system or VAERS. But they're old. They kind of deserve it. You know,
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.680]  Hank Aaron had a good life. Just bye-bye, Hanky. There you go. And they lied and said the autopsy
[10:46.680 --> 10:55.480]  said he didn't die of the shot. No autopsy was done. Robert Kennedy Jr. got banned off Facebook for
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.320]  talking about Hank Aaron and showing studies saying it was killing old people. This is all true.
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.200]  And they said, oh, you lied. The coroner said he didn't die of that. Turned out no autopsy.
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.440]  He went and interviewed him last week. But you won't see that because he's banned on Facebook.
[11:10.360 --> 11:11.960]  Then let me just continue here for you.
[11:14.280 --> 11:20.280]  Here's the actual study, COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines and the risk of cryon disease. They
[11:20.280 --> 11:28.520]  have another name for that, spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease. You know, they don't call
[11:28.520 --> 11:34.600]  it chemtrails when they manipulate the weather. They call it high altitude aerosol spraying
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.040]  weather modification. They're like, oh, there's no such thing as chemtrailing. We do spray stuff
[11:40.040 --> 11:45.400]  out of the jet engines, though, mixed with the fuel to darken the earth. That's all true. We
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.840]  just don't call it chemtrails, boys and girls. And same thing here. There's no, this doesn't
[11:50.840 --> 11:55.320]  cause mad cow because that's really what Alzheimer's is, is prions, proteins, protein
[11:55.320 --> 12:01.560]  crystals in the brain. No, no, no, no, no, no. There's no vaccines in general aren't linked to
[12:01.560 --> 12:06.840]  mad cow because we don't call it mad cow. We call it spongiform encephalopathy. And it's a different
[12:06.840 --> 12:12.440]  crystal that you get when you eat cows that ate meat because they're not supposed to. And then
[12:12.440 --> 12:17.560]  the protein goes to the blood brain barrier through their guts because cows aren't meant to eat.
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.120]  They're not omnivores. They're not carnivores. And so they're only supposed to eat. That's why
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.520]  they have three stomachs. And then they ferment it in their stomachs of the grass. And so if you feed
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.720]  cows that it then gets into their bones, gets into their joints. And then you can eat it and grow the
[12:31.720 --> 12:38.680]  crystals in your brain. That's a different type of spongiform encephalopathy. But the protein
[12:38.680 --> 12:45.800]  that is created by this tends to fold in the study they looked at. And that is what creates
[12:45.800 --> 12:52.120]  a different type of prion. But hey, nothing more fun than a good old prion.
[12:54.520 --> 13:00.520]  Liberal. Whoa, it's so nice. What's going to happen? And it's already happening.
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.680]  Large numbers are dying. Large numbers are becoming brain damage. I mean, I've got crew works right
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.040]  out here whose mom's a chief nurse at a nursing home. And they gave them all the first round of the
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.280]  shot a few months ago. And none of them came out to dinner. None of them got up for like a week
[13:14.280 --> 13:24.120]  and some of them died. Man. But the nurse says something like, shut up. You don't know anything.
[13:24.680 --> 13:27.800]  Besides, there's too many of these damn old people around here. Let's get rid of them.
[13:27.800 --> 13:32.440]  But all of you, you can get early onset of neurological disorders. And then Fauci'll
[13:32.440 --> 13:38.120]  say some new virus is doing that to you. Because Fauci's a hardcore killer. Oh, he hatched the
[13:38.120 --> 13:42.360]  whole HIV thing, everything else. He's a really nice man. Why do you think Bill Gates likes him so
[13:42.360 --> 13:47.960]  much? He looks up to him. Because Bill Gates, his father, funded Fauci. Fauci's going to get
[13:47.960 --> 13:52.440]  you and your family. Don't you worry. So all you good FBI agents that serve the Democrats,
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.160]  you roll those sleeves up, you're 35, 40 years old, and you're going to have Alzheimer's when
[13:57.160 --> 14:04.840]  you're 55. You're going to get euthanized too. But it doesn't matter. You're a G-man. Oh, yeah.
[14:05.960 --> 14:10.840]  Yeah. Just like Cuomo sitting on all those old folks over there to die knowingly under Fauci's
[14:10.840 --> 14:17.800]  order. Yep. He ain't going to do nothing about that. But you're G-man. G-man. Yeah, Americans.
[14:19.560 --> 14:23.000]  Here. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, but it doesn't matter. It's better. You know,
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.960]  the British government gave pregnant women the shot and had a bunch of miscarriages,
[14:25.960 --> 14:30.280]  gave over 75 a shot, a bunch of them died at convulsions, and Guillain-Marais and Archelabsy
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.840]  and convulsions. And what was the other one? A whole bunch of them. It was Bill's palsy.
[14:34.840 --> 14:38.360]  A whole bunch of those. Let's try to kind of hard to cover up when your face is paralyzed
[14:38.360 --> 14:44.040]  hour after you take the shot or the next morning. But it's okay because it's liberal. But oh, look
[14:44.040 --> 14:49.000]  at this. The WHO, who's our boss, had said don't give it to pregnant women because it's a little
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.360]  obvious when a large portion lose the baby. They said, hell, let's just get over this.
[14:52.360 --> 15:00.600]  Yes. WHO, Green Lights, mRNA vaccine experimentation. Experimentation. Never
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.760]  authorized, never tested on animals on pregnant women and newborn infants. Yeah.
[15:05.640 --> 15:08.840]  It's like, man, this baby's retarded. This baby never talks.
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.480]  Because they never got a chance to. Then they just say, oh, something else wrong with them.
[15:15.480 --> 15:19.240]  See, because autism was the test. They could give hundreds of millions of boys brain damage
[15:19.240 --> 15:24.280]  with the vaccines, which is all done by the time. Then now they can kill billions slowly and everybody
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.160]  will just go along with it and have little 10k runs for, you know, half the kids can't talk and,
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.760]  you know, half the folks above 50 can't talk. And there'll be the studies that they all took
[15:32.760 --> 15:35.800]  the shots, but they won't care because their families won't want to admit what they did.
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.040]  It'll be shut up. Don't talk about that. You're hurting the victims' feelings of,
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.440]  we don't know why they're all dying, but it's still liberal.
[15:44.440 --> 15:52.120]  Well, let's hurt the babies and the mommies. Yes. Yes. Kill them. Kill them. Liberal. I love
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.280]  you, Bill Gates. Murder them for safety. I love your pink sweaters.
[15:58.120 --> 16:04.920]  I love the Patriot blend. Wake up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it.
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.760]  We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's
[16:10.760 --> 16:16.920]  what fills my soul. Wake up America Patriot blend coffee. Folks, we have had this coffee for years
[16:16.920 --> 16:23.320]  at infowarstore.com years. Never raise the price. Never. The Wake up America blend, the best coffee,
[16:23.320 --> 16:28.360]  the crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And of course, that's just one of the great ways
[16:28.360 --> 16:33.640]  you can support info wars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support
[16:33.640 --> 16:38.440]  info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake up America Patriot blend. Of
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.600]  course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When you have
[16:42.600 --> 16:47.320]  thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gets
[16:47.320 --> 16:50.920]  a five star. So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star except
[16:50.920 --> 16:57.960]  maybe one or two people. Patriot blend 100% organic coffee only available at info wars store.com.
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen shroyer here, the host of the info wars war room. And I have had a major
[17:03.080 --> 17:10.840]  wake up call living in Texas this last week about how important storeable food is. Now I have plenty
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.960]  of storeable food in my house, but my notion has always been this is last case scenario,
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.480]  worst case scenario, like end of America, apocalyptic type scenario. But I'm realizing now
[17:21.480 --> 17:26.360]  that's not the case. Folks, they can shut off the power. They can shut off the water at any given
[17:26.360 --> 17:31.240]  moment. Now I was lucky. I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry that I didn't have to
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.760]  dig into my storeable food. But many people in Texas did it. Don't be in that situation. Don't
[17:36.760 --> 17:41.240]  have that major wake up call when they come to shut down your power and they shut down the stores
[17:41.240 --> 17:47.480]  in the food supply, have the backup, have the insurance and be ready to feed yourself, your
[17:47.480 --> 17:54.040]  family, your friends and your neighbors with a storeable food, best quality, best price 10% off
[17:54.040 --> 18:03.160]  right now at infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:18.760 --> 18:23.000]  We are on the march and the empire is striking back with their worldwide great
[18:23.000 --> 18:28.680]  reset planetary lockdown. And I want to finish up with a stack of COVID news. The next segment,
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.640]  Tucker Carlson had Naomi Wolf on. She even showed up on my show one time about the book like 20
[18:33.640 --> 18:42.600]  years ago. She's a good liberal, like Glinda, a good witch in a desert of eyes. Is there such a
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.160]  thing? But I mean, she's like, my God, this is a total police state, total martial law takeover
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.720]  using COVID. And it's the Democrats mainly doing it. We've got to fight this. So it's it's pretty
[18:51.720 --> 18:59.720]  powerful. That's coming up next segment. But I don't think targeting pregnant women is funny. I
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.960]  don't think targeting old folks is funny. In fact, it makes me so angry that I just had to
[19:03.960 --> 19:09.800]  get sarcastic about it or I'm going to start crying. And this is violence against us. It's
[19:09.800 --> 19:13.480]  all premeditated and you have to understand something. You just joined us here on the Alex
[19:13.480 --> 19:21.720]  Young Show. I study a good 10 hours a day. I get up at like 5am, study a couple hours, couple hours
[19:21.720 --> 19:30.200]  the afternoon before I go to bed. And I have seen no exaggeration, hundreds of top scientists,
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.840]  hundreds of top epidemiologists, and then hundreds of medical doctors in hospitals
[19:34.840 --> 19:43.160]  and in nursing homes and in teaching facilities. And I've also seen hundreds of nurses online.
[19:43.160 --> 19:48.120]  And we had a bunch of them on his guest where it runs the gamut of carnage. It's like what you'd
[19:48.120 --> 19:53.480]  expect to hear if there were witnesses to Joseph Mingola, the crazy doctor, the angel of death
[19:53.480 --> 20:03.560]  in a Nazi Germany. It's just simply insane. It just runs the gamut, the entire gambit.
[20:04.840 --> 20:08.760]  And I just start thinking about it. I mean, we had people on 10 years ago, nurses,
[20:08.760 --> 20:12.520]  when the studies were in the news and then we covered it, the nurses would call in and we would
[20:12.520 --> 20:16.680]  later back them and he would say, sit us your ID. We won't say who you are. We'd have a nurse on.
[20:16.680 --> 20:20.360]  Then some came on and said who they were and where they worked. And they would say, oh no,
[20:20.360 --> 20:26.120]  we're ordered to give all the premies vaccines, but then up to a third of them die. So then we have
[20:26.120 --> 20:31.800]  to argue with the hospital board about can we resuscitate them. And a lot of places don't even
[20:31.800 --> 20:35.960]  resuscitate these kids just because they weigh three pounds or something. They just kill them,
[20:35.960 --> 20:43.880]  folks. It's killing the weak. But that's the Spartans were the first to really do that on an
[20:43.880 --> 20:49.880]  organized scale and actually killed the weak and it did make some good looking, very smart,
[20:49.880 --> 20:56.520]  aggressive people. But the globalists aren't even doing that, ladies and gentlemen. They are actually
[20:56.520 --> 21:01.560]  going after everybody trying to dumb us down and then kill us because they don't want competition.
[21:01.560 --> 21:07.480]  So that's what real eugenics is like a grizzly bear routinely will mate with the
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.280]  what's a female bear called the sow, the cow. Look at what a female bear is called.
[21:15.560 --> 21:22.360]  And I think the male's called a dog. But you know, like a fox is a female fox is called a vixen,
[21:22.360 --> 21:26.920]  male fox is called a dog. I think like seven or eight crows is called a gag old more and that's
[21:26.920 --> 21:36.440]  called a murder. Was I correct? Is it called a sow? Okay, so the grizzly bear dog will have sex
[21:36.440 --> 21:41.800]  with the sow. That's not a pig, folks. They call a female bear a sow. And then she will have one
[21:41.800 --> 21:47.240]  or two sometimes every once in a while three cubs and he will routinely go smell them and he will
[21:47.240 --> 21:53.000]  kill the male. He will kill his son because he doesn't want competition. And of course, there's
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.480]  old Egyptian stories about sometimes a Pharaoh would, you know, kill his son or whatever and
[21:57.480 --> 22:01.720]  some of the some of the Egyptian gods would kill their son sometimes. And you all know in
[22:02.840 --> 22:08.600]  the Old Testament that Ramesses, the great was killing the first born Israelites and actually
[22:08.600 --> 22:13.400]  found the tablets and the carvings and stone. The hieroglyphs for that actually happened.
[22:14.280 --> 22:18.520]  They only proved it about two decades ago. They thought the Bible was made up. But this is an
[22:18.520 --> 22:24.040]  ongoing thing. So we've already brain damaged a large portion of our boys because these vaccines
[22:24.040 --> 22:29.400]  are designed across the blood brain barrier and cause brain damage. And now they're moving on to
[22:29.400 --> 22:33.640]  the girls and everybody else. So you can ignore this at your total incomplete peril. But I'm
[22:33.640 --> 22:40.040]  trying to explain something to you. I have the head of the EU Commission saying don't do it.
[22:40.040 --> 22:46.280]  And they still approve the damn Pfizer vaccine. It's not a vaccine. India saw all this and quoted
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.200]  this and I didn't get to this. Sunday I meant to I didn't get to this Monday because there was so
[22:50.200 --> 22:54.440]  much news. I covered it. I showed the article. You guys pull it out of the stack or reprint it. It's
[22:54.440 --> 23:02.120]  the fact checkers claim India did not ban Pfizer vaccine. And then it's even got a screenshot
[23:02.120 --> 23:10.040]  in there where they actually published that Bill Gates have paid Yahoo News and Newsweek and
[23:10.040 --> 23:16.760]  others to put out the fake article. India did ban it. And India said it's causing neurological
[23:16.760 --> 23:22.200]  disorders and brain damage. And these studies show that the protein in it will probably attack
[23:22.200 --> 23:27.960]  fertility and also hurt the brain. There it is. Newsweek fact check claims India banned mostly
[23:27.960 --> 23:32.840]  false while admitting the fact of ban. This is life saving folks. You've got to send everybody
[23:32.840 --> 23:37.240]  you know, scroll down, scroll down please. And then right there you can see the Indian government
[23:37.240 --> 23:44.520]  quoting why they banned it. And they say right there because of neurological disorders and
[23:44.520 --> 23:49.240]  people getting sick and folks having a lot of problems that keep, keep, keep scrolling down
[23:49.240 --> 23:55.560]  guys. Keep scrolling for me just as fast you can till you find the tweet. And I guess the way our
[23:55.560 --> 24:00.440]  computers work it's not loading the tweet but stop right there. Stop right there. Go back up please.
[24:00.440 --> 24:07.800]  Look right there. Microsoft and its partners may have be compensated if you purchase something
[24:07.800 --> 24:12.760]  through recommended links in the article. They left that part. I pointed out that it showed
[24:12.760 --> 24:17.960]  that News Guard was running the site but they didn't say News Guard and a day later they replaced
[24:17.960 --> 24:21.640]  it with News Guard saying News Guard is the independent fact checker that said this.
[24:21.640 --> 24:29.080]  News Guard is owned by Bill Gates. See what I'm talking about right there? This is life and death.
[24:29.080 --> 24:35.000]  This isn't a game. It's not a joke. Guys hit refresh on that article and you may have a
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.240]  blocker on there. I don't know why or a bandwidth so horrible here that it doesn't load the Indian
[24:39.240 --> 24:45.080]  government tweedles, the Tweetsie Weetsies that are in there. And I would expect that we will then
[24:45.080 --> 24:48.760]  you know, see them probably ban that in the future. Oh the Indian government can't say anything
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.400]  because they don't want you to know this. There it is. The committee noted that incidents of
[24:53.400 --> 24:59.160]  palsy that's getting paralyzed, anaphylaxis that's super horrible like when 20B is staying in,
[24:59.160 --> 25:04.680]  and other serious adverse events have been reported during post-marketing. Further, the firm
[25:05.480 --> 25:10.920]  was not proposed any plan to generate safety and immunology data to the Indian population.
[25:10.920 --> 25:14.760]  They're not even going to look at it. They're not going to do studies. They just inject you with it
[25:14.760 --> 25:18.600]  because they've already studied on animals and they know what it does. It attacks the brain,
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.880]  the entire nervous system, the nerves, all protein interactions of cell division, fast cell growth,
[25:23.880 --> 25:29.080]  replication, the placenta babies, everything else, your damn testicles. I mean that's why
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.440]  top scientists have said you'd be better to jump into a portal to hell from that fox's headline.
[25:34.440 --> 25:40.360]  Top scientists, you just jump into a portal to hell before you take this. Why would all these
[25:40.360 --> 25:45.800]  prestigious scientists say this because it's horrible and it's secret. They won't test it on
[25:45.800 --> 25:52.040]  animals because it kills the fricking animals and makes them drooling messes. But see, they know
[25:52.040 --> 25:57.240]  doing something this big, this evil, this out of control, this horrible, killing handcare and so
[25:57.240 --> 26:01.480]  many others that the public's just going to lie. No, it's not true. The government's not evil.
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.040]  Bill Gates is an evil. He wears a pink sweater. He's not killing me. It's not happening. No,
[26:06.040 --> 26:13.320]  it's no. It's not. I'm okay. Everything's all right. And the news is like those dumb black people,
[26:13.320 --> 26:19.880]  two to one won't take it. That's because they're stupid. And then they got quotes biting like,
[26:19.880 --> 26:25.560]  you know, black people don't know what's good for them, but I do know what's good for them. So
[26:25.560 --> 26:31.560]  you black people need to just, you know, get in line and take your shot. You're not saying that
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.600]  nurse would hurt you, would you? That nurse is another moron that works for the system that goes
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.080]  along with it. Of course, that nurse was never seen again after she collapsed. They go, it's a
[26:41.080 --> 26:45.000]  conspiracy. She died. I'm not saying she died. Just where is she? Like, well, you're not going to get
[26:45.000 --> 26:57.000]  to see her. Just liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal. Right back. Cognitive
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.920]  dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you
[27:02.920 --> 27:08.920]  refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested that
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.080]  fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[27:21.080 --> 27:26.760]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[27:26.760 --> 27:34.200]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA
[27:34.200 --> 27:41.400]  fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[27:41.400 --> 27:48.040]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[27:48.040 --> 27:54.040]  that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at
[27:54.040 --> 28:02.120]  info wars store.com. You cannot hide a grand assault. America is about to have its energy cut off,
[28:02.120 --> 28:08.520]  its borders destroyed, its dollar brought down to nothing. All of you that have served Satan
[28:09.240 --> 28:15.640]  believe that you are on the right team. You're about to find out how pathetic you are. So I ask
[28:15.640 --> 28:23.800]  all of you who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear. The enemy is about to expose
[28:23.800 --> 28:32.040]  itself. The enemy can't help itself. The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy. We sit here
[28:32.040 --> 28:37.960]  as good people get upset about that and try to stop it and we should. But once it comes through,
[28:37.960 --> 28:44.520]  once it hits us, once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point
[28:44.520 --> 28:50.120]  out we tried to stop it. So prepare yourselves America. You're going under the judge but just
[28:50.120 --> 28:55.640]  like all the children that were aborted. This is the truth. This is the info war.

[29:59.960 --> 30:02.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:02.600 --> 30:17.640]  They railed against the ground.
[30:21.800 --> 30:28.680]  Another ragtag man. You know, we've been caught in a bear trap.
[30:28.680 --> 30:33.400]  We've been caught in a wood shipper and it's designed to drag us all the way into it.
[30:34.600 --> 30:37.640]  And people are going to realize the lockdowns are never going to stop, the masks are never
[30:37.640 --> 30:40.920]  going to stop, the forced homoculations are never going to stop. First it's one mask,
[30:40.920 --> 30:44.920]  then it's two masks when you start complaining. Hey, you don't want two shots, it's five shots,
[30:44.920 --> 30:50.600]  then it's 10 shots. How did I know it would be all those shots? Because Bill Gates runs his
[30:50.600 --> 30:58.920]  evil little mouth years ago and he's in charge. He's what 65 or whatever he is. All those old
[30:58.920 --> 31:03.800]  globalists died. They haven't found the fountain of youth yet. They haven't gotten the immortality
[31:03.800 --> 31:07.400]  they're looking for with all this genetic engineering and all this testing we're doing on us.
[31:07.400 --> 31:14.360]  He got left with all the keys, the power. This is 200 billion tax free dollars.
[31:14.360 --> 31:21.640]  And if you want to be tax exempt, you've got to join their club like his evil daughter
[31:21.640 --> 31:26.440]  and push eugenics in death. They're such leering predators, aren't they?
[31:28.280 --> 31:31.640]  Come and finish up on this and I'll hit the huge Tucker Carlson news. Here it is.
[31:32.760 --> 31:38.280]  I thought I'd show you this from nine years ago. Overhead shot, please. Impact of
[31:38.280 --> 31:43.720]  Florida Neurological Development and Children, 25 studies looked at by Harvard, did their own
[31:43.720 --> 31:50.120]  study and found it's not a problem. Fluoride just lowered IQ in children by 10 points.
[31:51.800 --> 31:55.320]  That's just the fluoride in the tap water, which doesn't strengthen your teeth. You know,
[31:55.320 --> 32:02.040]  my dad's a dentist and an oral surgeon. And he came to me like 15 years ago and he goes,
[32:02.040 --> 32:05.400]  you know, I thought you were making it up. I thought they were putting calcium fluoride
[32:05.400 --> 32:10.600]  in the toothpaste. It's sodium fluoride hydrophilic acid. That's dangerous and poisonous.
[32:10.600 --> 32:16.520]  It doesn't help the teeth. Oh yeah. He saw the former chief dentist of Canada that actually
[32:16.520 --> 32:21.560]  got Canada fluoride in the 70s and 80s and pushed that guy. I said, I didn't know they're putting
[32:21.560 --> 32:26.200]  toxic waste fluoride, acid based fluoride with all the chemicals that were with it.
[32:27.320 --> 32:31.000]  All the pollutants, I'm not going to lead mercury arsenic, but by calling it that,
[32:32.440 --> 32:37.160]  oh, it circumvents prop 65 in California, all of it. Then they put the toxic waste directly
[32:37.160 --> 32:43.160]  in your toothpaste and they put it directly in your drinking water. So here's the Harvard study.
[32:43.160 --> 32:50.360]  You know, that's Harvard. I mean, that's God Harvard study at Harvard.edu.
[32:53.960 --> 33:00.440]  So that's why this is so important. And they want to be able to dumb you down
[33:00.440 --> 33:07.960]  so bad that when you have a rash of white people in Asians being killed, stabbed,
[33:07.960 --> 33:13.320]  maimed in New York by groups of racist young black men who believe that they're in a jihad
[33:13.320 --> 33:18.680]  against evil because the media said whiteness is inherently evil. I guess that extends to Asians
[33:18.680 --> 33:23.640]  in the knockout game and the rest of it. They've slashed up. So they said that when a black man
[33:23.640 --> 33:28.040]  kills or attacks someone, that's white supremacy. Like, well, that's upside down world. That's
[33:28.040 --> 33:34.280]  two plus two equals 50. Well, that's the whole point. Yeah, there's the march against white
[33:34.280 --> 33:39.960]  supremacy because so many black folks have bought the Kool-Aid and are actually attacking non-black.
[33:39.960 --> 33:45.080]  It's very sad. But this is tribal warfare, folks, and it's what they've inducted us into. So again,
[33:45.080 --> 33:50.440]  I'm going to finish up with this overhead shot here. Here is the December 1, 2020,
[33:50.440 --> 33:56.280]  emergency declaration asking Europe to block the Pfizer vaccine that now India and others have
[33:56.280 --> 34:02.200]  saying that the studies connected to it just on what this protein does, it just causes infertility,
[34:02.200 --> 34:07.320]  death, cancer, Alzheimer's, you name it. It grows prions in the brain, which then your body has
[34:07.320 --> 34:13.000]  an autoimmune response to cause a swelling in the brain, also affects vision. It's not good. But
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.160]  that's what they say in their report, you know, don't listen to them. Doctors raise alarm over
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.000]  COVID vaccine linked to infertility. But don't listen to top scientists. I mean, they're not the
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.280]  U.N. Only the U.N. can do it. This horrible authoritarian run saying with dictators on its
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.680]  board of directors that has paid off a big pharma. And then this new one, immunologist,
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.360]  orange Pfizer and Moderna coronavirus vaccine may cause neurodegenerative disorders such as
[34:36.360 --> 34:43.640]  Alzheimer's. That's in the Journal of Microbiology Infectious Diseases. Just so happens this fluoride
[34:43.640 --> 34:50.040]  of this, excuse me, before I slip, this protein is perfectly made to grow and to start clotting
[34:50.040 --> 34:55.640]  and then to start coming together like a crystal in your brain. Nothing like having some crystals
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.120]  grow in that brain. That'll make you feel real good and forget who you are that finally stop
[35:00.120 --> 35:08.360]  breathing, which is liberal. And then here's the actual study. COVID-19 are in a base vaccine and
[35:08.360 --> 35:15.400]  the risk of prion disease. That's all up on info wars.com. I suggest you share it
[35:15.400 --> 35:22.440]  with a direct link to that area. Here's another one from natural news. Doing a great job up.
[35:22.440 --> 35:26.120]  This is all over the news. I heard it on the radio this morning. WHO green lights. Well,
[35:26.120 --> 35:32.840]  the WHO green lights. And I mean, the U.N. board paid off by all these big pharma companies.
[35:32.840 --> 35:37.960]  WHO green lights mRNA vaccine experimentation. They admit we're just doing open air experimentation
[35:37.960 --> 35:40.120]  on pregnant women and newborn infants. Yeah.
[35:40.120 --> 35:47.480]  Run the virus. Vaccine trials can soon begin on newborn babies and pregnant women. Man,
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.400]  and that is so unethical. Portal kid never knew without them. If you'll accept that,
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.480]  they'll accept anything because they've got such docile brain damaged people living in a
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.240]  trance state watching TV all day. At first, they said, don't give it to pregnant women and old
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.560]  folks. But now, hey, they're letting them. We killed Hank Aaron. We killed a lot of folks.
[36:05.560 --> 36:13.000]  And nothing's happening. All right. Intensify murder operations. Yeah. But we played this
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.840]  at the start of the show. It's a very powerful video. A man flying back into Canada refuses
[36:16.840 --> 36:21.720]  airport COVID test. We'll play that coming up next segment as well. And the sickening things that
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.920]  Fredo said about what it's going to be like living there now and having to quarantine in a hotel
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.960]  and all the rest of it. North Dakota house votes to make mass mandating legal. Good news on that
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.160]  front. UK health authorities announced not a single death from flu this year because they're all
[36:37.160 --> 36:43.160]  counting it as COVID total fraud. Twist president, anyone who wishes to travel must be vaccinated.
[36:43.160 --> 36:46.680]  So that's the whole global government system. So Switzerland is falling to tyranny.
[36:47.720 --> 36:51.800]  Vaccine passports to enter pubs venues being considered by British government, but all over
[36:51.800 --> 36:58.200]  Europe, the UK and the US. Illegal aliens are given waivers and are not given COVID-19 test or
[36:58.200 --> 37:05.720]  vaccines. So we want to incentivize them coming here. And France is considering totally banning
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.920]  public gatherings. Period. So the martial law just absolutely intensifies. But now they're
[37:10.920 --> 37:15.480]  telling us in the mainstream news in 2024, you may be able to take the mask off. See,
[37:15.480 --> 37:21.320]  it's just it's all and then maybe 2020 now, maybe in 5000 years. And now they're saying we want you
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.960]  to take vaccines every time you travel. We won't even say what it is. You just get injections
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.240]  at the airport. I'm not kidding. I've been on the test anyway. We're going to go to break.
[37:32.040 --> 37:35.720]  I'm going to come back with Tucker Carlson and a lot more, but I thought it was important to cover
[37:35.720 --> 37:39.720]  all of that. And, you know, we're all over the news. They're just all over Twitter and all over
[37:39.720 --> 37:45.720]  Facebook calling for my arrest and just heaping lie upon lie upon lie. There's a bunch of big
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.560]  articles. Mark Zuckerberg changed the rules how Facebook went easy on Alex and other right wing
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.840]  figures. Wait till we break that down. It's quite illustrative of what's happening. And then meanwhile,
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.800]  the Graceland pastor held in custody. He's now been held a long time for opening his church.
[38:01.800 --> 38:08.760]  He's not allowed to have church period in Canada. And we've got Ezra Levant of rebel media joining
[38:08.760 --> 38:15.400]  us to talk about that. And we've got the new justice head saying he will purge free speech
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.800]  in America. It's all coming up separately. You can fight back in little ways. And we've
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.360]  tested a lot of these Faraday cages, a lot of these privacy pockets, a lot of these privacy
[38:24.360 --> 38:29.640]  pouches, a lot of these systems. And this is the best system out there. It's a little Faraday cage
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.200]  with the copper lining in it. You put your little cell phone in it. And only when you want to use
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.480]  the phone does it boot up and track you. Even if you turn off the location and say don't track me,
[38:40.360 --> 38:44.120]  they track you, the contact racers, the globalists. This will be the control system
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.920]  of the future. Just like I told you 25 years ago, soon people will cover up the cameras on their
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.480]  computers because people are watching. Now that's well known. In a few years, everyone's going to
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.040]  have these. Most of the ones out there are not 100%. This is almost 100%. It's the best unit
[38:58.040 --> 39:04.840]  you're going to find. And it's 1995. This exact unit sells everywhere for $29.95. We sell these as
[39:04.840 --> 39:09.960]  fast as they come in. It's been a month or so since we had it and we got a shipment. But despite that,
[39:09.960 --> 39:16.760]  I'm keeping them at $19.95. Every listener needs to go to infowarstore.com. We have them in red,
[39:16.760 --> 39:23.480]  black, and blue. For some reason, we can't get the green ones. But it's all there. And you see the
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.920]  reviews there on the site. So it's a great system. And we're also working with a U.S. manufacturer
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.240]  to put these out ourselves. And we're going to have bigger ones for laptops and iPads and things
[39:35.240 --> 39:39.480]  like that. So I'm getting big into this because it's important to fight back however we can if
[39:39.480 --> 39:42.040]  you're going to have more of these little wicked devices. Soon in the future, we'll have to have
[39:42.040 --> 39:45.080]  a cell phone to travel. They're now admitting that it will be a prerequisite because I think it
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.880]  now is in communist China, your little digital robot minder with combat robots on the street
[39:49.880 --> 39:55.320]  controlling you as well. Also, knockout sleep aid is 40% off. Those sales are about to end.
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.400]  Now is the time to get prepared. Now is the time to get high-quality, storable food that's ready
[39:59.400 --> 40:05.000]  to be shipped to you within days. Infowarstore.com has the highest quality, storable food,

[40:57.480 --> 41:06.280]  really funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had access to this show in
[41:06.280 --> 41:12.440]  the mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun. In fact, you speak out, have
[41:12.440 --> 41:16.840]  your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well,
[41:16.840 --> 41:23.560]  what do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these
[41:23.560 --> 41:27.880]  huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge, they're so real,
[41:27.880 --> 41:31.480]  but I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time we do. The
[41:31.480 --> 41:37.480]  globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity. They
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.680]  enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That, for me, is really,
[41:42.680 --> 41:49.240]  so sad and disgusting. So, you've got to pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we
[41:49.240 --> 41:53.720]  will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[41:53.720 --> 42:02.440]  all in this together. I knew Trump was in battle. I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double
[42:02.440 --> 42:09.240]  talking agents of the enemy. And a lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no,
[42:09.240 --> 42:14.040]  it's 3G chess, 5G chess, he's invincible. And I understand why people aren't to believe that
[42:14.040 --> 42:18.280]  because this is scary what's going on. The global government, the New World Order. Now that people
[42:18.280 --> 42:22.280]  hold up the fact that that's real, they won't somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure
[42:22.280 --> 42:27.320]  has held pride. My gosh, look at how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.640]  on the drug, once Biden signed that executive order. We pay the most of anybody in the world.
[42:31.640 --> 42:36.280]  That's just one case of hundreds of things that Trump had reversed. And now people are going to feel
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.080]  who's staying in the pain. The energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated
[42:41.080 --> 42:46.200]  this is the trial to the Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down
[42:46.200 --> 42:50.760]  and saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity.
[42:50.760 --> 42:56.040]  Because the fix is in, folks. The swamp is deep. Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[43:21.640 --> 43:27.880]  To change the very DNA of the human species, to mutate us into a form that they can control,
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.960]  like a pawn on a chessboard. The bottom line is they want to play God. They are playing God. And
[43:35.160 --> 43:37.720]  the news is only going to tie it around our necks from here on out.
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.120]  So many other people want to be positive. They want to put out fake news and
[43:42.120 --> 43:45.000]  want to only cover limited amounts of what's happening with New World Order. But
[43:45.640 --> 43:49.480]  I think in the day, it's all about the population. It's all about world government. It's all about
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.880]  the end of the human system as we know it. And on its ashes, a nightmare being built.
[43:53.880 --> 43:55.720]  Only admitting it can turn around and stop it.
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:02.200 --> 44:15.720]  It seems like yesterday that it was long ago.
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.560]  At least be families. At least be free. But it was long ago.
[44:23.560 --> 44:25.080]  And now we're inside the New World Order.
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.520]  And now we're very biologists. We've been taken over by the globalists. We can just be
[44:30.520 --> 44:35.160]  seen. Same as a commodity, like a Monsanto Terminator seed.
[44:37.480 --> 44:38.760]  The mountains that we move.
[44:50.280 --> 44:53.480]  You know why? We're in so much trouble.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.280]  Because we don't have a sense of honor anymore, where we came from and who we are and where
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.480]  we're going. We don't think about future generations as if they're us. We've been trained to be
[45:03.480 --> 45:09.240]  incredibly isolated and alone and selfish and unhappy. And I talk to so many people,
[45:09.240 --> 45:12.120]  they go, no, Jones, you're right about the world government, the technocracy,
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.920]  the scientific evil. I'm just going to enjoy my life and just try to stay out of the way of this.
[45:18.520 --> 45:22.680]  You're not going to stay out of the way of it. And that's why those people are so fundamentally
[45:22.680 --> 45:29.400]  selfish and unhappy. Selfish people are not happy. The problem is the globalists manipulate good,
[45:29.400 --> 45:36.760]  loving, altruistic, open people and tell us you've got to not be racist and accept gun control.
[45:36.760 --> 45:41.960]  You've got to not be racist and let us bring in foreigners out, vote you. You've got to pay more
[45:41.960 --> 45:47.320]  taxes. You've got to let us run your life to prove you're not bad. We're like, okay, yes, sir,
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.480]  I know I'm not perfect. When they're the evil people that exempt themselves from everything
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.960]  they do to ush. It's fundamentally about good versus evil. Now, there's a lot of good things
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.360]  happen. I like Tucker Carlson show. I love it. It's the best thing on TV. That's why they want
[46:00.360 --> 46:05.800]  to take him off air. And the Democrats are now sending letters to cable providers and to cable
[46:05.800 --> 46:11.400]  systems and to satellites saying take Tucker Carlson off the air while we've censored everybody else.
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.560]  Remember just a year ago, we're not censoring congressional hearings. There's no censorship
[46:15.560 --> 46:20.120]  with anybody. We've never heard of that. Remember that gaslighting? Now it's like, yeah, of course,
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.920]  we're going to censor. We're going to put people in prison. Why? Tucker Carlson caused the insurrection
[46:24.920 --> 46:32.360]  at the Capitol. No, he didn't. Meanwhile, the Merrick Garland just came out and said we'll play it
[46:32.360 --> 46:37.480]  next hour. He said, oh, no, when we burn down federal buildings, that's not terrorism. He actually
[46:37.480 --> 46:43.960]  said that. Oh, no, Antifa doesn't exist. They're a good organization. You're like, doesn't make
[46:43.960 --> 46:50.840]  sense. It doesn't exist. It's not terrorism. It's not violent. But what they did is good. It's all
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.880]  meant to make you give up on logic. It's a psychological tactic to do this to you. Of course,
[46:55.880 --> 47:04.280]  a 250 pound man with giant arms can compete in high school against girls that weigh 100 pounds
[47:04.280 --> 47:09.800]  less than them when his bones are twice as big. And he has testosterone that would be banned in
[47:09.800 --> 47:15.640]  women's sports for women to take it. But a man can have genitals, horse testicles hanging down
[47:15.640 --> 47:20.120]  between his legs, and he can go out and wrestle women to the ground and win the track meets and
[47:20.120 --> 47:27.480]  everything. It's like, oh, it's okay because it's a guy being a girl. So sick, a scientific takeover,
[47:27.480 --> 47:34.600]  an assault on logic. So Nanny Wolfe was on with Carlson and they were talking about how we become
[47:34.600 --> 47:39.160]  a total police state and how the COVID's the global takeover. Yeah. She's like, I wouldn't have voted
[47:39.160 --> 47:42.840]  for Biden if I knew this was going to happen. What do you mean, lady? You already saw the bureaucracy
[47:42.840 --> 47:48.280]  do it. But she thought Trump was doing it. So people got to get a crash course in reality.
[47:48.280 --> 47:52.440]  We don't have much time. The full interview is on info wars.com. Here's part of it.
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.520]  One person who apparently is not afraid to speak up is Nanny Wolfe, who was undoubtedly losing
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.160]  friends by appearing on the show tonight. She's the author of the End of America letter of warning
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.160]  to a young patriot and the CEO of Daily Cloud. She joins us tonight. Nanny, well, if I appreciate
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.640]  your coming on, I never thought I would be talking to you except in a debate format. I'm sure we
[48:11.640 --> 48:16.680]  disagree on an awful lot. But on this, I was struck by the bravery it must have taken you to
[48:16.680 --> 48:22.280]  write it. I'm sure you lost friends over it for doing this. Tell us why you're doing this and why
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.680]  you wrote that. Well, it's not just, first of all, thank you, Tucker. I'm really happy to be talking
[48:28.680 --> 48:36.280]  to you. It's not just that one tweet. I've been writing pretty much every day for months and
[48:36.280 --> 48:44.040]  months about what I see as the terrible crisis that we're in that we have to recognize under the
[48:44.040 --> 48:50.840]  guise of a real medical pandemic. We're really moving into a coup situation, a police state
[48:50.840 --> 48:56.120]  situation. And that's not a partisan thing that, you know, as you say, that transcends everything
[48:56.120 --> 49:01.240]  you and I might agree or disagree on that should bring together left and right to protect our
[49:01.240 --> 49:06.840]  constitution. We're absolutely moving into what I call step 10. I wrote a book in which I pointed
[49:06.840 --> 49:13.080]  out there were 10 steps that would be tyrants always take when they want to close down a democracy,
[49:13.080 --> 49:17.720]  whether they're on the left or the right, they always do the same 10 things. And now we're at
[49:17.720 --> 49:22.120]  something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. You described it really, really well. It is step
[49:22.120 --> 49:27.080]  10 and that's the suspension of the rule of law. That's when you start to be a police state and
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.280]  we're here. There's no way around it. I'm so embarrassed that it's just it's another example.
[49:32.280 --> 49:37.400]  There are a million of them of why partisanship is stupid and it makes you stupid. And I guess I
[49:37.400 --> 49:41.560]  just assumed that we wouldn't agree on stuff. So I didn't read your tweets and I obviously should
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.240]  have been and I missed a lot. And so again, it's nice to remember you should treat people as individuals
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.960]  rather than as stand-ins for whole political parties. You have been predicting this for a long
[49:51.960 --> 50:01.160]  time, you just said. Why don't you think others aren't seeing this? Well, unfortunately, a lot
[50:01.160 --> 50:08.040]  of people are seeing it, but we're not unified. And as you pointed out, we're a very divided
[50:08.040 --> 50:14.520]  country for a lot of cynical reasons. I'm in touch with many patriots from all backgrounds and all
[50:14.520 --> 50:19.800]  walks of life who are horrified. I interviewed, for instance, Moms for Liberty, a group of
[50:19.800 --> 50:25.240]  conservative Moms in Florida who are mobilizing to try to get schools open. They're so worried
[50:25.240 --> 50:30.840]  about what's happened to their kids. And I talked to a mom, Jen, say a famous gymnast and activist
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.600]  in San Francisco on the left, who's also a mom who's horrified. I've interviewed doctors. I've
[50:36.600 --> 50:45.000]  interviewed ordinary people, restaurant owners from all walks of life who are absolutely unable
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.680]  to even articulate their fear and horror, recognizing that the state has now crushed
[50:50.680 --> 50:55.960]  businesses, kept us from gathering in free assembly to worship, as the First Amendment
[50:55.960 --> 51:00.920]  provides, is invading our bodies, as you mentioned, which is a violation of the Fourth Amendment,
[51:00.920 --> 51:09.160]  is a restricting movement. Finding us here in New York State, I could be fined $15,000 a day
[51:09.160 --> 51:13.880]  if I gather people, you know, more than 10 or 25 people depending on where in New York State I live.
[51:13.880 --> 51:19.320]  You know, which is a complete violation of the First Amendment. I mean, the violations go on
[51:19.320 --> 51:25.800]  and on and on. I've talked to restaurant owners who are looking at a sector in which tens of thousands
[51:25.800 --> 51:30.520]  of small businesses have been crushed. And why were they crushed? Not because of pandemic force
[51:30.520 --> 51:36.440]  them to. There is no real science underlying a lot of these closures. It's because autocratic
[51:36.440 --> 51:43.400]  tyrants at the state and now the national level are creating a kind of merger of corporate
[51:43.400 --> 51:49.160]  power and government power, which is really characteristic of Italian fascism in the 20s.
[51:49.720 --> 51:56.760]  And they're using that to engage in kind of emergency orders that simply strip us of our
[51:56.760 --> 52:01.240]  rights, rights to property, rights to assembly, rights to worship, and all of the rights that
[52:01.240 --> 52:07.400]  our Constitution guarantees. So people are definitely horrified at noticing. I think people are shocked
[52:07.400 --> 52:13.480]  and divided, as I mentioned before. The other thing that happened is you said this has all been very...
[52:13.480 --> 52:17.400]  So this is why they're trying to censor us off the air because we have the great reset.
[52:17.400 --> 52:23.080]  We have Operation Lockstep. We have these monsters literally saying, Bill Gates saying,
[52:23.080 --> 52:27.080]  I want to kill old people. Klaus Schwab saying, you'll own nothing. You'll have nothing. It's
[52:27.080 --> 52:32.120]  never going to end. No more industry where you're in contact with people. It's never going to end.
[52:32.120 --> 52:39.720]  Get through the Stockholm Syndrome, people. Full video. It goes on from there. It's a great
[52:39.720 --> 52:48.360]  interview. And I have a whole stack here where they are scrabbling. CNN, ABC News, the Biden
[52:48.360 --> 52:56.360]  administration has told Congress this week, Monday, I guess yesterday, that, yeah, we're
[52:56.360 --> 53:02.040]  helping censor conservatives off the Internet. I mean, the merger of government and corporations
[53:02.040 --> 53:07.080]  to censor a whole group of people is called mass oppression, folks. It's not like, oh,
[53:07.080 --> 53:10.680]  we're driving 10 miles an hour in the car. It's about 150 miles an hour.
[53:13.480 --> 53:19.240]  And what happens when you get up to 250? Because this fascist machine will go about 250.
[53:19.240 --> 53:25.080]  The car takes off at about 200 off the road. That's the allegory. So we're basically in a funny car
[53:25.080 --> 53:32.600]  right now. They're going to try to make us go 300 miles an hour. And we're going to blow up. And the
[53:32.600 --> 53:36.600]  left doesn't get it. The Chinese and the globalists do. They want the U.S. out of the way. This is
[53:36.600 --> 53:40.680]  going to cause a civil war. I don't want to hurt liberals. I don't want to shoot cops. I don't want
[53:40.680 --> 53:46.440]  to storm the Capitol. I don't want the FBI agents to get killed. I don't want any of this. You people
[53:46.440 --> 53:54.680]  are being manipulated by a master plan. We're off the damn rails. This is going to end in a
[53:54.680 --> 53:59.160]  horrible explosion. And it's not going to go well for anybody. And the left's going to get devastated.
[53:59.960 --> 54:05.000]  And in the end of this, fascism is going to take over the U.S. And then we'll join with the whole
[54:05.000 --> 54:11.000]  global government system. It's been the plan all along. And I'm not one to evacuate. I'm not going
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.680]  to. But they are trying to put me in prison right now. The stuff you see on the news, typically
[54:14.680 --> 54:20.120]  I support. And so it's just hard for me to be in the middle of this to know how real it is.
[54:20.120 --> 54:25.080]  And to see the general public just feel kind of in a daze not knowing. I mean, folks, it's far worse
[54:25.080 --> 54:30.200]  than Naomi Wolf said. This is a takeover. It doesn't stop from here. You understand? And the
[54:30.200 --> 54:38.200]  takeover is designed like a chemistry set to cause explosion. So it's 101 guaranteed civil war,
[54:38.200 --> 54:42.200]  martial law, that's the plan. We'll be right back. I remember to stop it, folks.
[54:42.200 --> 54:51.560]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.800]  food, and medicine. And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to
[54:57.800 --> 55:04.440]  bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the
[55:04.440 --> 55:09.880]  few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours
[55:09.880 --> 55:14.200]  of freezing in the cold. We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.400]  have any power in their house and then running out of gas. Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king.
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.640]  And food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well. They're both available,
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.240]  the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality shortable foods right now,
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.920]  massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide at infowarstore.com.
[55:32.920 --> 55:37.640]  $50 off on our best stainless steel gravity feed filter and 10% off all shortable food
[55:37.640 --> 55:43.400]  in all packages at infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com or preparewithalix.com.
[55:43.400 --> 55:50.840]  Big discounts for only a few more days. As negative as times are right now and as depressing as
[55:50.840 --> 55:56.760]  things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test. This experience, this
[55:56.760 --> 56:04.360]  life on this planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out of the
[56:04.360 --> 56:09.400]  third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to.
[56:09.960 --> 56:14.840]  And it really does come down to that. So as saddest things are and as evil as things are,
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.400]  look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[56:19.960 --> 56:26.840]  God is the author of us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will. And that
[56:26.840 --> 56:32.040]  free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole
[56:32.040 --> 56:38.520]  evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free
[56:38.520 --> 56:42.680]  will. It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan
[56:42.680 --> 56:46.040]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[56:46.040 --> 57:01.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:01.960 --> 57:17.880]  Where eagles dare, info wars. This is the info war.
[57:24.680 --> 57:28.520]  That's some good punk rock right there. That's just more modern stuff. That's good.
[57:28.520 --> 57:34.360]  This is a family show. We better fade it down right now. Welcome back info wars.com
[57:34.360 --> 57:39.800]  and news wars.com are the websites. Maybe we should play a little bit of London Dungeon next
[57:39.800 --> 57:46.360]  segment or Hollywood Babylon. Boy, Hollywood Babylon is certainly collapsing.
[57:48.920 --> 57:53.720]  Hollywood is collapsing as fast as my hair is falling out, which I don't mind. I'm a little
[57:53.720 --> 57:59.240]  bit of a fat ass now. The election totally stressed me out. I released tons of cortisol in my body.
[57:59.240 --> 58:03.800]  I worked 20 hours a day and gained 30 down pounds. I've already lost about 10 of it
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.160]  in the last month. I've been making myself take the supplements religiously, but
[58:10.440 --> 58:15.640]  I'm not even working out anymore. I'm not complaining either. I know why people can't
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.160]  handle this. I know why people want to live in denial because this is horrible.
[58:19.160 --> 58:25.480]  I mean, this new rule of order is unbelievable. We just played that Naomi Wolf piece with Tucker
[58:25.480 --> 58:31.240]  Carlson and how she just now sees this is a total fascist takeover and that the Democrats are at
[58:31.240 --> 58:34.760]  the heart of it. And of course, the Republicans are scared and going along with it pretty much.
[58:35.960 --> 58:39.240]  So we're in trouble, folks. We better come together and deal with this.
[58:39.880 --> 58:44.520]  But Democrats demand to know why cable companies don't censor conservative news.
[58:44.520 --> 58:49.080]  Steve Watson, info wars.com. And it's got all the clips. It's got the newscast. It's got the
[58:49.080 --> 58:55.080]  tweets with the Democrats and CNN and all of them asking in a blatant attempt to pressure cable
[58:55.080 --> 59:01.080]  providers to censor conservative media. How about this populist media? Democrats have pinned a
[59:01.080 --> 59:06.920]  letter demanding to know what they intend to do about certain channels, including Fox Newsmax,
[59:06.920 --> 59:12.200]  spreading this information. That means questioning the election. I'm supposed to do that. The letters
[59:12.200 --> 59:19.400]  sent Monday by California Democrats, Anna Issue and Jerry McNenry also has satellite digital TV
[59:19.400 --> 59:26.200]  writers. Are you planning to continue carrying Fox News, OAN and Newsmax on your platform,
[59:26.200 --> 59:35.000]  both now and beyond the renewal date? If so, why? Now these members of Congress want massive
[59:35.000 --> 59:41.320]  corporations like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast to apply some newfound moral or ethical principles
[59:41.320 --> 59:47.160]  related to journalistic integrity in determining what content they allow to be disseminated on
[59:47.160 --> 59:57.560]  their services. Simply insane. Biden, AGPic Merrick Garland says he'd support working with Congress
[59:57.560 --> 1:00:02.120]  for strict free speech online. Natural video of it. I'll play it coming up next segment.
[1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:08.760]  And it gets worse. Biden regime, AGPic Merrick Garland will use office to ensure respectful
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:12.280]  treatment of liberal media, though. Yes, you'll get charged if you're mean to them.
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:19.160]  That is coming up next segment. I'm going to show you those videos. And I'm going to tie it
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:24.520]  into Trump fighting back. His main push is going to be election integrity. Hallelujah.
[1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:29.400]  And he definitely represents the party and the populist movement. And the polls
[1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:33.640]  show that what is it? 70 plus percent of Republicans say they're going where Trump goes.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:39.160]  The media is trying to spin that. But oh, yeah, third party. It doesn't have the muscle,
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:46.520]  the energy. It doesn't have the systems. We want to take over the Republican party completely.
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:51.160]  That's why the system was so scared. We've almost done it. And then we want to take the Democratic
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.920]  party over and have two populist parties that can then fight with each other and have separation
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:01:03.720]  of power. That's the federalist system. Two parties, federal, state and local government, three branches
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:08.760]  in each area of government, then the fourth of state being the media, fifth of state being the
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:15.080]  churches. Instead, we've got this whole globalist fifth column that runs it all, standardizes it,
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.560]  and is now bringing in the UN and regulators and signing over all of our energy systems,
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:23.160]  everything else, the private corporations, which sounds great to the mainline libertarians.
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:30.040]  But it's not good because these corporations just become governments in their own right.
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:36.040]  And that's where the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institute and the Hoover Institute get
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:41.880]  it wrong. All right. And I used to be a big L libertarian. I am a little L one. I'm living,
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:46.600]  let live, too. But see now the rainbow flag isn't living, let live. It's, hey, we're coming for your
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:56.440]  kids. And it's, it's bad. It's not a battle flag. I sell supplements for two reasons.
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:03.640]  Because they work. They're real. They're powerful. And because it's a giant market. But again,
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:09.560]  why is there a giant market? Because it works. That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's
[1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:18.120]  Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our prostate formula, Prostagard, or whether it is
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:24.600]  the super high grade organic vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ of the CoQ10
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:32.360]  in DNA force, or the pure deep breath crystal iodine and X2, these are all the very best supplements
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:38.200]  you're going to find in an already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:42.280]  the InfoWare. So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're finding the
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:48.360]  InfoWare so you can't lose. InfoWare delivers in space. Please visit InfoWareStore.com and get the
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:03:09.560]  products today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWareStore.com If you
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:28.200]  are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. All right, I haven't really talked
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:33.240]  about this much since it broke last week because there's so much important stuff going on. But
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.880]  I've had friends, I've had family, I've had neighbors come over that don't ever talk to me
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:42.840]  hardly and say, Hey, what do you think of Ted Cruz? You know, I'm a Republican, but man, I think his
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:49.880]  career is finished. Well, Ted Cruz has had his issues with me. He said things about me that
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:53.320]  aren't true. He's attacked me, but he's also defended my free speech. But that isn't why I'm
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:58.360]  supporting Ted Cruz. He's a great senator. He's got a great voting record. He was standing up with
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:03.640]  Trump on the 6th to get a 10 day investigation when nobody else had the courage to do it. And
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:09.960]  he's been targeted by the globalist. So I support Ted Cruz. He's a survivor. He plays politics when
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:15.320]  he's got to do it to survive. But he has an instinct for America. And you know, his dad was a Cuban
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:20.600]  exile and he's got the right instincts and the right stuff. I think to be president of this
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:26.680]  country one day. I'm just telling you, that said, if you live in Texas, it's an hour and 45 minutes
[1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:34.280]  from Austin. It is an hour and 30 minutes from Houston to Cancun. So Cancun is like, if you live
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.000]  10 miles from the beach, you drive the beach. I mean, it's literally like you live 10 miles from
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.120]  the beach. So he was honest about it. He said, I went down there. I was going to stay the weekend.
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:50.040]  I was going to work from there. I didn't have power at my house. And I was thinking like,
[1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:54.360]  why did I think of that? Well, my report was to put me shut down. So I couldn't do it.
[1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:59.320]  But I love Cancun. The crime has gotten bad there. It's not the safe way it used to be. He's
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:05.320]  very safe in Mexico City. Great place. But that's a smart move. He was honest about it. And it's
[1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:09.640]  like, oh, no, no. The Democrats are the ones saying, wear your mask. Don't be in crowds of people.
[1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:15.080]  And then all of them get caught on Caribbean islands with like 50 people, you know, naked chicks
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:21.640]  hanging off of them. All of it. That's what makes me mad. He's not been for that. And so that's
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:28.840]  where I stand on it. Yeah, they're calling in Senator Cancun, Cruz, and all the rest of it.
[1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:38.360]  We should be worrying, ladies and gentlemen, about Ovidon. Because this is the third
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:41.720]  administration of a guy that wants to destroy this country for the globalist. And they've
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:47.880]  got a literal meat puppet zombie up there dismantling the country. So the reason I'm
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:53.880]  angry about the Ted Cruz thing is it changed the subject from Cuomo and 16,000 dead old people
[1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:58.440]  that they knowingly killed on purpose to get their death numbers up. And the fact that
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:05.080]  it was Fauci advised that not Trump. And that we could destroy Fauci and Bill Gates with this.
[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:12.280]  And that other governors Whitmer and Wolf and all these other Democrats did, we have them.
[1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:18.680]  So did Ted Cruz order nursing homes that said we don't want to take COVID patients if it's
[1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:23.480]  killing 4% of people, which it wasn't true, but it will kill old people like any other bad cold
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:28.280]  if you don't have vitamin D3 from not having sun or zinc, horrible nursing home food. And so
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:35.320]  it was 44% of New York's deaths were in the nursing homes. Now it's 59% last time I checked.
[1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:37.080]  And that's before these new numbers came out.
[1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:42.120]  First they're like, well, we had 5,000 deaths and then we had 6,000. Well, okay, it's 8,000. Okay,
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:47.400]  it's 10,000. We covered up half of them. Now they're like 16,000. Well, we found another 3,000.
[1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:52.840]  So now it's it. Now it's at 19,000 dead. I'm sorry, I was giving you old numbers from last week.
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:07:02.280]  16,000 now it's 19,000 dead. So I guess if 5,000 was 47% that it looks like do the math if it's now
[1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:09.320]  18,000, 19,000 dead. And then you add all the other people who died. I mean, it's well over 60,
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:15.080]  70% died in nursing homes. It's the same thing in Europe and the same thing in other states
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:19.080]  because they're killing the old people and now they're giving them the vaccine and they're dying.
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:28.120]  So this is sick. And this is evil. I don't want to hear about Ted Cruz. If Ted Cruz ordered
[1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:32.600]  old people to have COVID patients stuck with them, I mean, you saw what Whitmer did where
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:36.600]  there's like that black dude beating up the Alzheimer's white dude, beating them. I'm like,
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:41.400]  why is the young dude in the hospital? Because he was a COVID patient that the hospital wanted to
[1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:48.840]  get 50 something grand off of. So they stuck a mentally ill, crazy person. Forgot his family was
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:55.240]  getting the money in a damn nursing home to beat up old people. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:01.160]  know. To beat up old people. And again, it's okay because it was an old white man. It's a black
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:06.840]  man doing it. And we all know we can just have a march against white supremacy whenever a white
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:11.720]  person gets killed. That's what New York does now. And so, you know, that's how this works. And again,
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:17.960]  I literally love everybody. But the media hyping up that white people inherently bad, white people
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:23.800]  are inherently evil, white people deserve to die. Hate crimes against white people have
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:29.000]  exploded. And let's move on from that. The UN reported two years ago that in the last decade,
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:33.080]  there was a doubling in Christians being murdered all over the world because the UN has said open
[1:08:33.080 --> 1:08:37.720]  season and nobody does anything about it. So, the majority of those are Asians and black people.
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:42.840]  I don't care if you're Asian, black, white, wherever you are, you have a soul and you have value. And
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.960]  if I don't treat you with respect, God isn't going to treat me with respect. This is a human
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:52.440]  fight against the globalist. But they've all turned us against each other to a sickening level.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:59.000]  Now, let's move to that next piece of information that's so important. We have
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:07.160]  Merrick Garland saying that it's not terrorism if you burn down a federal building or attack
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:12.600]  police with hatchets trying to break into the federal building if it's nighttime. Now, I always
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:19.160]  thought under common law, a crime of invasion or a crime of rape or a crime of robbery is bigger
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:25.720]  if it's nighttime. But no, not according to Mr. Upside Downworld. Here he is in testimony saying
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:31.560]  antifa is not engaged in terrorism. Pooping on Nancy Pelosi's office is. Sounds like
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:38.840]  animal house prank. I don't agree with it. Slamming cops indoors is assault. You should get jail
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:43.320]  time for that. Those cops didn't deserve that. Out of a million people, a couple hundred acted
[1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:50.360]  like hoodlums. Most of them plants. But still, it happened. But compare that to the burning down
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:55.080]  large portions, large swaths, large sectors of the country and calling it mostly peaceful with
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:01.240]  huge buildings burning behind you is insane. No, ladies and gentlemen, it is terrorism when you're
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:05.080]  trying to terrorize the federal building to shut and trying to terrorize everyone to giving into
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:13.800]  your demands in an autonomous zone. You're trying to take over. That is what is going on here when
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.400]  you throw a mall off cocktails in the building and catch it on fire. You guys fast forward the part
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:22.280]  where the police come out right here and they attack them with hatchets. Here it is. They're
[1:10:22.280 --> 1:10:26.520]  trying to break in the building and the feds are sitting and then they finally stop them.
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:30.680]  And last time I heard they released the guy that attacked the feds with a hatchet. I mean,
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.200]  I'm sorry, you attacked me with a hatchet. You're dead. That's a deadly weapon. I'm going to kill
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:38.760]  you. And they probably charged me. They charged cops that defend themselves. So this is out of
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:44.120]  control. You don't like out of control cops. How about out of control leftist dressed up in black?
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:50.680]  So here's the probably new attorney general, the Obama Kimmeroy, the Obama Dingleberry, Garland
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:56.360]  Merrick telling you that when it rains, when he's pissing on your back, that it's not piss. Here it
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:02.680]  is. Let me ask you about assaults on federal property in places other than Washington, D.C.,
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:06.600]  Portland, for instance, Seattle. Do you regard assaults on federal courthouses or other federal
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:14.040]  property as acts of domestic extremism, domestic terrorism? Well, Senator, my own definition,
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:19.720]  which is about the same as the statutory definition, is the use of violence or threats
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:28.680]  of violence in an attempt to disrupt democratic processes. So an attack on a courthouse while
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:35.720]  in operation, trying to prevent judges from actually deciding cases, that plainly is domestic
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:47.080]  extremism, domestic terrorism. An attack simply on government property at night or any other kind
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:52.440]  of circumstances is a clear crime and a serious one and should be punished. I don't mean, I don't
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:57.080]  know enough about the facts of the example you're talking about, but that's where I draw the line.
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:05.160]  One is both are criminal, but one is a core attack on our democratic institutions.
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:10.760]  Well, on the face of it, that's pure crap. They were burning it down saying it was illegitimate,
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:14.680]  so it couldn't operate. So what does it matter if they burn it down during the day or at night?
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.800]  You know, the guy that bombed in Nashville and blew up the building. I mean, is that terrorism?
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:27.080]  Yes. Just because it's at night, it's not a problem. And these people are sick, absolutely sick.
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.160]  And it makes me just, I'm just so tired of them. Plus, you can't even talk.
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:40.920]  How about, hey, do you believe Congressman Nadler's right that here's a clip of him saying,
[1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:46.280]  and if it doesn't exist, you know, they need to start nailing these guys, nailing them
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:50.680]  with the reality. The truth is, they're terrorists. They're globalists. They stole the election.
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:52.920]  They're trying to cause a civil war for the Chikoms.
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.440]  Actually, we bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies.
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:01.720]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us,
[1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:07.960]  not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well,
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:15.960]  with or without a battery. Now, with the Info Wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you

[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:07.880]  without power, including most grocery stores, many Texas residents are left without food.
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:14.360]  The lines of the grocery stores are getting longer and longer, while most of the store shelves are
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:22.680]  left bare. Now we know that in the most historic record-freezing temperatures in over a century,
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:29.400]  your government can simply turn off the power, turn off the heat, and turn off the water.
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:35.880]  Don't let your government dictate whether or not you're able to feed your family.
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:43.800]  Go to infowarstore.com and get at least a year supply of storable foods to make sure you and your

[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:18.440]  Well, the stock market's taking like a lead balloon right now.
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:23.960]  All the jobless numbers are pouring in. Energy prices are exploding.
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:32.360]  Old Joe Biden's doing the job he's supposed to do to make sure that you can't invest in the U.S.
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:37.880]  so you got to move your jobs to communist China. And Greg Abbotsman caught his pants down letting
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:44.280]  communist China build another wind farm in Texas. Greg Abbots all talked, all had no cattle.
[1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:48.600]  He's a real shame. And he's been praising fake President Biden,
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:54.680]  thanking him for saving us. I mean, this is really disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:59.240]  Oh, but he's going to, they'll prosecute one or two natural gas producers, you know,
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:05.880]  that charge too much when it's the electricity co-ops and an ERCOT that are running the scam
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:13.080]  on the outside groups, charging some people as high as 18,000 percent more. Which I told you,
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:16.280]  day one of it on the Sunday, when everything was icing up last Sunday,
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:20.360]  about the same thing last, you know, eight, nine days ago, I said,
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:24.360]  watch, you're going to get multi-thousand percent bigger bills because it's a formula
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:29.560]  of the scam. You're like, oh, Jones, it just cost workers an emergency. I covered Enron
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:34.520]  on probably 500 shows. It was a huge story for years. I had all the experts on the documents,
[1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:39.800]  the trial. I covered it. They cooked up the carbon tax. They cooked it all up.
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:49.000]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, Texas supplied up to 15 states when it had power
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:52.760]  until Obama got in and shut down our big, gorgeous coal plants.
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:01.160]  But oh, it doesn't matter. Remember what Schumer said? Yeah, let's play a clip with Schumer.
[1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:09.560]  Schumer said yesterday, you just can't play this enough, that maybe Texas has learned its lesson.
[1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:14.760]  Hear it from the blue city controller that's run that once great city of the ground.
[1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:22.680]  The bottom line is, Texas thought it could go at it alone and built a system that ignored climate
[1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:27.960]  change. It was not what's called resilient. And now Texas is paying the price. I hope they learn
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:32.920]  the lesson. When we build power, when we build anything now, we have to take into account
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:38.120]  that climate change is real or people will be caught the way the people in Texas are.
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:41.720]  So they say coal plants cause climate change. First it was global warming. Now we're having
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:47.560]  a big freezing spell. So it's, oh, it's change. Any change is man, not the sun. And so it's because
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:54.840]  we didn't have enough of this type of energy that can handle climate change. What does that even
[1:17:54.840 --> 1:18:01.000]  mean? It means nothing because we don't have energy that can deal with these type of problems.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:06.920]  What does that mean? It's the windmills that aren't reliable. He said we need reliable,
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:16.440]  diverse energy. What does that mean? It's coal. Nothing burns better and safer than coal. Nothing.
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:19.320]  Whether you're cooking pizzas or whether you're turning a water turbine.
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:26.680]  And we happen to have the cleanest coal in the world here. And after it goes through scrubbers,
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:29.160]  nothing comes out but water vapor and carbon dioxide.
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:34.360]  But again, Penn and Teller did it 20 years ago. I've done it as well many times. You go out and
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:40.600]  talk to the average person on the hiking bike trail in New York or, you know, Central Park or
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:45.560]  in Austin, Texas at the Greenbelt. Leigh Ann McAdoo did it about six years ago. We had to find
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.720]  that report and air it. And she talked to like 50 people. She didn't cherry pick them. And every one
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:55.080]  of them but one person said, she'd say, we need to bend a hydrogen monoxide. It's all over the
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:59.960]  place. It causes increased urination. You know, if you have too much of it, it can kill you.
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:05.480]  And almost every person, including one guy, said, I'm a chemist from Cornell. He started hitting
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:13.400]  on her. But he goes, I agree. We should bend a hydrogen monoxide. She's like, you know, that's
[1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:23.000]  the name of water. But see, it sounds scary. We all know oxygen is good. But carbon dioxide. Oh,
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.960]  that sounds like monoxide. Totally different. Let's hear from him one more time. What's the word
[1:19:27.960 --> 1:19:40.440]  he used for energy that's resilient? Well, that's not wind turbines. That's not natural gas. Here
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:48.600]  it is. The bottom line is, Texas thought it could go at it alone and built a system that ignored
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:54.120]  climate change. It was not what's called resilient. And now Texas is paying the price. I hope they
[1:19:54.120 --> 1:20:00.120]  learned the lesson when we build power, we build anything. So exactly what they did to us. Obama
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:05.320]  did this period. You can argue, hey, the gas power plants fell in the cold. Yeah, because we have
[1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:10.040]  to have those because the wind doesn't work. And we're not building new nuclear reactors. And so
[1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:17.880]  we have the cold gone. And he calls that resilience. That is a total inversion overhead shot, please.
[1:20:17.880 --> 1:20:25.240]  So if a pentacle is a star, is a symbol of a person, a head, two arms, two legs. If you reverse
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:34.920]  that, that's called Satanism, an inversion of humanity. And what is everything the globalists do?
[1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:53.320]  It's an inversion of reality. Okay. I've got Ezra Levant, who is a really great patriot and a smart
[1:20:53.320 --> 1:21:00.600]  fellow. He runs really the only successful nationalistic, patriotic, pro-freedom organization
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:05.240]  left in Canada. I mean, Canada is just an incredible country. Great people, but they are just like
[1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:10.920]  a lot of nice people in my state are just zombies, man. They're just in a coma. And they've got
[1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:15.160]  incredible arresting preachers that have church services after a year of lockdown. They're still
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:19.000]  locked down up there. But they let Black Lives Matter and Antibot run around and attack whatever
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.760]  they want. That's all coming up with him. And then this is a big story. And I'm not hitting this
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:29.080]  because I'm in it. I mean, there's probably 10 other big stories we're in. I'm not even covering,
[1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:35.480]  including the FBI wanting to arrest me and all the rest of it. But this one's big because it's
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:44.120]  such absolute crap. I mean, you read it and just all of it is wrong. And of course, it's from BuzzFeed,
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.960]  but then all the quote, serious media picked it up after BuzzFeed put it out.
[1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:54.440]  Mark changed the rules, how Facebook went easy on Alex Jones and other right-wing figures.
[1:21:54.440 --> 1:22:03.640]  Oh, he went easy on us. They wrote rules saying that people could promote my murder. I'm going to
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:09.880]  show you mainstream news. And then Zuckerberg changed that. And so they tell you about the changes,
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:14.360]  but don't say what it was he changed. So Zuckerberg is like, okay, you're not allowed to compliment
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:19.080]  Alex Jones and you're not allowed to post this stuff, but you can't kill him. That's illegal.
[1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:26.120]  I'm actually showing you what they put out from them. Remember that the year and a half ago?
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:32.040]  A list of like Lewis Faircon, Alex Jones, Laura Limmer, Paul Joseph Watson. What is he doing
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:37.160]  aggressive? He's not even an activist. I wish he was. He'd be a great one on the street. But oh,
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:41.720]  Paul Joseph Watson, they said, you are allowed to promote violence against him because he's a bully.
[1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:48.680]  And Zuckerberg goes, hey, guys, we can't overtly try to get him killed. Okay, that's illegal. That's
[1:22:48.680 --> 1:22:52.600]  like putting the contract out. And so they're like, they have the Southern Providence Law Center in
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:58.520]  ADL in here going, it's time to arrest Mark Zuckerberg. Yes, he won't let us kill Alex Jones
[1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:03.400]  because we're loving liberals. And that Mark Zuckerberg, you know, he just took over the Australian
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.160]  media and wouldn't let the news of the government be promoted on Facebook. I mean, you know, he's
[1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:11.720]  I mean, you know, he's just he's just throwing countries to the side. But you know, he's easy on
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:21.880]  Alex Jones. Oh, Mark, thank you. You were so easy on me. You were so easy on me. You wouldn't let them
[1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:28.120]  promote my murder. So we've got that coming up and open the phones up in the third hour today.
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:34.440]  And speaking of that devil, Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting in the fourth hour, you know,
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:38.760]  the guy that deserves to die. But it's okay because like, you know, drink your fluoride,
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:43.320]  drink your mercury, take your aluminum, just all of it, and you're going to go away to a happy place.
[1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:48.120]  And then it's going to save the earth. Okay, so listen to Bill Gates, listen to Adolf Hitler,
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:52.520]  and just kill yourselves. But I don't actually agree with that. Over right back.

[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:59.160]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:04.280]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:10.680]  degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:16.360]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:22.360]  pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:28.680]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:35.480]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:42.520]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:48.840]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil

[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:13.480]  cells to maintain your health. Essential means you must have it. It's been sold out for months.

[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:58.840]  time. We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that is
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:05.000]  now available at InfowarsStore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.800]  health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:16.200]  its relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:22.440]  by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:27.800]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:33.320]  up a little. Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:39.480]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava but other
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:46.440]  herbs, including but not limited to German Comma Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Balerian root. We do
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:28:12.440]  expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfowarsStore.com.
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:33.800]  As you know that they've arrested a preacher, he's been in jail a while up in Canada for opening
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:41.000]  his church. They talked to Ezra Levant of the Rebel News, rebelnews.com, here in just a moment.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:48.120]  But speaking of jail, I'm sure a lot of you have seen the national news. Washington Post,
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:54.680]  New York Times, all of them CNN breathlessly. Alex Jones and Roger Stone might get arrested
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:29:00.360]  for leading the Capitol insurgency and premeditating it. Though they said there was no
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:06.360]  premeditation in the Senate kangaroo trial that Trump was acquitted at, that Trump instigated the
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:17.800]  whole thing that day. But don't let logic get in the way of fraud. Don't let disinformation
[1:29:17.800 --> 1:29:22.440]  get in the way of facts. No, there's a giant Twitter mob. It's been trending off and on for
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:29.000]  over a week that I need to be arrested than I am Satan. Yes, I'm even more demonized now than
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:36.360]  even Roger Stone or Rush Limbaugh. It's insane. And now we learn that Mark Zuckerberg, when they
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:43.560]  change the rules to say that they can plan violence against me, he went and changed that. And now
[1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:48.600]  the Daily Beast and others buzzed feed news. They're all very angry. Mark changed the rules for
[1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:53.640]  Alex Jones. They don't tell you the rule he changed was that they could kill us. Facebook restores
[1:29:53.640 --> 1:29:59.160]  news sharing as Australia caves to big tech. We've got that piece of news as well. YouTube,
[1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:07.560]  Apple, Facebook ban info wars. And then of course followed that by Facebook. Facebook deletes policy
[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:13.400]  allowing violent threats against dangerous individuals. Yes, they're allowed to organize
[1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:18.680]  physically attacking us. Mark said we can't have organized crime. And so
[1:30:18.680 --> 1:30:26.520]  they're all angry at him now. And the ADL is calling for his arrest. And Sasha Barak Cohen is
[1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:31.400]  very, very Nazi like if you ask me. So please financially support us and keep us on air. We
[1:30:31.400 --> 1:30:35.960]  have great products that you already need. Our vitamin D3 with vitamin K is great for your immune
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:41.640]  system. It's essential. It's 25% off even though winter sun is close to selling out. Also because
[1:30:41.640 --> 1:30:46.360]  the emergencies in Texas around the country, we went down 10% on the high quality, horrible food
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:51.800]  ready to ship to you anywhere in the United States. Within 24 hours, it ships out high quality. We
[1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:55.560]  were eating in here when the power was off. It was amazing. We were eating stuff about three years
[1:30:55.560 --> 1:30:59.800]  ago stuff that they keep now is even better. They just get better and better. That's 10% off.
[1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:05.000]  Prepare with Alex.com. Prepare with Alex.com. That takes you right to the subsection of info
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:10.280]  war store.com. And we have the little blocket pocket privacy pouches, pherodicators for your
[1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:14.760]  cell phones to stop the contact tracers and hackers and others from tracking and controlling you.
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:19.560]  We have those available back in stock now. These really do work. Some of those out there don't
[1:31:19.560 --> 1:31:23.560]  work too well. These are the best we've been able to find. They're excellent. It's what I personally
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:34.600]  use. Then it funds the info war, a 360 win. All right. Our guest joins us Ezra Levant, rebelnews.com.
[1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:39.720]  And I wanted to get him on about this individual that went through and refused to take the COVID
[1:31:39.720 --> 1:31:44.440]  test and got fined. Big stuff is happening like that in the UK. Whatever is happening in the UK and
[1:31:44.440 --> 1:31:48.440]  Canada is coming here next, they admit it is. And we'll cover that briefly in the next segment.
[1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:55.000]  But he wanted to get into a well-known popular pastor who's still in jail because he dared
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:01.160]  have his church services. And so we're going to be covering that. Canadian pastor refuses bail
[1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:08.600]  conditions following arrest over church breaking COVID-19 restrictions. So Ezra Levant of rebelnews.com.
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:14.280]  Thanks for coming on with us. It's my pleasure. You know, Alex, a number of people have been
[1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:21.880]  fined or ticketed or even arrested for breaking lockdowns across North America. I've even seen
[1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:28.600]  some dramatic cases in the United States. But Alex, I've never heard of anyone actually being put in
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:38.760]  a maximum security prison. Today marks one week that Pastor James Coates has sat in the Edmonton
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:45.800]  remand center, one of Canada's largest highest security prisons. I heard yesterday that his
[1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:52.760]  lawyer said he's sharing his cell with a cellmate who was coming off of a drug. He was on math or
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:33:00.360]  I didn't hear all the details, but he's in with maximum security convicts. This is where people
[1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:07.880]  are held in the highest security. He was in a form of solitary confinement. He could receive no
[1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:15.720]  visitors, not even his family or his congregants. They claimed it was for COVID reasons. Ironically,
[1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:24.040]  about 400 criminals from this prison were released for COVID worries, but they're putting this pastor
[1:33:24.040 --> 1:33:33.400]  in. Alex, he is in there because he refuses to sign a promise not to open his church. This is as
[1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:43.080]  close to raw persecution of Christians. I think we've seen in Canada ever. It was last year that
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:47.240]  you first broke it. It's now been confirmed, or at least I saw that you broke it first. Others
[1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:53.400]  may have broken it before you, that the Montreal state government was saying in French, we're
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:57.880]  going to grab people when the next wave comes, which of course it did, this winter, and put them
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:02.440]  in secret facilities. Now, Trudeau is out and I have his tweets saying, oh, even if you test not
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:06.520]  positive flying back in with these fraudulent PCR tests, we're going to make you stay at a hotel at
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:12.680]  your own expense. Even if you do test negative, we'll make you stay at your house at your expense.
[1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:17.720]  So if you're positive or not positive, you've got a quarantine. I mean, this is serious basic
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:22.680]  dictatorship that he says he's such a fan of. Yeah, well, let me give you some details on what
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:30.600]  you just mentioned because it actually just kicked into effect yesterday. Anyone coming from any foreign
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:36.600]  country, including the United States, had to quarantine for two weeks at home in Canada.
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:41.320]  And you can disagree with it, but that's what it was. Go home, stay home for two weeks,
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:51.720]  even if you tested non positive. But now you must go to a government selected hotel,
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:35:02.600]  pay $2,000 to stay there for three days while your first test results are expected. So you
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:09.240]  can't go home. You have to stay at these government selected. They used to be hotels, but now they're
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:17.400]  COVID detention centers. If you leave them, it is an offense. You stay there. If you come up
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:22.280]  negative in the test, you're allowed to go home to serve up the rest of your quarantine.
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.640]  If you're positive, you have to stay in these hotels. $2,000 for three nights in a hotel.
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:32.520]  What is this, the four seasons? So this is conducting the general public into the criminal
[1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:37.160]  justice system, but it's a medical system arbitrary with no due process directed by the
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:44.840]  United Nations, the perfect cover to go after political enemies. Well, first of all, it violates
[1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:49.880]  our constitution, freedom of mobility. If you open the front page of your passport,
[1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:55.800]  I have a Canadian passport. I'm sure the American passport is similar. It's basically a promise
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:36:00.600]  that you're allowed to come back home to your country. That's hardwired right into our Canadian
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:05.560]  Constitution, the right of citizens to come back home. That is one of the most basic rights
[1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:12.280]  going back to ancient Roman times. It exactly is. Also, Canada's Quarantine Act, which I've
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:18.280]  studied recently, forbids the government from putting anything invasive in your body without
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:24.840]  your permission. They can't stick a swab up your nose. So I don't even know how a variety of these
[1:36:24.840 --> 1:36:31.080]  tests are legal under the Quarantine Act, but I think you made the key point. We're treating
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:37.720]  healthy people like sick people. We're treating innocent people like guilty people. And Alex,
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:44.200]  I'm sure you know this because you're very widely read, but the word quarantine comes from the Italian
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:51.160]  Caranta Giorni, 40 days when ships would come in places like Venice from places that had the plague.
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:56.200]  The ships would have to stay offshore from the main port for up to 40 days.
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:36:59.400]  They did have bubonic plague, a black spot on a white flag, exactly.
[1:37:00.120 --> 1:37:05.000]  And they would get a clean bill of health. You would get a bill of health. Is it clean or not?
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:09.640]  People would board the ship and learn about the passengers, learn where had it been.
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:16.200]  But they only quarantined the sick, Alex. They did not quarantine the healthy. And that's the
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:21.560]  fundamental difference between how plagues and pandemics were dealt with in the past
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:28.280]  and how they're dealt with now. Now we're treating an entire citizenry as if they're guilty and we're
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:37.080]  using irrational lockdown laws and mask laws as an entry way for police to criminalize.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.880]  Stay there, my friend. We're going to come right back and give you the floor because you're on fire
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:44.360]  here. This is so huge. This is so historic. And you're right in the fire. You're right where
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:49.000]  they're implementing what's coming here next. They admit Canada, Spain, and for all reasons,
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:54.200]  Australia are the testing grounds. We'll be right back. Now is the time to get prepared.
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.760]  Now is the time to get high quality, storable food that's ready to be shipped to you within days.
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:03.800]  Infowarsstore.com has the highest quality, storable food recently processed in package

[1:38:55.080 --> 1:39:03.480]  funny movie that came out called Wayne's World. Even before I had an access to the show in the
[1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:09.400]  mid-1990s, I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that looks fun. In fact, you speak out,
[1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:13.400]  have your own ideas, and even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real.
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:20.360]  Well, what do they say in Wayne's World? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:24.440]  cover these huge topics, I don't feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.040]  or so real, but I'm trying to tell you the truth. I'm trying to get it right, and most of the time
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:34.280]  we do. The globalists love lying to you. They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity.
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:39.880]  They enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:46.440]  set down and disgusting. So you've got to pledge for myself and the All-In-Full Wars crew that we
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:50.920]  will never join the globalists. We will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:56.840]  all in this together. I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on air,
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:01.880]  about looking at the world from the perspective of the globalists, that the public is so dumb
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:05.800]  down that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them,
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:11.160]  that we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed. Yes, that's the position of the
[1:40:11.160 --> 1:40:16.040]  globalists. They play God, and they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:20.680]  to us. You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me. They've tried to get you
[1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:26.520]  to join them, but metaphysically, at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit. I'm the connection
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:31.720]  to God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy. But I'll tell you,
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:36.440]  at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:40.680]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on them. Whether you're just a
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:47.640]  steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God. And treating other people
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:52.280]  like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the universe doesn't like,
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:41:02.280]  and that's a fact.
[1:41:22.280 --> 1:41:36.120]  Yet, the resistance.video, the resistance.video, they're trying to block us because the truth is
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:41.880]  powerful and can't defeat them. So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:46.280]  videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the press information
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:52.840]  is there. The resistance.video, share the link, the resistance.video, the resistance.video.
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:00.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:17.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We have Ezra LeVan and Rebel Media. Check out their
[1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:22.200]  site. It's excellent. Their shows, rebelnews.com. It's amongst the best research out there.
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:26.120]  And it's not just Canada centric. It's for the whole planet. But I tell you,
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:31.640]  Canada is a testing ground of globalism. Great people, but very, very sad. What's happened there?
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:37.320]  So let's finish up here as it's all interconnected with this pastor that maximum security,
[1:42:37.320 --> 1:42:42.600]  solitary confinement here in the U.S. and blue cities, they've released rapist murderers,
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:47.480]  but they're also putting people that have broken quarantine in places in California
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:50.680]  or other areas. They're putting them in jail. But when the governors get caught having their own
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:54.520]  parties, well, that's okay. When a governor gets caught sending COVID patients into nursing homes,
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:42:58.600]  that's okay. I mean, the level of hypocrisy is just astounding. And then now Trudeau,
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:02.440]  I'm reading these tweets here. It sounds like something out of a science fiction
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:08.440]  dystopic book they write 20 years ago about if your results come back negative,
[1:43:08.440 --> 1:43:13.000]  you'll be able to quarantine at home. This quarantine is mandatory and will be enforced.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.640]  If you test results, come back positive for COVID, you'll be required to immediately quarantine
[1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:23.720]  the designated government facility. And as you said, pay $3,000 for it. This is martial law. This
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:33.160]  is insane. Where is it going now? Well, the trouble is judges who should have the courage in my mind
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:37.800]  to say, whoa, our constitution, I mean, our Canadian constitution is not as strong as your
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:45.800]  American constitution. Yours is forged in liberty, a rebellion against the crown. Canada is more
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:51.640]  passive. We never left the crown. We had an evolution, not a revolution, but we still have
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:59.160]  basic freedoms in our constitution, Alex. So a judge could strike down these as unconstitutional.
[1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:05.400]  Our constitution like yours does not contain a pandemic exemption. But the thing is,
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:11.560]  the lockdown itself has become a belief system, a superstition, really. And the masks are the
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:16.920]  flag of that superstition. They're a sign that you're obedient to it. And no one is more part
[1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:23.640]  of the establishment in our society, Alex, than a judge. So if you go to a judge and say, hey,
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:31.000]  your honor, I want you to pull the rug out from this entire apparatus that's being built using
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:36.840]  the pandemic as an excuse, that judge feels enormous peer pressure from every other person
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:41.240]  he encounters in society. Judges are at the highest heights. They know politicians. They
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:48.200]  know fancy lawyers. They probably know public health doctors. So it is extremely hard for even
[1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:54.920]  a good judge who loves liberty to buck the peer pressure. I haven't seen it yet in Canada,
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:45:01.720]  other than one judge in Quebec that lifted the curfew from homeless people. There actually is
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:08.440]  a curfew in Quebec that applied to everyone, like we're children, Alex, from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m.
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:13.640]  They were treating adults like children. If you were out past 8 p.m., you got massive fines.
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:18.040]  And the cops were giving fines to homeless people. They weren't giving them a home.
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:22.360]  The homeless shelters are either full or they're closed because of COVID. So all these cops were
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:27.880]  doing is giving people the lowliest of the low an extra ticket. That doesn't serve public health.
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:33.080]  That's like taking away a race, centuries of the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights,
[1:45:33.080 --> 1:45:37.320]  and to really butcher it all. Where is the pushback? Because some of the most brutal footage I've
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:41.640]  seen of them going to houses where there's one person more in a party, so they beat people up.
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:45.800]  I mean, the police in many areas are just very jackbooted, very authoritarian.
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:51.960]  Yeah, well, can I show you a video I sent a clip to Daria about half an hour ago? This is from Edmonton.
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:59.800]  That's the city where this pastor is in jail. So there was a peaceful protest. Yeah, this is exactly
[1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:06.120]  it. And all of a sudden, they grabbed that man there who's the brother of a pastor. And he
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:11.560]  literally wasn't doing anything. And they pushed aside all reporters, and they dragged them away.
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:18.200]  They had this huge SWAT team style bus. And it was the most bizarre thing. I could be quiet if you
[1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:21.320]  want to turn up the volume because it's quite something. Let's play the clip from the beginning.
[1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:23.240]  Here's the rebel media news piece.
[1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:48.760]  Can you tell me what is your name and why they arresting you?
[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:54.840]  I haven't done anything. My hands are being broken right now. Because he's a Christian.
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:00.600]  What is your reason for arresting them? I didn't do anything.
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:07.080]  Please explain to me what law he broke. Can anyone explain to me?
[1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:11.160]  I'm here to keep the peace. I have no idea. You have no idea what he did.
[1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:18.440]  Folks, Nazis just fallen orders. And this is definitely what we're seeing in Germany.
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:22.840]  They said the lockdown's never ending. Ezra reminded me of this clip when he was last on.
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:29.080]  Let's not forget why their prime minister, Mr. Mr. Trudeau, is supporting all this because he
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:33.880]  quote, admires communist China that again has the number one record for most people killed. Here it is.
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:44.840]  Adleration I actually have for China. Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:50.040]  to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:55.720]  start investing in solar. There is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:01.080]  of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted. That I find quite interesting.
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:04.920]  So he's not a Francophile. He doesn't like France. He's not an Anglophile. He doesn't
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:10.600]  like England. He's not a Marophile. He doesn't like America. No, he's a China file. I guess a
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:17.800]  Gigi Ping file. And this is outrageous. And last week, Ezra, we saw Obama's front man,
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:24.760]  I guess, Biden say at the Town Hall of CNN, I'm sure you saw it, that, oh, invading Hong Kong's
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:28.680]  OK and putting people in death camps is OK. I mean, I feel like even Alex Jones, you think,
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:31.720]  would be not shocked. I'm even feeling like I'm in a Twilight Zone here.
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:38.600]  Yeah. Well, just yesterday, Canada's parliament had a motion. So it's not a binding law or anything,
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:45.160]  but it was a mental statement saying that the way China is treating the Uyghur minority in
[1:48:45.160 --> 1:48:49.880]  that Western province of Xinjiang, calling that a genocide. Now, that's a tough word,
[1:48:49.880 --> 1:48:55.880]  but I think there's some evidence behind it. Trudeau refused to vote one way or the other.
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:01.640]  In fact, he instructed his entire cabinet to abstain. Well, look, why don't you take a stand?
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:07.480]  Either you think it's a genocide or you don't. I should remind you, Alex, that Justin Trudeau
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:13.880]  has said that Canada has committed a genocide against our own Aboriginal people. So Justin
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:20.040]  Trudeau throws the word genocide around against our own country. But when China treats Tibet,
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:26.120]  the Uyghurs, Hong Kong, et cetera, political dissidents, Falun Gong, Christians, like dirt,
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:30.920]  Trudeau won't offend them. And it's just a real Hitler level. You know, people over
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:35.160]  here, Hitler, there's footage of hundreds of thousands of people in camps reported to kill
[1:49:35.160 --> 1:49:39.560]  hundreds a day. They put bags over their heads, take them and shoot them and take their organs.
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:45.080]  I mean, this is like train car level stuff. And it's like, Trudeau, as you pointed out,
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:51.880]  just saw the article, he won't even say no to it. Not just, he won't say no. I want to remind you
[1:49:51.880 --> 1:49:58.360]  that about 800 days ago, so we're coming up on almost three years, frankly, China
[1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:04.920]  grabbed two Canadian civilians off the street, basically a kidnapping and has been holding
[1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:11.480]  them ever since. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, it was a diplomatic, tough guy move
[1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:16.760]  against Canada. You would think Canada would withdraw our ambassador, would put sanctions on,
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:23.080]  you know, there's about 100,000 children of Communist Party members from China who
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:28.360]  go to Canadian universities. So the Communist elite in China sends its kids to Canada
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:32.520]  to go to our schools. And some of them are just normal kids. But a lot of them are political
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:38.280]  and they bring their Communist Party politics to Canadian universities. They also, in some cases,
[1:50:38.280 --> 1:50:43.720]  bring espionage. The crazy thing is, Trudeau supports that espionage. Here's what I mean.
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:51.320]  Just last week, Trudeau gave $4.8 million to sponsor a research project by Huawei,
[1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:57.720]  the tech giant in China, at Canadian universities. So we're literally giving foreign aid from Canada
[1:50:57.720 --> 1:51:05.800]  to China to help develop their spy technology. I think you know that Canada was training
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:12.920]  Chinese soldiers in cold weather warfare. That was a scoop I had in December, redacted
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:15.640]  documents that were sent to me that were not fully redacted.
[1:51:15.640 --> 1:51:17.480]  Trudeau tried to cover that up, too, didn't he?
[1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:24.680]  He did. In fact, he was outraged that the military wanted to stop training Chinese troops in
[1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:29.160]  Canada. The military said, this is not a good idea. And they postponed them.
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:29.720]  And Trudeau-
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:33.800]  Yeah, because bigger than this training, they're infiltrating with spies.
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:42.760]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, I think that Justin Trudeau carries on his father Pierre Trudeau's
[1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:48.520]  love for Communist China. Pierre Trudeau had a soft spot for dictators, whether it was Fidel Castro,
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:53.560]  the Soviet Union, or Communist China. He never met a Communist tyrant he didn't love.
[1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:58.120]  And Justin Trudeau is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but growing up at the knee of his
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:04.520]  father, he surely overheard so much pro-communist talk that he sort of has a child's recollection
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:09.640]  of what his dad would say. So when Justin Trudeau praises Communist regimes today,
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.360]  he sounds childish because he's just remembering what his dad said when he himself was a kid,
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:18.120]  but the feeling is there. He literally loves Xi Jinping.
[1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:23.560]  Wow. We're going to be 30 more minutes. I want to talk about where this goes. If Canada is the
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:29.160]  model, what are we facing here? Where's the pushback? And we'll also talk about post-Trump.
[1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:33.560]  What do you think of O'Biden? And it really is O'Biden. And so much more.
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:37.800]  As we're at Levant, you've got to visit their website. It's excellent, rebelnews.com.
[1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:40.920]  I mean, it's just some of the best reporting out there. We'll be right back with our number three.
[1:52:40.920 --> 1:52:48.840]  Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy,
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:55.080]  food, and medicine. And with the blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to
[1:52:55.080 --> 1:53:01.640]  bring in federal and globalist control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:06.600]  the few grocery stores and restaurants that were open and most of them getting turned away after
[1:53:06.600 --> 1:53:11.000]  hours of freezing in the cold. We've seen millions of people sleeping in their cars
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.320]  because they don't have any power in their house and then running out of gas. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:53:15.320 --> 1:53:20.520]  energy is king. And food is the energy our bodies run off of and water as well. They're both
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:24.520]  available, the highest quality water filtration and the highest quality storeable foods right now,
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:30.200]  massively discounted because of this emergency for everybody nationwide at infoawardstore.com.
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:34.920]  Fifty dollars off on our best stainless steel gravity fed filter and 10% off all storeable food
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:40.680]  in all packages at infoawardstore.com. That's infoawardstore.com or preparewithalex.com.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:48.120]  Big discounts for only a few more days. As negative as times are right now and as depressing as
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  things can be, you have to understand that this is all a test. This experience, this
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:54:02.280]  whitelist planet is a reckoning. It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:08.040]  so we can decide where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to. And it really does
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:12.840]  come down to that. So as saddest things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:18.520]  the world as well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of
[1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:26.280]  us having our own will. God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.920]  thing. When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:37.320]  D.C. and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling
[1:54:37.320 --> 1:54:41.080]  you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in a bad because Satan hates you because you're made in
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:49.400]  the image of God, the creator of the universe. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:55:05.960]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to pray and who to blame.
[1:55:08.280 --> 1:55:15.960]  Everybody won't be treated all the same. There'll be a golden letter reaching down.
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:21.800]  This is a short segment, a long segment coming up here. The natural event of rebel media,
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:28.360]  the head of it, the founder of it is here and we're seeing on a scale of 1 to 10, 6, 7, 8s of
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:35.640]  tyranny. And it's a worldwide UN directed program by private corporations that engage in fascist
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:39.640]  activity at the top that use communism at the bottom. What would you call this moment in time?
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:44.600]  Because I was having a conversation this morning with a very famous national talk show host,
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:48.760]  I guess second only, the Rush Limbaugh that just died. And it's like, yeah,
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:53.560]  when are you Alex ready to run to Venezuela? Argentina or Chile or something?
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:59.320]  How about out of the fire into the frying pan? And I'm not going to do that, but there is that
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:03.240]  thing historically. Why did people stay in countries as they got worse and worse? Well,
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:07.720]  it's your home and you want to fight for it. But at the level of acceleration, it keeps accelerating
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:14.600]  this fast, Ezra. I mean, Canada, Australia, Spain, the US to a great extent under Obama, even Naomi
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:18.440]  Wolfe, the big liberals said she shouldn't have voted for Biden. He's a fascist dictator. I mean,
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:23.800]  that's really what's happening. So where does this go from here? Well, the phrase I like to use
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:30.840]  is it's easier to fight in the first ditch than the last ditch. And I think we are well past the
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:36.440]  first ditch. It's time to fight. And by fight, I mean using every legal and peaceful means we can.
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:43.640]  And so with lawyers is one way. I think civil disobedience, what this pastor is doing is quite
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:49.720]  something. I should tell you that he's been in jail for seven days now. Well, three days ago on
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:57.720]  the Sunday, his church was packed. It was completely full. They had to open a spillout room for
[1:56:57.720 --> 1:57:03.560]  people to watch on video. That got full. People parked in the parking lot to listen to the live
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:11.960]  stream. There were seven police vehicles that showed up, but they didn't dare move in. Why is
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:18.360]  that? Because we're not yet at the last ditch, Alex. And so when 350 people show up at a little
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:24.120]  church where the pastor is still in prison and they say, you know what, you can't arrest all of us.
[1:57:24.120 --> 1:57:29.640]  Now they can arrest all of them, Alex. They can. We've seen that in history, but not at the first
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:37.800]  ditch. So those 350 Christians decided that now is the time to fight, not a year from now or two
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:44.040]  years from now. And the government blinked. They did not make any arrests. Now they might later on
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:47.960]  go to someone's home and give them a ticket. It shows their bullies. They just want to get the
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:54.360]  leaders and punish them. I think that's going to backfire. Yeah. And now this is spreading. The
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:58:01.960]  church rebellion, as we're calling it, is spreading. There was a church and I'll send you the link of
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:05.800]  this in our next commercial break, because we're coming to it soon. There's a church in the other
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:11.720]  Alberta city of Calgary that was inspired by this first church. So they opened. Well, guess what?
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:17.560]  The bylaw officers came by, but we had our cameras there. We started asking the bylaw
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:26.280]  officers questions. They ran away. They ran away. So the surveillance spies don't like being spied on.
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:32.040]  And I think it comes to citizen journalists and crowdfunded lawyers. And now is the time to fight,
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:39.800]  not when it's too late. Now is the time. And I tell you what Alfie Oaks is doing down in Naples,
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:44.440]  Florida with his grocery store group. What what you're doing, what these churches are doing,
[1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:49.000]  what the Orthodox and Hasidic Jews are doing in New York and Israel, saying we're going to have
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:52.360]  our churches and we're not going to wear masks and we're not going to take your shots. And then
[1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:58.920]  the persecution I've seen in Israel really has been frightening. But it's a global phenomenon.
[1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:03.640]  I want to ask you, we come back in for 60 seconds. Why it's global? Since when to open the paper,
[1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:08.120]  it's like, well, the UN says you can take your mask off in 2024. Now, well, the UN says we're
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:12.200]  going to give pregnant women shots now without study. It's like, when did I wake up and the
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:17.880]  United Nations was in charge and the WHO of everything? Ezra Levant of rebelmedia, rebelmedia.com
[1:59:17.880 --> 1:59:24.360]  is our guest. I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and newswars.com. And I want him to recap this other
[1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:28.840]  church, this chain reaction, because this is the answer to tyrants. I agree. This is the second
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:33.720]  ditch. We've all got to start saying no, civil disobedience, nonviolent, and they can't put
[1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:38.760]  us all in jail, ladies and gentlemen. And it just moves on from there. We got to go protest at these
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:43.240]  government officials' houses. We got to sue them because they're coming out for us. This is a global
[1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:53.400]  authoritarian plan. Just ask Klaus Schwab back in 60 seconds. I knew Trump was in battle.
[1:59:54.200 --> 2:00:00.440]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[2:00:01.720 --> 2:00:06.920]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh, no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest. He's invincible.
[2:00:06.920 --> 2:00:10.760]  And I understand why people aren't to believe that, because this is scary what's going on
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:14.600]  with the global government and the New World Order. Now that people hold up to the fact that that's
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:19.480]  real, they won't somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look at
[2:00:19.480 --> 2:00:24.120]  how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled, depending on the drug once Biden signed
[2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:28.760]  that executive order. We pay the most of anybody in the world. That's just one case of hundreds of
[2:00:28.760 --> 2:00:33.640]  things that Trump had reversed. And now people are going to feel we're staying in the pain,
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:38.440]  energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate,
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:43.080]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:49.400]  and just engaged in all sorts of criminal activity, because the fix is in folks. The swamp is deep.
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:51.320]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it.
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:01:10.760]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:18.120]  Jones, the Southern primary law center. Of course, put up a map of people they say are racist and
[2:01:18.120 --> 2:01:21.880]  evil and homophobic because they don't want their five-year-olds being taught anything sexual.
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:27.480]  And the family research council famously got shot up. Well, now stuff on the Southern
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:31.320]  primary law center, maps getting burnt all over the country, Hispanic Baptist churches,
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.200]  Black churches in Alabama, if they hear that they preach against homosexuality or anything else,
[2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:39.240]  they get firebucked. And the media is like, yeah, that's good. That's what you deserve.
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:43.960]  So the left has become extremely aggressive, not just here, but all over the world.
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:50.280]  And Ezra Levant of rebel media was documenting that in Canada, they're going out and putting
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:55.960]  pastors in solitary confinement who's still in jail right now, no judge, no jury. He's not
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.880]  being convicted for having his packed church open after it being closed artificially for a year.
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:04.680]  So you can have your sporting events and things, and you can have your liquor stores,
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:09.560]  you can have your topless bars, but you can't have your churches. He was mentioning how that's
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:15.560]  spreading now and how it's a chain reaction of people saying, no. So as we take this segment
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:20.280]  to recap what's happening in Canada, how it's an example of tyranny, but also an example
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:26.280]  of resistance and where you see this going. Sure. There's a church just outside Edmonton,
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:31.160]  Alberta called Grace Life Church and their pastor, James Coates said, you know what,
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:36.200]  we're just going to have church because our way of praying is together, not over Zoom,
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:42.040]  not from home. We're going to church together. And now this is an image here of the Calgary Church.
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:46.120]  Let me explain this image that you see here. You see those two trucks there, Alex? Sorry,
[2:02:46.120 --> 2:02:51.320]  I'm getting off gear for a second. Those two trucks were the enforcement vans that we spotted at
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:56.040]  the Calgary Church. We had a drone with us, Alex. Take your time. Tell those stories.
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:03:02.200]  Tie it all together. Tell us about this. Okay. Okay. So this, this was spreading to a Calgary
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:06.840]  church. So we had reporters at both the Calgary and Edmonton Church. You can see the cops peeking
[2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:13.000]  out of the window there. We chased them off. We had reporters at that Calgary church and we,
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:17.720]  when we pointed the cameras at them and asked them questions, they scurried off. We tracked them.
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:22.680]  They went to hide in this parking lot a couple blocks away. Stay with this video. Those are
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:27.720]  the two enforcement vans that were spying on the church. Now the drone goes back to the church.
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:33.800]  So you'll see that's the two cop cars. They ran away when we simply asked them questions.
[2:03:33.800 --> 2:03:40.920]  Why are you persecuting Christian churches? Why are you allowing Walmart and Costco to operate
[2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:45.880]  liquor stores and cannabis stores? But you're harassing the church. Now the drone is headed
[2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:51.560]  back to the church. So this is, as you can see, a second church in Calgary, a smaller church.
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:57.240]  This was after services had sort of finished. So there's only about 20 cars there. But my
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:04.840]  point is the church rebellion is spreading and a lot of these enforcement officers aren't used
[2:04:04.840 --> 2:04:10.440]  to doing such dirty work. If you're an enforcement officer, I don't know, maybe there's a dog barking
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:15.800]  or someone parking where they shouldn't. You're a bylaw enforcement officer. You're not actually
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:22.200]  a policeman. You do low level, you know, someone's camping out overnight in the river.
[2:04:22.200 --> 2:04:29.720]  That's right. So probably most of them are good enough guys and gals. So now they're being given
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:36.280]  a terrible mission, go and ticket people who simply go to church, give them multi-thousand
[2:04:36.280 --> 2:04:42.360]  dollar fines, threaten them with jail. So we turn a camera on them and say, how do you feel
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:46.600]  about what you're doing? Is that what you thought you'd be? Yes. So this is the Calgary church here
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:54.920]  where our drone was. So these were the vans of the cops who were coming to this little church.
[2:04:54.920 --> 2:05:00.120]  This is the little church in Calgary that was inspired by the big church in Edmonton. I say
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:06.920]  again, in Edmonton, that pastor remains in jail. Today is his seventh day in a maximum security
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:13.480]  facility simply because he will not undertake, he will not make a legal promise not to open
[2:05:13.480 --> 2:05:20.520]  his church. Trouble is that kind of courage is spreading and his church is full and they could
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:28.280]  arrest the substitute pastor. Well, guess what? Someone would take his place and courage engenders
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:34.920]  more courage. And Alberta is sort of like the Texas of Canada, Alex. So if there was any place
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:41.240]  we'd see this freedom fight back, it doesn't surprise me. It's from Alberta. And the Premier
[2:05:41.240 --> 2:05:46.600]  of Alberta, I know him personally, he's actually quite sympathetic to Christians in his real life.
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:52.280]  So it must be troubling for him to be the only province in Canada, perhaps the only jurisdiction
[2:05:52.280 --> 2:05:58.120]  in North America, to actually jail a pastor like what they do in China or Iran. Why are we seeing
[2:05:58.120 --> 2:06:03.560]  this all over Australia, Europe, New Zealand, Canada, the US? You'll literally have Walmart and
[2:06:03.560 --> 2:06:08.680]  Targets open, but there'll be a Catholic church, a Baptist church, you name it. They will shut it
[2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:12.760]  and liberals will come protest it. But then when Black Lives Matter protests, it's wonderful and
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:20.600]  safe. I mean, there really is a biblical attack on believers happening. Oh, yeah. And I use the
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:26.520]  phrase superstition for the new belief system about this invisible power called COVID. And you
[2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:32.200]  have to wear a mask. It's like wearing a cross to ward off a vampire. You wear a mask. It's your
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:38.760]  symbol of submission to lockdownism. And it gives you the moral authority to snitch on your neighbor.
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:43.640]  It gives you the moral authority to treat someone poorly if they themselves don't have a mask.
[2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:49.320]  We see people so proud of shaming their neighbor, they do a selfie video,
[2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:54.680]  scolding someone in a store for not wearing a mask. When do we lose our manners and our way
[2:06:54.680 --> 2:07:00.680]  of dealing with each other neighborly? It's when we replaced our norms, our Western civilization
[2:07:00.680 --> 2:07:08.120]  norms with these new public health orders that make no sense, that dehumanizes. And by the way,
[2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:14.360]  when you cover someone's face, you cover a way of relating to each other. We study each other's
[2:07:14.360 --> 2:07:19.000]  face for nonverbal cues. Yeah, we know the bad guys wear the mask. We know the executioners wear it.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.320]  This is a cult. Programming is that we're all dirty. We're all bad. I'm sure you've seen the
[2:07:23.320 --> 2:07:28.440]  great reset. Klaus Schwab says, anyone with industries in close contact will no longer have
[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:34.120]  jobs, no more contacts. If you stay at home, you have nothing, you own nothing, good for earth.
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:40.040]  What? You're really locking us up. And again, who made the you in God? How did this happen?
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:45.080]  Well, I've got bad news for you, Canada. As you know, Justin Trudeau, our prime minister,
[2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:50.280]  I don't know if you know this Alex, but he's a bit of a marijuana enthusiast. And I'm not
[2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:57.160]  saying that other than he's not exactly focused on the job. He's been working from home for about
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:02.920]  10 months now. He rarely goes into parliament. He's pretty much mentally checked out. He still
[2:08:02.920 --> 2:08:10.120]  has his vacation beard from the winter of 2019. So he's not really the hands on prime minister.
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:14.760]  I know that won't shock you to hear that. He's pretty dopey. But the real prime minister in
[2:08:14.760 --> 2:08:19.720]  Canada, his deputy is named Christia Freeland. I've got two shocking things to tell you about
[2:08:19.720 --> 2:08:25.000]  Christia Freeland. Number one, even though she's the deputy prime minister of Canada,
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.560]  that would be like saying the vice president in the United States. She sits on the board of
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:34.680]  the World Economic Forum. Today, she sits on it. How's that not a conflict of interest?
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:40.920]  Canada's public health officer, our version of Anthony Fauci for the first half of the pandemic
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:46.360]  was a paid employee of the World Health Organization at the UN. So there's total conflicts of interest
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:51.560]  everywhere. Absolutely. And finally, and this is you're not even going to believe this because
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:56.360]  it's too on the nose. It's impossible. Christia Freeland, before she became a politician,
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:01.960]  she was a journalist and she was writing the biography, the authorized biography,
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:10.440]  of George Soros. It never ends. It never ends. In fact, I bet Daria could find it online really
[2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:15.880]  quick just for the quick Google search. This is photo right after Trudeau was elected of Trudeau,
[2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:24.200]  Freeland, and Soros meeting at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. One of his first major
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:31.000]  visits after he became PM prime minister in 2015 was to fly to Switzerland to have a private
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:36.200]  there it is. That's George Soros on the left, Justin Trudeau in the middle, and that woman on the
[2:09:36.200 --> 2:09:42.600]  right, Christia Freeland, is on the board of the World Economic Forum. She was going to be Soros'
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:48.840]  official biographer, but instead she just happens to be the deputy prime minister of Canada. And
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:53.400]  given that Justin Trudeau is mentally being checked out for about a year and a half,
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:57.320]  she's the de facto prime minister. So basically the de facto. It's the same thing now with Biden.
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:02.520]  I was going to raise that. This is perfect. They want some zombie or pod head in there so literally
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:07.400]  you can have Soros people and others in there controlling the government. I got one last thing
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:11.160]  for you and you're going to think I'm making this up, but you can Google it. One of the first
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:18.600]  things that Trudeau did was he signed a contract, a formal contract with George Soros' Open Societies
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:26.920]  Foundations to develop mass refugee policy for Canada. But he literally contracted out Canada's
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:32.680]  policy to Soros who isn't even a Canadian. Let's come back to that because I did see that and folks
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:37.160]  it's the same thing where they now say Bill Gates runs the G8 because Boris Johnson is on the
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:42.520]  rotating board because he's the prime minister of England of the UK. And they said, oh, Bill Gates
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:47.720]  is in charge of the G8. And then Bill Gates is in charge of US COVID response. Who died made these
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:57.320]  guys die. I love the Patriot blend. Wake up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it.
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:03.240]  We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's
[2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:09.320]  what fills my soul. Wake up America Patriot blend coffee. Folks, we have had this coffee for years
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:15.720]  at infowarstore.com years. Never raised the price. Never. The Wake up America blend, the best coffee,
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:20.760]  the crew here loves it. We drink it every day. And of course, that's just one of the great ways
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:26.040]  you can support info wars here. Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody. Why not support
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:30.840]  info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake up America Patriot blend. Of
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:35.080]  course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star. When you have
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:39.560]  thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody

[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:29.800]  Both of them have said they like easy ping and death camps. Well, once they like basic
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:34.920]  dictatorship, the entire China the most, just basic, you know, it's like a Honda or something.
[2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:41.560]  It's a good basic dictatorship. Most Nazis in its belt of dead people, anybody Stalin and Hitler
[2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:47.240]  combined. And then you've got every day you turn on, well, the U.N. is the only one that can say
[2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:55.240]  something about COVID. How do we counter a global corporate move like this? Well, I think
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:02.120]  interestingly, the answer might include foreign countries that don't want to be a part of it.
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:08.440]  We saw that after Twitter suspended President Trump's account, even while he was president,
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:13.560]  you saw other countries, including Germany, England, Merkel of all people and France.
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:22.040]  Yeah, saying they weren't quite comfortable with some, you know, tech oligarch in Silicon Valley,
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:27.720]  deciding what they could occur. Couldn't turn off you. I remember Uganda was having an election
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.640]  and they could see some meddling from Silicon Valley. So they simply banned all of Twitter from
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:38.600]  Uganda. And Twitter was squawking about that. And I sort of chuckled, you know, the saying,
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:43.240]  build your own Twitter. Hey, Twitter, build your own Uganda. My point is, I don't know anything
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:50.680]  about Uganda, really, Alex. But maybe the same way Republicans feel about Silicon Valley, those
[2:14:50.680 --> 2:14:59.960]  guys don't like me, don't know me. Imagine how that goes for Jair Bolsonaro, the president of
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:07.960]  Brazil, who has had fights with Facebook over WhatsApp groups, or India. And by the way,
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:15.400]  India is used to unhooking because they've banned about 50 apps from China, including TikTok,
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:19.400]  I think, because they're having a sort of a war in the Himalayas with China.
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:22.360]  Well, let's expand on that. I interrupted you and made a false statement. It was
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  Macron said he didn't like him shutting him down. Merkel said she understood it and liked
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:32.360]  all the things and then expanding on that. Australia just caved in to Mark Zuckerberg,
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:37.480]  because he was blocking all government information on Facebook because he didn't like
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:42.120]  legislation they had. Yeah, well, I'm not going to say it's a slam dunk. But, you know,
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:47.240]  India is interesting because they're a tech, a high tech country. They I mean, not all of it.
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:52.040]  But much of India remains very poor and low tech. But they have a tech industry.
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:57.320]  Just the same way they have Bollywood for our Hollywood. They definitely have a large brain
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:04.360]  trust. And maybe they, for their own reasons of national security and sovereignty to deal with
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:09.800]  China, maybe they'll develop their own systems and maybe that will weaken the Facebook, YouTube,
[2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:15.240]  Google's of the world. Now, that's that's only a partial solution to the tech side. You need
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:23.480]  countries to withdraw from UN mandates from UN framework conventions, whether it's on global
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:29.080]  warming or the migration pact, or they have small arms. I mean, the UN is trying to do through
[2:16:29.720 --> 2:16:35.880]  their structures. What American and Canadian and other local countries refused to do through
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:42.520]  theirs. Donald Trump was the toughest critic the UN ever faced. I love his line. I represent
[2:16:42.520 --> 2:16:48.120]  Pittsburgh, not Paris. When he pulled out of the climate treaty, I think they've got four years worth
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:54.280]  of bad ideas they want to catch up on. And by the way, you just, you just literally stole my
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:59.000]  thunder. I was going to bring up Trump and the Paris climate accord. They are behind. They're
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:04.040]  trying to accelerate all that. And so Trump was getting us out of the WHO. It's a fraud. And I
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:10.280]  noticed Trudeau is paying Wuhan 800 plus thousand. Biden just gave him five million. What in the
[2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:16.280]  world is going on at that lab? Oh, yeah. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is considered
[2:17:16.280 --> 2:17:21.800]  ground zero in a number of ways. Did the virus come from there? Was it leaked? What happened?
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:29.960]  Well, Trudeau after the pandemic sent 830 grand in foreign aid to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[2:17:29.960 --> 2:17:34.280]  That's not it. You know, there's the different vaccines. There's Moderna. There's Pfizer. There's
[2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:38.040]  all these Trudeau. You know, you're not even going to believe this, Alex, because it's too much.
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:44.680]  It's too much. But who did Trudeau sign a deal with right away for a vaccine? It was called
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:53.640]  Cancino, C-I-N-S-I-N-O. It was a Chinese vaccine maker affiliated with the People's Liberation
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:59.320]  Army. So he didn't just, Trudeau didn't just sign a contract for a Chinese vaccine, which would
[2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:04.360]  have been crazy to begin with. He signed up for one that was being made by the People's Liberation
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:09.880]  Army. What is wrong with that boy's head? Now, in the end, they double-crossed him and they
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:15.000]  refused to send it. But he was ready to do it. And he actually said he would allow them
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:22.600]  to use Canadians as the guinea pigs for their PLA vaccine. I saw that. And what's
[2:18:22.600 --> 2:18:27.160]  what about the Chinese is when you totally grovel to them, they bitch-flap you. I mean,
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:32.120]  China is like so corrupt and so evil, the most cold-blooded regime in history. And the left
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:37.160]  just loves them. I mean, the Washington Post has headlines, G.G. Ping needs to destroy Trump.
[2:18:37.160 --> 2:18:41.400]  And he's so sexy and he's amazing and he's incredible.
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:45.880]  You know, Alex, I want to tell you a story. I don't know if we've ever talked about this before,
[2:18:45.880 --> 2:18:50.840]  but early in the pandemic, I wrote a short book. It's a quick read. I don't even think it's 100
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:57.080]  full pages. And I called it China Virus. And, you know, that's just like we say Spanish flu.
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:18:59.880]  No, I didn't see the book. I didn't read it, but I did see a piece on it, yes.
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:06.920]  Yes, it's a short book. And it was really about Trudeau's, the real virus being Trudeau's
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:12.360]  love affair with Communist China. So it was a play on words. The China virus that I was actually
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:16.920]  talking about was Trudeau's love affair with the Communist Chinese. And I document a lot of these
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:20.760]  things. Sure. He's like Papi Lapu to G.G. Ping's the cat. I mean, he's in love with it.
[2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:27.240]  That's right. I mean, so the book was actually about Trudeau and Communist China, but the virus,
[2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:32.760]  how that was really making Canada weaker. But here's the thing. So I wrote this book in April
[2:19:32.760 --> 2:19:38.120]  really quickly. Just, I wanted a quick book to help show people what I thought was happening.
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:43.880]  We uploaded it to Amazon. And we published, I think, 14 bestsellers with Amazon Canada.
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:49.880]  They refused to let the book go up for a month. They blocked it. And then suddenly,
[2:19:50.680 --> 2:19:55.160]  and we asked why, we had lawyers ask why, and they said, well, it contradicts, quote,
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:20:02.200]  official sources. We said, which official sources? The U.N., Canada, China, like the CDC.
[2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.720]  And that's because you weren't supposed to say China virus. Did they finally read it and go,
[2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:11.720]  oh, it's a play on words? Well, they finally, without explanation, relented. The book went
[2:20:11.720 --> 2:20:17.720]  up in Canada, immediately went to number one in Canada, immediately. It's sold like crazy for
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:23.720]  a week, Alex. And then they took it down again. They took it down. No explanation. The same thing,
[2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:29.080]  it contradicts official sources. They took it down. Anytime you're effective, you are banned.
[2:20:29.080 --> 2:20:34.680]  Anytime you're effective. And then the crazy thing is, after we found another printer to
[2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:40.280]  take care of it, they put it back up and they have, to this day, never explained who complained,
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:45.240]  what the complaint was. And when they say we violated some official, is it a Canadian official,
[2:20:45.240 --> 2:20:49.720]  American official, was it Trudeau himself? That's very popular as to when you're in trouble and
[2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:57.240]  they won't tell you what it is. What it is, who the complaint was from, to give us a chance to
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:03.000]  make our case. There's a lot of footnotes in that book. So that's an example of, was it the UN?
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:08.760]  Was it the big tech companies? Was it the merger of Canada's political system with the UN? It's
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:13.560]  insane. Only got 30 seconds left. Is there an awakening happening? And if so, are we going to
[2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:17.720]  win this thing? Because it seems like right now, they're just bulldozers against us. I think the
[2:21:17.720 --> 2:21:24.600]  other side that has more zombies who are following the lockdownism, they're more zombies with the
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:30.440]  masks doing what they're told out of fear and conditioning. Our side is more revved up, but
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:36.600]  we're far fewer in number. I don't think we've had such an infringement on our civil liberties
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:42.840]  in more than a century. I agree. Rebel news.com. It's amazing. The best thing in the Northern
[2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:47.880]  Hemisphere. Thank you so much, sir. As a little man, I'm Alan Jones. Tell the news straight ahead.

[2:22:55.720 --> 2:23:02.280]  saying everybody take your vitamin D three, take your zinc and take your C. It's essential

[2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:54.040]  time. The people are awakening. They're taking control of their own environment. Cell phones
[2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:59.720]  are an amazing tool. Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations,
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:05.320]  hackers, governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially, are using this to steal
[2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:10.520]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:16.040]  of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:23.480]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover. In their own words,
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:27.880]  they admit it. So, I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:32.200]  more than a decade. And now the units have gotten really lightweight. They're faraday cages. They
[2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:36.760]  just look like a cloth envelope. They work absolutely great. And it just gives you that
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:42.200]  security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and

[2:24:45.560 --> 2:25:08.360]  m4store.com today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:28.680]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. The new
[2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:32.840]  attorney general, he's not approved yet, but they've got the vote. Eric Garland is another
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:38.440]  Obama creature. That's why this administration is called the third administration of Obama,
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:45.720]  Obyden. And boy, it's at Mark of the Moon. It is a bunch of crazed globalists slicing up this
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:50.360]  country, selling it out brutally, tripling drug prices with the stroke of a pen,
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:56.920]  just raping the dollar, raping this country's future because these people have chips on their
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.960]  shoulders and want to dominate America for social engineering. And the way to do that is to make you
[2:26:01.960 --> 2:26:09.080]  poor and dependent on them. And so you heard that interview with Ezra Ovan, a super smart guy,
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:14.760]  said, I envy his reporters. I envy his work. They're so prolific for a small team. I mean,
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:19.080]  they're just, they're right up there with Project Veritas for how effective they are. And
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:24.760]  he's laying out all this stuff. I read everything he said, but I'm like remembering,
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:28.280]  remembered when Trudeau said he loves dictatorship. Remember when Trudeau said we should teach
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:32.200]  five-year-olds how to, you know, have sexual assaults, you know, remember just all this horrible
[2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:37.560]  stuff and how George Soros runs his administration and how he was going to let China do secret
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:43.080]  experimentation on the Canadians and made it public. And it's just like, what in the hell is
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:49.240]  going on here? And how did we sit here with the UN running our life and China running our life?
[2:26:49.240 --> 2:26:55.400]  It's a nightmare. And I told you a year ago, I told you in February, I said the lockdown will
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:01.000]  never end. The checkpoints will never end. The contact tracing, the PCR tests that are admitted
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  fraud and based off a fraud test you're sent to a prison cell. Imagine when they release a real
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:17.400]  bio weapon. And I saw their plan last year. A year ago, I said, they're going to announce this was
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:21.240]  really a simulation and they're going to release something a lot deadlier. They're going to say
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:28.120]  terrorist did it. And then Bill Gates goes on. Colbert says, well, this is really just a drill.
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:32.120]  This is not that deadly clock swabs are the same thing a month after that. And terrorists are
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:38.520]  about to release something far worse. And now they're on last week with whatever his name is
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:43.080]  and to Trevor Noah. And I mean, I see all this stuff and they're ever going on more deadly
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:47.160]  thing is coming. Not just a deadly strain. And you'll never leave your house again. And
[2:27:47.160 --> 2:27:56.200]  this is war, people. And they're not just doing it to consolidate power. They like it. They enjoy
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:01.240]  you starving to death. They enjoy you being homeless. They enjoy you being on fentanyl.
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:10.200]  They enjoy you having nothing while they've got everything. They're monsters. And you know what?
[2:28:10.200 --> 2:28:16.520]  You deserve it if you don't stand up yourself. Because you've rationalized and I rationalized
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:22.600]  so much bad stuff. We made excuses. A lot of folks say, you know, well, I did it for this,
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:25.560]  or I did it for that. And they've gotten a military. There's so many horrible things
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:28.840]  in the name of our country. I don't know why people that did that stuff who meant well.
[2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:35.880]  But now it's clear it's not America running our government. It is corrupt evil forces that want
[2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:39.960]  to dissolve us while they use us to build their world government. Then they want us out of the
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:46.440]  way to settle an old score. So here's Merrick Garland. I already played him saying Antifa
[2:28:47.080 --> 2:28:50.600]  is not terrorist when they attack federal buildings and burn them down
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:57.240]  or attack federal police with hatchets. He actually said that. But he also, you know,
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:00.200]  is moving to legalize illegal aliens. Why have you got a country then?
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:05.240]  They don't be COVID testabouts. Different from them. And he also said he's going to join with the
[2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:10.200]  corporate media in shutting down free speech as long as they call it hate. So it'll be just like
[2:29:10.200 --> 2:29:15.320]  the European Union. And now you can't criticize COVID fraud. You can't criticize election fraud.
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:20.920]  Why there's nothing you can do. It's all bad. It's all evil. It's all a dictatorship of the
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:25.560]  establishment. Here it is. Discussed your own experience with domestic terrorism cases
[2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:31.080]  in your plan to prioritize this issue. It's something the FBI director has said is one of
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:37.240]  our most pressing threats. Do you think the DOJ has a role to play in examining the role of
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:41.800]  misinformation and incitement online to contributing to violence?
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.640]  They're talking about me right there. In fact, they're in the news, FBI's investigating us all
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:54.040]  this. When we point out that Joe Biden said taking over Hong Kong is good and death camps are good,
[2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:58.440]  we're like, that's dangerous. That's evil. That's incitement. You don't bend over to them just like
[2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:02.200]  that. Do whatever they say. You're a terrorist. So what are you going to do about domestic terrorism?
[2:30:02.200 --> 2:30:08.680]  It's our main focus. Disinformation on the internet that contributes. It's not explosive,
[2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:14.040]  saying go beat them up or when they burn things down. It's just what people do or go out and harass
[2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:19.240]  people at their stores or their businesses or their churches or the restaurants like Mad Maxine said
[2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:24.120]  or all this stuff or Michael Moore saying burn everything down. That's the New York Times saying
[2:30:24.120 --> 2:30:31.960]  kill Trump. That's all good. But when we criticize the COVID vaccine killed a bunch of folks,
[2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:37.320]  oh, that's this info. You can't have Jones up there saying India banned this vaccine because it's true.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:46.920]  So FBI, arrest his ass. FBI, subpoena him. FBI, get Jones, getting, getting, getting, getting.
[2:30:46.920 --> 2:30:51.720]  People say, man, Jones, you got a lot of courage doing this. No, I don't.
[2:30:55.160 --> 2:31:01.160]  It would take raw mindless courage to know all this and not fight it. They're coming for everybody,
[2:31:01.160 --> 2:31:06.040]  including all these stupid lawyers, all these stupid FBI agents, all these stupid congressmen,
[2:31:06.040 --> 2:31:11.240]  all these stupid professors, all these stupid people posing like they're part of the establishment.
[2:31:11.240 --> 2:31:16.040]  I've been around them. They're all sycophantic ass kissers. And they have no idea what they're
[2:31:16.040 --> 2:31:22.200]  manifesting and what they're doing to themselves. My God, China is doing mass human gene editing
[2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:28.440]  in living people. China is doing mass experiments on millions of people. China 20 years ago had
[2:31:28.440 --> 2:31:33.640]  cows that produce human milk and spiders that are part goat produce body armor.
[2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:38.600]  And you know the U.S. has all that underground too. It's out of control.
[2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:44.360]  But their number one threat is Americans that don't want to be totally shafted and screwed over.
[2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:50.440]  Because they know Christians aren't going to go along with their kids being taken away from them
[2:31:50.440 --> 2:31:53.720]  and for the devil worship, for the mark of the beast. And that's why they're targeting churches
[2:31:53.720 --> 2:31:56.600]  everywhere, getting everybody used to their main target ish.
[2:32:02.920 --> 2:32:06.440]  People need to become territorial. You need to stand up for yourselves. You need to band
[2:32:06.440 --> 2:32:12.200]  together and say no. You know, I need to form a new church, a Christian church with a very
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:17.560]  inclusive church that believes in the sanctity of life, that believes in Jesus Christ and that
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:21.320]  believes in a pro-human future and who understands that revelation is real.
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:28.200]  Because you don't have those churches anymore. They don't really exist. There's very few of them.
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:34.200]  The ones that are out there getting shut down and just have that because that's what the enemy
[2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:38.200]  fears and what they're going to come after is a Christ-centered church that's not a bunch of
[2:32:38.200 --> 2:32:42.680]  Bible thumping. And by that I mean a bunch of priests arguing who the best preacher is.
[2:32:42.680 --> 2:32:47.080]  A bunch of priests arguing who's got all the answers and this church did this wrong or that
[2:32:47.080 --> 2:32:52.280]  church did this doctrinally incorrect. I just want to tell people the devil's real and God's real
[2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:55.800]  and world governments here and it wants to kill your ass, but first it wants to dumb you down
[2:32:55.800 --> 2:33:04.520]  and steal your mind to get your soul. They got to get your mind to then trick your soul to choose evil.
[2:33:04.520 --> 2:33:10.440]  Your mind is just the soul's body suit interface on this planet, but they want to put you in a
[2:33:10.440 --> 2:33:14.440]  false reality from the time you're born to bombard you to reject God and go with them.
[2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:21.400]  And I see the little rejected God. They are literal zombies. So let's go out to break with
[2:33:21.400 --> 2:33:30.520]  the garland. Here it is contributing to violence and that the DOJ has a role in working to help us
[2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:37.160]  develop reasonable solutions to this challenge. Well, again, Senator, I think that every opportunity
[2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:43.000]  the Justice Department has to work with members of the Senate to think about how to solve problems
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:49.640]  and how to craft legislation is one that we should take. I don't have in mind particular
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:56.760]  legislation in this area. I do think that an important part of the investigation of violent
[2:33:56.760 --> 2:34:02.680]  extremist groups is following their activities online and getting an idea of what kind of
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:12.040]  information misinformation is being put out. Well, I look forward to talking more about this with you.
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:18.440]  Well, there's increasing regulatory schemes both in Europe and in California and other
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:22.280]  states being considered. And I look forward to working with you on striking that appropriate
[2:34:22.280 --> 2:34:27.240]  balance between protecting data privacy, protecting individual liberty, but also protecting
[2:34:28.200 --> 2:34:32.840]  the competitiveness of the United States and globally making sure that we're pushing back on
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:42.040]  digital authoritarianism. They're going to take our speech away with the EU Merkel model by
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:50.600]  pushing back on online authoritarianism. Another double thing. Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 are all
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:56.360]  about making you dependent and cutting you off from energy, food, and medicine. And with the
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:35:01.400]  blackouts we've seen that are guaranteed to be engineered to bring in federal and globalist
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:08.840]  control, we have seen massive lines of people lined up at the few grocery stores and restaurants
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:13.800]  that were open and most of them getting turned away after hours of freezing in the cold. We've
[2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:18.280]  seen millions of people sleeping in their cars because they don't have any power in their house
[2:35:18.280 --> 2:35:23.400]  and then running out of gas. Ladies and gentlemen, energy is king and food is the energy our bodies
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:27.720]  run off of and water as well. They're both available, the highest quality water filtration
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:31.800]  and the highest quality swarble foods right now massively discounted because of this
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:37.000]  emergency for everybody nationwide at infowarkshore.com. $50 off on our best stainless steel
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:42.840]  gravity effect filter and 10% off all swarble food in all packages at infowarkshore.com.
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.720]  That's infowarkshore.com or preparadalex.com. Big discounts probably a few more days.
[2:35:47.720 --> 2:35:54.680]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government. But world government is
[2:35:54.680 --> 2:36:01.720]  only the control grid. Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and
[2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:08.360]  become gods and obtain immortality. But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:15.000]  of all carbon based line forms. That's why they say carbon is bad. They are rewriting the entire
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:21.720]  genetic code of the planet. They are playing God. They believe they have been inspired by
[2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:28.280]  interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:33.560]  I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record.
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:41.080]  You have been warned. You have been given the information to say no to this plan. This is the
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:46.680]  end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the alien takeover of earth.
[2:36:48.680 --> 2:36:54.680]  I sell supplements for two reasons. Because they work, they're real, they're powerful,
[2:36:54.680 --> 2:37:00.920]  and because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:07.960]  That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's Saupon Meadow and other key ingredients in our
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:15.800]  prostate formula, Prostagard, or whether it is the super high grade organic bottom of B12
[2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:22.280]  in ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ of the CoQ-10 in DNA force, or the pure deep breath
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:27.640]  crystal iodide on an X2, these are all the very best supplements you're going to find
[2:37:28.280 --> 2:37:33.960]  in an already great market of high quality products out there. And it funds the InfoWare.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:37.400]  So even if these products weren't high quality, which they are, you're funding the InfoWare,
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:43.400]  so you can't lose. InfoWare delivers in space. Please visit InfoWareStore.com and get the products
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:47.960]  today. Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on air at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:53.560]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic,
[2:37:54.200 --> 2:37:59.560]  making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthrights
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:04.760]  being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:11.560]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:16.680]  an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact you're able to see
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:21.320]  the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your life,
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:26.360]  your husband, the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:32.840]  you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself is what God teaches
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:38.040]  us is worship. So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.320]  things of the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.720]  consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:15.960]  And we're doing a great job taking a lot of calls on the show,
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:19.160]  be sure and check that out, a lot of stations starting to pick that up, radio and TV.
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:23.880]  His wife is having a baby in a couple of days, so he has taken a few, he wanted a week off,
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:28.760]  I said, dude, take a month off. And so the great Tom Pappert is hosting that. I'm going to be
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:34.120]  hosting some this week, probably Friday, and then I'm also going to be hosting some of that show,
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:39.080]  taking phone calls coming up next week as well. I think Owen Schreuer is going to step
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:47.480]  up the plate and do some of that on top of that. So that is what we have here on the lineup. And
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:56.520]  of course, Owen Schreuer and the War Room, that is 3 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:04.520]  right here on the Info Wars Network. Now, I saw this article three days ago,
[2:40:04.520 --> 2:40:11.800]  what are the sperm telling us? Because my wife was at the coffee table on her laptop,
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  and I walked over and I saw the articles, I pulled up, I read it, and I meant to cover it,
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:25.480]  but I got busy and never did. And it's really amazing. It says, scientists
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:34.120]  are concerned by falling sperm counts and declining egg quality. Why is there declining egg
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:40.680]  quality too? Endocrine disrupting chemicals may be the problem atrazine.
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:46.920]  One of the main things I was banned for was covering mainline science reports
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:53.320]  about how that was happening. And people got really concerned. So they had Jimmy Kimmel,
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:59.160]  they had Colbert, all of them attacked me and said I was a liar. And they said it was racist.
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:04.440]  They said, you know, the KKK leader, and that was all written form of the globalist, he says that
[2:41:04.440 --> 2:41:08.280]  the frogs are gay and that they're putting chemicals in things to make us gay. No, what I
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:15.400]  said is it makes you infertile and then whatever it does with amphibians and fish is they start
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:20.280]  trying to fertilize males for whatever reason, particularly in frogs. So whole frog species
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:25.880]  are becoming extinct because of this in South Africa, in areas of Europe, and in in Houston.
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:32.760]  The media thought it was a joke, but I saw an article that half the frogs in the Houston channel
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:37.480]  are homosexual. I mean, they want to have sex with a male. There is no sex. A male frog sits on
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:42.280]  the female frog or toads back, and then they put eggs out and then the male just fertilizes that.
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:47.720]  There's no copulation going on. There's no penetration, not to give it a frog sex here,
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:53.560]  but frog reproduction. But, you know, if the frogs are going extinct, well, you know these
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.680]  chemicals are the same thing. They in utero make you have a smaller penis and genitals and hurt
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:05.160]  your development. And here's an example. My dad's got a small lake on our East Texas farm ranch.
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:13.320]  It's full of hydrilla and a bunch of duckweed. And so there's a state program where you get
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:17.480]  these fish that have been had a chemical put on them. These tarp where they're sterile.
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:24.360]  And they just put chemicals on the eggs and the eggs still hatch and still make little tarp,
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:27.720]  but then they grow up. They're sterile. So that's just one chemical
[2:42:30.040 --> 2:42:33.800]  that's similar to atrazine that they put in and just sterilize the fish.
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:40.920]  And you put a few drops in a whole big, you know, container with these little baby fish
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:46.520]  or the eggs, and it's bye-bye. You're never going to have babies again. So this is science,
[2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:51.080]  ladies and gentlemen. And my dad has the literature. I meant to come in here and do a whole show on it
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:57.960]  sometime and show you. These are like 30-pound carp in the lake. But you know, that's how this
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:04.440]  operates, ladies and gentlemen. And so you can find out about it or you can die. But see,
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:09.160]  they see us as animals, like free-range humans is what we're called. And we're out here doing all
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:13.240]  of this. We're out here just going along, oh, I'm going to the movies. I'm going to the bar. I'm
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:17.480]  going to go see it. And it's all designed to make you be distracted not to know how stuff works.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:23.240]  But behind the scenes, folks, they are hitting you and they are hitting you and your family hard.
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:29.000]  On the global scope, they're all these regiments of eating only organic. And if you look at the
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:34.200]  Rockefellers and the Gaetsons and others, they'll normally live by jet helicopter or private jet
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:40.520]  in the middle of nowhere. No 5G, no GMO, all filtered water. They have all these regiments
[2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:45.000]  to detoxify themselves while they hit us with 5G, while they hit us with fluoride, while they hit
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:53.320]  us with GMO, while they hit us with the deadly mRNA mutagenic bio weapons. And it's very serious.
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:57.800]  And to them, it is a holy action they're carrying out to save the earth. Well, you look at Gaetson,
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:44:01.320]  he talks about people are starving and America's never coming back. He starts,
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:10.200]  and we got to kill the old lady. He just really gets excited.
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  And that's the type of people these folks are. Again, I was talking to a family member who
[2:44:19.400 --> 2:44:26.440]  worked at the Indiana Cancer Research Facility back in the 60s.
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:32.840]  For a couple years, I remember it was my dad, and I was telling some of these stories. I was a kid,
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:36.680]  I would hear all this stuff, and he said, yeah. He said, there'd be like whole wards of people
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:42.360]  missing lower mandibles who'd had their jaw taken off of tobacco or cigarettes or whatever.
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:45.640]  And they'd have other areas, they had the children's wards, they had all of it. Because,
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:51.320]  you know, you think scientists are all good until he would see like scientists get off on
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:45:00.840]  injecting somebody with something really poisonous. He said like these scientists would get rats and
[2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:06.040]  would just stick them with a needle of cancer and just go like, oh, and like would get sexually
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:11.000]  excited. And I'm like 10 years old, my dad's telling me all this, and it's all true. It's all
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:15.160]  true. And that's who Bill Gates is, folks. He got brought into all that stuff like my dad did in
[2:45:15.160 --> 2:45:19.080]  high school. That's the way they take the smartest kids and put them in this. And he was like, what
[2:45:19.080 --> 2:45:23.800]  the hell is this? I got to give him on the show sometime. He's very private, though. But
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:31.160]  yeah, nobody's ever seen my dad. I'll make him get on air with us sometime. He's pretty,
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:39.080]  he's the outgoing guy I am. He's pretty reserved these days. But I just remember all the stuff he
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:43.960]  told me. And it's just, you watch Bill Gates when he's with Frieza Kari or when he's on with
[2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:49.400]  Colbert, like, had terrorists are going to release someone 100 times worse and billions are going to
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:57.080]  Colbert is laughing and it's so much fun because they're part of the elite. And Colbert is really
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:01.560]  scared, actually. He's just like, holy hell, I signed on with Psychopaths. I'm going to work with
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:05.880]  these people to try to get out of this. Because here's the deal. I'm not bragging when I tell
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:11.560]  you this. I'm giving you the good news. Whenever a man cow was on, he said on air, like the name
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:14.920]  of three or four famous people, the texting they were listening, he said he got dozens more after
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:18.600]  they said that doesn't happen when he had a font's new show. And again, it's not about Alex Jones.
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:23.960]  It's about, do you know who's listening? Rush Limbaugh is dead now. He's not listening or he
[2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:29.640]  is. He's in heaven. Who else do you think listens? They all do, folks. They all listen. And because
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:34.120]  they all know it's the truth and they can't go as far as I do. Pepper Carlson's doing it and
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.160]  they're trying to take him off the air and he's not going to, he's not going to back down. I can
[2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:42.520]  tell you that. But nobody else can get away with this. Okay. So we're under total attack.
[2:46:42.520 --> 2:46:47.640]  They're trying to put me in prison right now because of this, but I don't care because those FBI
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:52.520]  agents are going to have children with shriveled testicles that can't have kids either. Okay.
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.920]  And I don't care. They got the studies. I don't care if you're black or white or who you are.
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:05.080]  The genital sizes are all going and the testicles are shriveling up in utero. You are being put in
[2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:08.600]  chemicals that are in the food and water that do that. And then afterwards you're hit with it
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:14.360]  and it attacks your IQ. It attacks your, and it's the women's eggs are fried. Read this article
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:21.480]  in the New York Times and then ask them, well, why'd you say Alex Jones is bad? Because it tells
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:27.080]  you the frogs are dying. The fish are dying. They're sterile. They're gay. And that's why they go,
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:32.360]  oh, it's your transgender now. Like, oh, you grew a tumor. You grew a tumor on your brain. You're
[2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:40.440]  dying. You're going to trans into death. You're going to trans into cough. You're going to go
[2:47:40.440 --> 2:47:47.720]  over into the Gothic now. You're transitioning from living to dead. Oh, you've got, and I've got,
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:52.920]  oh, I've got an article. Let me show you. There's women that take the vaccine can't get mammograms
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:47:57.240]  for six months or sonograms because they say it looks like you have cancer because your body has
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:04.840]  a cancer effect. Of course, you'll get cancer later. Don't worry. That's why they said Biden,
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:08.520]  after COVID, he will quote, tackle cancer. And he means you're going to get cancer.
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:18.520]  So high prevalence of micro penis in 2,710 male newborns from an intensive use of pesticide area
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:25.400]  of northeastern Brazil. This is all fact. And what is in that atrosine, endocrine,
[2:48:25.400 --> 2:48:30.680]  disruptive chemicals. It's all mainline science. But see, oh, Colbert doesn't want you to know that.
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:35.720]  Jimmy Kimmel has been ordered, they said, to write these pieces and make jokes because they're
[2:48:35.720 --> 2:48:39.560]  using the pesticide on you. We are the virus. We are the disease.
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:43.560]  Oh, if you don't want your phone to microwave you when you're not using it,
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:47.400]  because it's always on. If you don't want them tracking you and controlling you and want to
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:50.760]  kind of isolate your phone to only use it when you want to take a photo or you want to know where
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.720]  you're going or you want to call somebody, we have them back. They've been sold out for months.
[2:48:55.720 --> 2:49:02.040]  We have them in 1995. They're high quality system, fair day cage, a privacy pocket
[2:49:02.040 --> 2:49:06.520]  at infowarstore.com. You're not going to beat this deal and it funds our operations. So we've
[2:49:06.520 --> 2:49:11.800]  got them in black. We've got them in red and blue. The green is not the most popular, but we can't
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:17.640]  get it right now. So those are at infowarstore.com and your purchase funds our operation. I want

[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:04.440]  But I'm realizing now that's not the case. Folks, they can shut off the power. They can shut off
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:09.640]  the water at any given moment. Now, I was lucky I had plenty of food in my fridge and in my pantry
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:15.080]  that I didn't have to dig into my storable food, but many people in Texas didn't. Don't be in that
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:19.960]  situation. Don't have that major wake up call. When they come to shut down your power and they shut
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:25.800]  down the stores and the food supply, have the backup, have the insurance and be ready to feed
[2:50:25.800 --> 2:50:31.160]  yourself, your family, your friends and your neighbors with the storable food, best quality,
[2:50:31.160 --> 2:50:41.800]  best price 10% off right now at infowarstore.com. In the early 1990s, it was a really funny movie
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:50.440]  that came out called Wayne World. Even before I had asked the TV show in the mid-1990s,
[2:50:50.440 --> 2:50:56.680]  I went and saw that movie and thought, man, that was fun. To speak out, have your own ideas and
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:00.840]  even if you're a nerd, you're still entertaining because you're real. Well, what do they say in
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:07.880]  Wayne's world? We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Every day when I cover these huge topics, I don't
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:12.200]  feel worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real, but I'm trying to tell you
[2:51:12.200 --> 2:51:16.360]  the truth. I'm trying to get it right and most of the time we do. The globalists love lying to you.
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:23.320]  They love manipulating you. They enjoy destroying humanity. They enjoy manipulating ideas and
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:28.920]  using people's ignorance against them. That for me is really such a disgusting. So you've got to
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:34.520]  pledge for myself and the whole info wars crew that we will never join the globalists. We will
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:37.800]  never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're all in this together.
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:45.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:56.920]  Welcome back. I'm going to do five more minutes and then Paul Joseph Watson
[2:51:57.480 --> 2:52:06.280]  from a Britannic Magiskill. The Magiskill will be taking over and always doing a great job.
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:13.960]  I know you're awesome folks, but remember, you spread the word about the shows. You share the
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:17.880]  articles. You share the videos. That's how we affect the world. That's how we change things.
[2:52:17.880 --> 2:52:22.200]  And boy, we've been proven right on the Gay Frogs and the New World Order and World Government
[2:52:22.200 --> 2:52:27.000]  and forced inoculations and permanent lockdowns. We've proven we really are doing a great job
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:31.400]  and they're trying to put my ass in prison as you see all over the news. So I think we've proven
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:36.600]  that we really are for the people, by the people of the people, and we're certainly flawed, but we
[2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:40.920]  use God as our North Star. So thanks for your prayers. Thanks for your support. Thanks for
[2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:43.800]  everything. I'm going to cut an ad right now live. We can run during the show tomorrow because we
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:50.360]  need to make some money. Listeners, you are the reason that info wars is on the air.
[2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:57.240]  And I really want to thank you all for over the years keeping us on air. And I think info wars
[2:52:57.240 --> 2:53:01.800]  has gotten stronger and gotten truer as the time has gone on because we've learned more
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:07.400]  and more of the New World Order has unfolded. So we've been able to dial in exactly where
[2:53:07.400 --> 2:53:13.880]  they're going. And boy, were we 97% right. The 3% we were wrong about was it was way worse than we
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:19.880]  actually thought. And that's the bad news. The good news is that humanity is starting to awaken.
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:24.760]  But I cannot stress enough to you in this economy, in this world, how hard it is
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:29.720]  to fund this operation, to have our own encoders, our own crew, our own satellite uplinks,
[2:53:29.720 --> 2:53:37.000]  our own websites, our own legal, our own licensing, our own everything. It is expensive and it is hard
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:42.440]  to run our own warehouse and run our own crew and just all of it. So thank you for doing some of
[2:53:42.440 --> 2:53:48.280]  your shopping at infowarstore.com. And we've got a lot of things that have been sold out that are
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:52.760]  back in. Winter sun, we got a limited supply because of COVID lockdowns. It really hurt the
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:58.760]  supply chain with vitamin D3 and vitamin K that are essential to your immune system and your body
[2:53:58.760 --> 2:54:03.720]  cells. Great for adults, great for children. It's back in stock, selling out very soon, 25%.
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:11.640]  Off. Also sold out for over a month is the info wars privacy pockets that have a little
[2:54:11.640 --> 2:54:17.160]  Faraday cages that keep the globals from being able to track you. It doesn't send out radiation
[2:54:17.160 --> 2:54:22.760]  from the phone that you're able to be hit by. When you have the phone in it, it's really a
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:26.680]  healthy thing to do to put your phone in it to remember how much screen time you're doing,
[2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:30.840]  how it's dominating your life and the fact that it is surveilling you. It's actually a good weeding
[2:54:30.840 --> 2:54:36.440]  tool to get you in control of the phone and the phone not control of you. We've got it in black,
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:45.560]  blue and red at infowarstore.com. And then we've also got activated charcoal toothpaste that we
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:50.360]  already had in the pipeline a year and a half ago, finally got in six months ago. But my dad
[2:54:50.360 --> 2:54:54.920]  developed retired dentist oral surgeon concentrated, doesn't have the additives fluoride free,
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:55:00.440]  doesn't have the aspartame, doesn't have the toxins. It's really strong toothpaste. I researched the
[2:55:00.440 --> 2:55:04.120]  fact that this is one of the fastest growing toothpaste is activated charcoal. Had my dad
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:10.120]  come up with a top firm with a superior one. We're very, very, very proud of it. It's available
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:17.320]  at info wars store.com as well. Again, discounted. So whether it is the privacy pockets, whether
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:22.280]  it's the activated charcoal toothpaste, or whether it is the winter sun, vitamin D3 and vitamin K,
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:26.120]  that's so essential year round, particularly in the winter, and particularly for black folks,
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:31.720]  black folks are twice as likely.co. It's still super rare, but twice as likely because black
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:36.680]  folks in the hemisphere live in cities, live in these urban canyons and don't get the sun.
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:42.680]  And black folks need about three times the sun that occasion gets Hispanic, probably needs about
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:46.280]  twice as much, depending on how much melon you have as a white person, white people are designed
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:50.920]  to live away from the sun. So we get less of it to be able to live. Folks live near the equator
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:54.600]  are blocking out the sun. So if you're not living near the equator, and you're living in Northern
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:59.640]  Klein, but you're genetically designed to live at the equator, you need vitamin D3. That's a fact.
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:03.480]  And they don't want you to know that. So particularly if you have dark skin, you need high
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:07.720]  quality vitamin D3. There's a lot of folks that absorb it well in the gut. So you absorb it under
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:13.560]  the tongue, take it sublingually infowarstore.com. We also have with America coffee. It's the best
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:17.400]  coffee I've ever had people get it. Oh man, this really is incredible. It's from the Chiapas area
[2:56:17.400 --> 2:56:22.200]  in Mexico, right by Guatemala. That is the same price for the 10 plus years we've been selling
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:27.720]  it. The same stuff comes from the same place sells for about 50% more a pound at Whole Foods.
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:32.920]  So we have a great deal on it at infowarstore.com. If you shop with us, we can find the operation
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:38.200]  and swarble fever limited time is the crisis is additional 10% off preparewithalex.com
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:41.880]  preparewithalex.com takes you right to the subsection of infowarstore.com.
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:53.320]  You do not hide a grand assault. America is about to have his energy cut off. Its borders
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:57:00.840]  destroyed. It's dollar brought down to nothing. All of you that have served Satan believe that you
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:06.840]  are on the right team. You're about to find out how pathetic you are. So I ask all of you
[2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:14.840]  who are awake and who love God, stop living in fear. The enemy is about to expose itself.
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  The enemy can't help itself. The enemy comes to kill, steal and destroy. We sit here as good people
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:29.560]  get upset about that and stop it. We should. But once it comes through, once it hits us,
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:35.480]  once it's dominating us and raping us and attacking us, we just have to point out we
[2:57:35.480 --> 2:57:41.240]  try to stop it. So prepare yourselves, America. You're going under judge but just like all the
[2:57:41.240 --> 2:58:00.520]  children that were aborted, this is the truth. This is the infowar.
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:25.800]  And we are live with the summit news hour. You'll notice I'm wearing the hat tonight. That's because
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:31.960]  the hairstyle, the haircut is not fit for public consumption. And that's because I haven't had
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:37.240]  a haircut in about four or five months because of course under the lockdown restrictions here in
[2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:44.920]  the UK, barbers, hairdressers have been closed for the past several months. But thankfully,
[2:58:45.640 --> 2:58:51.800]  by the gracious enlightenment of our everwise government, they're telling us that now we
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:59.720]  will be able to sit on a park bench with another person in about three weeks time. Yes, I can't
[2:58:59.720 --> 2:59:06.360]  describe how excited, how grateful I truly am that they're lifting these coronavirus lockdown
[2:59:06.360 --> 2:59:13.800]  measures so quickly to the point where in three months time, maybe just maybe we'll be allowed
[2:59:13.800 --> 2:59:20.120]  to go to the pub, maybe in three months time. That's what we're going to talk about today.
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:26.200]  Headline here out the Daily Mail, which just came up a couple of hours ago, Britain's coronavirus
[2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:31.400]  lockdown is one of the toughest in the world. With Ireland, the only stricter Western nation
[2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:36.200]  study reveals Britain's are living under the sixth strictest lockdown in the world and the second
[2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:43.000]  harshest in Europe, according to an analysis by the University of Oxford, researchers have ranked
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:49.560]  the pandemic responses of 180 countries on a stringency map by looking at how COVID restrictions
[2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:53.640]  have affected schools, offices, social gatherings, international travel and freedom to leave home.
[2:59:54.520 --> 3:00:01.320]  Each country was scored on a scale of one to 100. And they're saying that Britain is the second
[3:00:01.320 --> 3:00:07.640]  strictest in Europe. We've got France, we got Germany, we've got Italy opening up their schools,
[3:00:07.640 --> 3:00:13.800]  their restaurants, their bars, their social events way faster. And yeah, as I said in the
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:20.760]  introduction, three months time will be allowed to go to the pub, maybe. And then in three and a
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:26.920]  half months, in fact, it's closer to four months, they say that these restrictions will be lifted
[3:00:26.920 --> 3:00:33.080]  and that it's irreversible and that we won't have another lockdown. Of course, many of the health
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:38.920]  experts that form part of SAGE, which is advising the government, say that that's complete baloney,
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:44.760]  and basically indicating that these lockdown restrictions, these measures in some form,
[3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:51.400]  will continue indefinitely and will definitely continue indefinitely for those who don't take
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:58.360]  the vaccine. Headline out of Summit News, Vaccine Passports to enter pubs venues being
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:04.920]  considered by British government. To make it clear, these are domestic passports, basically
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:10.760]  domestic ID cards, which by the way, Winston Churchill banned back after the Second World War
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:17.240]  and said they were fundamentally anti-British. Now our great Libertarian leader Boris Johnson
[3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:23.240]  is saying that the government will consider vaccine passports to enter pubs, restaurants and
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:30.600]  other venues. And this has been part of his roadmap to lifting lockdown, despite other European
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:35.800]  countries such as France, Germany, and Italy easing restrictions far sooner. Initial changes
[3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:41.080]  will see Brits only being allowed to sit on a bench with another person from next month,
[3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:49.000]  that's right. From March the 8th, I believe the date is they're saying, we may allow you
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:54.120]  to meet another person from outside your household and sit on a park bench with them,
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:59.720]  because nobody's been doing that over the past two months. Nobody at all has been flouting any
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:06.680]  of these lockdown restrictions. They're saying that outdoor dining will not reopen until April
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:13.880]  the 12th. That's about seven weeks time from now. Businesses, pubs, restaurants are all going bust,
[3:02:13.880 --> 3:02:19.080]  it doesn't matter, despite the fact that these coronavirus cases are falling quicker than in
[3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:25.560]  many of the European countries by the stats. We are on a snail's pace to lifting lockdown,
[3:02:25.560 --> 3:02:30.040]  and even when it is lifted, as I'm going to get into, they're saying that some of the restrictions
[3:02:30.040 --> 3:02:36.120]  will remain. And that's the point. Many people have made the point that if you really want to
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:42.200]  sell this vaccine, if you really want to encourage take up of this vaccine, they see the park benches
[3:02:42.200 --> 3:02:47.880]  where they literally put tape over them and say, old people aren't allowed to sit down after their
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:55.240]  daily exercise. The messaging with this vaccine is that if you take the vaccine, if you take a
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:03:03.080]  double dose of the vaccine even, even then, maybe you won't be able to live your life. So you would
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:07.960]  think if they really want a massive widespread take up of this vaccine, especially amongst
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:14.280]  BAME communities, Black people, ethnic minorities, that they would sell it on the basis of,
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:20.280]  from a libertarian standpoint, from an ethical standpoint, this is wrong within itself,
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:25.880]  but they would say, take the vaccine, you get all your freedoms back. They're not even saying
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:30.200]  that. They're saying, no, you'll still have to wear masks. You'll still be under restrictions.
[3:03:30.200 --> 3:03:35.560]  And of course, that's going to drive a lower take up of the vaccine than they expected. So then
[3:03:35.560 --> 3:03:38.440]  they're going to come back and say, well, not enough people have taken the vaccine.
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:43.160]  We're going to have to continue these social distancing measures, these lockdown measures
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:48.760]  for months or even years into the future. But the Prime Minister revealed yesterday in front of
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:55.800]  Parliament, COVID status certification is being studied, meaning that, quote, vaccine passports
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:04:00.920]  could be required to enter pubs, restaurants and other venues, according to the Daily Mail.
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:05.880]  Bear in mind that for the past three months or so, the government and the vaccine minister
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:13.640]  have said repeatedly, we're not going to introduce vaccine passports for international travel,
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:18.680]  because that would be discriminatory. Now they're saying, oh, well, that's basically inevitable.
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:23.560]  You're going to have to have the vaccine and proof that you've had the vaccine to engage in
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:29.320]  freedom of mobility, international travel. But beyond that, which they lied about for the past
[3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:34.920]  three months saying they weren't even considering it, while literally pouring millions of pounds
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:39.960]  into studies that were considering it. Now the thing you're saying, you're not only
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:45.320]  inevitably going to need it for international travel, maybe you're going to need it to go to
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:51.160]  the pub, the cinema, sports events, live entertainment. And even in one report, I saw
[3:04:51.160 --> 3:04:56.680]  that it was being considered that you would need this vaccine certification to go to the shop.
[3:04:58.440 --> 3:05:03.320]  And we laugh at the people who say, revelations, the mark of the beast,
[3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:08.600]  he who doesn't take it will not be allowed to buy or sell. Now there's literally consideration
[3:05:09.640 --> 3:05:16.200]  of the potential that if you don't take the mark, you won't be able to buy or sell. I don't expect
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:22.520]  that to be introduced in terms of people being able to go into the shops. But that was reported.
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:27.080]  And they are saying that they will consider, and obviously this is going to be
[3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:33.400]  somewhat at the discretion of businesses, that they will force people to prove they've had a
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:38.840]  coronavirus vaccine, whether they don't want to take the vaccine, whether they're medically exempt
[3:05:38.840 --> 3:05:43.560]  from taking the vaccine, because it's dangerous. They're now talking about having that to allow
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:49.800]  people into cinemas, sports stadiums, bars, restaurants, while all the time claiming,
[3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:55.640]  oh, the vaccine's not going to be mandatory. We're not going to force anyone to take the vaccine.
[3:05:55.640 --> 3:06:02.280]  You just won't be able to live a basic normal social life or even be able to go out without
[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:08.680]  taking the vaccine. So if you don't take it, you'll be under de facto lockdown for infinity.
[3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:16.120]  Oh, but it's not mandatory. It's not mandatory. Indications that international travel will also
[3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:20.120]  only be allowed via a vaccine passport mean that for the millions of people who can't or
[3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:26.840]  won't take the vaccine, they'll effectively be under indefinite lockdown. Then we have this report,
[3:06:26.840 --> 3:06:33.240]  scientists vaccination before every holiday may be needed. Yes, that's every single holiday.
[3:06:33.800 --> 3:06:37.800]  Scientists at Oxford University have suggested that people may need to have a coronavirus
[3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:43.400]  vaccination not once, not twice, but every time they want to travel out of their home country,
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:50.360]  of course, our own government, our own home secretary will continue to allow the migrant
[3:06:50.360 --> 3:06:56.760]  boats to flood into the country. No vaccination required. No ID required. Put them up in four
[3:06:56.760 --> 3:07:04.120]  store hotels, feed them, later on integrate them into society. But those are the protected class,
[3:07:04.120 --> 3:07:09.000]  the rest of us won't be allowed to leave the country by the looks of it unless we take the
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:13.800]  shot. The scientists published a report in the Royal Society Journal, which acknowledged there is
[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:17.960]  little data on how efficient or long lasting the current vaccines are. And so it's likely
[3:07:17.960 --> 3:07:24.120]  that countries will require a recent vaccination. And in the next segment, I'm going to get into
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:31.160]  the fact that they're now proclaiming that flu deaths have completely disappeared, literally
[3:07:31.160 --> 3:07:37.960]  saying they haven't detected a single case of flu the entirety of this year, and that we may need
[3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:42.920]  to keep social distancing, mask wearing to defeat the flu. Gee, I wonder what the real story behind
[3:07:42.920 --> 3:07:48.120]  this is. Don't go away. We'll be right back. Actually, both of these blocks, UHF frequency.
[3:07:48.120 --> 3:07:54.440]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and
[3:07:54.440 --> 3:08:01.960]  recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well with or without a battery.

[3:09:48.440 --> 3:09:51.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:03.560]  You're listening to the Summit.News radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:12.120]  The voucher is just the amount of the quote where he says, quote, there are things even if
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:16.760]  you're vaccinated that you're not going to be able to do in society, for example, indoor dining
[3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:24.040]  theaters, places where people congregate. Again, even if you're vaccinated, that's not the messaging
[3:10:24.040 --> 3:10:29.160]  that I would go with if you really want widespread take up of a vaccine to tell people that even if
[3:10:29.160 --> 3:10:35.160]  they get it, they're not going to get their pre COVID freedoms back. And it's a similar situation
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:39.880]  in the UK, which I just mentioned. Scientists now saying the vaccination may be needed before
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:46.440]  every single holiday. The government actively considering whether a vaccine certificate will
[3:10:46.440 --> 3:10:54.680]  be required to enter pubs, venues, restaurants. And while this is all taking place, we've seen the
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:11:01.400]  mysterious disappearance of the flu. Gee, I wonder why this could be headline UK health
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:08.280]  authorities announced not a single case of flu detected this year. Health authorities in England
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:13.880]  have announced that not a single case of influenza has been detected this year. With one professor
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:19.960]  suggesting that mask wearing should be kept in place during winter to drive down flu deaths to
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:27.080]  quote zero. We talked about zero COVID in the past. We seem to be moving away from that. Thankfully
[3:11:27.080 --> 3:11:33.480]  in the UK, this idea that we have to have literally zero cases whatsoever to have any kind of
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:39.800]  continuous consistent freedoms. You've seen in New Zealand and Australia, where they can get three
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:45.960]  cases amongst a single family, and they locked down the entire city of Auckland for three days.
[3:11:45.960 --> 3:11:51.320]  How long is that going to continue? Well, now they're talking about zero flu because the flu
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:57.720]  deaths have completely disappeared. And according to the health authorities released some, this is
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:12:04.920]  disputed, it's entirely because of mask wearing and social distancing. So the social restrictions
[3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:08.840]  brought into curve transmission of coronavirus combined with an increased uptake of the flu
[3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:15.720]  vaccine have both been credited with driving down infections. So the official health body in
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:25.000]  England studied over 685,000 test samples. Since the first week of January, and not a
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:31.240]  single flu infection was discovered. Yes, they're actually claiming that not a single person had
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:38.440]  the flu in the entire United Kingdom for the first almost two months of the year in winter.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:44.520]  I wonder why that is. Professor Christina Pagel went on to suggest that some of the measures
[3:12:44.520 --> 3:12:49.320]  brought into fight coronavirus could be kept in place to combat flu infections. Oh, so we're
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:55.960]  keeping them forever, right? Asserting the quote, we can reduce flu deaths to pretty much zero.
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.960]  Pagel said it's worth encouraging people to wear masks on public transport and in other busy
[3:13:01.960 --> 3:13:08.280]  environments every winter. The masks aren't going anywhere because we can eliminate flu,
[3:13:08.280 --> 3:13:15.960]  because we've honestly had zero flu cases in winter in an entire country for an entire almost
[3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:24.040]  two months. So believable. That's contradicted by other experts as we previously highlighted
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:30.040]  who have suggested get this. What a crazy conspiracy theory this sounds like to me.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:37.880]  That flu cases are so dramatically low because influenza cases are being falsely counted
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:46.600]  as COVID cases. What kind of crazy conspiracy theorists would suggest that? Well, top epidemiologist
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:52.280]  Nukwotowski, who was former head of biostatistics epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:59.720]  University, sounds like your regular tinfoil hat wearer to me, asserted the influenza has been
[3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:07.320]  renamed COVID-19 in large part. And we wonder why we've had so many officially recorded cases.
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:14.280]  According to the CDC, the cumulative positive influenza test rate from late September into
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:23.320]  the week of December 19th, this is 2020, was just 0.2% compared to 8.7% from a year before.
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:29.320]  Suddenly, the flu just disappeared. According to Wotowski, this is because many flu infections
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:34.200]  are being incorrectly labeled as coronavirus cases. And then of course, you get the notoriously
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:41.240]  unreliable PCR tests on top of that. Provides you with plenty of coronavirus cases, which then
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:47.880]  you can use to justify elongated and in fact, indefinite lockdowns. He said there may be quite
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:53.800]  a number of influenza cases included in the presumed COVID-19 category of people
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:59.640]  who have COVID-19 symptoms, which influenza symptoms can be mistaken for but are not tested
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:06.680]  for SARS or N.A. Numbers published in April last year by the UK's Office of National Statistics
[3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:12.280]  also showed that there have been three times more deaths from flu and pneumonia than coronavirus.
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:18.600]  So at the height of the pandemic, when it began in Europe last year from March through to the end
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:24.280]  of April, the official UK government statistics said there have been three times more flu and
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:29.960]  pneumonia deaths than coronavirus deaths. And indeed the BBC reported, quote, the number of
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:35.560]  deaths from flu and pneumonia for more than 32,000 is three times higher than the total number of
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:43.720]  coronavirus deaths this year. That is 2020. Three times higher in early 2020, in early 2021,
[3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:50.200]  the flu has just disappeared into thin air. And now they're saying that because of that,
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:56.280]  we can eliminate flu. Maybe we can just eliminate all viruses from circulation completely,
[3:15:56.280 --> 3:16:03.480]  as long as when the government says jump, we say how high time and time again. These restrictions
[3:16:03.480 --> 3:16:09.080]  are ever going to be really lifted completely. At least for the next few years, it seems very
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:15.320]  doubtful. And in fact, related to that, saw a tweet earlier which is taken from the official
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:21.800]  Gov.UK website. Remember that I discussed this on a previous show. Somebody filed a Freedom of
[3:16:21.800 --> 3:16:27.240]  Information Act request with the UK government, which by the way, Tony Blair came out recently
[3:16:27.240 --> 3:16:33.480]  and said that was the biggest mistake of his time in office, passing the Freedom of Information Act.
[3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:38.120]  Legislation, God forbid, the public should be able to get information from the government. The horror!
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:45.160]  Somebody did that. They asked the government how many COVID deaths from the entire total of
[3:16:45.160 --> 3:16:52.360]  COVID deaths in the United Kingdom on the death certificate was only COVID listed as the cause
[3:16:52.360 --> 3:16:59.400]  of death, not including all the other co-morbidities suffered generally by elderly people with several
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:04.680]  other serious illnesses in hospital. The UK government came back and published this, by the
[3:17:04.680 --> 3:17:12.520]  way, on their official website and said that the figure was around 10% of the officially declared
[3:17:12.520 --> 3:17:20.120]  COVID deaths that had actually been a result of COVID alone, not including any other co-morbidities
[3:17:20.120 --> 3:17:24.760]  on the death certificate. So the actual number of people who had died from coronavirus alone in
[3:17:24.760 --> 3:17:30.920]  the United Kingdom is one tenth the amount of the public number that they stay over and over again.
[3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:37.320]  Again, that's on the official Office of National Statistics website as a result of the Freedom of
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:45.240]  Information Act request. There's another piece of information on Gov.UK, which somebody tweeted
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:51.000]  out a screenshot of earlier, and it says in this report deaths are defined as a death in a person
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:59.000]  with a laboratory confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either died within 60 days of the first
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:05.080]  specimen date or died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the
[3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:12.600]  death certificate. So basically they're counting all deaths of COVID if they occurred within a
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:19.960]  60 day time frame of the person being diagnosed with COVID. Now, bear in mind many of these people,
[3:18:19.960 --> 3:18:27.080]  the vast majority of these people, are seriously ill elderly people who have several other co-morbidities,
[3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:33.160]  but if they catch COVID during that 60 day window from when they're unfortunately tragically declared
[3:18:33.160 --> 3:18:40.040]  dead, they count it as a COVID death. Gee, I wonder why there are so many cases. We'll be right back
[3:18:40.040 --> 3:18:45.960]  when we talk about misinformation summit. Don't use the going. Throughout history, there have been
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:51.160]  two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two. One is born of remissance,
[3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:56.440]  the other is born of conquest. One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:03.800]  an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength. The other is based on the massive
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:11.160]  number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it. America is transferring out of a system
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:17.080]  based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery. That's why the
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:21.880]  globalists tell us America was founded off slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:26.440]  so they can invert the facts that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown
[3:19:26.440 --> 3:19:30.680]  is here. It is already causing millions and millions of starved death. When they're done,
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:35.400]  billions of starved death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:40.120]  general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:45.560]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates new world order weapon. I knew Trump was in battle.
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:52.600]  I knew he was surrounded by cowards and by double talking agents of the enemy.
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:58.280]  A lot of people just couldn't believe it. They're like, oh no, it's 3G chest, 5G chest,
[3:19:58.280 --> 3:20:02.840]  he's invincible. And I understand why people learn to believe that because this is scary what's going
[3:20:02.840 --> 3:20:06.760]  on. The global government in the new world order. Now that people woke up to the fact that that's
[3:20:06.760 --> 3:20:11.640]  real, they won't somebody to come save them from. Well, Trump sure as hell tried. My gosh, look at
[3:20:11.640 --> 3:20:16.120]  how prescription drug prices just tripled or quadrupled depending on the drug once by the
[3:20:16.120 --> 3:20:20.840]  sign of that executive order. We pay the most pay by in the world. That's just one case of hundreds
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:25.880]  of things that Trump had reversed and now people are going to feel the sting and the pain, the
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:30.680]  energy cost, everything else. But what's really illustrated this is the trial to the Senate
[3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:35.320]  where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and saying he lost the election
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:41.640]  and just engage all sorts of criminal activity because the fix is in folks. The swamp is deep.
[3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:46.440]  Trump fought it, but it's up to us to win it. We told you it was coming under the United Nations
[3:20:46.440 --> 3:20:52.120]  pilot program in Singapore for eight months. They made citizens wear bracelets on their arms
[3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:56.360]  that make some social distance and report them back to cell towers to track for every movement.
[3:20:56.360 --> 3:21:01.880]  This is for everybody. The way it gets better. Now France has programs in their factories,
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:07.160]  government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars. They can make social
[3:21:07.160 --> 3:21:12.120]  distance and report back to their computers. They're turning us into a commodity. Human
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:16.200]  animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced. They are literally
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:21.080]  taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations down the
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:25.480]  way that they own us with the gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[3:21:25.480 --> 3:21:30.600]  To you understand, it is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level. And now they're
[3:21:30.600 --> 3:21:35.160]  coming with dog collars and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. Starting next year,
[3:21:35.160 --> 3:21:39.960]  it will begin. Did you hear me? Dog collars for your children, all based on a hoax,
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:43.160]  all based on a lie. Employee wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:49.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:22:05.240]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news.
[3:22:05.240 --> 3:22:13.240]  I'm going to come back here in a moment and talk about misinformation, specifically
[3:22:13.240 --> 3:22:17.480]  proliferated by the mainstream media, something that's not often talked about while they try
[3:22:17.480 --> 3:22:21.160]  and get everyone else banned, silenced and censored for, quote, misinformation.
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:24.600]  First, though, we're going to go to this report from Nigel Farage.
[3:22:25.320 --> 3:22:29.640]  I had a headline here out of the independent Coca-Cola faces backlash over seminar asking
[3:22:29.640 --> 3:22:36.280]  staff to be less white. Again, this is transnational corporations openly embracing
[3:22:36.280 --> 3:22:42.680]  the intersectional racist nonsense that the far left produces. So Coca-Cola has come under fire
[3:22:42.680 --> 3:22:47.080]  from conservative critics who have accused the drinks brand of reverse racism after it used
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:52.360]  a training video that encouraged staff to try to be less white. Replace those words with try to be
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:58.280]  less black. Can you imagine the outrage that would ensue? The content of a training session
[3:22:58.280 --> 3:23:03.880]  was leaked by a Coca-Cola employee who sent pictures of slides asking white people to be, quote,
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:10.120]  less ignorant and less oppressive. Here's Nigel Farage commenting on that. Let's go to the clip.
[3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:17.960]  Back, I told you about Coca-Cola and this absolutely crackpot idea that they were going to
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:24.120]  actually train their employees to be less white because if you're less white, you're less arrogant
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:31.480]  and you're less nasty. And I put that film out a couple of days ago. Now I put these videos out
[3:23:31.480 --> 3:23:39.000]  because very often I want you to see and hear stories that otherwise you simply will not get
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:43.480]  from mainstream media. And I've been doing that now for about a year and I hope you think
[3:23:43.480 --> 3:23:52.200]  I do manage to tick that box. But this is not just an exercise inventing our anger at some of the
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:58.840]  madnesses that are going on in this world. It is a means to actually getting things changed.
[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:05.320]  And I've got some good news for you because there were two or three of us, a couple in America,
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:11.800]  a couple in the UK that picked up on this story and went for it. And as a result of this,
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:19.800]  Coca-Cola were facing an onslaught of online criticism. So they put out a statement to say
[3:24:19.800 --> 3:24:28.600]  that being less white was not the focus of their activities in terms of educating their employees
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:36.440]  and they would continue to redefine their curriculum. That led to more people emailing,
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:44.600]  to more people being outraged. And now Coca-Cola have said that this will not be part of their
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:51.480]  of their employee training. So they dropped it. They dropped this dreadful idea of telling people
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:56.840]  to be less white, of telling people who are white to be utterly ashamed of who they are
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:04.360]  and what they stand for. And this is a big victory and we have been a part of this. You
[3:25:05.240 --> 3:25:12.680]  have been a part of this. I got a lot of emails, a lot of messages from those who watch my video
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:19.800]  almost with incredulity that a firm like Coca-Cola could be doing this. Woke capitalism is what it's
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:27.160]  known as when big companies have somebody right on in the HR department who thinks they need to do
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:36.040]  this for popularity. So this is a big kickback. It's a big victory and it's why I do want you
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:41.160]  to keep watching my videos. I do want you to keep getting in touch with me via the website,
[3:25:41.160 --> 3:25:47.240]  emailing me stories that you've seen that nobody else has covered. And when you do see me picking
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:53.160]  up an issue that you think matters and you think should be changed, I want you to share these videos
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:26:01.160]  and yourself. If it's relevant, complaining to your local MPs. If in the case of Coca-Cola,
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:08.520]  emailing the company. We proved in the last few days for Coca-Cola that we can get things changed.
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:14.680]  So I'm really happy about that. Now, one thing we haven't yet changed, and I'm speaking to you now
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:19.880]  on Tuesday morning, is the story that I was uncovering last April and last May when I was
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:26.600]  going out day after day into the English Channel and showing you videos of these migrant dinghies
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:33.800]  coming across from Calais and all along the North French coast, coming into the United Kingdom.
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:39.000]  I covered, I think, the scale of that story. Mainstream media did then pick up on it. And then,
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:44.440]  of course, I went to the hotels and showed you the billions that we're spending over the course
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:49.240]  of the next few years. Now, last week, the immigration minister, Chris Philp, put out a
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:55.640]  statement to say that 70 per cent of those who so far this year had attempted to come from Calais
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:27:01.960]  had been stopped on the beaches. So the extra 30 million quid, we've given the French authorities
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:08.840]  was working, and that now we weren't members of the European Union, we would start returning people
[3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:15.240]  who would illegally come to Britain and had come here through a safe country like France. Well,
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:21.080]  it was all very bullish, as it nearly always is from Pretty Patel and Chris Philp, but none of it
[3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:29.240]  ever matches reality, because this very morning, a boat landed on a beach at Warmer in Kent, near
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:37.720]  Deal. And 21 migrants got off the boat and ran off into the Kent countryside. As I speak to you,
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:44.840]  they're being hunted down by Kent police. 50 that we know all came into Dover yesterday. It'll be a
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:50.760]  lot more today. And whatever Chris Philp said, so far this year, the numbers that are coming are
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:56.200]  even bigger than last year. It was eight and a half thousand that we know of across the channel
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:28:02.280]  by small boat last year. And from what I can see, we may well have left the EU, we may well have
[3:28:02.280 --> 3:28:11.240]  left the Dublin Convention, but we don't have any agreement with the French government on returns.
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:19.400]  So we've won on Coca-Cola, but to stop the massive cost of people coming into Britain illegally,
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:26.840]  the vast majority of whom would never, ever qualify to be refugees, let alone what the
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:32.920]  security risk is of people who we've got no idea who they are coming into and being allowed to stay
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:39.880]  in our country. So we haven't won this one yet, but I will keep pumping out information, information
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:46.120]  you won't get from mainstream media. And I want you to go on watching, to go on complaining,
[3:28:46.120 --> 3:28:50.040]  and to go on putting on pressure for change, because that's what we want. We want
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:56.120]  to improve things. So look, a massive thank you from me to all of you who watched that Coca-Cola
[3:28:56.120 --> 3:29:01.960]  video, spread it around and complained to the company, because we've actually made something
[3:29:01.960 --> 3:29:08.600]  just a bit better. That's Nigel Farage on his YouTube channel. Go on, subscribe to that. Talking
[3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:15.800]  about Woke UK, we had this headline also out of Summit News yesterday. This was quite hilarious,
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:21.560]  some incident that happened over the weekend. UK police forced to respond after ad claimed
[3:29:21.560 --> 3:29:27.160]  being offensive is an offence. Turns out it's not an offence, but it doesn't really matter.
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:33.400]  Merseyside police were forced to respond after officers took part in an electronic ad campaign.
[3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:39.080]  They had a van with an electronic billboard outside a supermarket, which claimed being offensive
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:46.280]  is an offence, with authorities later clarifying that it is in fact not an offence. Over the weekend,
[3:29:46.280 --> 3:29:51.160]  the mobile electronic billboard was parked outside an Asda supermarket for a PR campaign.
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:29:56.920]  Being offensive is an offence, states the ad, which features a police badge superimposed
[3:29:56.920 --> 3:30:13.960]  over an LGBTQI+++. Merseyside police stand with and support the LGBTQI+, community. We will not
[3:30:13.960 --> 3:30:18.680]  tolerate hate crime on any level, come and speak to Team Beb, stated the text on the ad.
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:26.680]  Problem is, being offensive is not an offence, and Merseyside police, after a backlash,
[3:30:26.680 --> 3:30:32.360]  had to come out with a tweet and admit that maybe they should have realized it before putting it
[3:30:32.360 --> 3:30:38.680]  in big letters on a billboard, parking it outside a supermarket and having three police officers
[3:30:38.680 --> 3:30:44.360]  guard it and broadcast to the public, basically intimidate the public into thinking that being
[3:30:44.360 --> 3:30:51.560]  offensive is an illegal activity in the United Kingdom. It's not. There is a claim, there is a
[3:30:51.560 --> 3:30:57.000]  crime in the UK, which is called being grossly offensive, but that carries with it a high bar
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:02.120]  to reach court, and it's very hard to prove. It's not just being mean to somebody on Twitter,
[3:31:02.120 --> 3:31:09.560]  it turns out. Problem is, we've got record-rising crime rates, we've got record-rising knife crime
[3:31:09.560 --> 3:31:16.280]  in the United Kingdom, we've got crime levels at such a disgraceful level that in 2015,
[3:31:16.280 --> 3:31:21.160]  the head of the National Police Chiefs Council said that police officers would be unable to
[3:31:21.160 --> 3:31:28.680]  attend some burglaries, but rest assured they will be hot on the scene of you if you tweet
[3:31:28.680 --> 3:31:37.160]  something mean to somebody in the LGBTQI++++++ community while having to backtrack immediately
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:41.800]  and say that actually, it's not the case, you can be offensive, that's not a crime, you can back
[3:31:41.800 --> 3:31:51.960]  no way. As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[3:31:53.240 --> 3:32:01.240]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[3:32:01.240 --> 3:32:09.160]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[3:32:09.160 --> 3:32:15.800]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no
[3:32:15.800 --> 3:32:24.040]  synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives. Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:30.600]  with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most
[3:32:30.600 --> 3:32:36.040]  out of this herb-packed formula. So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store. Never
[3:32:36.040 --> 3:32:42.440]  been a better time than right now. Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:32:43.320 --> 3:32:49.480]  As negative as times are right now, and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[3:32:50.360 --> 3:32:58.120]  that this is all a test, this experience, this whiff on this planet is a reckoning. It's God
[3:32:59.000 --> 3:33:03.640]  giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide where we want to spend
[3:33:03.640 --> 3:33:09.640]  eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come down to that. So as sad as
[3:33:09.640 --> 3:33:14.200]  things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God
[3:33:14.200 --> 3:33:20.600]  is the author of our consciousness. God is the author of us having our own will. God is the
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:27.240]  author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing. When you look at mainstream
[3:33:27.240 --> 3:33:33.720]  media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's
[3:33:33.720 --> 3:33:37.480]  all about dominating your free will. It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly,
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:41.960]  you're in the bad because Satan hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:50.440]  the universe. I sell supplements for two reasons. Because they work, they're real, they're powerful
[3:33:50.440 --> 3:33:55.960]  and because it's a giant market. But again, why is there a giant market? Because it works.
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:34:01.560]  That's why it exponentially grows. So whether it's saw palm meadow and other key ingredients
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:09.640]  in our prostate formula, prostate guard, or whether it is the super high grade organic
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:17.160]  vitamin B12 and ultra 12, or whether it's the PQQ or the CoQ10 in DNA force or the pure deep

[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:49.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:09.640]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:16.040]  I want to talk about misinformation because this is, of course, a major bugbear in the
[3:36:16.040 --> 3:36:20.840]  mainstream media right now. They claim people should be silenced, censored, banned because
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:26.440]  of, quote, misinformation. You notice that it's moved on from hate speech. It's moved on from
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:32.360]  any other justification. Now it's just, well, we think you're wrong. You peddle misinformation,
[3:36:32.360 --> 3:36:38.600]  which is, of course, is an entirely subjective word. Therefore, you need to be de-platform.
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:44.840]  Well, it turns out there are three clear cases of misinformation, naturally harmful misinformation,
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:50.040]  that the media has engaged in in recent times. Headline here at Summit.News,
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:59.880]  poll finds 44% of liberals think cops killed 40 times more unarmed black men than the actual number.
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:06.120]  This is a new poll, which highlights the gulf between what people believe and reality.
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:12.840]  And it finds that 44% of liberals think cops killed almost 40 times more unarmed black men
[3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:19.080]  than the actual figure. Now this was conducted or it was commissioned by Skeptic Magazine.
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:25.400]  First of all, you have to find out the actual number of unarmed black men who were killed
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:31.480]  by police, in this case in 2019. And according to Mapping Police Violence, which is a database
[3:37:31.480 --> 3:37:37.160]  compiled by data experts and activists. So it's not really going to skew in favor of police.
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:44.680]  In 2019, police officers in the United States killed 27 unarmed black men by any means.
[3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:51.480]  And that includes 13 unarmed black men, which were fatally shot in the same year by cops.
[3:37:52.600 --> 3:37:57.560]  However, when you ask liberals, when you ask leftists, how many unarmed black men they thought
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:38:03.240]  had been killed by cops, a very different picture emerges. According to a nationally
[3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:09.000]  representative survey, people who describe themselves as very liberal or liberal think
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:14.600]  that the actual number of unarmed black men killed by police per year is about 1000.
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:24.280]  Again, the actual number is 27. The 1000 figure is just under 40 times the actual figure of 27
[3:38:24.280 --> 3:38:30.920]  unarmed deaths. Zach Goldberg tweeted this and he said, quote, overall, 44% of liberals guessed
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:37.880]  1000 or more as compared to 20% of conservatives. That calculation is based on the crosstab shared
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:43.320]  by the researcher. And you can see those stats in the tweet, which is embedded in the article.
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:48.600]  Goldberg also explains how furthermore the average liberal respondent also thought a
[3:38:48.600 --> 3:38:55.560]  clear majority of people killed by police in 2019 were black. In actuality, roughly a quarter were.
[3:38:56.840 --> 3:39:02.600]  Again, more unarmed white people are killed by cops. You would expect that given that,
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:07.160]  you know, black people represent 13% of the population. But of course, when you account for
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:13.080]  the regularity of violent confrontations involving black men with police officers,
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:17.800]  then you have to account for that number being more. The huge disparity in the actual number
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:23.160]  of unarmed black men killed by police and how many how many a significant number of liberals think
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:29.320]  were killed by police can only be explained by media messaging and moral panic. Again,
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:36.280]  why do they think that 40 times the number of actual deaths occurred compared to the real figure?
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:43.880]  Because we had months and months of mainstream media propaganda about black people being hunted
[3:39:43.880 --> 3:39:49.320]  down on the street. Literally, as I point out in this article, in one instance,
[3:39:49.320 --> 3:39:56.920]  basketball star LeBron James asserted that black people are quote, literally hunted every day,
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:03.400]  every time we step foot outside the comfort of our homes. We had months and months of
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:09.400]  black lives matter inspired riots, violence, burning of buildings. We had, I think that last
[3:40:09.400 --> 3:40:14.680]  count, it was about three dozen deaths as a result of those riots. And a large part of that
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:21.960]  violence was based on this false perception that at least 1000 black people per year unarmed black
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:30.920]  people were being killed by cops circulated amplified by the mainstream media article goes
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:35.720]  on to stay given a rhetoric like that, which often goes unquestioned by corporate news outlets.
[3:40:35.720 --> 3:40:40.840]  It's surprising that so many Americans are misinformed. And this brings me on to another
[3:40:40.840 --> 3:40:46.280]  example of misinformation, which I've mentioned before, which most people don't really talk about.
[3:40:47.240 --> 3:40:52.680]  Again, peddled by the mainstream media, the reason Americans think this is because of the
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:58.600]  mainstream media propaganda they've been fed about Coronavirus, the fans of flames of hysteria
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:05.000]  being fanned by the corporate news media headline survey Americans think Coronavirus has killed
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:14.200]  30 million people in the US 225 times higher than the actual figure. This was a survey by
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:20.920]  research firm Keck CNC. This was back in August 2020, which found that on average people in the
[3:41:20.920 --> 3:41:27.960]  US think 9% of the population which equates to around 30 million people have died from Coronavirus
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:35.400]  when the actual figure is less than 155,000. And again, that was back in August. The fact remains
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:41.560]  they thought 30 million Americans have died of Coronavirus when the actual number at the time
[3:41:41.560 --> 3:41:47.080]  was 155,000. And of course, the actual number now, according to the government, even with all these
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:55.800]  comorbidities and counting flu cases of COVID, they say is around 500,000. Even if you accept
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:42:02.360]  that, that's a lot less than 30 million, isn't it? But when asked in this survey, the average
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:09.720]  American thought that 30 million Americans back in August had died from Coronavirus. Why did they
[3:42:09.720 --> 3:42:16.520]  think that? It wasn't because of the pinfoil hack conspiracy theorists circulating this information.
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:25.240]  It was because of media hysteria and moral panic. So again, you have nearly half of liberals
[3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:30.440]  thinking that 40 times more unarmed black men are killed by police every single year because of
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:37.480]  mainstream media misinformation and hysteria. And you have the average American thinking 30
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:44.440]  million Americans have died from Coronavirus because of mainstream media hysteria and misinformation.
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:53.560]  Two cases is another case from Politifact, the Pointer Institute, which is literally a left-wing
[3:42:53.560 --> 3:43:01.080]  fact-checking organization, headline, what we know about Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:06.840]  death. This, of course, was the unfortunate death of the police officer in the aftermath of the
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:14.840]  Capitol Hill riot on January 6. There's a summary here, and this outlines it perfectly,
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:20.680]  that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died January 7, that was the day after the incident,
[3:43:20.680 --> 3:43:26.200]  after he was injured while physically engaging with rioters at the US Capitol according to a
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:32.280]  Capitol Police Press release. But the cause of his death remains under investigation. The fact
[3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:38.520]  that it remained under investigation and that nobody knew the cause of death, for sure, did not stop
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:44.120]  an early report from the New York Times that said Sicknick was struck during the riot with a
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:50.920]  fire extinguisher. The Times recently revised that report prompting criticism because there's no
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:56.440]  proof that it happened, but they went ahead and reported it anyway because they wanted a martyr,
[3:43:56.440 --> 3:44:04.040]  they wanted somebody to blame for the tragic death of this officer. CNN reported that investigators
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:10.040]  are considering whether a chemical irritant like pepper or bear spray played a role. On January 8,
[3:44:10.040 --> 3:44:15.640]  Sicknick's brother told ProPublica that Sicknick had texted about being pepper sprayed. ProPublica's
[3:44:15.640 --> 3:44:21.880]  report also mentioned a stroke. Continues, Sicknick's mother recently said she thinks he
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:28.840]  suffered a stroke the Daily Mail reported. Again, he died the day after from what looks like a stroke,
[3:44:28.840 --> 3:44:34.120]  but they don't know it's still being investigated. That didn't stop the New York Times from saying
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:40.200]  it was from him being struck with a fire extinguisher and that didn't stop CNN from reporting that it
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:48.920]  was related to him inhaling pepper spray. Massive example of misinformation circulated by the
[3:44:48.920 --> 3:44:57.080]  mainstream media at the height of this hysteria over the U.S. Capitol riot in the day, the first
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:02.840]  24-hour period after it. Again, another glaring example of mainstream media misinformation.
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:09.400]  Again, this report is not even going to get one-one-hundredth of the attention that the initial
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:15.560]  claim that Trump supporters killed a police officer got. Glenn Greenwald commented on this
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:21.800]  report earlier today. He stated, quote, PolitiFact finally acknowledges the truth. Nobody has any
[3:45:21.800 --> 3:45:27.160]  idea how Brian Sicknick died. His mother said he was never hit and believes he died of a stroke.
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:32.360]  His brother thinks it may have been pepper spray. Nobody knows. It doesn't matter. They went ahead
[3:45:32.360 --> 3:45:36.760]  and blamed Trump supporters anyway. Despite the fact, by the way, that four other Trump supporters
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:42.440]  died, including Ashley Babbitt. Nobody really cared about that. In fact, Ashley Babbitt was the only
[3:45:42.440 --> 3:45:47.560]  one who basically received any mainstream media attention. Nobody even knows the names of the
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:52.840]  other four Trump supporters who tragically died. Greenwald went on to say, quote,
[3:45:53.640 --> 3:45:59.800]  have any of the cable hosts who repeatedly dramatized a false story about how Sicknick died
[3:45:59.800 --> 3:46:03.720]  causing that story to ricochet across social media to millions of people
[3:46:03.720 --> 3:46:11.320]  retracted what they said. Max Abrams also commented on this. He said, don't worry. I'm
[3:46:11.320 --> 3:46:15.800]  sure the corrective story will get as much media attention as the original version,
[3:46:15.800 --> 3:46:22.440]  asserting as fact that the domestic terrorists smashed to death the officer with a fire extinguisher.
[3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:28.360]  So they have three examples of mainstream media misinformation that led to direct hysteria and
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:32.200]  real world harm. That's going to wrap it up. War Room is coming up next.
