[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:24.880]  so does he live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones you look at
[00:24.880 --> 00:31.440]  what happened in Tiananmen Square back in 1989 thousands were shot dead and run
[00:31.440 --> 00:36.600]  over by army tanks there in the college area when they simply came out and said
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.440]  we want to be able to vote we want to be able to have representative government
[00:41.440 --> 00:49.200]  in 1986 the president the chairman of the Communist Party by the name of who
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.320]  Yao Bang who is a sympathetic to the students and debate and and and democracy
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.840]  movement at that level and was stripped of his position and put under house
[01:00.840 --> 01:08.840]  arrest and when that happened China came into a relatively repressive period
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.120]  when all the debate had to go underground and which cost a lot of
[01:13.120 --> 01:21.040]  tension and that built up till the 1989 spring of 1989 when Fu Yao Bang and
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.720]  expectedly died of a heart attack and that as you all remember was the event
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.040]  that triggered Tiananmen Square demonstrations those days as a 21
[01:32.040 --> 01:36.280]  year-old student leader marching on the street of Beijing and occupying
[01:36.280 --> 01:41.080]  Tiananmen Square we not only had the support of the Chinese people we had
[01:41.080 --> 01:45.880]  the support from all over the world particularly in the democratic countries
[01:45.880 --> 01:51.480]  clearly you felt we were fighting for the same as you had fought for and lived
[01:51.480 --> 01:59.480]  by it felt like history was on our side and victory would be ours soon on June
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.760]  4th 1989 the Chinese Communist Party sent in tanks and troops to massacre the
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.600]  people it claimed to represent in order to save his own skin the Communist Party
[02:10.600 --> 02:15.840]  brutally suppressed freedom of expression and crushed all dissents it has
[02:15.840 --> 02:23.680]  continued to rule since then at the barrel of guns using fear and lies the
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.240]  people's Republic of China is not a republic neither is North Korea it is a
[02:29.240 --> 02:35.080]  Politburo Central Committee dictatorship of the grandchildren and the
[02:35.080 --> 02:40.480]  children of the people who overthrew and took over China and its weakened
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.520]  position from the Japanese at the end of World War two and leftist in America and
[02:45.520 --> 02:51.640]  major foundations backed that so the robber barons would have a country with
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.720]  hundreds of millions of slaves to be able to leverage out the rest of the
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.320]  world economy and now it is the China century according to the anti-American
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.920]  globalist at the Council on Foreign Relations will the 21st century be the
[03:04.920 --> 03:09.560]  American century or will it be the Chinese century the Chinese are moving
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.360]  up fast there's no doubt about that I was there just about a month ago and the
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.760]  change in 25 years because it was 25 years ago that I was first there is
[03:19.760 --> 03:23.560]  extraordinary what would be the consequences in your opinion if Trump
[03:23.560 --> 03:32.240]  were to confront on trade one can expect that people like myself and those
[03:32.240 --> 03:39.440]  leading Americans who for eight administrations have pursued a common
[03:39.440 --> 03:45.800]  policy will continue to believe in those principles and will continue to
[03:45.800 --> 03:51.080]  advocate them but we're beginning to see signs that the fabric of how we finessed
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.120]  it is beginning to fray so I actually think it's possible not just an
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.040]  economic confrontation with China but also a political and strategic
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.320]  confrontation in ways that if you had had me on the show one or two years ago I
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.080]  would not have predicted this relationship is deteriorated significantly
[04:07.080 --> 04:10.400]  in a short amount of time folks in Hong Kong said when they build this bridge
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.760]  that took five years biggest bridge in the world for the mainland here will be
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.160]  used to bring in tanks and troops and the bridge hadn't even been completed two
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.680]  months when tanks and armored vehicles and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[04:24.680 --> 04:30.320]  of troops per week began pouring in a few months ago again it got completed
[04:30.320 --> 04:33.400]  what six months ago they began pouring in right after that and they've been
[04:33.400 --> 04:37.840]  pouring in hundreds of thousands every week since then no one knows the full
[04:37.840 --> 04:44.000]  number but it's reportedly over a million because very few leave back to the
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.280]  mainland they've been massing troops there look around us the societies that
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.760]  have made the most spectacular progress in the shortest period of time are not
[04:54.760 --> 04:58.560]  the most rigidly organized nor even the richest in natural
[04:58.560 --> 05:03.040]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish they think the West is dead
[05:03.040 --> 05:06.080]  they think if they censor nationalists and patriots off internet you'll just
[05:06.080 --> 05:09.520]  forget about us and then they'll be the only information out there well so far
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.680]  that's not been working too well for them thanks to you spreading the word
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.600]  steadfastly but the resistance to globalism is alive and well at band not
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.400]  video and now we've added a lot of new functions and a lot of new hosts and

[05:40.640 --> 05:45.320]  there's nothing the scumbags can do the power of America the power of freedom
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.320]  the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the censors of the
[05:49.320 --> 05:54.840]  tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at band not video but it's up to you to
[05:54.840 --> 05:59.920]  unleash its full potential band not video
[06:05.200 --> 06:11.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[06:11.120 --> 06:16.240]  to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:16.240 --> 06:21.240]  you
[06:37.240 --> 06:45.560]  broadcasting worldwide on this Friday edition I'm your host Alex Jones and
[06:45.560 --> 06:50.240]  we're gonna be here for the next four hours last night my phone began blowing
[06:50.240 --> 06:59.360]  up at a level that I've never seen before and that was everybody freaking out
[06:59.360 --> 07:07.720]  about a woman in New York at a AOC event saying that we need to kill the
[07:07.720 --> 07:11.600]  babies we need to get rid of the babies for the earth and then she went on to
[07:11.600 --> 07:19.880]  have we eat the babies now the minute I saw it I said this is a 100 level troll
[07:19.880 --> 07:26.000]  this is highest level troll because the woman did a great job doing it and what
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.400]  she said is what they're actually pushing but the way she laid it out it
[07:29.400 --> 07:35.840]  would explode and then because it was fake the media would then attack it and
[07:35.840 --> 07:42.120]  say nobody wants to kill the babies that then opens it up to the fact that Bernie
[07:42.120 --> 07:48.360]  Sanders has been running around saying that we need to get rid of the babies
[07:48.360 --> 07:53.760]  in the third world to save the earth particularly the brown babies and we
[07:53.760 --> 07:57.440]  are keeping babies alive and selling their organs and all these Democrats are
[07:57.440 --> 08:02.320]  saying too many kids are killing the earth and this is their real policy but
[08:02.320 --> 08:08.600]  the big takeaway is that AOC was nodding her head while the woman was
[08:08.600 --> 08:16.440]  speaking and agreeing with her and then not decrying it so that is the big
[08:16.440 --> 08:22.160]  giant takeaway but the troll carried out by the LaRouche organization was
[08:22.160 --> 08:26.120]  expertly executed now you say what you want about LaRouche group they're
[08:26.120 --> 08:29.160]  always being demonized and I don't agree with some of their solutions but
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.160]  their analysis of how the global government works and their analysis of
[08:34.160 --> 08:39.560]  how British eugenics became the world policy and how Hitler was a spin-off of
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.680]  that that's totally true I separately studied history before I ever even ran
[08:44.680 --> 08:50.120]  into the LaRouche work when I've been on air a few years and found the
[08:50.120 --> 08:54.200]  analysis of how the world works was just quotes and documents and statements I
[08:54.200 --> 08:59.400]  mean a lot of Ronald Reagan's views were formed by Lino LaRouche he would fly many
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.760]  times weekly to meet with Reagan in his first few years in office and then so
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.240]  with the CIA director of course LaRouche had been in the OSS and then in the CIA
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.360]  in Europe and so LaRouche had had been inside the globalist system and was
[09:13.360 --> 09:19.120]  obviously fighting it he got put in prison for not paying a credit card
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.600]  statement on time in his organization I mean I've experienced the same type of
[09:23.600 --> 09:26.960]  stuff they're trying to do to me to put me in prison so it's usually a good sign
[09:26.960 --> 09:31.480]  when somebody's political the system is trying to put them in prison if the
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.520]  system's corrupt but I don't want to go off down a LaRouche and rabbit trail
[09:35.520 --> 09:42.560]  here that's who went down to play the clip in a moment and just got up and
[09:42.560 --> 09:48.440]  basically mirrored back on them what they're saying and it goes on for two
[09:48.440 --> 09:51.160]  and a half minutes and then they finally come and take the mic away from her I've
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.480]  gone and watched much of the town hall she was having they were letting other
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.200]  people talk about 30 seconds they let her go and go because they liked what
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.000]  she was saying and then that she sounded so distraught
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  they're like oh it's okay because they're like oh our propagandists work too good
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.120]  on her because AOC and Beto they're all just following a rule of 12 years 11
[10:12.120 --> 10:17.840]  years it's all going to be you know ending now it's seven years six years
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.120]  now we don't pass carbon taxes in three months we're all dead and that's what
[10:22.120 --> 10:29.080]  Greta Thunberg was saying through her mentally ill autistic haze very very
[10:29.080 --> 10:35.760]  sad and so this woman was expertly mirroring you know the German accent
[10:35.760 --> 10:42.640]  the whole nine yards she did a great job you know she ought to get an Academy
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.480]  Award because she acted just as hysterical just as stupid as the Soros
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.480]  funded puppets are we're gonna go to break and come back and get into the raw
[10:53.480 --> 10:58.920]  clip of that and then Rob News put together a very excellent piece you need
[10:58.920 --> 11:06.840]  to go to band.video or news wars.com to find it we've been having DDoS attacks
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.560]  for about a month straight every day and it started 7 a.m. and we've got
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.400]  everything on cash servers so articles that were already up are already up but
[11:16.400 --> 11:19.960]  we're not able to get into info wars because there's millions of visitors a
[11:19.960 --> 11:26.600]  second that aren't real and so the cash system is up but info wars is
[11:26.600 --> 11:30.240]  basically down I mean that's just the daily occurrence here of the attacks
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.040]  I'm not gonna list them all you know about it you see what happens it's now
[11:34.040 --> 11:37.040]  happening to President Trump it's happening the Republican Party it's
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.280]  happening to the NRA because they sit there and let big tech do all this and
[11:42.280 --> 11:45.040]  big tech and the globalists and the stay-behind networks that Obama and
[11:45.040 --> 11:48.600]  Hillary left in charge are doing all this and they're directing in that
[11:48.600 --> 11:53.280]  congressional hearings bragging they're directing at all by saying we're Russian
[11:53.280 --> 11:56.720]  agents they're able to use the power of the CIA against us of course they're
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.080]  actually globalist agents and their big weaknesses that they're against this
[12:00.080 --> 12:06.080]  country's existence so they spin it that that were the foreign powers and were the
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.360]  bad guys which of course is a completely asinine but that's the type of thing
[12:10.360 --> 12:16.360]  that's going on so this was a perfect troll and it just makes me feel happy to
[12:16.360 --> 12:20.200]  be alive you know there's other smart people out there doing smart things and
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.040]  you know I've said the way to defeat the globalists is what we did three years
[12:24.040 --> 12:28.960]  ago all of our listeners going into Democrat events and bringing up that
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.320]  they want to confiscate our guns that they want to kill babies after they're
[12:32.320 --> 12:36.880]  born partial birth abortion post-birth abortion and that Bill Clinton's a
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.680]  rapist and all the other issues we just take over their events and show that
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.360]  they're giant frauds or that Hillary ruined Libyan you know Africa and it's
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.600]  a war criminal well Elizabeth Warren's being shouted down everywhere in
[12:50.600 --> 12:58.360]  airport town halls AOC is being trolled the squad is being basically legally
[12:58.360 --> 13:02.920]  and lawfully hunted by the truth everywhere they go just everyone you
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.400]  listening check the newspaper check the local candidates websites members of
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.840]  Congress that are globalist presidential candidates go to their district go to DC
[13:11.840 --> 13:17.920]  if they're in your district go confront them dominate them this is how we are
[13:17.920 --> 13:24.800]  going to defeat them this is how we are going to stop them is with human action
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.240]  and then putting it in cyberspace triggering a mass movement against them
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.400]  the Joker that I went and saw last night was exactly what I was told from those
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.680]  that are of the script it's meant to cause mass leftist French Revolution
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.240]  riots killing of anybody that's mental class and killing the police and
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.520]  overthrow of civilization and a release of incel mass mental illness so it is
[13:45.520 --> 13:48.320]  designed to cause mass shootings it's not that people are hyping it's going to
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.400]  cause mass shootings and then that's going to cause mass shootings it's designed
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.320]  to cause the breakdown of society I told you that I sent a representative to
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.520]  Sundance this year they did not even hide the fact that they are being funded to
[14:00.520 --> 14:08.120]  trigger overthrow of the America and the breakdown of civilization pure poison so
[14:08.120 --> 14:13.280]  we're gonna be breaking all that down today as well but they're openly saying
[14:13.280 --> 14:19.560]  kill babies and Rob do stayed up late last night to band-ot video to put the
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.200]  video together AOC's modest proposal going back to Swift writing well we got
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.120]  too many Irish let's just eat their babies and and the British actually
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.000]  thought it was real at first and said well maybe we should eat the babies
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.560]  because the Irish were seen as subhuman so shock video AOC nods at women saying
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.720]  start eating babies to save the earth you scroll down at news wars calm we
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.720]  have the boil down that we put together and then we have the raw video as well
[14:46.720 --> 14:52.040]  it needs to go viral it's at news wars dot com we can't post it to info wars
[14:52.040 --> 14:55.400]  dot com that's why I've created backup sites like news wars and prison planet
[14:55.400 --> 15:02.440]  dot com and you know Paul's got his summit dot news because there's so many
[15:02.440 --> 15:06.280]  attacks and so many things and so many lawsuits and so many everything we've
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.040]  got to do this to just continue on to 2020 and that it helped leapfrog past
[15:11.040 --> 15:17.000]  their censorship and continue fighting and again they've banned info wars calm

[20:37.800 --> 20:41.040]  Alex Jones
[20:42.560 --> 20:49.960]  it's Friday ladies and gentlemen already on October 4 2019 hard to believe we're
[20:49.960 --> 20:56.280]  about to be in the year 2020 and the quickening that's happening the
[20:56.280 --> 21:04.040]  informational societal cultural spiritual singularities that happened
[21:04.040 --> 21:09.160]  during times of massive change historically is here we're in a major
[21:09.160 --> 21:16.440]  sea change a major global realignment and the old order had a plan to try to
[21:16.440 --> 21:22.000]  have the end of history they had a plan to stop quickenings they had a plan to
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.800]  stop human rebellion to their plan to take free will and that's what this whole
[21:28.800 --> 21:36.320]  technocracy whole world government system is not science and mathematics
[21:36.320 --> 21:44.640]  technology machinery to empower humanity but to end humanity the final
[21:44.640 --> 21:50.800]  revolution we're putting together a special report with Bernie Sanders
[21:50.800 --> 21:54.480]  talking about killing the brown babies and all the other Democrats talking
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.000]  about how they want to forcibly reduce our population and Fox News saying don't
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.600]  have children they're bad for the planet and hospitals heating themselves with
[22:02.600 --> 22:08.160]  the bodies of dead babies and maybe parts being sold and babies being kept
[22:08.160 --> 22:12.680]  alive and then a woman gets up and says okay well you say we're all dead in
[22:12.680 --> 22:18.680]  11 years AOC the other fear mongers compete and say it's 11 it's 10 it's
[22:18.680 --> 22:23.000]  nine it's eight it's seven we're down to seven years and two three months and we
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.680]  don't pass a carbon tax now we're all dead around for the hills just total
[22:28.680 --> 22:32.320]  hoax on its face
[22:32.320 --> 22:44.160]  but you get a woman up there I'm gonna cover it next segment on some of several
[22:44.160 --> 22:49.360]  special reports I'm gonna get to one of time in this one and the woman gets up
[22:49.360 --> 22:55.600]  there and says what they're saying but because she didn't mean it now they're
[22:55.600 --> 23:03.400]  saying it's a hoax no she's just saying back at them through satire through
[23:03.400 --> 23:15.080]  Jonathan Swift's 1729 essay a modest proposal because they were starving
[23:15.080 --> 23:19.800]  people to death on purpose to control their population that was in the
[23:19.800 --> 23:26.120]  newspapers the times he said well hell since you're starving the Irish out the
[23:26.120 --> 23:32.920]  taxes and regulations in Ireland why don't we just eat their babies let's just
[23:32.920 --> 23:45.440]  go one more step so that's all the folks over at LaRouche did and so now they're
[23:45.440 --> 23:48.840]  gonna have to defend saying oh we don't want to eat babies we just want to kill
[23:48.840 --> 23:52.360]  them and then take their organs which is just as bad in fact that's absorbing
[23:52.360 --> 23:58.440]  someone robbing them of their life so you have life that's eating a baby taking
[23:58.440 --> 24:02.160]  a baby's organ after it's born or before it's born it's the same thing but
[24:02.160 --> 24:05.680]  taking their organ killing it so you can live is the same thing as eating
[24:05.680 --> 24:11.640]  something like that's even more intimate isn't it your stomach takes alien
[24:11.640 --> 24:15.800]  stuff in takes what it wants craps out the rest when you take a kidney or a
[24:15.800 --> 24:21.400]  liver or heart you're really a hundred percent taking it on aren't you it's
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.960]  most intimate thing more intimate than sex more intimate than even giving birth
[24:25.960 --> 24:33.320]  in a way so they're eating babies that's coming up next segment and then boy oh
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.560]  boy Tom Papert's done a great job it's over at national file dot-com we just
[24:37.560 --> 24:42.920]  posted it to news wars dot-com we can't post it to info wars dot-com because the

[25:37.800 --> 25:44.560]  Paris HQ report I'm gonna make a truthful observation about myself here
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.960]  is I know you're doing it too probably you know I've really dropped the ball and
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.480]  let them break my will we probably have ten articles a day about Islamists
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.440]  killing people in Europe running over with cars stabbing shooting bombing
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.560]  then a bunch of articles about raping little kids and kidnapping them pooping
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.920]  in pools just all the regular stuff sexually mutilating little girls and I
[26:06.920 --> 26:11.920]  just don't even cover anymore because I just can't handle it it almost feels
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.560]  like I'm tattle-tailing you know like because I don't like Muslims or whatever
[26:15.560 --> 26:20.120]  no it's not that I don't like Muslims I don't like Islam and the cult and what
[26:20.120 --> 26:26.360]  it is or what it became and the fact that it wants to conquer me but it just
[26:26.360 --> 26:31.440]  kind of becomes like a sick thing okay whatever just you stab a bunch of cops
[26:31.440 --> 26:35.280]  and people screaming Allah Akbar and none of that's in the national news you
[26:35.280 --> 26:40.440]  have to go to the police reports just like every day some black person stages
[26:40.440 --> 26:43.400]  a race attack on themselves and the media says white people did it as soon as
[26:43.400 --> 26:46.480]  it turns out it's staged and they're charged you never hear it was black on
[26:46.480 --> 26:50.960]  white you just hear oh this person made up this crime I mean it's just the media

[34:13.120 --> 34:18.120]  paid to the Chicago mercantile the London mercantile and the Frankfurt
[34:18.120 --> 34:25.240]  mercantile which are owned by private brokerage firms owned by the Roth
[34:25.240 --> 34:34.120]  childs the Rockefellers with sub brokerage firms owned by Barack Obama Al Gore and
[34:34.120 --> 34:40.920]  a handful of other top Democrats when you see all this hysteria they want to
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.960]  put a tax on carbon and track and trace it for total control they can shut down
[34:45.960 --> 34:50.440]  any civilization any country any company any individual they want with it but
[34:50.440 --> 34:56.200]  they also get all the money and the power so AOC is up there saying we've only
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.200]  got months to pass the carbon tax and her new green deal that's basically
[35:02.200 --> 35:10.700]  communism little bankrupt us in a year tax cow farts hook bags on cows shove
[35:10.700 --> 35:14.280]  tubes up their air ends I mean I mentioned this because this is totally
[35:14.280 --> 35:19.520]  insane but they've known that if you put something out totally insane
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.440]  people tend to accept it because it must be reasonable because it makes no
[35:23.440 --> 35:27.800]  sense you wouldn't be saying something so wild and so crazy unless it was true
[35:27.800 --> 35:37.240]  that's why Joseph Gerber famously said that you must tell a lie so big and so
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.840]  ridiculous then people will believe it and so we'll take them to news wars
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.960]  dot com is where our article is posted that's what we're gonna put on screen news wars dot com shock
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.840]  video AOC nods as woman says start eating babies to save the earth and it's a
[35:55.840 --> 36:00.200]  very important article because if you scroll down into the article you'll see
[36:00.200 --> 36:13.400]  a video report that Rob do stayed up all last night to put together titled these
[36:13.400 --> 36:26.840]  people are demented a modest proposal AOC edition and that's very important
[36:26.840 --> 36:38.040]  because Jonathan Swift an author and literary master in 1729 wrote a essay
[36:38.040 --> 36:50.000]  titled a modest proposal or preventing the children of poor people and then it
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.640]  goes on to talk about how it's beneficial to take them and to eat them as a
[36:55.640 --> 37:03.640]  food supply now Bernie Sanders says kill the poor children in the womb to save
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.360]  the earth and we see the United Nations and all these groups saying that humans
[37:09.360 --> 37:12.920]  are inherently bad and we're keeping babies alive again to harvest their
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.760]  organs and then killing them so they can get a higher price on the organs that is
[37:18.760 --> 37:26.920]  beyond eating them that's totally using them up and so we're already doing what
[37:26.920 --> 37:32.840]  he proposed is outlandish satire but it triggered a debate about the
[37:32.840 --> 37:37.920]  humanization of Irish children being allowed to starve to death in England
[37:37.920 --> 37:45.520]  and in Ireland because they were seen as subhuman and this is where a lot of the
[37:45.520 --> 37:49.840]  modern liberalism came from of we should take care of everybody and not treat
[37:49.840 --> 37:55.640]  people like garbage in India people that are seen as lower caste are seen as
[37:55.640 --> 37:59.080]  subhuman still people in China are this is something goes on all around the
[37:59.080 --> 38:05.400]  world it's the West that tried to stop it so we're always told how bad we are
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.080]  and how we're evil and racist because in the West we actually care about not
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.800]  trying to be like that around the rest of the world is still very barbarous
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.160]  Africa still has slavery in four countries black-on-black slavery and
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.320]  only raised that not even put those poor people down but to point out we're the
[38:24.320 --> 38:32.600]  best the West we invented freedom and we invented women being empowered and we
[38:32.600 --> 38:36.640]  invented not judging somebody off what color they were or what their background
[38:36.640 --> 38:41.840]  was but off what they stood for merit and it revolutionized things it's much
[38:41.840 --> 38:45.320]  better to have generals that came up through merit than instead of being
[38:45.320 --> 38:50.760]  fifth-generation little spoiled brats rich people but then you go to the
[38:50.760 --> 38:54.680]  extreme of oh well just because somebody's another color we put them in charge not
[38:54.680 --> 38:59.760]  because of merit but because of their a different color that's another form of
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.440]  royalty where not just because you're a British royal you're put in charge but
[39:04.440 --> 39:09.120]  because you're black you're put in charge and so you see how you replace one
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.520]  form of classism with another form of classism and communism creates absolute
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.760]  nightmares and destruction Western Christian Renaissance created the modern
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.160]  liberalism that did make us strong now we have modern leftism that's hijacked it
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.880]  that's created a nightmare system big difference between leftist and liberals
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.600]  now liberals today are leftist so liberal is a horrible term and a horrible
[39:33.600 --> 39:40.240]  people and the Prager University does an excellent job leftist versus liberals the
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.240]  difference between leftist and liberals huge difference leftist are satanic
[39:45.240 --> 39:51.040]  narcissists obsessed with themselves absolutely selfish to the max that
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.680]  wanted to control every facet of your life that's not liberal liberal is
[39:57.680 --> 40:04.080]  England 250 years ago saying we're outlawing slavery and we'll wage war on
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.520]  anybody that has slavery
[40:07.520 --> 40:18.040]  leftism is not liberal is an excellent report but let me start getting to these
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.920]  pieces of information let's go ahead and roll the raw video of the woman in
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.880]  New York talking to AOC that's gone totally viral last night here it is may
[40:28.880 --> 40:38.600]  you raise your hands please because of the climate crisis we only have a few
[40:38.600 --> 40:43.720]  months left I love that you support the green deal but it's not getting you know
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.640]  getting with a fossil fuel it's not gonna solve the problem fast enough a
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.960]  Swedish professor saying you know we can eat dead people but that's not fast
[40:51.960 --> 40:57.080]  enough I think your next campaign slogan has to be this we got to start
[40:57.080 --> 41:03.360]  eating babies we don't have enough time there's too much CO2 all of you you're
[41:03.360 --> 41:09.080]  you know you're pollutants too much back in 10 seconds for me this is
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.560]  master trolling she's projecting back on the left what they're actually doing
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.680]  but it is little loose group doing it now remember in Washington state they
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.320]  now are saying they're gonna take dead bodies process them into fertilizer and
[41:20.320 --> 41:25.320]  put it on crops to make you eat your own kind and it's about training you to be
[41:25.320 --> 41:29.440]  degradated training you to not guard human life training you that you have
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.640]  no freedom getting past these taboos that have been set up because when you
[41:34.640 --> 41:37.800]  don't have those taboos you have a nightmare system don't have sex with
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.160]  children treat the dev with respect treat old people respect don't target
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.600]  the weak because any system that starts doing that descends into hell
[41:47.600 --> 41:53.520]  immediately and now scientists are saying at the UN cannibalism is the way
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.880]  to save the earth in fact they just put it on screen of all these you and
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.880]  scientists scientists suggest climate change could pave the way for cannibalism
[42:02.880 --> 42:11.800]  so this is being pushed everywhere in a big way and so we have to be honest
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.880]  about what they're doing we come back we'll play the full clip and analyze it
[42:14.880 --> 42:20.800]  and then get into AOC's modest proposal it's posted at news wars commas the
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.000]  second video shock video AOC nods as women says start eating babies to save
[42:25.000 --> 42:30.960]  the planet you can get it from news wars comm and if you go to band video you
[42:30.960 --> 42:36.280]  can find the raw reported share it which needs to be seen because I should have
[42:36.280 --> 42:42.520]  said this from the start of the hour we have all these Democrats on video saying
[42:42.520 --> 42:48.520]  kill babies and the rest of it actually agreeing with her so that's why it's so
[42:48.520 --> 42:52.520]  bombshell I should have gotten to the why the video so important but I didn't
[42:52.520 --> 43:00.120]  believe the most powerful for last I am well the president came out this last
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.400]  Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me by the deep state they're
[43:04.400 --> 43:07.480]  not gonna stop their ally with the communist Chinese it's worse than I

[44:07.200 --> 44:11.440]  country as the globalists try to break our borders bankrupt and devalue our
[44:11.440 --> 44:15.760]  dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood

[44:20.120 --> 44:24.440]  bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute the American people put a

[45:57.160 --> 46:03.760]  globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't I
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.680]  say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian
[46:07.680 --> 46:10.760]  corporate rule government above the law but doesn't pay taxes that has
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.400]  diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and socialist
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.400]  power to the people but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore well
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.560]  Trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw
[46:22.560 --> 46:26.360]  away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you could say the
[46:26.360 --> 46:30.120]  communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than
[46:30.120 --> 46:35.960]  everybody that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch the
[46:35.960 --> 46:39.800]  man and he turned over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.520]  will to have the discernment to help me part of their defeat and I've been
[46:44.520 --> 46:48.920]  saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great
[46:48.920 --> 46:54.480]  thank God for his son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against the NW
[46:54.480 --> 47:06.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:24.480 --> 47:45.440]  so if you go back to the time of Egypt and it's in the Egyptian Chronicles the
[47:45.440 --> 47:50.720]  Pharaohs from time to time would order a percentage of the slaves killed when
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.680]  they thought their numbers got too high fact a Metallica song we were just
[47:54.680 --> 48:02.960]  playing creeping death is about exodus in the Bible that tells that story of
[48:02.960 --> 48:10.360]  Moses and archaeologists have now dug up the Egyptian hieroglyphs where they
[48:10.360 --> 48:15.560]  talk about ordering the firstborn sons of different tribes they controlled
[48:15.560 --> 48:22.680]  killed that's always a way to just prove your dominance is to kill the
[48:22.680 --> 48:28.400]  firstborn males of any tribe you've conquered the Romans would just kill
[48:28.400 --> 48:34.440]  all the males down to about age 12 some of their writings say this tribes
[48:34.440 --> 48:39.200]  particularly mean these Visigoths kill their boys down to eight you got to go
[48:39.200 --> 48:43.120]  read those Julius Caesar wrote letters back to Rome about it you can read those
[48:43.120 --> 48:50.200]  those are public type in Julius Caesar's letters to the Senate but today they put
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.160]  fluoride in that double-hearts boys four times as bad for black males and look at
[48:56.160 --> 48:59.880]  the studies and they put them on a red line and they teach him to be a feminine
[48:59.880 --> 49:06.600]  order to have sex changes every firstborn son in Egypt will die from the
[49:06.600 --> 49:11.920]  firstborn son of Pharaoh who sits on the throne the firstborn son of the female
[49:11.920 --> 49:18.160]  slave who is at the end of the mill and the firstborn of the cattle as well yeah
[49:18.160 --> 49:25.880]  that's the response to the killing of the firstborn Israelite children and of
[49:25.880 --> 49:31.120]  course it will be the elite children that die that's the way the world works
[49:31.120 --> 49:40.200]  history doesn't rhyme it repeats and so those that have God's countenance those
[49:40.200 --> 49:46.800]  that have God's blessing passed on by Christ to the Gentiles will have the
[49:46.800 --> 49:55.240]  angel of death pass over us but those who do not die children will die and not at
[49:55.240 --> 50:02.760]  our hands because the Pharaoh the God of this world is killing the children and
[50:02.760 --> 50:10.040]  has a hunger for them and so God will send the final plague and you look at the
[50:10.040 --> 50:14.200]  Hollywood people way higher rates of cancer for their kids and all these
[50:14.200 --> 50:19.320]  elitists they have most their kids commit suicide they're cursed already cursed the
[50:19.320 --> 50:25.720]  real judgment hasn't come so there's a powerful video upon news wars comm and
[50:25.720 --> 50:30.280]  banned on video that I've been telling you about where Rob do I texted him at
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.960]  10 30 and I said hey tomorrow he's a great researcher as you get the videos
[50:37.960 --> 50:40.920]  of Democrats telling us they want to kill babies up to age three and that
[50:40.920 --> 50:46.120]  they're parasites and you know heat babies and use the baby parts to burn
[50:46.120 --> 50:51.240]  in incinerators to heat hospitals I mean they don't need to do that they just do
[50:51.240 --> 50:55.560]  it to have the idea that we use them as fuel we suck them up we it's a vampiric
[50:55.560 --> 51:01.920]  ritual and so do did it these people are demented a modest proposal AOC
[51:01.920 --> 51:04.960]  addition or he's not just keep harping on that is I want that to get out I want
[51:04.960 --> 51:08.600]  people to see that I want to understand that it's not just this woman getting up
[51:08.600 --> 51:15.960]  and saying it they are really doing it this is who they are every culture goes
[51:15.960 --> 51:22.960]  into a decadent cycle and starts killing babies starts eating babies and that's
[51:22.960 --> 51:31.400]  why Jonathan Swift 300 years ago while Malthus was running around at the same
[51:31.400 --> 51:38.640]  time Sir Malthus saying we need to kill the young of the poor but but the
[51:38.640 --> 51:44.280]  Christians he said won't let us kill him outright by the sword so we need to
[51:44.280 --> 51:50.680]  crowd them in to tiny Warren buildings hundreds to you know 300 square foot
[51:50.680 --> 51:54.800]  rooms so they kill each other with their diseases with their pestilence go
[51:54.800 --> 52:01.760]  read what Malthus has said Malthusian Malthus you think all this stuff's new
[52:01.760 --> 52:06.840]  it's not new Plato two thousand three hundred years ago wrote his Republic and
[52:06.840 --> 52:12.600]  said kill the poor only let the elites breed put the poor in areas with disease
[52:12.600 --> 52:20.840]  till they die he didn't write the allegory of the cave to free people he
[52:20.840 --> 52:25.240]  said we need to project things on walls of fake reality and keep them chained
[52:25.240 --> 52:31.280]  in pits as children and then we could mind control them and the CIA later did
[52:31.280 --> 52:36.520]  that children from birth in facilities raised up drug
[52:36.520 --> 52:41.480]  electroshock programmed until they can do anything they want with them we're
[52:41.480 --> 52:48.600]  following Plato's plan to rebuild Atlantis but Atlantis was real he knew
[52:48.600 --> 52:54.120]  all about it these people aren't playing games you think he put everything in the
[52:54.120 --> 53:01.200]  book no folks there was a city with free energy and flying ships is what he
[53:01.200 --> 53:10.960]  called him it blew up the sky was dark for years the planet was cold it's all
[53:10.960 --> 53:17.520]  there giant explosion who knows what it was but the point is is we've been here
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.560]  before don't let them tell you any different civilization's been here
[53:22.560 --> 53:34.760]  before not not as prolific not as distributed and they're going back to
[53:34.760 --> 53:42.920]  where it's not evenly distributed again break away civilization and you know I
[53:42.920 --> 53:45.960]  saw a ten pool video he's a smart journalist but he's smart enough to
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.400]  play along with the system so he doesn't get completely banned oh he's a liberal
[53:50.400 --> 53:55.480]  yeah right maybe a classical liberal but he like made fun of me in the video and
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.480]  I did Alex Jones rotation that I think the cell towers are gonna mutate us
[53:59.480 --> 54:02.320]  where we live with interdimensional demons now I said the cell towers are
[54:02.320 --> 54:05.120]  giving us cancer and I showed you mainstream news then I said the elite
[54:05.120 --> 54:11.000]  establishment believes they're interfacing with off-world entities
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.720]  interdimensionally and Joe Rogan has guest on professors saying universities
[54:15.720 --> 54:19.160]  have been doing those studies for 40 years he has his professors on after I
[54:19.160 --> 54:24.960]  went on and exposed it I'm not the one saying I'm communicating with their
[54:24.960 --> 54:29.360]  dimensional stuff they're the ones that say they are but see it's all a funny
[54:29.360 --> 54:34.240]  joke oh he says the frogs are turning gay ha ha ha interdimensional demons in the
[54:34.240 --> 54:41.200]  cell towers I didn't say that I showed mainline science about the cell towers
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.000]  the 3g the 4g the 5g on record giving you cancer they got signs up around them
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.680]  now admitting it there's a larger plan to exterminate us it's all over the news
[54:49.680 --> 54:55.320]  and a lot of people can't handle the truth so they only want to tell part of
[54:55.320 --> 54:58.280]  the story or they make fun of me as a way to get the story out there that's
[54:58.280 --> 55:05.000]  fine I'm a big boy I can handle it but the truth is every culture gets taken
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  over by evil and every culture believes they're sacrificing children to a dark
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.560]  entity that gives them power if they kill children that's a historic fact and
[55:16.560 --> 55:23.000]  just because Joe Rogan and Tim Poole can't handle it is fine I like Joe and I
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.120]  told you I said they're going to start demonetizing you I'd say in about a
[55:27.120 --> 55:33.600]  year and then even when you submit to them they're gonna take you over because
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.200]  by the time you submit you'll be discredited and hated and then you'll be
[55:37.200 --> 55:43.680]  a slave and it won't matter you must challenge the censorship now before it's
[55:43.680 --> 55:49.960]  too late and then we can back them off
[55:49.960 --> 56:03.160]  I told him that in his office six months ago to his face and now he came out
[56:03.160 --> 56:07.720]  they're demonetizing him and said it's all about power I even followed their
[56:07.720 --> 56:12.840]  rules and they are demonetizing me that's right Joe because they don't like
[56:12.840 --> 56:19.520]  you having millions of people that tune in when you snap your fingers they want
[56:19.520 --> 56:26.000]  all the power and if you become their puppet it won't be you anymore it that
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.920]  actually talks people what you'll just be their mouthpiece you'll just be a
[56:30.920 --> 56:40.640]  speaker like you plug into the wall will Joe wake up before it's too late or
[56:40.640 --> 56:47.000]  will he watch the fumes of his reach dissipated until when they banned him
[56:47.000 --> 56:55.680]  he has no more power left to resist them or would he resist them now
[56:56.680 --> 57:04.640]  Joe's a nice microcosm he wants to leave LA he knows it's killing his family
[57:04.640 --> 57:11.600]  he wants to say what he wants to say he's already bowed to them so much but
[57:11.600 --> 57:18.280]  because he's his own person and little glimpses of truth come on and guests
[57:18.280 --> 57:24.360]  come on and Joe opposes the censorship of the authoritarianism it's not enough
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.240]  to tell us how great the New York Times is Joe and have their little operatives
[57:28.240 --> 57:36.480]  on that can barely talk they want you to die because you're smart and you're
[57:36.480 --> 57:43.920]  strong and they won't feel dominant until you are dead we'll be right back
[57:43.920 --> 57:53.040]  stay with us the gauntlet has been thrown down every major Democrat candidate
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.120]  has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms and
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.640]  now Buddha judge has come out and said that it's about political power that's
[58:02.640 --> 58:06.800]  why they want the guns well finally they're being honest because all their
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.680]  lies haven't got them to the point they want so now they're just trying to
[58:10.680 --> 58:15.080]  normalize all this tyranny it shows what incredible followers these people are
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.880]  the globalists know they're not gonna get this without a civil war and they
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.440]  know that the minions trying to carry this out are not gonna be in a good
[58:22.440 --> 58:26.880]  position in that civil war but it's up to us that understand the big picture to
[58:26.880 --> 58:30.600]  carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick
[58:30.600 --> 58:34.960]  off a hot civil war that's our mission if you choose to accept it so please

[59:49.920 --> 59:55.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:17.120]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:24.880]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones. okay
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:30.040]  all right I've really been spending most of the hour talking about why the
[1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:34.160]  globalists want to slowly poison you dumb you down turn you into a slave before
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:38.240]  they kill you and the process of killing you suck all the money out of you with
[1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:42.920]  medical treatments they know won't save you and it's because that it's the
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:47.080]  nature of ruling class predatory elites in every civilization since the
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:58.080]  dawn of time only christianity sought to take us off of that course and it's
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:03.520]  been basically abandoned now as well and so what we've done over and over again
[1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:07.320]  is happening again and I and I've said I'll get to both these reports both our
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:11.080]  special report showing all these democrats openly saying let's kill
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:17.040]  babies and let's harvest them which is eat them when you sell their blood and
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:20.160]  sell their livers and sell their kidneys and sell their skin and sell their
[1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:28.760]  collagen and sell their hearts it's next level eating something way more
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:35.760]  intimate I will as a focus laser beam hit that in the next segment and I think
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:39.320]  we'd open the phones up even though I have more news and there is stars in the
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:46.120]  sky that we can see I think we should open the phones up specifically on the
[1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:51.400]  war on babies the war on children which is the war on the instinct to love
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:57.080]  ourselves and love humanity and have a future it's a war on a human future and
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:00.880]  they cut right to the chase teaches to hate children teaches children are bad
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:07.520]  teachers kill children see him as a commodity see him as a turkey at the
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:13.200]  grocery store and then we can factory farm all of humanity the way we factory
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.600]  farm all the animals you know I'm not we call animal rights activists because I
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:24.000]  know that movement is a eugenics run Peter Singer animal liberation front
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  eugenics front where they want to control the legitimate movement to treat
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.400]  animals more humanely because we have empathy ones read ourselves well so it's
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:36.920]  a very evil movement because it's controlled just like the environmental
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.960]  movements run by a post-humanist exterminist group that could care less
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:43.160]  about the earth and want to be able to cover up all the real environmental
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:47.280]  crises that they're helping trigger with fake carbon dioxide control which
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:52.760]  allows them planetary dominance they just want to be God they believe once
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:56.400]  they achieve this AI power they can just make new worlds you know and it mean
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:02.880]  we'll flicker the rest that this is this is just a big terrestrial sandbox
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:09.360]  laboratory or the laboratory tomato-tomata
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:18.800]  schedule schedule but I just want people to have a debate about the real world
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:23.560]  the scientific elite the breakaway civilization that's everything you you
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:28.800]  look at things through that perspective and then everything is absolutely
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:33.120]  crystal clear but if you don't look at it
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:43.160]  through that lens then nothing makes sense and the establishment say oh you
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:48.240]  look at that lens to make sense out of it well that's actually true the
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:53.880]  globalist or OCD control critics on average inbred psychotic in general at
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:59.040]  least sociopathic on the spectrum and they want a lens to control things so
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:07.480]  there's so much chaos they create an evil predatory nexus or grid which then
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:12.720]  they project onto the world so it doesn't always go the way they want but
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:15.520]  still they're projecting that authoritarian predatory grid on the
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:20.680]  things trying to make the universe make sense so I'm pointing at how things
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:24.560]  make sense that are going on because the rich and the ultra powerful of combined
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:28.680]  forces to bring in this global government post-human system because they
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:32.520]  want life extension they want control of things they claim they're trying to stop
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:35.680]  world war four that'll destroy us but really they're the ones adding fuel to
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.960]  it because they're psychotics so there's the conscious things they're doing and
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:43.720]  the subconscious things are doing but absolutely I'm trying to bring order to
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:47.120]  this and figure out what's going on and then I found the ruling class that's
[1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:51.200]  trying to bring order by getting rid of all freedom and ending the planet as we
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.520]  know it
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:05:01.680]  I'm up here with the crew in flight at night but I can't leave the office
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:06.520]  because history is happening right now this is a battle of wills between those
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:10.080]  that want a free world and those that want tyranny those who've bet against
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:14.720]  humanity and those who bet on humanity so I'm so thankful to you the listeners
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:17.760]  you are the salt of the earth you're the people that understand what's
[1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:21.800]  happening and who've helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny so
[1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:25.040]  I thank you again but please understand how important you are and understand that
[1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.920]  your word of mouth your prayer and your financial support is absolutely more
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:32.800]  critical than ever not just for president Trump but for info wars who is

[1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:13.120]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:18.120]  you're listening to alex jones
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:25.120]  you
[1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:42.520]  ruling classes throughout history have always gotten inbred and become
[1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:49.720]  psychotic that's just a genetic fact of inbreeding detached from reality
[1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:55.880]  detached from their slaves beneath them and they always try to figure out a way
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:07:10.160]  to get their servant class their diplomatic class their warrior class to go
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:20.800]  down and cull the slaves kill them and they also do that because once they get
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:24.880]  their own minions to go out and kill others well now their own minions will
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:34.960]  dehumanize themselves once they cross those bridges and so that's why AOC and
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:37.880]  Bernie Sanders and all of them are like we need to have the third world
[1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:41.840]  to abort their children we need to depopulate the planet humans are
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:45.720]  inherently bad you need to pay us carbon taxes those of you that live will be
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.680]  the priest class that organizes everything and manages everything because
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:52.160]  you're inherently bad but we'll teach you how to live we'll decide what
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.040]  resources you can have we're all gonna have big jets and huge helicopters and
[1:07:56.040 --> 1:08:00.600]  giant palaces and eat caviar and hamburgers and steaks you just don't
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:05.880]  get heating in your home and by the way your house is gonna be 250 square feet
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:11.600]  and by the way if you want a universal income you got to be sterilized so
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:16.920]  that's all it is is making slavery fashionable making it cool making it I
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:28.720]  have a spree to core and so it's in the news that AOC was up in New York State
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:34.400]  and a woman from the LaRouche group who's aware of eugenics gets up and says
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:42.840]  during the meeting that hey you're not acting fast enough the earth's gonna end
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.760]  in just a few years we've got to kill the babies we've got to eat them which
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:54.160]  again is Jonathan Swift's modest proposal from 1729 when Malthus Malthusians
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.600]  with that term comes from was going around saying let's kill the Irish let's
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:05.000]  put them in big cages put them in in apartments with their disease in the
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.920]  winter and let them all die he said cram the poor into these areas and so Swift
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:13.440]  said hey how about we just eat the Irish babies and some people thought it was
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:18.560]  serious so that's what they're doing so the media is trying to spend this that
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:26.560]  AOC you know didn't agree with it no she nods she says well don't worry we don't
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.000]  go that far we're gonna fix it she wants to terrorize you into submitting to her
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  and she sees it oh we've overdone it with this woman you know she's really
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.400]  panicked because you're telling them the world's gonna end in seven years 11
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.960]  years 12 years you know they keep lowering the number because they want to
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:44.400]  get to get that hysteria going
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:49.640]  they're trying to spin it well nobody really wants to do that this was a
[1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:53.240]  hoax well we're gonna show you a video where a bunch of Democrats that we've
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:57.680]  interviewed and talked to have actually said this because this is their world
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:01.120]  view because again if they can teach you to hate yourself and hate your babies
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:06.040]  then they've got you where they want you they cut right to the chase to cut off
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:09.440]  our life force to cut off our survival instinct so here's what actually
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:13.160]  happened in New York get rid of the babies the strut woman at AOC town hall
[1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:18.800]  urges eating babies to fight climate change here it is
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:24.320]  don't have enough time there's too much CO2 all of you you're you know you're
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:30.640]  pollutant too much CO2 we have to start now please you are so great I'm so
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:35.080]  happy that you're really supporting your great deal but it's not enough you know
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:40.200]  even if we would bomb Russia we still have too many people too much pollution
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:46.280]  so we have to get rid of the babies that's a big problem just stopping having
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:52.920]  babies aside enough we need to eat the babies and this is very serious thank you
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:11:05.560]  thank you we'll go ahead okay no we'll go ahead it's so no no no thank you so I
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:14.240]  think so one of the things that's very important to us is that we need to
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:21.400]  treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present luckily we
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:32.120]  have more than a few months in several years I think we all need to to to
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:38.920]  understand that there are a lot of solutions that we have in a positive
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:45.800]  way there's space for hope there's we are never beyond hope okay wait we're
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.320]  never beyond hope she said that in just a few months if we don't act then the
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:54.240]  time runs out we're all dead those are quotes for again your message of hope
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:12:00.120]  for all the work that you do and what you stand for in the government right now
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:06.240]  I myself thank you for your message of hope we're all dead in 12 years and
[1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:10.960]  Beto goes no it's 11 so she says 10 and now they're saying seven now they're
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:15.720]  saying you've got three months we pull the quote up AOC says AOC says we have
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:23.120]  months to act Greta Thunberg months to act UN months to act and if it doesn't
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:28.800]  happen now well Al Gore's been saying that since 1995 back when he said he
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:39.720]  invented the Internet now so we have time I'm gonna go to break and then I'll
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:45.480]  play AOC's modest proposal I'm gonna show you Democrats actually saying kill

[1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:06.600]  say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:09.680]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has
[1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:13.320]  diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and socialist
[1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:17.320]  power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore well
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:21.480]  Trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.280]  away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you could say the
[1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:29.000]  communist Chinese the David Rockefeller put in power are better than
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:34.680]  everybody that is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.680]  humanity turned over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:43.400]  will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat and I've been
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:47.840]  saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great
[1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:56.680]  thank God for son Jesus Christ and now let's move forward against the NW my

[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:43.960]  going to open the phones up and get your specific take on this and how serious
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:49.120]  this attack on humanity has gotten and how do we counter it and then we're
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:54.760]  going to have a guest on who writes for the epic times who has broken the hood
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:59.960]  report at national file calm that's Tom Papert's excellent news site that he

[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:10.000]  and that's carried on our platform at band on video and of course my radio and
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.240]  TV satellites for stations that want to pick it up a lot of stations are picking
[1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:16.040]  it up we're very very thankful for that so please call your stations and tell

[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:24.280]  and be able to censor is on those local radio and TV stations those should all
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:30.880]  become centers of communication and resistance to the globalist as well now
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:37.240]  again this report is up on band on video it's up at news wars.com it is
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:44.880]  absolutely essential that this get out to everyone you know this is AOC and her
[1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:48.880]  modest proposal dealing with the fact people say oh well this woman was just
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:53.360]  joking you know to show satire well exactly but the satire is mirroring real
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:58.600]  life which shows exactly what these individuals are up to so here it is
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:06.760]  people are demented a modest proposal that's key please get it out. Welcome to master
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:15.120]  lived on theater today's selection is a modest proposal by Alexandria Carcio
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:22.800]  Cortez. We only have a few months left I love that you support the green deal but
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:27.000]  it's not get it you know getting rid of fossil fuel it's not gonna solve the
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:32.080]  problem fast enough a Swedish professor saying that we can eat dead people but
[1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:37.000]  that's not fast enough so I think your next campaign slogan has to be this we
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:43.360]  got to start eating babies we don't have enough time there's too much CO2 all of
[1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:50.280]  you you know you're pollutant too much CO2 we have to start now please you are
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:54.880]  so great I'm so happy that you're really supporting the green deal but it's not
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:00.080]  enough you know even if we would bomb Russia we still have too many people too
[1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:06.120]  much pollution so we have to get rid of the babies that's a big problem just
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:14.680]  stopping having babies aside enough. It's a woman's body and she should not be forced
[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:19.200]  to carry anything inside of it wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm that has a
[1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:23.840]  heartbeat. So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm? A fetus is a parasite sweetie.
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:31.960]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems right?
[1:24:31.960 --> 1:25:01.120]  How many did I adopt? I kill my kids. We need to eat the babies and this is very
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:10.320]  serious please give a response. No thank you thank you we'll go ahead okay no we'll go
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:22.360]  ahead it's no thank you so I think yeah no so one of the things that's very
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:27.520]  important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:39.240]  that it does present. So we have to get rid of the babies that's a big problem.
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:48.360]  The babies that's a big... the babies that's a big...
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:56.720]  pretty it's pretty evil you sir yeah yeah and I hope and pray that you yeah

[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:53.880]  parenthood yeah state lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:59.360]  state for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth if
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:03.640]  a mother is in labor I can tell you exactly what would happen the infant
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:08.360]  would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:12.880]  resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired and then I
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:19.920]  discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother are you for
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.840]  third trimester abortions my answer to you is that should be a decision that
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:31.920]  the woman makes scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:36.720]  be very difficult is it okay to still have children how do you justify the
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:44.080]  decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free there's a
[1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:50.560]  new video out on informers.com of two partial birth abortion eight and a half

[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:00.760]  sucked out by some asshole and then they make a joke out of it these are
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:06.520]  abortion doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born the

[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:43.080]  and prosperity the powdered flesh from dead babies some people believe they can
[1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:46.480]  cure disease because of its enormous popularity
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:34:06.360]  that the shareholders of PepsiCo Big Builder Bird Group company are not
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:11.480]  allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring but we
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:16.320]  already know so enjoy the flavor we're gonna get the real solution which is
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:20.040]  gonna be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes I'm consistently
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:23.820]  pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular
[1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:27.160]  zores and I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million
[1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:31.280]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient would it be better
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:37.560]  not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-up in medical cost
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:41.160]  but that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:47.180]  discussion they told me to say that they were sorry but that you had become
[1:34:47.180 --> 1:34:59.600]  unreliable is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:03.000]  society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.600]  citizens it will do it to its descendants that kind of society will
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:12.320]  also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:38.400]  Pizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:36:02.560]  silent for food crisis we only have a few months left I love that you support
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:06.840]  the green deal but it's not getting you know getting with a fossil fuel it's
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:11.280]  not gonna solve the problem fast enough a Swedish professor saying you know we
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:16.320]  can eat dead people but that's not fast enough so I think your next campaign
[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:21.720]  slogan has to be this we got to start eating babies we don't have enough time
[1:36:21.720 --> 1:36:28.680]  there's too much CO2 all of you you know you're pollutant too much CO2 we
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:33.400]  have to start now please you are so great I'm so happy that you really
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:37.680]  supported nuclear deal but it's not enough you know even if we would bomb

[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:15.240]  my career welcome back ladies and gentlemen you know I look at hundreds of
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:19.440]  news articles today as I know you do as well you're informed or involved you
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:27.480]  care and you always see the photos of these arrested child molesters and they
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:35.800]  all look like a cross between Brian Stelter and Adam Schiff but you know
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:42.400]  who's the real clowns like if you're at a park and you see a creepy looking dude
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:47.520]  walking around and then you're not surprised 20 minutes later when you
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:51.840]  look over and he's jerking off behind a tree look at your kids you know that
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:57.800]  happened to me like 15 years ago there's a lot of perverts in the world

[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:31.480]  molester but drag queen story time all over the country has convicted pedophiles
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.560]  at it with little kids riding horsies and the mothers pushed their kids in the
[1:38:35.560 --> 1:38:41.200]  kids cry this is all just a sick satanic fetish and then now in different
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:45.800]  areas of the country like which it taught Kansas the news is like don't run
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:51.200]  background checks it's discriminatory let the drag queens sit with your
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:55.800]  children and they put the kids on TV with convicted killers you're saying why
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:39:01.480]  would they do this because if you can take your kids to actually a satanic
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:06.360]  clown event with convicted pedophiles and the men are dressed like demons and
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:11.080]  monsters and actually do these weird shark mouths they go a little kid
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:15.160]  sitting hi children when you show you the videos it's whether it's Texas or
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:19.880]  New York or everywhere it's to say hello bring me the children and the kids
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:26.200]  standing there and the men goes I exert perfect they found the shots and of
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:30.440]  course you know once the children submit now they've been prepared and then
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:35.040]  local news in Houston goes ah we've got him young gotta get him young and they'll
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:48.720]  tell my host laughs so that's how it all is ladies and gentlemen so let's go
[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:55.440]  back to this guy here unsupervised accused preach priest teach council
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:08.320]  foster children that's right that's AP priests that have been accused of
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:14.240]  assaulting people moved other areas end up supervising children and this is the
[1:40:14.240 --> 1:40:19.600]  thing just move them around but again would you put your child of your TV
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.360]  viewer I'm asking folks would you you showed up somewhere to daycare and this
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:31.720]  guy total creepersoid was there you would you would you would not have your
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:37.700]  children there but see if they could put it on TV to show men actually in war
[1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:42.800]  pain in goblin outfits then it's all about getting you to not have your
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:50.280]  defenses let's go back to him nearly 1,700 priests and other clergy members of
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:55.080]  the Roman Catholic Church considered credibly accused of child sexual
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:59.720]  abuse living under the radar with little or no oversight from regulator
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.360]  authorities or law enforcement decades after the first wave of church abuse
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:09.800]  scandals roiled US diocese AP reports and so people busted before they got
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:14.200]  let off just so embarrassing they reported in Pennsylvania 3,000 plus
[1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:20.800]  priests confessed to the police that they would have satanic orgies with
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:26.560]  little children raping them and giving them the sacrament which the sacrament
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:31.480]  is HIV into their bodies they would actually tell them in satanic ceremonies
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:36.680]  I'm not kidding folks this is in the news you want to go read it when your kid
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:40.520]  gets HIV you still don't say anything that's embarrassing right you turn your
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:44.640]  kids over they closed up the church they had a satanic ritual and gave your kid
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:51.120]  a deadly disease pale Satan right it's trendy but imagine then even after this
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:57.560]  they get busted it continues on because hey demons got to eat
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:09.240]  oh but don't worry here's another one the smoking gun Ohio police hunt for
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:18.720]  Speedo clad pervert haunting Kent State sorority house oh my gosh somebody in a
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:24.720]  Speedos running around outside sorority houses being a pervert so there's a big
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.960]  man hunt for him but when men dress like this in clown outfits and kids sit in
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:34.880]  their laps then it's okay there's another one hepatitis a outbreaks
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.440]  fly up across the US oh the more you get vaccinated the more you get it
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:45.240]  but anyways just thought I'd bring that up for you right there just remember
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:48.560]  that's going on just turn off your instincts turn your children over to
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:55.000]  known pedophiles it's liberal do it oh we might have to take your children away
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:01.680]  globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:05.640]  I say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian
[1:43:05.640 --> 1:43:08.720]  corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:12.400]  diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communists and socialists

[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:08.080]  interests steadfastly he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:12.520]  try to break our borders bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.320]  communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:21.080]  we have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy but at the 11th
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:25.840]  hour 58th minute the American people put a populist in power and it's happening
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:30.640]  all over the world so great things are happening but the enemy is striking back
[1:46:30.640 --> 1:46:34.920]  they're very serious with this impeachment plan it has bipartisan

[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:38.160]  if you want to know why allergies are getting so bad our bodies are fighting
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:44.520]  for their lives and most cancer is viral that's the medical fact it's not
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:53.680]  popularly known and when they contaminate vaccines which all vaccines are
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.480]  contaminated with other things from the environment when your body creates an
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:05.280]  autoimmune response to the attenuated pathogen be it viral or bacterial when
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:10.440]  they put a dead virus or a dead bacteria in you well they've now learned
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:16.680]  there's all sorts of other little miniature viruses in miniature bacterium
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:26.520]  even to that bacteria and even to that virus micro viruses micro plasms from
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:32.040]  the bacteria and then there's even things in there so it's just as above so
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:37.800]  below I'm gonna hit this next hour the story's up on info wars calm we've gotten
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:41.000]  the site we're able to post back to it it's up on news wars commas from mic
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:45.720]  Adams from natural news calm medical horror genetic sequencing of common
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:51.680]  vaccine finds entire male human genome from a boarded human baby a complete
[1:48:51.680 --> 1:48:58.840]  individual genome with abnormal modified genes 560 genes linked to the
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:12.400]  cancer so again they give you an entire humanoid it's not human replicant
[1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:23.680]  genome filled with cancer viruses in that sweet enjoy you know my dad
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:26.720]  listens to the show he sends me text messages when I do that and he goes
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:33.400]  son it sounds evil hey dad I'm doing that on purpose because that's pure evil
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:40.760]  what they're doing and maybe people will get upset about it but they won't I
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:47.800]  just want people when they're dying to spend your last months warning other
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:53.560]  people so they won't die so no one's gonna take this serious to your child or
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:59.720]  your wife or you die early I'm not trying to sound mean about this when you
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:06.240]  I know why people can't deal with all this I know why because to admit they're
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:12.400]  doing this to us is incredibly evil you have to do something about it my dad is
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:17.480]  an oral surgeon and Dennis he still has his license but he's retired 20 years
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:22.240]  ago he heard me talking about about fluoride and he said son you need calcium
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:26.080]  fluoride it's good for your teeth you're full of crap I brought him
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:30.480]  literature from scientists that got it fluoridation done in Canada Dennis saying
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:37.840]  I thought it was calcium fluoride it's not it's toxic acid acid fluoride with
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.520]  other toxins toxic waste they dump in the water this is insane this is horrible
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:46.280]  this lowers IQ gives you cancer my dad came back to me he was your right I
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:51.080]  can't believe it I thought it was medical grade fluoride Dennis don't know
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.880]  this now it's all it been all over the news because my dad thinks the other
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:50:58.520]  dentists are like him like well we wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't good
[1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:06.160]  even though he grew up was in UT when he was in high school playing to that told
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:10.440]  a bunch of eugenics stuff he still projected himself onto what he was
[1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:18.320]  doing so I'm gonna cover this after our guest leaves this because we have an
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.440]  epic times router is also written was from right bar to much others really
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:27.880]  powerful report on Nancy Pelosi son and Ukraine and the gas company and there's
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.480]  an indictment for securities fraud you didn't hear about that yeah we're gonna
[1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:42.400]  go deep down the rabbit hole on that but a lot of people are saying well you know
[1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:45.240]  sure it's coming out the shift probably just made all this stuff the whistleblowers
[1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:48.560]  made up like the transcript he read and Pelosi now says well even that
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:51.720]  transcripts real so they're desperate to protect ship so they've moved on to
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:56.280]  other things oh he asked China for help he threatened China said I know you bought
[1:51:56.280 --> 1:52:00.800]  off our government maybe you should investigate that well the idea that he
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:05.600]  can't investigate crime give me a break so CNN says Trump's normalizing his crime
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:09.960]  no you guys have been normalizing your crime and trying to act like
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:14.320]  investigating it's a crime so Trump's calling your bluff you don't just set
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:18.000]  the parameters of reality anymore with your gaslighting so that's coming up as
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:26.520]  well it's huge but I'm not trying to demoralize everybody here getting into
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:35.480]  all these hardcore issues I'm telling you that major medical firms and testing
[1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:45.440]  companies are going in and doing the spectrum spectrometer
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:53.600]  electron chemical test in the electron microscope test and all the rest of them
[1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:59.800]  and it's a fact that they are putting chemical and biological weapons into the
[1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:03.720]  vaccines and if you think ten thousand percent plus increase in pediatric
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:09.360]  cancer is bad son ladies and gentlemen it's gonna be I mean you'll have half
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:15.920]  the kids dead by five so roll them up and get ready to die there'll be lots of
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:20.040]  fundraisers for all the dead kids and lots of you know 10k's to raise money
[1:53:20.040 --> 1:53:25.440]  and find the cure find the cure don't shoot them up with cancer viruses so I
[1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:30.640]  can laugh all day about this because the truth is I'm gonna start raging and
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:37.840]  dump this table over and you know go after people so I'm not gonna do that
[1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:43.040]  but this is the reality this is where we are this is what we're dealing with and
[1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:47.280]  I'll cover this after that guest leaves us stories up on in fours dot com and
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:52.600]  news wars dot com I suggest everybody focus on this the product also contains
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:58.760]  residual components of MRC five cells including DNA and protein and trace
[1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:06.520]  quantities of neomyosin and bovine calf serum from MRC five media
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:11.760]  vaccines routinely formulated with a boarded human fetal cells notice MRC
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:19.200]  five and in W W 138 the CDC openly lists some of the vaccines that use the
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:30.920]  human cells including and it goes through them all the HEP AB MM RV verivix
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:37.520]  chicken pox FDA published vaccine it goes into what this major lab found talk
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:43.120]  about dangerous Adams has a top rated lab he took him six years to build it
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:49.440]  millions of dollars got scientists in it fetal cell line was found to belong to
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:53.880]  male fetus is what's in it entire human genome in the vaccine the cell line
[1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:58.440]  presents itself in such a way that it's likely to be very old thus consistent
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:04.440]  with a declared line of the 1960s that has the cancer viruses in it the fetal
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:09.160]  human DNA represented in the vaccine is complete individual genome that is the
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:13.720]  genome DNA and chromosomes of individual and present in the vaccine the human
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:17.400]  genome I mean this is gonna make people allergic to humans allergic to
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:26.200]  themselves oh I'm sure of it now we don't have long to wait and that and I'm
[1:55:26.200 --> 1:55:29.280]  not a sadistic person but all these yuppies and trendies and people that
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:35.960]  think this is all funny you're all gonna be dead very soon so
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:44.720]  this is a mass psychotic takeover no we already knew all this but just to have
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:49.480]  to know that they're using whole human genomes piggyback with a bunch of
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:57.920]  cancer viruses in the tissue so it nest in your cells how are they gonna get
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:04.400]  away with like everybody has cancer wow wow it'll be too scary to admit it
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:08.440]  everyone has Stockholm syndrome so they'll just go to the doctors and the
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:12.520]  doc and the doc and the cancer doctors of course I'll be fabulously paid off to
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:19.600]  cover it up geez but then it's gonna become really obvious when none of them
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:22.160]  are given their kids vaccines it's already happening and none of the rich
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:28.160]  people do so they'll tie it to your food cards entertainment rations in the
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:31.360]  future I'm gonna get on the internet play video games anything to be able to
[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:36.080]  handle shots so people will be so addicted they're gonna do it and then
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:39.520]  it'll be obvious you're killing yourself but it'll be okay they'll give you a
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:42.880]  bottle of stuff you know that you take for a week you just die before the
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:45.640]  cancer kills you
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:55.240]  AP reports that there are pedophiles all over the US both convicted non-convicted

[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:10.520]  keep fighting on because the right thing to do against the truly satanic
[1:59:10.520 --> 1:59:15.560]  forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off the lines in
[1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:19.520]  the sand for everybody now but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:23.360]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn I just want to take time out
[1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:28.360]  again to salute the audience because you are truly activist in the arena and
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:32.480]  without you and your prayers your word of mouth and your financial support this
[1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:36.080]  operation that you built that your operation would not be here we've got
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:39.920]  some giant specials running right now at info wars store.com a lot of items 50

[1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:47.400]  even harder into the future
[1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:54.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:59:54.040 --> 2:00:14.840]  The bigger threat for me though is not just deep platforming it's algorithmic
[2:00:14.840 --> 2:00:20.120]  manipulation I'll give you an example right now on Google you can search Paul
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:23.400]  Joseph Watson YouTube what would you expect to come up as the top result
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:27.280]  I don't know you have any followers on YouTube your YouTube channel 1.6 million
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:31.160]  subscribers you would expect the first result to be my YouTube channel correct
[2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:37.080]  the first result is a person doing an impression of me who has about 200,000
[2:00:37.080 --> 2:00:41.960]  subscribers a video that has about 30,000 views you don't even get to the
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:46.440]  result for my YouTube channel until the bottom of the page okay so Sundar
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:50.680]  Pitchai however you say his name testified in front of Congress they
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:55.360]  don't manipulate the algorithm for partisan purposes complete and utter
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:01.040]  lie in front of Congress you've got videos on YouTube Mark Dice is another
[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:06.160]  conservative commentator on YouTube you can put in the exact title in quotations
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:11.120]  for a video that he produced a couple years back about Michelle Obama 2 million
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:16.200]  views or whatever you have to go to page 30 on the search results of YouTube to
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:20.640]  find that exact video videos appear before that they're completely unrelated
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:24.240]  to Michelle Obama or anything to do with that we can talk about Google
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:27.000]  manipulation I mean that's that's the most obvious thing and the reason for
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:30.840]  this is simple human beings are lazy so when they go to Google they want Google
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:33.600]  to spit out the fastest result they probably don't even look past the first
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:36.560]  four things that it hits the first four links that come up when you Google
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:40.320]  something you are more inclined to hit those I can't think of a last time I've
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:44.400]  hit the second page of Google right so Google understands it's obviously human
[2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:47.160]  beings are lazy they want information as fast as possible so what they're
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:50.840]  purposely doing is giving you false information about someone or or
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:54.160]  distorted information about someone if you Google me the stuff that comes up as
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:57.760]  hideous I do so much work for black America talking about actual issues that
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:00.860]  are happening like the illiteracy rates that people are going through
[2:02:00.860 --> 2:02:04.680]  intensified in front of Congress and yet nasty disgusting articles that have been
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:08.480]  written about me by leftist racist journalists will be the first thing that
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:13.200]  come up as if and we know for a fact that CNN is not being watched we know for
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:15.560]  a fact that their viewership is down that people are no longer paying
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:19.520]  attention after they got caught with this Russian hoax and yet all of their
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:25.840]  stuff will hit the top of the page every single time but Sundar Pachai goes
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.320]  before Congress and lies and lies right to Trump's face and Trump puts up with
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.440]  it and so do we and now they're censoring Trump presidential ads and
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:38.520]  it's all confirmed they've set the precedent and you know I really like
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:42.800]  Paul I really like Candice and I've tried to explain to them and everybody
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.480]  else that I've been used as the beta test so going back two years ago before
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:54.640]  the official ban they made info wars with an Alex Jones search about page four
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:58.240]  and then on all the other big search engines they're doing that now too but
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:02.040]  then they only put the negative stuff up top but now I can put in whole info
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:06.720]  wars headlines and click web search they're unsearchable well then I went
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:10.560]  let me check Breitbart totally unsearchable then I checked a bunch of
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:15.200]  others like a weapon it totally unsearchable and then Breitbart and
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:24.600]  people don't even do articles about that they just start debating whether
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:30.240]  they're really being censored or not I mean I really sometimes wonder what's
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:37.680]  wrong with people because it's far worse than everybody knows the admissions
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:41.480]  are but everyone just kind of incrementally a few years later figures
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:44.760]  out what's going on when the battle plan is all out in the open we have a
[2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:48.200]  special guest joining us but I gotta tell you Trump's not paying for me to run
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:52.240]  these ads I'm running these ads to analyze them we're gonna come back with
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:56.120]  the intro then I'm gonna play dims want to steal the election Trump's telling
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:04:00.440]  the truth and then right after that this new ad they're running just since
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:07.200]  yesterday drain the swamp I mean these are powerful there's another one also
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:10.800]  stop the madness I want to play these because Trump's really getting hardcore
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:14.880]  and that's what we need and we're not gonna override these extremists by
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:22.160]  playing patty cake and by pulling back they put cancer viruses knowingly from
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:35.440]  SV 40 and a bunch of other deadly cell lines in vaccines and then they wrap it
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:40.200]  around a bunch of human DNA for whatever weaponized reason but they don't
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:44.000]  need to be doing this this isn't part of the process they're adding and that's
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:47.960]  up on info wars.com right now so if you want to live you might want to figure
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:51.160]  out that we're not playing games I'm just I'm just telling you this is life and
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:59.280]  death my friends I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have and my
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:04.360]  goodness yesterday's press conference when they came in on him with all their
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:08.560]  garbage the foreign reporters the US reporters these little political sellouts
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:13.320]  these whores he just tore them to bits and it's one thing to hear it if your
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:18.560]  radio listeners powerful but if you see it it's all at band.video we've got the
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:23.240]  full press conference we've got my boil down of how epic it is it's all about
[2:05:23.240 --> 2:05:26.760]  video and I just you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:31.800]  on all 45 cylinders this was amazing and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:36.080]  it so info wars America Trump all of us incredible things are happening and
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:42.080]  we're sharing the ideas that are gonna defeat the tyrants at band.video and I
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.720]  got to tell you we've done great video work we've done great films we've done
[2:05:45.720 --> 2:05:50.240]  so much but websites are not our thing well now they are I'm so proud of band.video

[2:05:54.480 --> 2:06:03.640]  Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:07.280]  lines of the info war
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:22.160]  it is simply antithetical to our constitutional democracy to use
[2:06:22.160 --> 2:06:26.600]  impeachment to overturn an election on partisan grounds I think it has
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:30.680]  traumatic impact on the confidence of the American people having government
[2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:35.000]  the effective impeachment is to overturn the popular will of the voters as
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.720]  expressed in a national election their hatred of the president exceeds their
[2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:45.440]  caring about this country and its people it would trample upon the choice made by
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:50.160]  the people through the electoral process and do great harm the people
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:56.800]  elected the president they still support him we have no right to overturn the
[2:06:56.800 --> 2:07:01.320]  considered judgment of the American people but what the American people are
[2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:07.480]  saying loudly clearly is let's get on with the business of the American people
[2:07:07.480 --> 2:07:13.240]  impeachment of a president is an undoing of a national election it
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:17.400]  violates the independence of the presidency and it usurps the people's
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:21.480]  voice they are ripping his son to our votes they are telling us that our
[2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:26.200]  votes don't count and that the election must be set aside send a message
[2:07:26.200 --> 2:07:32.200]  through the ballot box that's what we do in this democracy
[2:07:32.200 --> 2:07:50.440]  I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president he will get reelected
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:55.600]  they couldn't defeat him so now this swamps trying to take him out first the
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:08:00.920]  Mueller investigation now Ukraine politics at its worst president Trump is
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:06.560]  changing things renegotiating bad trade deals securing our border creating six
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:12.160]  million new jobs it isn't pretty the swamp hates it but mr. nice guy won't
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:18.320]  cut it takes a tough guy to change Washington it takes Donald Trump I'm

[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:13.560]  making it the end of the world they're making it the biggest thing that the
[2:11:13.560 --> 2:11:17.120]  planet has ever seen and it's all of our fault and something's got to be done
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:20.240]  right now well there's always been murderers there's always been killers
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:25.000]  and they know that and they've put the general public on psychotropic drugs
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:31.200]  that on the drug insert says he causes people to go out and do this my family
[2:11:31.200 --> 2:11:37.520]  is so bad it has changed our lives that was the reaction from the family of a
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.480]  husband and wife killed by a drunk driver in Salem today they were in
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:46.680]  court as the driver who was in this country illegally pleaded guilty hell
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:49.800]  of the illegal aliens shot the poor woman in San Francisco in the back the
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:54.840]  jury found him not guilty but he'd been found guilty of a gun crime so he was
[2:11:54.840 --> 2:11:58.640]  sent to prison for that and the appellate court said no let him go
[2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:01.520]  even though he'd been deported five times and committed about show their
[2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:06.440]  crimes a state appeals court has overturned a conviction against the man
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:12.120]  who shot and killed Kate Steinley on San Francisco's pure 14 back in 2015
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:16.920]  Jose Garcia Zarate was acquitted of murder a manslaughter in the case but
[2:12:16.920 --> 2:12:21.400]  found guilty of possessing a firearm as a felon tonight that conviction has been
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:25.480]  tossed out they can't even put a guy in jail for shooting a woman in cold blood
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:31.240]  in the back when he's illegal alien that's a virtue signal you've said that
[2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:34.960]  the president is fueling hate in this country are you suggesting that he bears
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:44.040]  responsibility for what we just saw in El Paso I am because he does someone who
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:50.880]  describes Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals who has sought to ban all
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:55.040]  all Muslims all people of one religion from traveling to the United States or
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:13:01.680]  who calls Nazis and white supremacists very fine people I was one of the gun
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:06.720]  owning Americans that heard your speech and heard what you had to say regarding
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:12.160]  hell yes we're gonna take your AR 15s and your AR let's be respectful let's be
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:19.360]  respectful well I am here to say hell no you're not this is my baby purchase
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:24.360]  under the 1994 gun ban please tell me your views if that's his baby he needs
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:31.440]  help we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:37.160]  we protect people against people who don't are not capable of knowing what to
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:41.240]  do with the gun because they're either mentally imbalanced and or because they
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:46.000]  have a criminal record time and anyway we've got one more question we don't
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.320]  come looking for me before we do I'm gonna make sure this weapon will never be
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:58.280]  able to take a life and people have always said there's so many of them out
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:07.000]  there right now one less they're coming for the guns 163 top fortune 200
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.720]  companies have sent letters to the president in Congress saying we want
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:14.800]  guns all semi-autos banned and then of course they're gonna come for all the
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:18.880]  others after that they want those all registered this is an exact formula they
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:22.160]  follow it's everybody's thinking oh they're not gonna get it all they don't
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:27.960]  have the votes the media is hyping up mass shootings and the Sandy Hook group
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:31.000]  connected to it's putting out videos of mass shootings the name of stopping them
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.920]  but all the studies show hyping up mass shootings puts ideas and mentally ill
[2:14:35.920 --> 2:14:40.960]  people's heads like the anti-famositors in Ohio and Texas and when they go out
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:45.240]  and kill people they say oh it's a white male it's white terrorism it's the
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:56.000]  biggest threat they know what they're doing and ladies and gentlemen we are
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:01.240]  live when it rains it pours around here this happens with any technology we've
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:05.560]  got a lot of really fancy equipment you know stuff happens on Fox News I talk
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:08.720]  to people over Fox News and they say they'll have like three studios for one

[2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:57.680]  this because there's the big breaking news at national file dot com that you
[2:20:57.680 --> 2:21:04.040]  wrote breaking Nancy Pelosi son was exec at gas company that hid business in
[2:21:04.040 --> 2:21:09.680]  Ukraine that is massive meanwhile the company has been charged with securities
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:13.400]  fraud you don't see that in the mainstream news then there's the whole
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:18.840]  background of this and them saying that trump is trying to do this tit for tet
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:24.080]  quid pro quo and trying to imply that he can't investigate corruption so you're
[2:21:24.080 --> 2:21:27.600]  really a leading expert on this please lay it out for us and thanks for joining
[2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:32.280]  us well it's great to see you alex I knew as soon as this impeachment thing
[2:21:32.280 --> 2:21:36.000]  started happening that this was a deflection because that's the democrat
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:39.840]  david rock playboat they want to deflect from the things that they
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:43.480]  themselves do when they were found have been colluding with the russians on you
[2:21:43.480 --> 2:21:48.400]  uranium one selling them 20% of our capability to build nuclear weapons they
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:52.080]  had to deflect and create a media spectacle for years about trump being a
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:55.600]  stuge of russia so I knew there was something going on with Ukraine and I
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:21:58.920]  knew it was bigger than just Joe Biden because Joe Biden's not that powerful in
[2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:02.320]  their in their world they would throw him under the bus in two seconds it turns
[2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:07.720]  out Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry are both integrally involved in this Nancy Pelosi
[2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:13.000]  son Paul police Pelosi junior as I discovered was on the management team of
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:17.840]  two companies he was on the board of this oil group and the related company
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:24.800]  nrg lab and it turns out that nrg lab and this oil was doing business in
[2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:30.240]  Ukraine they stated this themselves they said artists are actively involved in
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:33.840]  promoting the clean technology of this oil group of companies and energy lab
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:38.280]  for example Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the
[2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:43.360]  production of SH boxes in Ukraine that's one of their products Mika Newton is a
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:48.440]  singer in Ukraine and it turns out that her lifestyle was being funded by this
[2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:53.760]  woman named Anna Schell who is the benefactor of Paul Pelosi's company so
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:58.160]  they were grooming this woman who represented Ukraine on the European
[2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:03.480]  version of American Idol and she was used as the broker that go between between
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:08.280]  Paul Pelosi's company and the Ukrainian government to get the permit to do
[2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:13.320]  business there meanwhile Nancy Pelosi was leading a congressional delegation to
[2:23:13.320 --> 2:23:19.760]  Ukraine in 2015 Paul Pelosi was in Ukraine in 2017 under the guise of you
[2:23:19.760 --> 2:23:23.240]  know working on some kind of youth soccer partnership with the government and
[2:23:23.240 --> 2:23:27.400]  then when he was on the Ukrainian TV station they pulled his clip down and
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:30.560]  deleted it because they didn't want people to know he was there they have
[2:23:30.560 --> 2:23:34.600]  scrubbed almost all of the evidence of these companies off of the Internet
[2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:39.600]  permanently but this company based in Singapore is a big player Paul Pelosi was
[2:23:39.600 --> 2:23:45.960]  on the board and this is all coming out now and the good news is we're gonna play
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:49.040]  that video they don't want people to see right on the other side of this next
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:53.160]  break we've got that load in our little trusty computer in there right now but
[2:23:53.160 --> 2:23:57.720]  people can see the video at nationalfile.com we've also posted it at
[2:23:57.720 --> 2:24:01.440]  info wars.com and I keep harping on that because all the censorship all the
[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:05.840]  blocking everything is do it stop the world from learning things exactly like
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:11.560]  this exactly they want to shut up you Alex because you've been on the forefront
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:16.280]  of these issues for a long time and the general premise that all of us know to be
[2:24:16.280 --> 2:24:19.640]  true is that there are a group of elites who go around the world and enrich
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:23.800]  themselves at the expense of the people who vote them into office at the
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:27.960]  expense of the people in these nations who are being totally co-opted and
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:31.440]  destroyed by a globalist plot and meanwhile these people are using the
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:36.440]  government as you know a business ploy to enrich themselves and so you have
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:41.780]  John Kerry's stepson Chris Heinz of the Heinz catcher fortune and he was
[2:24:41.780 --> 2:24:45.320]  business partners with Hunter Biden when Hunter Biden was doing his own deal
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:49.720]  in Ukraine and now he's implicated in this so you have the Pelosi's implicated
[2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:53.440]  you have the Kerry's implicated you have the Clinton's implicated and actually
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:58.000]  Alex I will break this news right here on the show exclusively right after
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:02.960]  Trump got elected I have found this John Kerry and one of his final acts as
[2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:07.480]  secretary of state quietly put out a notice of funding looking for a
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:13.000]  contractor to create a network of social media activists in the Ukraine this was
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:16.480]  right before Nancy Pelosi's son went over to the Ukraine on his business trip
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:21.160]  this was as Hunter Biden and John Kerry's stepson were involved in this
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:25.480]  deal and John Kerry was looking for someone to quote build a network of
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:29.720]  civic activists throughout Ukraine they were obsessed with controlling the
[2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:33.720]  politics of Ukraine under the last president Poroshenko and then when
[2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:38.760]  Poroshenko got you know replaced by Zelensky they didn't see that coming
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:43.320]  Zelensky's pro-Trump and so they all freaked out including the Ukrainian
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:47.200]  Embassy here in the United States which was working with John Brennan on
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:50.880]  Operation Crossfire Hurricane to try to target President Trump during the
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:58.680]  election well when you think about this they've used Ukraine as a giant cash
[2:25:58.680 --> 2:26:02.720]  machine for so long they thought Hillary would get in this scam would go on
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:07.560]  forever and then now when Trump starts investigating it rightfully the deals
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:12.200]  with US interest they try to act like he's a criminal then they they kind of
[2:26:12.200 --> 2:26:15.800]  took the bait in my view now that it implicates them so bad they're trying to
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.640]  change the subject well we talked to the Chinese well we talked to the
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:25.360]  Australians well of course he was unwinding all the corruption that they'd
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:30.720]  set up and saying this isn't gonna be that way anymore at the WTO or China or
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:35.680]  anywhere or the EU or NATO it's over screwing us over and having politicians
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:39.880]  sell us out for kickbacks is over that's what the president should do it
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:44.280]  makes me go from loving Trump to being really committed to Trump that he's got
[2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:47.880]  to swamp this pest and has really been cutting their tentacles off worldwide
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:52.320]  where they get all their money it's incredible and keep in mind too that
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:55.600]  when John Brennan and Obama were running Crossfire Hurricane they were
[2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:58.960]  colluding with countries all over the world you had McCain sending somebody
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:02.760]  over to the United Kingdom to get the Christopher Steele dossier which was
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:07.080]  based on Kremlin intelligence you had Australian intelligence being tagged
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:11.280]  in on it you had intelligence capabilities all over the world and then
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:14.960]  you had shadow diplomacy so when Trump got into office and went over there in
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:19.560]  a state trip to Germany Obama was in Germany at the same time meeting with
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:25.640]  Angela Merkel and convincing Merkel to spy on Trump and to give them more of
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:28.720]  these recordings and more of this intelligence from the German intel
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:32.920]  agencies so that they could sabotage President Trump while he was in office
[2:27:32.920 --> 2:27:36.880]  that is treason that's the definition of treason so these people were colluding
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:41.160]  all over the world including Obama himself to try to sabotage the sitting
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:45.160]  commander-in-chief and so now they're trying to deflect from that and create
[2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:49.600]  a phony invented hoax and we know it's a hoax because when president Trump
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:53.120]  threw them for a loop and released the transcript they still went ahead and
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:56.520]  went with the David Brock scripted talking point that he was trying to
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:00.960]  cover up the transcript so the machinery of their scythe went forward even
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:05.000]  though Trump had you know thrown it for a loop they're incapable of responding
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:10.920]  to real-world events because all these things are scripted in advance that's
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:19.400]  absolutely right and when we come back I've got a clip of Nancy Pelosi where
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:24.160]  she's saying that the fake shift transcript he read in the committee's
[2:28:24.160 --> 2:28:29.600]  real and so as you're stating they're not just following scripts they're
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:34.660]  having total mental breakdowns and their information is always days weeks or
[2:28:34.660 --> 2:28:39.120]  years behind the wheels have truly come off but they're not stopping and then
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:42.560]  we have the soccer team ad with her son that you were talking about they don't
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:45.800]  anybody to see they'll play that as well in the other side of the investigative
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:50.200]  journalist Patrick Howley who's with the epoch times and the other great folks at
[2:28:50.200 --> 2:28:56.560]  nationalfile.com attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever

[2:33:01.400 --> 2:33:15.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:31.400 --> 2:33:39.320]  power he really is and I think he's abusing the powers of that office if
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:43.640]  former CIA director John Brennan had half a brain which he doesn't he would
[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:47.880]  disappear instead you can find the admitted Communist Party voter walking
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:52.400]  the tightrope of sedition as he tweets for more deep state whistleblowers to
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:56.360]  come forward as if it wasn't becoming obvious that Nancy Pelosi and Adam
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:00.360]  Schiff's knowledge of the whistleblower complaint a month before it was filed
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:06.240]  stinks of more deep state manufacturer manure these pawns of globalism can't
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:09.480]  even do an investigation without corrupting it and then there is
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:14.760]  chairman Mao superfan John Brennan biz pack review reports Rush Limbaugh made
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:19.880]  the jarring declaration that Obama CIA director John Brennan traveled to the
[2:34:19.880 --> 2:34:25.720]  Ukraine back in the time period around 2016 under a fake passport so wouldn't be
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:30.280]  known that he had gone and he was arranging data on the dossier and all of the
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:35.080]  other dirt that they were trying to amass insiders and observers alike have
[2:34:35.080 --> 2:34:40.200]  speculated that the likeliest progenitor of the Russia hoax if not in fact Obama
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:45.280]  was Brennan who was able to use the immense power and resources of the CIA
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:50.200]  as well as foreign intelligence assets to create and build a deep state plot
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:56.080]  aimed at taking down president Donald Trump but in a bunch of cases CIA employees
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:35:00.880]  are acting as as kind of political operatives that that's my read on it
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:05.080]  oh and it's getting worse and worse as time goes on just look at the whistle
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:08.280]  blower complaint and I use the word whistleblower in quotation marks here
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:11.880]  it looks like a legal document it doesn't look like a whistleblower
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.320]  complaint and that leads me to believe that this whistleblower that we keep
[2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:20.160]  talking about is just the face of an entire group that's at the CIA that's
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:24.840]  pushing this thing forward these people who run the CIA almost all of them are
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:30.320]  holdovers from the Obama administration yes now they're there for 20 30 35 years
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:34.400]  and they know that they can outweigh this president so what advice would you
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:37.840]  give to this president as he deals with the CIA if I could give the president
[2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:42.800]  advice I would say to turn to the Senate turn to the Senate Majority Leader and
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:47.520]  ask for an investigation of the CIA we need hearings on the CIA and reform in
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:51.120]  the CIA because this is not the way this whistleblower system is supposed to
[2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:55.000]  work which you'd be afraid of them if you were Trump oh yeah this is a
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:00.440]  continuation of the John Brennan James Comey efforts in 2016 James Clapper
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:06.360]  yeah Clapper the whole the whole group all of whom are under investigation by
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:13.000]  Barr and and Durham and I find this the timing of this somewhat suspicious it's
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  clear to me that this agent or officer and his lawyers Democratic connected
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:22.560]  lawyers worked with the House Intelligence is not the natural default if
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:29.600]  you're a CIA officer you go to the Democratic lawyers and the Democratic
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:35.400]  staff of the Intel Committee well in the era of Trump apparently it is because
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.760]  we have seen this working together with the Democratic Party the previous
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.920]  administration to prevent him from becoming president and now we see it as
[2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:49.040]  a move against the president Americans are desperate for someone to pay the
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:53.640]  fiddler before decent Americans are forced to drop what they're doing and
[2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:58.960]  descend on Washington DC what better candidate than John Brennan to be ripped
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:03.360]  from his home by a SWAT team to face the will of the country that he is
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:13.360]  arrogantly circumvented for years John bound reporting so we got us a bunch of
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:19.600]  dirty globalists inside the system dug in that are just sabotaging the working
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:22.360]  of government and trying to save the president talks to foreign leaders that's
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:27.160]  corrupt and then they've done everything that they say Trump's done it's just
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:31.560]  crazy how dirty they are and how obvious it is Patrick Howley writes for epoch
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:37.080]  times written a very powerful article for a national site that is a very very
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:41.480]  exciting that he and Tom Papert others are writing for a national file dot com
[2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:45.160]  I read their stories every day Tom Papert co-host the show here weeknights
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:49.240]  firepower with Will Johnson 7 to 9 p.m. central at band on video and informers
[2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:53.560]  commisable radio and TV satellites for stations would like to pick it up but
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:56.520]  getting back to Patrick I want to hear that little special report is I wanted to
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:02.280]  ask you it looks like Brennan is like the shadow government player he still has
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:05.560]  an actual security clearance Trump ordered it taken but the deep state
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:10.240]  defied the president he still has it is that accurate Brennan is really the
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:14.040]  chief operative I always believed that Barack Obama was overseeing these
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:18.200]  operations however Brennan is the chief operative and Brennan's protege is
[2:38:18.200 --> 2:38:21.560]  Peter Strzok Peter Strzok was the hatchet man so Peter Strzok was charged
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:26.040]  with carrying out all of these activities however Peter Strzok you know
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:28.840]  messed up of course because he was having an affair with Lisa Page and he was
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:31.920]  putting a lot of stuff on text message and if you're in the deep state you
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:34.880]  should not be putting a lot of stuff on text message so this thing can be
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:37.840]  unraveled now but we know that John Brennan was going around the world
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:42.600]  including to Ukraine with a secret passport a fake passport in order to dig
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.920]  up dirt on president Donald Trump which is treason which is you know it opens
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:51.640]  the CIA up to so many different kinds of things that Attorney General Barr could
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:55.920]  wage against them right now and the point of the matter is these people are
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:01.080]  hoaxers they not only fake the news but they now fake world events and they
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:04.440]  truly believe that there are enough low-information people out there who are
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:08.320]  not watching the Alex Jones show who are not educating themselves that if they
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:12.560]  just put the spectacle of an impeachment hearing on television people will
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.960]  think it's really serious because the spectacle of it is so overwhelming we
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:20.320]  have to break them down with facts and the fact of the matter is Adam Schiff
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:24.560]  lied in front of Congress Nancy Pelosi lied about Adam Schiff lying in front
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:28.240]  of Congress and all of these people were using Ukraine as their own personal
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:31.920]  gravy train because it's one of the most corrupt countries in the world and they
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:36.120]  were getting millions of dollars for themselves and their families
[2:39:36.120 --> 2:39:42.760]  Wow you know it goes back to Carl Rubs saying we control history now we can do
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:48.560]  whatever we want whenever we want however we want and we know that was a
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:52.480]  neocon slash Democrat operation all those illusional wars but it really shows
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:55.920]  their thinking and as you said they're betting on everybody being low
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:39:59.880]  informational voters and just getting away with all this but it seems like the
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:03.640]  hoaxes are getting bigger because they're not working anymore and so they
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:08.560]  just hope if they get bigger and bigger somehow they can swallow reality it's
[2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.120]  absolute desperation and if you look at the stuff that you and I both know that
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:15.600]  they could really be facing some charges for including human trafficking all over
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:19.360]  the world including you know these placeholder cases like the late Jeffrey
[2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:23.440]  Epstein the nexium sex cult which was sex trafficking in little kids from
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:27.080]  Guatemala and Mexico where they were grooming the kids at daycare centers
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:30.640]  performing mind control experiments on them bringing them into this country I
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:35.200]  mean this is sick sick stuff human slavery is the big issue of our time
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:39.360]  and they don't want that to be exposed and so they're desperate to try to shift
[2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:42.600]  the narrative to anything else that they possibly can't including the fact that
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:46.280]  the president had a very pleasant phone call with a foreign leader who's
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:49.640]  helping us by the way with economic things and military things and it's
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:52.600]  good to have allies by the way they're trying to ruin our alliances around the
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:56.120]  world because they're about global destabilization to deflect from their
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:41:00.080]  own criminality and so we're seeing that and by the way there are parents as we
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:04.760]  speak Alex at the state capital in Sacramento right now protesting against
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:08.680]  child protective services alleging that since the Clinton administration child
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:12.760]  protective services has been human trafficking little kids for profit by taking
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:15.720]  kids out of their homes from their parents in the middle of the night and
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.680]  then putting them into the foster care system which is child prostitution and
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:24.160]  the Trump administration told me today that they're now taking open reports
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:28.200]  from whistleblowers real whistleblowers who believe that they have seen
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:32.520]  prostitution in the foster care system and they want you to report that to the
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:37.320]  Trump administration that's breaking right now I know it's incredible and I
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:41.400]  love your energy and how you're so fired up we've got to get you on more often
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:45.960]  because I mean the epic times the work that's going on over at a national file
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:51.240]  and and big tech is so desperate they're so criminal to be trying to cover this
[2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:54.920]  up all these people that may not have the child trafficking on their hands or
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:59.000]  may not be involved in all this by helping suppress this information
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.520]  coming out they're doing it and I remember at the time the Clintons and
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:07.360]  Dyncor got caught in Eastern Europe and Africa and Haiti and the US literally
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:11.520]  putting into a file we want a darker girl with blue eyes and then they would
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:14.880]  go out and find a poor family and take them and then put it through Dyncor who
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:21.040]  was running local CPS and so the level of mafia evil is just so over the top
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:25.200]  that the average person just can't even imagine it and the fact that the
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:28.960]  Democratic Party is helping the child comes bringing the fentanyl they're
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:32.720]  helping do the child trafficking but it's so evil they believe it's quote too
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:36.000]  able to fail kind of like the infiltration of the Catholic Church by
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:40.080]  these sex cults and now it's an AP today that there's all these sex criminals
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:45.840]  that didn't get in trouble that are now being turned loose again on children

[2:44:54.320 --> 2:45:00.480]  globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it didn't i
[2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:03.680]  say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:07.040]  authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:10.400]  that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:13.840]  socialist power to the people but then meanwhile his tax
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:18.400]  exempt again offshore well trump got that and all these other populace get it
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:21.760]  why would you throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.080]  just so you can say the communist chinese the david rockfeller put in power
[2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:30.240]  are better than everybody that is a sick freakish joke
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:34.080]  and i will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:38.960]  and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help me
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:44.400]  part of their defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god is delivering
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:48.160]  because god is great thank god for his son jesus christ
[2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:54.240]  and now let's move forward against the nw
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:58.800]  the truth is president trump is the most investigated president in history
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:02.720]  he is working for american interests steadfastly
[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:07.040]  he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:11.760]  bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist chinese control
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:14.560]  who now own hollywood and the majority of our debt
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:17.920]  we have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:22.880]  but at the 11th hour 58th minute the american people put a populace in power
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:26.880]  and it's happening all over the world so great things are happening but the
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:31.520]  enemy is striking back they're very serious with this impeachment plan
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:35.120]  it has bipartisan support and i'm telling you president trump needs our
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:38.960]  prayers and info wars needs your prayers and support
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:41.520]  ladies and gentlemen the globalists are trying to shut us down
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:44.560]  but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:48.320]  great products at the same time with black friday comes two months early
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:52.000]  with store-wide free shipping double patriot points and ladies and
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.960]  gentlemen 50 off
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:47:05.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:20.240]  all right folks alex jones here back live dr nick baggage always informative
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:24.640]  is going to be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room with our destroyer
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:27.840]  of course i did a sunday show four to six p.m. central we're living
[2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:34.000]  in just incredible times and you really can't
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.920]  accentuate enough just how incredible the times are
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:41.360]  i can get really negative looking at all this but it's because corruption has
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:46.480]  been breeding under the surface for a long time
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:51.040]  and it's a system i call too able to fail
[2:47:51.040 --> 2:47:54.640]  so uh going back to patrick howley who is a
[2:47:54.640 --> 2:48:00.640]  very prolific well-respected investigative journalist you follow him on
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:06.480]  twitter at howley reporter and you can find his work at the epic times and
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:09.440]  other great publications you know just take the epic times i know it's only
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:13.200]  been around since the early
[2:48:13.200 --> 2:48:17.360]  2000s and then when we're getting into multimedia it's
[2:48:17.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  it's one of the top 10 video platforms in the world for the news outlet
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.040]  just because they cover real stuff and they've been proven right on
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:30.400]  basically everything so i'm glad he writes for them i'm glad he writes
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:34.800]  for the national wire and the work they're doing
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:38.480]  i got a few clips i want to play but what would you call this period of time
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:41.920]  we're in a and b what would you say the real
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.240]  position of trump is right now because
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:48.880]  you know i mean i know we've got the upper hand in many ways because we're not
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:53.040]  corrupt like they are and all the world people are waking up and it's a
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.640]  season of political revival and cultural revival but
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:00.800]  they're also just so damn nasty and crazy and arrogant
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:04.080]  that it just it just you can feel i think the palpable
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:08.560]  uh arrogance and insanity of these people who who who just been kind of asleep
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:12.000]  with the switch stealing billions and and the world going towards
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:15.840]  destruction uh and all these authoritarian regimes
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:20.560]  disrespecting us and and then now those authoritarian regimes are funding them
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:23.840]  in the hopes they can remove trump don't those regimes know you can't put the
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:27.600]  genie back in the bottle i mean this collision course we're going down i
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:30.560]  don't think can be changed now what's going to happen in the
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:34.400]  collision of these two forces uh it is going to be epic and i'm not
[2:49:34.400 --> 2:49:37.360]  sure exactly how that's going to unfold but i don't think there's any doubt that
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:42.000]  these arrogant sobs are going to be on the bad end of it what do you think
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:45.360]  i think this is a time of awakening and i think it's a new enlightenment
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:48.320]  because we have been under the rule of criminals
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:51.840]  and this story proves that Nancy Pelosi was putting herself on an advertisement
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:55.120]  for her son's firm so that he could send it around as a commercial to the rest
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:57.760]  of the world and get money for himself these people are
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:02.080]  were just using their position in the government to enrich themselves to be
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:05.120]  worldwide global criminals when george bush
[2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:08.000]  i was talking about president donald trump getting elected
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:11.120]  he didn't say you know i'm not looking forward to donald trump becoming
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.960]  president he said i'm really not looking forward to him becoming a leader
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:17.600]  because that's how they see themselves they don't care which country they
[2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:21.440]  represent they're in the leader's club and the right versus left paradigm
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:25.680]  keeps us at each other's throats here at our levels in the middle classes in the
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:30.880]  lower classes instead of coming together and real and you know looking upward
[2:50:30.880 --> 2:50:34.240]  and saying those are the people who we both have a great with and the enemy of
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:36.800]  my enemy is my friend and we should be going against them
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:40.080]  that's how we free ourselves that's how we free our minds that's how we free our
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:43.120]  society because the people in charge don't really
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:47.120]  have much of an ideology um they that their ideology is
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:51.120]  itself it's just an atheistic worship of themselves
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:54.000]  and they truly believe that they're much better than us
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:57.840]  they have contempt for us and for all humanity and we don't need to accept
[2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:00.480]  this in the short time that we're here on this planet
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:04.960]  and so right now i think we're in the middle of the revolution of ideas
[2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:08.160]  and we're gonna win because we're on the side of good and they're on the side of
[2:51:08.160 --> 2:51:14.480]  evil well i agree with you on that to a point
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:18.720]  but a lot of them actually just don't not care about us they absolutely hate us
[2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:22.000]  and these so-called establishments fall all the time
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.880]  that's why they're trying to build a real technocracy to keep their whole
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:27.440]  edifice propped up and you see a movie like the joker
[2:51:27.440 --> 2:51:31.280]  that i saw last night it's all about killing the police killing the local
[2:51:31.280 --> 2:51:34.960]  people having an anarchy a french revolution type and that's all being
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:38.160]  funded by the chai comms and the globalist and it's in the wiki leaks they
[2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:40.720]  want cultural divide they want cultural
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:45.120]  implosion uh and so you go see it it's advertised as avant-garde it's cutting
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:48.000]  edge as anti-establishment it couldn't be more
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:52.800]  establishment yes absolutely same with antifa antifa is doing
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:56.320]  the bidding of the cia and the establishment antifa is the enforcement
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:52:00.160]  wing of jeff bezos and amazon they're doing the bidding of the left wing
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:03.040]  corporations the left wing corporations and the left
[2:52:03.040 --> 2:52:08.640]  wing government have merged really and so the government does the bidding of
[2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:12.480]  the corporations and the corporations kind of streamline our society
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:16.400]  and we're looking at a fascist totalitarianism that is bigger than
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:20.160]  just the apparatus of the left or the apparatus of the right
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:23.200]  the republican party is choosing to be the quizzing party kind of like the
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:27.280]  right tendency in russia during stalin but the
[2:52:27.280 --> 2:52:30.400]  agenda is all being driven by these democrats and these democrats are
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:34.320]  globalist criminals i think that is very much on display now
[2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:37.120]  and so it's just a question of numbers can their hoaxes
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:40.720]  can their fake impeachment proceedings get out to more people
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:44.560]  with their mainstream media apparatus than our truth and that's why they're
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:47.680]  using silicon valley banning and censorship and everything else
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:51.840]  but you know uh they can't stop you they can't stop me they can't stop any of
[2:52:51.840 --> 2:52:54.080]  us because they can't stop the free flow of
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:52:58.960]  information people are too smart now well if you look at polosi or her
[2:52:58.960 --> 2:53:03.520]  family or biden or hillary they're all these rotting psychotic
[2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:08.880]  edifices like the portrait of dorian gray i mean it's you do judge a book by
[2:53:08.880 --> 2:53:11.760]  its cover and everything they touch is turning to pure
[2:53:11.760 --> 2:53:16.320]  crap i wonder what their death rows are going to look like
[2:53:16.320 --> 2:53:20.880]  yeah no it's very interesting and they have never really been able to normalize
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:24.320]  what it is that they do and so that's why they're trying to do that now you see
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:27.360]  drag queen story hour and these other things and you see um sort of the
[2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:31.040]  normalization of pedophilia with this james gun guy in hollywood saying
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:34.160]  oh it's okay that he was coming out in favor of pedophilia because they know
[2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:37.440]  that they're exposed after wiki leaks after the work that we've done they're
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:41.440]  exposed about what their agenda what their ideology really is
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:44.720]  is that they torture children they subject children to horrible human
[2:53:44.720 --> 2:53:47.760]  experiments that's the whole thing of their start over
[2:53:47.760 --> 2:53:49.600]  sorry but i guess that's the thing of their selfishness
[2:53:49.600 --> 2:53:53.280]  something more selfish than wrecking a child
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:58.240]  absolutely and you know the fox news just fired a guy for talking about
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:02.080]  malik the deity of uh you know the pagan deity of child sacrifice
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:04.960]  well look at what was going on the nexium sex cult where they were doing
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:08.240]  satanic rituals look at these uh children that they were human trafficking
[2:54:08.240 --> 2:54:12.800]  with fake visas into this country we are the abolitionists
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:16.560]  they're the pro-slavery media that's the paradigm and everything in politics
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:19.120]  right now is about human trafficking the wall
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:22.880]  you know the everything having to do with all these issues all this division
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:25.680]  it's all about the fact that they don't want to be exposed that they're running
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:28.400]  massive human trafficking rings they don't want to be exposed for their
[2:54:28.400 --> 2:54:31.680]  criminality greasing money from foreign governments all over the world using
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:34.560]  their positions here in the u.s. government they're selling this country
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:36.800]  for themselves and they think they're going to be saved
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:40.320]  well they're not going to be saved because radical muslims aren't going to
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:43.600]  you know they're not too impressed by joe biden and nancy polosi i'll put it that
[2:54:43.600 --> 2:54:47.280]  way radical communists in china are not too impressed

[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:06.480]  injecting it to kill you and your family i mean that's mainstream news
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:11.520]  it's confirmed and it's like oh big deal
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:14.960]  oh but uh you know five people died from vaping we got to ban it no that's just
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:18.480]  the government taking it over so these things are too
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:23.280]  evil to fail is what it is they've committed crime so massive
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:25.440]  that
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:28.480]  they just think they can get away with it but here's the problem the evil will
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:32.720]  grow till everything collapses almost all the nuclear reactors are supposed to
[2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:36.400]  be shut down after 30 years they're like 45 years old they're almost all
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:41.520]  leaking no one cares the executives are crazy
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:48.160]  it's it's it's a craziness where uh nero finally committed suicide he
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:51.040]  like he was a child molester torture people to death he was into all this
[2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:53.920]  bad stuff and he finally just killed himself well they're going to do it
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:56.480]  with all of us those just probably just detonate an
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:00.080]  antimatter bomb and go i love you satan ball you know i mean actually

[2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:09.280]  the biggest thing we want to do is probably just blow the whole planet up
[2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:14.160]  and it's all this weird satanic lyrics and and and poetry about oh the pleasure
[2:57:14.160 --> 2:57:18.080]  of killing humans forever and vaporizing oh i'll be most

[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:30.880]  this just like you do and people that don't know this is all
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:33.200]  going on people are living in denial about it
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:37.920]  doesn't mean it's not going on it is it's all going on

[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:39.280]  anchorage um alaska you know thinking about what's going on in the world
[3:00:39.280 --> 3:00:44.400]  today and uh in the last segment you know when you when you just really look
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:51.040]  at um the web the matrix of uh of the politics and i and i want to
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:54.720]  talk a little bit about it you know today i'm thinking you know
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:58.720]  what do i want to cover there's like too many things and there's never
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:04.960]  enough time and when you look around the world right now and what's happening
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.880]  it flashes me back to uh the watergate air you know in the same
[3:01:10.880 --> 3:01:16.560]  kind of things you know we had a corrupt central intelligence agency an fbi
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:22.240]  that had been working at the behest of at that time the nixon administration
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:26.320]  which you know had engineered the break in at the watergate and a number of
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:30.560]  other things but what what we never got was the
[3:01:30.560 --> 3:01:34.960]  you know was the full scope and story of what happened there and the reason we
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:37.760]  didn't was because of the chain of events that
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:41.920]  occurred after and i've talked about this before and that was at the time when
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:47.360]  my dad was in the congress and hail bogs was a majority leader a couple weeks
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:51.280]  before watergate uh broke and the second election of
[3:01:51.280 --> 3:01:55.600]  richard nixon the majority leader disappeared off the face of the earth
[3:01:55.600 --> 3:02:00.480]  and and my father was with him and you know what what was going on then in
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:04.000]  terms of the deep state has always happened and it was was alluded to in
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:07.920]  the last segment is the idea that bureaucracies the things
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:13.200]  underneath government they last forever you know i mean politicians do come and
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:16.960]  go and when the cia or the fbi or other
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:23.040]  security agencies or the military branches get up in front of the president
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:26.880]  or the executive or the committee or what have you
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:33.920]  in most cases they will refer to it off camera out of the public specter as
[3:02:33.920 --> 3:02:40.240]  the dog and pony show right because these bureaucrats are going to present
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:44.720]  what they want to feed the politician to create an outcome
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:47.680]  it is the most corrupt thing you've ever seen
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:52.880]  and i've watched it in motion i'm a third generation in government from the
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:58.320]  state local national levels and this is the way it flows so when you
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:02.320]  look at what's going on in ukraine right now and the scramble
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:06.240]  at the very top of the political parties because there's a level of
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:12.720]  corruption that exists there that we can't even fathom
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:15.840]  and we've legitimized it in lots of different ways
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:20.080]  and and let me give you a few the idea of
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:24.960]  contracts people winning all these foreign contracts
[3:03:24.960 --> 3:03:30.320]  people who are related or closely associated with organizations begin to
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:34.240]  benefit by those relationships why would you
[3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:40.080]  expect it to be any different than that that's the same way as it is in every
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:44.160]  network of people the problem is when they're serving the public's
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.760]  interest it shouldn't be allowed this is the
[3:03:47.760 --> 3:03:52.480]  difference okay it shouldn't be allowed to be able to
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:56.640]  individually profit by their activity this is why
[3:03:56.640 --> 3:04:00.960]  after watergate we had like freedom of information act which is largely gutted
[3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:05.600]  and i could tell you why we have public reporting of
[3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:10.240]  campaign contributions which is largely corrupted and i can tell you why
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:13.440]  and we're going to get into that in the next segment because
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:18.800]  you know when you think about what has bred the situation we're in
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:23.120]  it's the game playing of words and the creation of a narrative
[3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:28.720]  to suck in the american will and drive us like a herd of lemming off the cliff
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:31.760]  events insanity that we're seeing break out by our
[3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:36.240]  technocracy in the 21st century today this is dr nick
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:39.280]  baggage we're going to be right back after these brief messages and you're
[3:04:39.280 --> 3:04:43.120]  listening to the info wars
[3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:51.120]  so
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:55.920]  silicon valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish they think
[3:04:55.920 --> 3:04:59.280]  the west is dead they think of a censored nationalist and patriots off
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:02.080]  internet you'll just forget about us and then they'll be the only information
[3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:05.600]  out there well so far that's not been working too well for them thanks to you
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:10.080]  spreading the word steadfastly but the resistance to globalism is alive and

[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:06.160]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[3:06:06.160 --> 3:06:12.880]  it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:06:12.880 --> 3:06:17.520]  and welcome back and uh in the last segment i started talking a little bit
[3:06:17.520 --> 3:06:20.720]  more about the deep state and i and i want to make it relevant
[3:06:20.720 --> 3:06:24.960]  both personal perspective um you know i'm 61
[3:06:24.960 --> 3:06:29.040]  in a couple of months and so a little bit of perspective i think age and
[3:06:29.040 --> 3:06:33.600]  experience does matter especially when you start to apply multi-generational
[3:06:33.600 --> 3:06:37.200]  view of the world which we kind of lose in the way our
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:41.680]  family structures are fractured today but you know at least in my family is
[3:06:41.680 --> 3:06:45.600]  relatively uh intact um at least among some of us
[3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:49.600]  to try and stretch that knowledge forward uh into the next generation
[3:06:49.600 --> 3:06:55.920]  watergate is the same contextual uh narrative that we have today
[3:06:55.920 --> 3:06:59.840]  only the difference is we have a technocracy that is so
[3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:04.960]  powerful aligned with media and global corporations that are
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:09.120]  opportunity to be heard as individuals is quickly
[3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:14.240]  becoming diminished and you know the most band network in the world and here
[3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:19.360]  we are talking and band.video a great place now where you
[3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:24.240]  can see archival material from all of the posts in this network by just a
[3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:28.400]  simple search but even getting to that location
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:32.800]  you'll find is being interfered with online at least i have in the last week
[3:07:32.800 --> 3:07:38.480]  or so but check out band.videos because this is like
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:41.920]  really the best of the best and pass it on to people
[3:07:41.920 --> 3:07:45.120]  so at least we're beyond the sensors for a while
[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:51.360]  but i say that with with a lot of emphasis on the for a while because
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:56.640]  the objective of these networks now is to control speech
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:02.800]  and control the reality creation that happens with the control of the word
[3:08:02.800 --> 3:08:08.160]  the spoken word and ultimately also the written word when you consider
[3:08:08.160 --> 3:08:13.840]  most of that digitized today but going back again historically what happened
[3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:17.280]  we got the freedom of information act which did a couple things that need to
[3:08:17.280 --> 3:08:20.560]  be changed in the 21st century it exempted private
[3:08:20.560 --> 3:08:23.280]  corporations from the freedom of information act
[3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:27.600]  and which meant all government contractors which now if you look at
[3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:31.200]  our government structure to hide to hide
[3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:35.040]  the bureaucracy is through contractors that are not subject to the freedom of
[3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:38.880]  information act of 1976 which came out of
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:43.440]  Watergate all right we need to go back revisit the act and have whistleblowing
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:47.200]  apply to private sector so we can find out what's
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:51.760]  going on within these organizations and people can be protected and when
[3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:55.600]  companies particularly go against the public good in the public will and
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:59.280]  civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:02.960]  freedom of the press by restraining and constraining the very
[3:09:02.960 --> 3:09:08.320]  tools of the 21st century that is a human rights violation
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:13.040]  ladies and gentlemen to silent speech is a human rights violation
[3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:17.600]  a fundamental violation to who we are as created human beings
[3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:22.400]  and the freedom of information act needs to be revised
[3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:26.000]  so that we can catch people doing things that are against
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:30.080]  yours and my interests you know because this is the problem
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:33.920]  transparency on cameras need to shift the other direction
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:37.440]  into government offices so we can see what's going on
[3:09:37.440 --> 3:09:41.200]  it's the public's business we ought to be able to look in and see what's
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:45.920]  happening there and we're not we're not permitted in fact
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:50.160]  we're given sound bites and bits and scraps of information
[3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.240]  that are pretty meaningless unless somebody goes out to aggregate
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:58.480]  which is what info wars does what drudge does and a number of others
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:04.480]  out there do and it's a threat it's not like you're creating news you're
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:07.360]  gathering the news and re-reporting it and gathering
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:11.680]  real information and reporting it and the implication of that is
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:17.200]  somehow that's disruptive to the social order well let me say this about free
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:20.320]  speech it will always be disruptive to
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:24.640]  social orders whether you're demonstrating in hong kong right now
[3:10:24.640 --> 3:10:31.120]  and thank god you can still um or in the us you know doing the
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:34.960]  things that you do to be heard but here's the point
[3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:38.720]  is should this happen within the context of violence
[3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:43.360]  i don't think so but what do you have when people start shutting down your
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.800]  ability to have a discourse a conversation that matters
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:50.240]  and that's where we are in the united states polarized to the point where the
[3:10:50.240 --> 3:10:54.800]  discourse is ended and that is a dangerous place to be
[3:10:54.800 --> 3:10:59.920]  and that is not american not foundational and not fundamental to who we are
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:04.560]  and is part of the technocracy's goal to divide and conquer
[3:11:04.560 --> 3:11:10.160]  the human soul and the human spirit by dividing us so violently on an emotional
[3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:13.600]  thrust and disengaging the intellect because as you
[3:11:13.600 --> 3:11:18.720]  start to disassemble and break down the debate and the
[3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:22.640]  arguments with facts you come to very different conclusions
[3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:27.760]  so going back to the cia and fbi they have a lot to hide because they've been
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:32.160]  the tools of political leadership in a way that
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:38.080]  has allowed them to fester to stay within these bureaucracies
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:45.040]  buried within those structures to really push the public agenda which is not
[3:11:45.040 --> 3:11:50.880]  i i say again is not um their role in fact there are laws specifically
[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:54.480]  forbidding federal employees from participating
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:12:00.240]  in those kinds of policy um action or trying to weigh in on regulation or
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:05.440]  weigh in on the law they're there to do what they're told
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:10.080]  and that is not how it functions um too much of that is the other way around
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:14.080]  so what donald trump is doing in disrupting the deep state is he has to
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:17.600]  reach down deep within these infrastructures and
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:24.080]  dislodge old thinking and in doing so you reveal the abuses
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:28.240]  and in finding those abuses you need to hold people accountable that have been
[3:12:28.240 --> 3:12:33.360]  in collusion in what is a real conspiracy under the law
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:37.040]  to take away this republic from those of us
[3:12:37.040 --> 3:12:40.720]  who are citizens here that represent that republic
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:44.000]  and that's what we're losing in all of this right now
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:49.360]  is first of all the word games and creating a narrative that they control
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:54.400]  and inflaming the public to engage only the emotional side of our character to
[3:12:54.400 --> 3:12:58.080]  the expense of our intellect this is not going to get us there
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:02.320]  there are real solutions there are real problems but the deep state does need
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:05.600]  to unraveled and the security agencies have been
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:09.600]  apart and parting i'm asking ukraine
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:15.600]  russia and china everybody uh to start blowing the whistle on corruption is
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:18.640]  the right thing because that's in the human beings interest
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:21.360]  no matter what country you live in in the world
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:24.480]  particularly the third world where it's still transacted and
[3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:28.640]  brown paper bags and our government and through them
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:32.320]  every one of us as citizens participated in that as our government
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  hands out black bags of money all over the world to gather influence
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:40.720]  and outcomes and black males people and kidnaps people and tortures people
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:45.360]  and i think don't donald trump is trying to get to the bottom of what allowed
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:49.360]  this government to reflect the american people
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:56.560]  in this way globally what has given them the authority to act in this way
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:04.080]  globally as felons all of those are felonious actions if you committed
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:07.680]  if you did either in the united states or abroad
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:11.440]  but not our government which represents who we are fundamentally
[3:14:11.440 --> 3:14:15.440]  i don't think so and that's why i'm glad someone is disrupting
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:19.360]  the deep state and i hope it continues band
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.160]  dot video check it out all of my stuff is there all of the other guys
[3:14:24.160 --> 3:14:30.720]  is there alexa stuff uh owens um everyone's and it's important
[3:14:30.720 --> 3:14:34.240]  uh to pass that on to others because that's the way this information gets
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:37.680]  out there um you know when i when i think about
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:42.320]  the possibilities too and this is where i remain the eternal optimist in all of
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:46.960]  this um and i joke about i say i'm a path i have a pathology you know and it's
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:50.560]  called a pathological optimist because i just can't give up
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:54.640]  um and i won't give up and and you know and and i think that's the character
[3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.200]  of those that listen to this network um and and who we are you know and
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:04.240]  and i volunteer my time once we come on do this with uh with the guys because
[3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:09.120]  it's important to me uh and i think it's important that we all
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:12.720]  support this network in some fashion um
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:16.080]  however we can even just passing it on to others is a great
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:19.520]  a way to start coming back in the next segment i want to
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:22.560]  break down the alternatives to possibilities the government's i always

[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:29.120]  and some of them we're doing right here in alaskan it's kind of the big

[3:20:13.280 --> 3:20:24.880]  with nick baggage and welcome back this october 4th uh
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:31.120]  2019 and it's a friday afternoon and um my part of the world approaching that
[3:20:31.120 --> 3:20:34.480]  anyway and uh you know when we're talking the last segment about
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:38.400]  sort of what's changed and what's under attack you know fundamental free speech
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:41.600]  is under attack um and we all have
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:44.720]  know that if we're tuned into this network
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:49.440]  but the idea of assembly uh think about this in the 21st century
[3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:55.040]  the town square as it was 250 years ago is way different today
[3:20:55.040 --> 3:20:59.280]  we're in the town square right now on the digital
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:04.800]  doorway of of how we function you know i mean this is the digital town square
[3:21:04.800 --> 3:21:08.800]  so it is our right to assemble here and have this conversation no matter how
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:12.960]  we're dialing into but the idea that those that control the
[3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:17.520]  airwaves which are public airwaves in the way we used to perceive them
[3:21:17.520 --> 3:21:22.880]  are now telling us whose voices get heard and how those voices are
[3:21:22.880 --> 3:21:27.440]  channeled through that network it's manipulated
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:31.440]  this is a fundamental affront to our right of assembly
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:35.360]  our right of free speech you know our our right to
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:39.440]  redress even our government in this town square because a lot of the
[3:21:39.440 --> 3:21:42.720]  conversations that happen throughout the internet
[3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:45.760]  is about our governments no matter where we live whether it's the united
[3:21:45.760 --> 3:21:49.360]  states canada uh great britain uh or wherever you're
[3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:54.800]  listening around the world the fact is our governments
[3:21:54.800 --> 3:21:58.960]  in cooperation with globalists and the world monitor
[3:21:58.960 --> 3:22:02.800]  monetary fund and others have manipulated
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:06.560]  our governments and thrown a cultural context
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:11.040]  on it and this is done through our what we're calling the deep state and what
[3:22:11.040 --> 3:22:16.400]  others call the bureaucracies that exist beyond the political leadership
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:20.800]  that have an agenda that go to the same meetings that cooperate with each other
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:23.920]  in the congress there's not a congressional office that doesn't have a
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:27.840]  deep insider embedded in it right out of the gate
[3:22:27.840 --> 3:22:33.120]  the gammals have them assigned when you arrive unless you're smart enough to resist
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:38.400]  so you actually invite them in uh and then they direct your show so much of
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:42.960]  the agenda is directed by staff and then under that is whole systems
[3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:46.400]  of bureaucracies and in some places even the
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:50.560]  legislators are developed out of those bureaucracies
[3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:54.080]  and then elected to office and even manipulated at a deeper and more
[3:22:54.080 --> 3:22:58.960]  fundamental basis but the idea of uh
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:04.960]  biden's son picking up 50 grand a month for a consulting gig
[3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:10.240]  come on folks are you believe that this is a way it also plays out there are a
[3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:12.720]  lot of ways this plays out and this is where again
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:17.200]  how do you uh police this in a way that's a rational and reasonable i think
[3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:21.440]  public disclosure is part of it let the public decide what's corrupt
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:25.920]  you know but let's find out the fact for sure i think we're entitled to that
[3:23:25.920 --> 3:23:30.640]  and the freedom of information act does not go far enough and the idea of
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:34.480]  keeping track of campaign contributes because back in the nixon era for those
[3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:38.400]  don't remember money was being literally handed off in bags
[3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:42.400]  you know an envelope hey you know here's the dough
[3:23:42.400 --> 3:23:45.760]  you know and it's and it happened then and so they created all these rules and
[3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:49.520]  regulations and committees and think about it
[3:23:49.520 --> 3:23:54.080]  now we have cool we have bribery by committee because the same effect is
[3:23:54.080 --> 3:23:57.680]  there you know the big contributors get the access the big contributors have
[3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:01.280]  lunch the big contributors win the game and the big
[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:04.960]  contributors then do these side deals like book publishing
[3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:08.160]  you know i was in the book business okay for a long time and here's how
[3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:11.760]  here's how some of that plays out look at who was on these boards of these big
[3:24:11.760 --> 3:24:16.240]  book book publishers and look how these boards interact with other corporate
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:20.160]  shells and then you'll find out that this is one of the games like the bernie
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:23.520]  sanders millions from his best-selling book
[3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:27.280]  why did you get that opportunity now you know a lot of these best-selling books
[3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:31.120]  don't sell you know new gingrich got a huge
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:35.120]  advance for his book but it only sold 10 000 copies and the rest were shredded
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:38.560]  up and sold as a refuse to a toilet paper company a lot of people don't
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:43.200]  remember that but that's what happened so big money goes in these advances but
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:47.120]  then when you look at the margins on book publishing today and book sales
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:51.040]  and then track that in actual numbers a lot of it doesn't make any economic
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:54.320]  sense at all it's like the poker game at the water
[3:24:54.320 --> 3:24:57.200]  gate you know there in washington dc where a lot of congressmen are seen
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:01.040]  coming and going they have friendly game of poker with a group of lobbyists
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:05.200]  except the congressman always wins isn't that odd he always wins you know
[3:25:05.200 --> 3:25:08.800]  lobbyists will fold on the full house you know and the law and the congressman
[3:25:08.800 --> 3:25:14.000]  will have a pair of twos and he'll always win and is that bribery or is that a
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:16.320]  good poker player jeez you know it would take a
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:21.280]  rocket scientist to figure this stuff out so take a look at where people's
[3:25:21.280 --> 3:25:25.600]  money comes from and how it flows and you learn a lot about them
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:28.640]  and i think that's part of the whole transparency thing that's why disclosure
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:32.400]  is required and then people can judge that you know did they come in a
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:36.160]  impoverished and go out billionaires you know like you know chasing a bunch of
[3:25:36.160 --> 3:25:40.000]  lawsuits out of the governor's office in arkansas on their way to the presidency
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  with not two nickels to rub together uh running billion dollar
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:47.760]  foundations after fact you know watch obama he'll do the same
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:51.360]  but look at the deals that are made up behind the scenes and you got to ask
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:57.520]  a question why shouldn't uh the standing executive
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:04.400]  take control of his administration and order the investigation of criminal
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:09.280]  activities by the previous group in power that's called accountability ladies
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.200]  and gentlemen that's why political power shifts from one part of the other so you
[3:26:13.200 --> 3:26:15.200]  can find out what's going on that's why there's
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:18.800]  supposed to be a two-party system not a one globalist system
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:23.280]  with two parties masquerading underneath that which is why donald
[3:26:23.280 --> 3:26:28.960]  trump eats 16 other republicans from the establishment which is why
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:33.520]  uh you see this mob approach to a lot of this stuff but look at where these
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:39.040]  people come from they're from the inside uh
[3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:43.360]  to tell us what's good for us and this is the problem they're shutting down our
[3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:46.800]  ability to have a conversation and the truth of the matter is
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:50.000]  in today's day and age you don't even have to escape the town square all you
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:52.800]  can do is change the channel turn off the electronic
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:26:56.320]  being you know you don't have to tolerate anything you don't have to accept
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:00.400]  anything um but somebody wants to tell you what to
[3:27:00.400 --> 3:27:04.400]  think is a problem and we need to think for ourselves we need to
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:08.320]  elevate who we are we need to begin a discourse
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:13.200]  that's based on a good sense so we got to keep pumping the information out
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:16.400]  uh through all the channels that are available to us so we can
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:20.080]  talk about that you know there's there's other ways to operate in government
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  you know here in alaska i was talking about the owner state now is walley
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:27.760]  hickles vision and what he said is that a lot of the public
[3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:32.240]  resource that we hold in common which you know which is what is true
[3:27:32.240 --> 3:27:36.160]  he looked at because he was a business guy very successful business guy here
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:41.040]  and he said hey that's the balance sheet that's where real wealth is stored it's
[3:27:41.040 --> 3:27:45.280]  not on your p&l the money in the money out your profit loss statement
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:49.280]  as businesses are operating this is a cash flow you know how the cash comes in
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:53.360]  and how the cash goes out and how we're sold on how our government operates
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:57.440]  right it's on the taxes in and the revenues out and we all fight over the
[3:27:57.440 --> 3:28:01.200]  tax and revenues out but the balance sheet
[3:28:01.200 --> 3:28:07.600]  the assets of the nation are what's been hijacked for 250 years
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:11.600]  and that's what we need to talk about because that's the bigger context
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:15.600]  of the charade of the deep state is to hijack the assets
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:19.760]  for that smaller and smaller 1000 families
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:24.560]  that control this planet's economies and this is the danger sign ladies and
[3:28:24.560 --> 3:28:27.440]  gentlemen because the looting of our national treasuries
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:30.960]  is what's been happening for 250 years in this country
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:35.200]  and for millennium in europe we're going to be right back after a few brief
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:39.120]  messages this is dr nick baggage shaking down the deep

[3:32:52.240 --> 3:33:02.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:02.240 --> 3:33:16.560]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[3:33:16.560 --> 3:33:22.800]  for your mind with nick baggage
[3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:26.240]  all right welcome back uh nick baggage from Alaska today
[3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:30.240]  you know what i'm i'm i want to talk about again the balance sheet versus
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:34.480]  the p&l statement how that all ties in again from from practical experience
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:38.080]  and and and there's a couple places that this makes sense when you think
[3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:41.120]  about the national resources you know there was a period of time
[3:33:41.120 --> 3:33:44.560]  the railroad barriers where they were given these huge right-of-ways to the
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:47.120]  country and then they were given a mile of
[3:33:47.120 --> 3:33:50.560]  property right on both sides of the railroad so they controlled everything
[3:33:50.560 --> 3:33:54.960]  that the grain elevators everything so they just screwed all the farmers all
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:59.360]  over the country tapped all the profits and all the
[3:33:59.360 --> 3:34:03.520]  labor of these people like slaves and the railroad barons that's why they
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:06.080]  called them railroad barons you know and these are the
[3:34:06.080 --> 3:34:10.000]  these are the guys who really object to the income tax because they were
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  screwing everybody you know and uh there were a lot of things going on
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:16.960]  you know but it was again the looting of um
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:20.240]  you know of the national resources you didn't even go back further you know
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:23.440]  you can go back to um the revolutionary war and the
[3:34:23.440 --> 3:34:26.320]  story of the continental's you know we paid everybody in
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:29.840]  continental's and there's old saying it's not worth the continental because
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:33.600]  after the after the war after the revolution they weren't worth anything
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:39.360]  well then a bunch of insiders speculators went around and bottom
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:43.360]  all up for a nickel and ten cents on the dollar from all these veterans who had
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:46.400]  risked their lives and had legs chopped off and everything fighting the
[3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:50.400]  british bottom all up and then the executive branch
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:53.760]  some years later like 20 years later you know as part of this
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:57.760]  ploy when they were buying all these up borrowed some money from france and
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:00.640]  gold and then they redeemed them all at 100 cents on the
[3:35:00.640 --> 3:35:05.840]  dollar and speculators on the backs of the revolutionary heroes
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:09.920]  stripped out the well once again you know and so i mean even when you think
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:15.360]  about the blood of our fallen stripped out the well from them just like so
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:18.800]  much cattle being bled before the slaughter you
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:24.000]  know i mean give me a break ladies and gentlemen
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:28.800]  but here in the rest of our world that we need to remember
[3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:32.320]  what's the balance sheet represented by in the united states and how do they
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:36.080]  used to operate with the balance sheet well it was land
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:41.040]  primarily natural resources and land and there was a process by which
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:46.400]  any citizen any american with an equal right to be an american
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:50.880]  you know that's all of us had the right to go out and stake
[3:35:50.880 --> 3:35:54.880]  four corners and later survey it and work it
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:35:59.520]  for seven years and he could get a homestead 160 acres of what was public
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:03.680]  land and made a private land based on the effort that person put in he had to
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:08.080]  build a home and make it work you know which
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:11.280]  you had to be an entrepreneur and you had to do all kinds of things make that
[3:36:11.280 --> 3:36:14.400]  work but you had the chance yet you had an ax and you had the will you could go
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:19.440]  do and they had homesteading they reduced it down to five acres i mean 160
[3:36:19.440 --> 3:36:23.280]  acre homesteads you could still get an alaskan the 1960s
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:26.320]  that's in my lifetime ladies and gentlemen it's you know we're still
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:31.200]  living in that generation thankfully uh and you know into the early 70s we could
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:35.520]  get five acre home sites um from the federal government on on
[3:36:35.520 --> 3:36:38.880]  public lands that wasn't national parts or preserves
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:42.560]  although there's a big question mark about that story for another day but
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:46.000]  when you look at the balance sheet of the nation
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:49.840]  which is the resources we hold in common
[3:36:49.840 --> 3:36:54.400]  this is a big number ladies and gentlemen now who gets to
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:36:58.400]  exploit those resources under what conditions today
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:02.640]  these are multinational companies and and global
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:07.440]  companies that are doing that now in alaska we have 18 percent of the entire
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:10.960]  land mass of the united states and we have about 700
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:14.560]  thousand people that live here okay so we're like a suburb of
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:19.200]  dallas or maybe austin you know we're small
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:24.000]  by population spread over this massive region
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:28.400]  that is the literal treasury of the nation
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:31.760]  and it's being looted right now by multinational corporations with an
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:35.200]  advantage well they have shut down the ability of
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:38.880]  most individuals to prospect in the richest parts of our
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:42.720]  state because they locked them up under a section called d2
[3:37:42.720 --> 3:37:48.480]  in the lands acts of the 1980s and tied up 104 million acres of public land
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:51.440]  that's now out of possibility of ever being
[3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:55.920]  advanced for development and a lot of this holds strategic minerals that we
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:38:00.160]  know that we import um predominantly from out of the country
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:05.280]  but still with the public lands that are left in alaska with our state land
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:09.680]  we created under what walley hickle visualized was an owner state a way of
[3:38:09.680 --> 3:38:13.760]  looking at it that was different we want to make those resources
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  produce something so in alaska we later under another republican governor
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:25.200]  um they formed the alaska permanent fund which is a fund that took 25 percent of
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:29.840]  all the oil wealth and put it in this sovereign wealth fund this wealth
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:32.640]  fund of the states called the permanent fund which now has
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:37.120]  somewhere around 60 70 billion dollars and it fluctuates a bit
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:41.280]  it's a vest in a lot of different things but you know compared to what norway
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:45.200]  did which is keep their resources and develop that part of the balance sheet
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:49.520]  by contracting the workout to shell and to others
[3:38:49.520 --> 3:38:53.600]  in their areas where they owned oil and gas
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:38:58.480]  off the shores and and by doing so what they did is they kept the wealth
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:03.120]  internalized and they have hundreds of um uh billions
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:08.880]  in norway so if you took the national wealth and managed it just a bit
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:13.200]  differently like what norway has done and what alaska is partially done i don't
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:17.520]  think completely enough but if you manage those resources
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:21.440]  they throw off a lot of money and here in alaska for instance
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:25.600]  we don't have a state income tax we don't have a state sales tax
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:30.240]  we don't have a state property tax we have some state excise tax you know like
[3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:35.840]  on gasoline and this kind of thing on cigarettes and alcohol and so on
[3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:39.360]  but as far as income no no some cities have a little bit of a
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:42.560]  sales tax cities have some property taxes burrows
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:46.720]  because we don't have counties here we have burrows they have some uh forms of
[3:39:46.720 --> 3:39:50.880]  property taxes generally but the point i'm making is
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:56.800]  government is supported here essentially out of taxes on our natural
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:00.880]  resources and revenue streams derived from our natural resources
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:04.720]  and part of that money is reinvested then in a fund that is
[3:40:04.720 --> 3:40:09.200]  uh a fund that offsets the cost of government and also throws off
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:14.400]  yesterday in alaska sixteen hundred and six dollars per person was distributed
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:19.760]  out of the excess of our earnings now let me say that again we have a
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:23.680]  governmental ask our state government runs by its revenue streams from its
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:27.600]  natural resources and its land base as opposed to
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:34.000]  taxing you or me actually because i live here uh but this is the point is
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:37.920]  there's enough here if it's not stolen and looted
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:42.160]  uh for uh the wrong purposes and there's a way to allocate for those that are
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:47.120]  willing to put their back into it some of those public lands and to go back to
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:50.720]  that again there's good reason for that other countries should be doing this
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:55.920]  this is a way to transfer resources in a in a rational way
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.600]  uh to individuals who are willing to do the work
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:03.120]  and develop something and make something and create something
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:07.440]  and that's the way it was done here uh for several hundred years
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:14.000]  and unfortunately they quit you know and and there's really room to
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.680]  not quit there may be some other ways to look at that in the 21st century and i
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:21.600]  think we should because the the government should not control
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:26.400]  all of the resources um in the way that it does and yet
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:30.720]  those that we hold in common ought to produce for us an optimum
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:34.480]  value and alaska state constitution actually requires
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:38.160]  that alaska's natural resources optimize value
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:42.000]  for the residents that live here and we also alaska have the
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:47.600]  the most powerful personal privacy provision of any state constitution
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:51.520]  in the united states in fact the u.s constitution
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:55.760]  doesn't have a strong language of privacy as what alaska has
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:42:01.360]  uh and these are important things because this is the last frontier in so many
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:04.640]  different ways and we can learn a lot from what we've
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:08.800]  experienced here because we learned from 200 years
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:12.800]  of america existing before there was statehood here
[3:42:12.800 --> 3:42:16.640]  and got to observe and and hopefully not make the same mistakes as other states
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:20.080]  have made but the globalists are here too and they've
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:23.760]  been here for a long time and they would like to loot this little
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:27.680]  island in the remote out back of the planet
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:31.200]  um they would like to take this resource
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:34.640]  and put it in their pockets at the at the expense
[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:39.280]  of most americans and this is a problem for you for me and for the rest of the
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:44.480]  world because it's the globalists that have destroyed the very fiber of
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:52.080]  freedom in the human soul this is dr nick pegge we'll be right back
[3:42:52.080 --> 3:42:56.240]  well the president came out this last wednesday and said there is an ongoing
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:42:59.360]  coup against me by the deep state they're not going to stop their ally with the
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:02.080]  communist chinese it's worse than i thought it's

[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:55.520]  the truth is president trump is the most investigated president in history
[3:43:55.520 --> 3:43:59.440]  he is working for american interests steadfastly
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:03.760]  he is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders
[3:44:03.760 --> 3:44:08.480]  bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist chinese control
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:11.280]  who now own hollywood and the majority of our debt
[3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:14.640]  we have been maneuvered towards a collapse in bankruptcy
[3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:18.880]  but at the 11th hour 58th minute the american people put a populist
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:21.680]  in power and it's happening all over the world
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:26.160]  so great things are happening but the enemy is striking back they're very

[3:45:57.600 --> 3:46:01.760]  and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms and now
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:06.400]  buddha judge has come out and said that it's about political power
[3:46:06.400 --> 3:46:10.080]  that's why they want the guns well finally they're being honest
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:13.600]  because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:16.560]  so now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:20.080]  it shows what incredible followers these people are the globalists

[3:46:27.120 --> 3:46:30.640]  that civil war but it's up to us to understand the big picture
[3:46:30.640 --> 3:46:34.560]  to carry the fight to the enemy and the information war before they can kick

[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:31.440]  down and off to make all this possible from my home in anchorage alaska you know
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:37.440]  when when i think about all this stuff uh and i i ask people you know send me notes every
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:42.480]  once while i always appreciate that um if it's a note for the networks and the network
[3:47:42.480 --> 3:47:46.320]  you have something personally for me that you want me to think about i appreciate that i don't
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:52.000]  take uh callers i haven't uh yet and rate mainly because there's just never enough time to even
[3:47:52.000 --> 3:47:58.800]  cover what i want to cover uh in an hour a week so um earth pulse dot com that's my website you're
[3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:05.520]  welcome to go there earth pulse e a r t h p u l s e earth pulse dot com i i almost always forget
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:10.160]  to mention it and people say you got to mention your website so there it is uh now that's out of
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:14.720]  the way i want to go back into the topics because one of the some of the feedback i've gotten
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:21.120]  that people appreciate is um the angle of solution because that's really where we have the rubber
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:25.520]  meets the road we all get upset about all different things for all different reasons
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:29.360]  but but how do we solve it you know what are the things that we could be doing differently
[3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:35.120]  when i think about um the balance sheet of the nation first of all thinking about the
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:39.920]  balance sheet of the nation that's a good start you know start to think about what we own in common
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:45.600]  and how are those resources producing for us in the most efficient way and and actually people
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:50.880]  don't see it in the big mainstream nationals but donald trump has been opening up the north
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:58.320]  slope of alaska to oil exploration and leasing this is uh fundamentally critical uh to alaskans
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:03.920]  into the nation to be energy independent and hydrocarbons uh are where it's at right now and
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:09.920]  where it's going to be for um quite quite some time and and the association of hydrocarbons
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:18.320]  with climate change um i would argue uh another day uh how deep that association is and actually
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:24.240]  um how much of a fallacy that is but i don't want to go there today i don't have enough time i i want
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:30.800]  to continue this discussion about the deep state and where it starts because um where i started
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:36.160]  when i started looking at government where where did i want to serve because that's how i approached
[3:49:36.160 --> 3:49:43.680]  it and i decided i would work in uh public education back uh now uh 30 years ago and and when i did i
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:48.320]  worked for 10 years for decade and during that decade i worked in the anchorage school district
[3:49:48.320 --> 3:49:55.680]  which educates about 40 percent of alaska's kids um i was president i became president at 26 of the
[3:49:55.680 --> 3:50:00.880]  alaska uh anchorage council of education and we later affiliated with the american federation
[3:50:00.880 --> 3:50:06.320]  of teachers and the alaska federation of teachers and and then i was elected statewide president
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:11.680]  a couple of times and vice president political affairs a couple of times um on the state level
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:17.680]  and i got involved in all aspects of public education in lots of different ways and after
[3:50:17.680 --> 3:50:25.440]  10 years my conclusion and the only uh president of a of a nationally recognized statewide teachers
[3:50:25.440 --> 3:50:33.920]  union i decided that the only real solutions for public education was in fact parental choice
[3:50:33.920 --> 3:50:40.000]  what some people call vouchers but vouchers got kind of a bad name so today i'm going to change
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:44.640]  you the narrative and let's call that parental choice all right because i think that's more
[3:50:44.640 --> 3:50:50.960]  accurate as to what it is it's about the right of parents to choose whether the state
[3:50:52.080 --> 3:50:59.760]  feeds the data into your kid's brain or you do and fundamentally i think this is our right as
[3:50:59.760 --> 3:51:07.200]  parents to control the data feed in our kid's head starting with the allocation of public funds
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:11.760]  so we can decide how those funds are spent now the first argument i always heard was
[3:51:11.760 --> 3:51:21.680]  religious objection now this is a fertilizer commonly called bs argument because federal funds
[3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:27.040]  flow in the form of student loans to georgetown university which is a catholic university
[3:51:27.600 --> 3:51:33.840]  brigham young which is a mormon university baler which is a baptist university and nobody
[3:51:33.840 --> 3:51:39.920]  gets in the way of student loan programs feeding those institutions that have a religious slant
[3:51:40.800 --> 3:51:46.000]  no matter how you want to argue about how they projected in the work but that's the point is
[3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:53.120]  parental choice give the grant to a parent and ask them where will you spend your money and the
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:59.200]  game will become competitive and then the data feed into kids heads becomes different now think
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:05.920]  about this from this standpoint and again speaking as someone who represented teachers around alaska
[3:52:05.920 --> 3:52:12.000]  and a lot of teachers who get very angry because i'm saying this um but the fact is teachers would
[3:52:12.000 --> 3:52:18.400]  do a better job without the bureaucracy restraining in the way that it does because there's a lot of
[3:52:18.400 --> 3:52:24.800]  really good gifted teachers and i was fortunate enough to have many of them and what i can say
[3:52:24.800 --> 3:52:32.640]  about that is in anchorage alaska around 12 000 a year in public money goes through the operating
[3:52:32.640 --> 3:52:38.240]  budget kids now that doesn't include the capital budget for buildings it doesn't include the special
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:44.240]  ed budget for special needs kids or transportation budgets or student nutrition budgets just the
[3:52:44.240 --> 3:52:49.760]  core is about 12 grand per kid and in a high school class in anchorage there's 30 kids to a
[3:52:49.760 --> 3:52:57.200]  classroom which breaks out to 360 000 per classroom for nine month school year and i would ask
[3:52:57.200 --> 3:53:01.520]  everyone in anchorage are you getting your money's worth and i would ring the bell for anyone that
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:09.600]  says yes to that because you're not you're not getting 360 000 with the value out of each classroom
[3:53:10.400 --> 3:53:15.520]  maybe you are in the way the money spreads around the community and rolls over three or four times
[3:53:15.520 --> 3:53:21.040]  but it's pretty inefficiently done that same money i think would go a lot further distance and you
[3:53:21.040 --> 3:53:27.440]  could still allocate an additional allocation for special needs kids because i mean you do need to
[3:53:27.440 --> 3:53:33.120]  serve that community of interest that they need that you could still have a student nutrition
[3:53:33.120 --> 3:53:38.560]  program where in alaska in anchorage 25 30 percent of the kids at elementary are on a
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:43.600]  free or reduced lunch because they're in poverty for god's sake you know i can we still meet that
[3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:49.120]  challenge i think we probably can actually and the transportation challenge in anchorage you
[3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:54.800]  could damn near put four kids in a taxi cab and do it for less expense than how many kids are
[3:53:54.800 --> 3:54:01.120]  actually transported on buses in our in our communities the point i'm making is that once
[3:54:01.120 --> 3:54:07.840]  again a lot of money is spent in a monopoly in a monopolistic situation that deals with the
[3:54:07.840 --> 3:54:16.960]  the beginning of what begins a free democratic republic like ours which is an educated public
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:23.520]  but when there's a monopoly on what the data feed is we have a fundamental problem and this
[3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:29.280]  is where it starts so reform and education is supposed to be a platform plank of the republican
[3:54:29.280 --> 3:54:35.600]  party and they run our legislature and our state government for years and they haven't put one bill
[3:54:35.600 --> 3:54:45.920]  forward so is it real or is it bs i think it's bs and i'm calling bs uh on all of this because
[3:54:45.920 --> 3:54:52.960]  every one of these people won't take the challenge won't do it won't give parents that fundamental
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:55:00.320]  right back educate your kids and this is where the power is ladies and gentlemen because look
[3:55:00.320 --> 3:55:06.240]  what's happening with the generation we see right now the entitlement generation where
[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:12.560]  everybody wins a trophy give me a break because as soon as they realize it isn't the way they
[3:55:12.560 --> 3:55:19.040]  that it works it's going to be way too late in their evolution and development as young people
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:26.080]  who are going to inherit this republic so education is foundational fundamental and public
[3:55:26.080 --> 3:55:30.320]  education is not something goes back to the founding fathers ladies and gentlemen it's a
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:37.760]  phenomena of the last century in the 1920s and 30s is where that got formulated and created and it
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:45.200]  happened um from the bottom up um primarily from the poor wanting a chance for the next generation
[3:55:45.200 --> 3:55:52.240]  and so they built the schools they funded the schools they were one room school houses before
[3:55:52.240 --> 3:55:57.600]  that the very first institutions in Alaska government were school districts when it was all
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:04.160]  federalized and there was no source of revenue to create schools it was that and it was a fish tax
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:09.440]  that paid for it a three percent fish tax that paid for that again natural resource driven
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:16.560]  no we used to drive all of our revenues to run this country from uh import and export taxes
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:23.920]  guess what we're generating a lot of money now uh from order to affect our industries and you
[3:56:23.920 --> 3:56:28.640]  know and i think there's a balance in all of this and the balance um has been out of balance for
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:35.360]  too long because the globalists are deconstructing every civil society no matter where you live in
[3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:41.200]  the world and they're doing it wherever you're listening to this broadcast right now in a cultural
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:51.920]  context for you whether you're a muslim hindu christian jew uh doesn't matter muslim doesn't matter
[3:56:51.920 --> 3:56:59.200]  they give you a narrative that will fit your cultural context as they loot your nation because
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:06.240]  that's what's happening that thousand families that own it all want it all and and it doesn't
[3:57:06.240 --> 3:57:12.560]  have to be that way and i'm not talking about um a disproportionate anything i'm talking about
[3:57:12.560 --> 3:57:17.200]  transparency and how government really works it should serve us all not the elites not the
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:22.720]  globalists our governments are being hijacked it's time to take them back take them back with
[3:57:22.720 --> 3:57:30.240]  the power of information and pass on the info wars dot com that's where the information is
[3:57:30.240 --> 3:57:35.520]  that's where the revolution begins remember you're the tip of the sphere have a great weekend this
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:39.840]  has been dr nick caggis signing off on this friday afternoon
