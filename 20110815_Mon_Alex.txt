[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.040]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.040 --> 00:30.320]  I want to thank all of you for joining us today it's gonna be an absolutely a
[00:30.320 --> 00:33.800]  jam-packed transmission we're gonna be live here for at least the next three
[00:33.800 --> 00:42.440]  hours it is the 15th day of August 2011 on this Monday edition and boy am I
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.600]  glad to be here I took off yesterday had an excellent rebroadcast some of it
[00:48.600 --> 00:55.280]  segments of our new info wars special reports that we're doing multiple times
[00:55.280 --> 01:00.280]  a week at prison planet TV so in a way it wasn't a rebroadcast because much of
[01:00.280 --> 01:05.040]  yesterday's show had never been broadcast at all but I almost called my
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.920]  producers and crew and came in yesterday but I controlled myself and
[01:09.920 --> 01:16.480]  didn't we have a very full plate of key information ahead of us but the world is
[01:16.480 --> 01:20.640]  awakening just because you're awake doesn't mean that you know exactly
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.360]  where you're at but it gives us that are awake a lot more than the general
[01:25.360 --> 01:32.000]  public a chance to show them and illustrate to them historically what's
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.960]  happening in its current context so we have masses of news we're going to
[01:37.960 --> 01:43.640]  obviously be breaking down here coming up in the next segment and we have no
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.600]  guest today I told Jaren and others I don't want any guest I want to be able
[01:49.600 --> 01:56.120]  to cover the news and take your phone calls on a host of issues number one
[01:56.120 --> 02:01.240]  the system is running scared of Ron Paul and admits that they are censoring him
[02:01.240 --> 02:05.960]  in fact I saw it this morning and forgot to send it to Jaren and I forget the
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.320]  exact headline but we're gonna dig it up once I can't find something I start
[02:10.320 --> 02:14.040]  obsessing on it only had about five minutes try to find it before showtime it
[02:14.040 --> 02:20.360]  was a politico headline and it oh Jaren says he did find it I don't know how you
[02:20.360 --> 02:26.040]  did that so quickly Jaren oh here it is Tim Palente Michelle Bachman clash at
[02:26.040 --> 02:32.480]  Republican debate and that's you found one of them but that's not it it was a
[02:32.480 --> 02:43.880]  politico headline that basically said Bachman Palente you know come out as top
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.680]  contenders at debate and then it just doesn't even mention Ron Paul that only
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.640]  lost by a couple hundred points a couple hundred votes and now it's admitted
[02:52.640 --> 02:59.880]  that Michelle Bachman bought 4,000 votes that's admitted and so Ron Paul lost by
[02:59.880 --> 03:06.040]  well some estimates are 216 others 152 but the point is there's also hundreds
[03:06.040 --> 03:09.960]  and hundreds of votes that came up missing and then you add to that that
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.880]  Bachman bought thousands of the tickets actually paid people something Ron Paul
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.560]  did not do Ron Paul told his supporters to come there and buy tickets if they
[03:19.560 --> 03:22.480]  believed that even that's all part of the straw polls to show who has the
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.760]  interest but clearly with all of her money and establishment backing the
[03:26.760 --> 03:33.080]  former IRS attack dog enforcer who supports secret arrest of citizens and
[03:33.080 --> 03:39.600]  secret execution of Americans hey if you like her why not like Joseph Stalin I
[03:39.600 --> 03:46.680]  know I know she's a lot cuter than Ron Paul but and I know Rick Perry's got
[03:46.680 --> 03:51.040]  better hair than Ron Paul but well the point is when I come back from break I'm
[03:51.040 --> 03:59.760]  gonna start my engines and go over all of this today also in financial news why
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.600]  is George Soros selling gold and buying farmland that's up on info wars.com
[04:05.600 --> 04:11.440]  from Mike Adams at natural news we have a lot of other bizarre information like
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.560]  Crudman calls on government to manufacture war to save economy and it was
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.360]  a very bizarre for those that aren't informed a statement by Crugman we're
[04:24.360 --> 04:30.040]  gonna play that clip coming up amidst alien invasion rant many missed the
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.320]  point that New York Times Economist was advocating a stage crisis so we're gonna
[04:34.320 --> 04:42.520]  be going over that as well Rick Perry has changed his mind on HPV executive
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.120]  order that killed so many people in Maine so many others well he's a day late

[04:56.960 --> 05:00.080]  them there's no doubting that when he knew it was killing people with a ride

[08:09.760 --> 08:13.200]  GCN radio network
[08:13.200 --> 08:28.760]  it is Monday the 15th day of August 2011 we're going to be live here for the
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.240]  next three hours we're going to cover the entire waterfront of key news and
[08:33.240 --> 08:39.160]  information your phone calls Rick Perry throwing his hat in the 2012 presidential
[08:39.160 --> 08:45.280]  ring the mainstream media admitting that they are ignoring Ron Paul and running
[08:45.280 --> 08:50.600]  scared from him I will get into all the latest military news US and NATO
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.480]  arming Syrian opposition we knew that months ago but now it's confirmed
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.440]  planning military strike big victories by Muammar Gaddafi now four months into
[09:00.440 --> 09:07.160]  fighting US and NATO backed al Qaeda forces of course you know Friday the
[09:07.160 --> 09:11.480]  federal government working with the state and city government on San
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.840]  Francisco shut down cell phones in much of the city to quote block a peaceful
[09:15.840 --> 09:21.360]  protest even the Associated Press is calling this Orwellian today Curt
[09:21.360 --> 09:25.520]  Nemo I had the first big report out on Friday and then again Sunday anonymous
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.440]  announces Bart cyber attack after cell phones shut down that is all coming up
[09:31.440 --> 09:37.520]  as well but I also want to talk today about positive things that are happening
[09:37.520 --> 09:43.680]  and I'm going to do that at the start of the second hour and in fact I'm going to
[09:43.680 --> 09:51.720]  write a note here positive things because as bad as a lot of things are in
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.520]  this world it always takes things getting bad before people decide to
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.400]  rediscover liberty and before the average man or woman decides to get up off
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.800]  their rumpus and to believe in themselves and to believe that they can
[10:07.800 --> 10:14.560]  affect change it takes tyranny to get people to start valuing liberty see we
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.920]  go in cycles and the founding fathers talked a lot about this many historians
[10:17.920 --> 10:24.120]  have talked about it that you become decadent because your society is wealthy
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.640]  then corruption comes in then hardcore corruption sets in then tyranny gets into
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.320]  place and then people struggle against it and regain their liberty and value it
[10:35.320 --> 10:41.320]  and then incredible prosperity begins again and then slowly corruption creeps
[10:41.320 --> 10:45.720]  back in the prosperity goes away the freedom goes away tyranny comes in the
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.400]  people stand up again and then once they have liberty and once people are
[10:49.400 --> 10:54.920]  moral then the blessings of freedom come back the prosperity comes back and then
[10:54.920 --> 10:58.520]  the children and grandchildren become decadent again and the cycle continues
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.640]  itself over and over and over again so I'm going to be talking about some of
[11:03.640 --> 11:07.920]  the positive things that are going on in this world when we start the second
[11:07.920 --> 11:15.520]  hour today by the way in the last month I've had radio station managers and
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.480]  owners call us this has been happening for years and they say yeah we we we just
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.560]  got the arbitration ratings or we just got the instant people meter systems
[11:26.560 --> 11:29.960]  that are even better we do even better on those because it's not just off
[11:29.960 --> 11:34.840]  establishment long-term name recognition and laziness people just filling out the
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.120]  diaries it there's a system in the car that you would read a put in that
[11:38.120 --> 11:43.640]  actually tracks what you're listening to and Genesis is a great network Ted
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.880]  Anderson is a wonderful person he never sensors me never tells me what to do but
[11:48.880 --> 11:55.600]  and we've been successful because we're not establishment radio by the book but
[11:55.600 --> 12:01.040]  over the years little bitty stations outside big markets because the big
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.640]  monopolies there's only really two big companies own most the big stations and
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.920]  cities so even if you get good ratings and huge listenerships you usually can't
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.480]  get on those big marquee stations because the the syndicators also own the
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.720]  stations one of the big names obviously is clear channel and so over the years
[12:20.720 --> 12:27.400]  we'll go on stations say 500 watt thousand watt stations outside cities
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.800]  like Knoxville is one example and a station will go from almost no ratings
[12:32.800 --> 12:38.280]  to a year later doubling a year after that quadrupling in the time slot I'm in
[12:38.280 --> 12:45.240]  big audience for little bitty stations but WBCR is an example but then over the
[12:45.240 --> 12:51.080]  years I've been able to get on big stations in big cities but it's it's
[12:51.080 --> 12:57.360]  always the same you know the the the station owner or manager calls up and
[12:57.360 --> 13:01.600]  says yeah I got this from the local station or I got this from another
[13:01.600 --> 13:09.040]  network but just you know thought I wanted to you know let you know you know
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.840]  how high your ratings are but the way Arbitron and instant people meters work
[13:13.840 --> 13:19.120]  if you're not subscribing to it until it gets published in a newspaper you're
[13:19.120 --> 13:26.400]  not supposed to talk about it and so it is a big dirty secret in talk radio that
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.960]  everywhere I'm put in a market even on a smaller station I will defeat everyone
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.840]  and I just gotten the last month I don't know two different stations that came in
[13:36.840 --> 13:45.120]  one of them is in a top 20 market up against Rush Limbaugh one station went
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.920]  from what number six to number one number one I was on the station two
[13:52.920 --> 13:58.040]  months and in two months the station went from way down the rankings to number
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.280]  one against Rush Limbaugh and I'm just gonna have Ted get with the ad agencies
[14:02.280 --> 14:05.680]  and get the numbers ourselves because Ted's a great guy but I'm even doing
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.920]  this on air so that it becomes a larger issue so that we actually act like a
[14:10.920 --> 14:18.000]  radio network and get the ratings and the fact that that's the holy grail of
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.200]  talk radio it's the holy grail of radio that you have a talk show host that you
[14:28.200 --> 14:35.080]  can take and put on a smaller station and in a matter of months go from nowhere
[14:35.080 --> 14:41.840]  to number one that is the holy grail of talk radio and that's the reason that
[14:41.840 --> 14:47.960]  talk radio network the second biggest network out there records my show every
[14:47.960 --> 14:51.320]  single day and has it sent to executives I have that from inside talk radio
[14:51.320 --> 14:55.320]  network they syndicate folks like Savage and others the truth is I will
[14:55.320 --> 14:59.840]  dominate and I will beat and I will annihilate in the ratings anybody that I
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.000]  go up against if I can be put in the NASCAR I can take the junkiest car on
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.960]  the track with the least amount of money in it every time if you let me on the
[15:09.960 --> 15:18.360]  track if you put me on the track I will dominate but I have to be allowed on the
[15:18.360 --> 15:25.120]  track and basically what happens is for 15 16 years I've been winning every
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.520]  time I'm let on the track and the establishment is all fully aware of
[15:28.520 --> 15:31.480]  this and the radio executives and consultants are all aware of it but it's
[15:31.480 --> 15:39.560]  a big secret and Genesis just can't sit there and count on the fact that this is
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.720]  known in the industry we have to get this information to the radio stations in
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.080]  the markets out there so that I can reach more people they can try to save
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.680]  this country there's no doubt if I was on 650 radio stations like Rush Limbaugh
[15:52.680 --> 15:58.280]  we would turn this country around in one month there's absolutely no doubt of
[15:58.280 --> 16:02.760]  it and I just start thinking back over the years when I was on KJFK here in
[16:02.760 --> 16:09.280]  Austin back when it was talk radio they were paying $300,000 a year you have to
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.680]  pay to get Howard Stern on one of the only shows you can actually pay for the
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.960]  others you all share radio spots with them networking local spots they were
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.480]  paying 300 something thousand I forget the exact numbers over 300,000 to him
[16:22.480 --> 16:28.560]  plus he got part of the commercials and in 96 they put me on on a Saturday night
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.600]  and six months later it was one of the highest rated shows in that slot number
[16:31.600 --> 16:35.320]  one and talk radio it was beaten by the music some of the books came out later
[16:35.320 --> 16:40.280]  and I was beating everything in town number one not just in one or two key
[16:40.280 --> 16:43.240]  demographics but across the board so they said well we better put you on
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.080]  Sunday too you know since people like you then I will give you a weeknight show
[16:47.080 --> 16:52.440]  seven to nine o'clock and when I wasn't preempted by sports we shot up very high
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.440]  number two number three every book and every demographic and here I was in
[16:56.440 --> 17:02.280]  many demographics beating Howard Stern who was on in the morning now then the
[17:02.280 --> 17:07.480]  two radio guys had had left to go on to better pastures who had hired me at that
[17:07.480 --> 17:12.800]  station from watching me on access TV and they brought in some guys who never
[17:12.800 --> 17:16.200]  really worked much in radio and they got very upset by my ratings they got very
[17:16.200 --> 17:19.320]  threatened by it and basically said you're gonna stop talking bad about the
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.640]  government or you're fired and I said I can't do that so they fired me I don't
[17:23.640 --> 17:28.920]  know it was six weeks later or so and really enjoyed themselves and said you're
[17:28.920 --> 17:33.800]  out of radio haha and I laughed at them I said I'm doing a show already for my
[17:33.800 --> 17:37.320]  house and ISDN on more than 10 stations they said no you're not you liar
[17:37.320 --> 17:44.080]  you're not on the radio and I've always had to deal with this that I don't exist
[17:44.080 --> 17:48.520]  and that I don't dominate and that we're not number one I am number one and you
[17:48.520 --> 17:53.480]  put me up against anybody on a frequency even half as powerful within six months
[17:53.480 --> 17:59.840]  to a year I will be number one period anywhere you put me on the radio and you
[17:59.840 --> 18:03.760]  know why because people even if they're dumbed down have good instincts good guts
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.640]  and anybody listening to this radio show in your gut knows I'm absolutely a
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.040]  hundred percent hardcore real and there's no teleprompters here and I
[18:12.040 --> 18:16.640]  believe exactly what I say and I do what I say I'm gonna do and that's what
[18:16.640 --> 18:22.480]  people want and it's a parallel to Ron Paul he's one number one in New Hampshire
[18:22.480 --> 18:27.400]  number two in the Iowa straw poll winning all the other major scientific
[18:27.400 --> 18:31.480]  polls number one number two or number three has massive support every
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.480]  political analyst that's been honest said for two years he's the only guy that
[18:35.480 --> 18:42.480]  can beat Barack Obama the Republican leadership is a complete joke and what
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.920]  happened last Friday after he won the debate hands down in Iowa totally
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.320]  dominated it had the people standing ovations the talk show questioners the
[18:53.320 --> 18:58.180]  the host of the show were attacking Paul all the other political hyenas were
[18:58.180 --> 19:01.520]  attacking the lion out there and everybody saw it and so what happened
[19:01.520 --> 19:07.640]  Friday all the big neocon talk show host came out and literally attacked Ron
[19:07.640 --> 19:12.240]  Paul and said he was basically the devil and would destroy America when they're
[19:12.240 --> 19:17.920]  the people that ensured that mainline rhinos who are for carbon taxes big
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.600]  government all these wars torture into the bill of rights warrantless
[19:21.600 --> 19:26.120]  wiretapping you guys have made sure that they stayed in power and that was no
[19:26.120 --> 19:29.920]  real challenger to Barack Obama so he could get in power and here's Ron Paul
[19:29.920 --> 19:33.800]  right about everything across the board never compromised the same yesterday
[19:33.800 --> 19:39.240]  today and tomorrow and here you are coming out and going after him joining
[19:39.240 --> 19:44.480]  CNN and others saying Ron Paul can't win putting out that false mantra it's the
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.440]  same thing you give Ron Paul a fair shake you you you you line him up with
[19:49.440 --> 19:53.360]  the rest of the horses he will absolutely stomp every one of them into
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.960]  the ground just like I will because it's not Ron Paul it's not Alex Jones it's

[24:20.520 --> 24:27.720]  number out to take your calls but nobody out there and talk radio wants to go up
[24:27.720 --> 24:31.920]  against Rush Limbaugh I didn't want to go up against Rush Limbaugh I wasn't even
[24:31.920 --> 24:38.440]  thinking about Rush Limbaugh 14 years ago when Ted Anderson said you're doing
[24:38.440 --> 24:44.400]  this nighttime show on my little radio network but wouldn't you like to do a
[24:44.400 --> 24:52.600]  daytime show 11 to 2 I said isn't that Rush Limbaugh slot and he said yeah but
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.440]  there's some smaller stations out there that you know that can't get him on
[24:55.440 --> 25:01.200]  their station so why don't you fill that slot and I said okay I'll do it and so
[25:01.200 --> 25:05.720]  for a couple years I did the nighttime show and the daytime show six hours a
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.560]  day but the daytime show did grow up to be a lot bigger so here we are many
[25:10.560 --> 25:15.920]  years later so I never looked to challenge Rush Limbaugh I never thought
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.840]  magically that if I was in Rush Limbaugh's slot I would beat him when I
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.680]  would had a chance to be put on the field with him and I don't have a hatred
[25:25.680 --> 25:32.160]  for Rush Limbaugh I think Rush Limbaugh was a gateway I remember being in high
[25:32.160 --> 25:38.840]  school and college and listening to him and agreeing in the principles of
[25:38.840 --> 25:45.520]  liberty and freedom and the Second Amendment and national sovereignty but
[25:45.520 --> 25:48.560]  I grew out of Limbaugh very very quickly I learned that environmentalists aren't
[25:48.560 --> 25:55.000]  wackos they're hardcore banker run consolidators to sell everyone on guilt
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.360]  so that we'll give up our liberty our freedom our private property I learned
[25:59.360 --> 26:03.480]  that big mega corporations were behind the environmental movement to control
[26:03.480 --> 26:06.840]  government and then have government shut down their competition so only they
[26:06.840 --> 26:16.600]  could operate they were monopoly men and so I'm not up here going you know
[26:16.600 --> 26:20.600]  anywhere they put me up against Limbaugh I absolutely completely dominating and
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.240]  Ted by the way has now gotten those numbers they're gonna put a press
[26:23.240 --> 26:27.480]  release out on it soon and it's not the first time this has happened anytime I
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.280]  put in the same market with Rush Limbaugh I will take stations that aren't
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.080]  even showing up in the ratings and I will take the show to number one it
[26:35.080 --> 26:38.600]  normally takes six months to a year I've done it in a major market in two
[26:38.600 --> 26:46.040]  stinking months and you know why you know why because they've put in the
[26:46.040 --> 26:50.920]  instant people meters that actually show who's being listened to and it's a lot
[26:50.920 --> 26:56.920]  harder to game those and here's my problem with Rush Limbaugh Rush Limbaugh
[26:56.920 --> 27:00.920]  talks all day about the free market but he doesn't talk about how the mega
[27:00.920 --> 27:04.760]  federal reserve that he supports and defends over the years is a giant
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.360]  monopoly over the issuance of currency and credit he doesn't talk about how he
[27:08.360 --> 27:13.960]  works for a group that tries to set up radio monopolies who actually shut
[27:13.960 --> 27:21.160]  out competition the truth is I will absolutely defeat Rush Limbaugh any time
[27:21.160 --> 27:26.160]  they let me in the ring with him okay he can wear brass knuckles I'll wear
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.520]  gloves I will clean the floor with him you can tie one of my arms behind my
[27:31.520 --> 27:37.600]  back literally and give him a baseball bat I will destroy him now I don't want
[27:37.600 --> 27:42.360]  to destroy Rush Limbaugh he's already done a pretty good job of that taking so
[27:42.360 --> 27:47.800]  many pills he went deaf that's what that OxyContin does that guy's a cyborg I
[27:47.800 --> 27:55.440]  feel sorry for him I want to get America back I want my Republic back I want my
[27:55.440 --> 28:00.720]  Bill of Rights and Constitution back that's what I want I could care less at
[28:00.720 --> 28:08.400]  the end of the day to say man I'm the most hard-hitting hard-core truly cutting
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.440]  edge radio host that's hit this country in decades you think I like that no I
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.200]  don't like the responsibility of having to get up here and realize millions of
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.600]  people are listening to me this is a mission this is not entertainment this
[28:22.600 --> 28:28.960]  is not about being a big personality this isn't about living in 30 million
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.480]  dollar houses or flying around on private jets this is about defending the
[28:34.480 --> 28:39.520]  Republic from enemies foreign and domestic and I remember multiple top
[28:39.520 --> 28:44.440]  radio executives a decade ago and seven years ago always the same the same
[28:44.440 --> 28:49.200]  speech Alex do you want to go on this crusade that's leading nowhere or do you
[28:49.200 --> 28:57.320]  want to be a star be a mainline Republican join us you'll get a TV show

[29:01.400 --> 29:07.160]  those big networks know it they couldn't believe that they couldn't buy me for
[29:07.160 --> 29:13.160]  30 pieces of silver what is 30 pieces of silver worth if you don't have a
[29:13.160 --> 29:17.520]  country or a second amendment and if a bureaucrat can come to your house and
[29:17.520 --> 29:24.720]  boss you around or take your children for no reason in fact I didn't even have
[29:24.720 --> 29:30.880]  a choice there's no choice at all what would it profit a man to gain the whole
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.400]  world and lose his soul you know that parable you go to somebody and sell give
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.040]  you a million bucks to give me your eyes no way no way well why would you take a
[29:38.040 --> 29:44.400]  million bucks to sell who you are to sell your soul huh see I can't be bought
[29:44.400 --> 29:49.520]  and I can't be threatened and people know it and I'm only an example how we're

[33:27.480 --> 33:35.360]  up from nowhere I didn't have some giant defense contractor 25 years ago when
[33:35.360 --> 33:41.840]  AM radio was completely dying get behind me and and pay to get me on dozens of
[33:41.840 --> 33:47.160]  stations to get ratings and then expand talk radio across the nation oh and
[33:47.160 --> 33:51.920]  make no mistake it was a major defense contractors and rush limbaugh that saved
[33:51.920 --> 33:59.160]  AM radio AM radio would not even exist today as we know it if it wasn't for
[33:59.160 --> 34:04.720]  rush limbaugh so let's give him his due and and this is something that's in the
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.080]  way way back burner of my brain the fact that anytime I'm put up against rush
[34:10.080 --> 34:15.920]  limbaugh or anybody else I absolutely dominate them people are like well then
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.720]  give us these ratings numbers let me explain you talk radio whenever Ted
[34:20.720 --> 34:25.480]  wants to get the ratings he has to go out to the big consortiums and pay to see
[34:25.480 --> 34:29.560]  them do you think the TV networks just get to see the Nielsen ratings for
[34:29.560 --> 34:33.760]  nothing you think Nielsen does that for free goes out and gathers that data no
[34:33.760 --> 34:36.720]  you have to pay for it and a hefty sum Ted just came in my ear during the
[34:36.720 --> 34:41.120]  break you said yes yes we were already on that we already we already have the
[34:41.120 --> 34:45.560]  numbers I got a bunch of cities for you well then why is it my show being
[34:45.560 --> 34:51.400]  promoted because I talk about 9-11 being an inside job because I'm not some
[34:51.400 --> 34:59.360]  candy-ass libertarian show excuse me because I'm not a coward I'm Mike
[34:59.360 --> 35:05.400]  Tyson and his prime put me in the ring I will rip these people to shreds fist and
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.920]  elbows they're going down because I want liberty that's why I'm fighting is for
[35:10.920 --> 35:15.320]  my family I know how real this is I'm not fighting for a big ego I'm not
[35:15.320 --> 35:18.840]  fighting to go to these stupid radio conventions everybody kissed my hind in
[35:18.840 --> 35:24.480]  I'm a recluse I want to be left alone that's why I'm out of the gates that's
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.000]  why I came out of my cave because I want to be left alone that's why I'm here
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.920]  that's why I'm angry I don't want to be here I got up at 6 a.m. it took my
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.560]  children fishing I almost called in and canceled the show today I'm not there
[35:38.560 --> 35:43.920]  with the French Bulldog and my three children I'm catching bass and catching
[35:43.920 --> 35:48.360]  sun perch and and trying to catch catfish white a big one right up there
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.280]  almost caught him but broke the line that's what I want to be doing not
[35:52.280 --> 35:56.920]  hanging around with rich people in New York or Los Angeles or showboating
[35:56.920 --> 36:01.440]  around with people you guys to buy my office I might go to a movie every
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.080]  couple months with a crew or something but I'm not out hanging out I'm not out
[36:05.080 --> 36:10.200]  trying to hang out with the people and act cool and be seen I want my freedom I
[36:10.200 --> 36:15.560]  want my freedom and I want the globalist off my back I'm a free man I
[36:15.560 --> 36:18.720]  don't want to be a slave on a global plantation now I'm gonna get into the
[36:18.720 --> 36:22.680]  news and then wide open phones second and third hour today no guess because I
[36:22.680 --> 36:28.480]  want to talk to you but my brain just starts burning with the data and the
[36:28.480 --> 36:36.720]  information that in a consolidated talk radio system with one giant oligopoly
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.200]  of corporations two different groups operating together to own the stations
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.800]  own the host keep people out do whatever they can that any time there's a
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.200]  crack in the door and there's been dozens of these cases I absolutely just
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.600]  wipe the walls with these people now here's the good news and I said I give
[36:58.600 --> 37:01.520]  you a bunch of good news next hour here's some good news just just one
[37:01.520 --> 37:08.480]  little piece of good news out of a cornucopia of good things I listen to
[37:08.480 --> 37:15.080]  mainline neocontalk radio now nighttime morning weekend and they talk about
[37:15.080 --> 37:19.320]  global government and the ultra rich and and and how the ultra rich use
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.640]  monopolies and use government to shut down the competition that was not on
[37:22.640 --> 37:29.960]  radio two years ago the only place you'll ever on big radio hear anybody
[37:29.960 --> 37:33.240]  talk about the New World Order or such issues with George Norring and he took
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.000]  that show in the right direction he deserves a lot of credit he did that
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.240]  seven eight years ago big change and if you got to say somebody really open the
[37:40.240 --> 37:44.680]  door to allow some of these topics to be discussed it was George Norring at the
[37:44.680 --> 37:49.640]  end of the day he deserves more credit than I do having people like me on and
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.920]  the system thinks it's safe to let him do that because he covers the waterfront
[37:54.920 --> 38:05.720]  but the point is truth is contagious and the truth is if George Norring did a
[38:05.720 --> 38:11.800]  purely political show during the middle of the day he'd beat Rush Limbaugh the
[38:11.800 --> 38:18.040]  truth is people are sick of the rhino establishment parroting the same message
[38:18.040 --> 38:23.400]  over and over and over again and it's not just that it's the same old distorted
[38:23.400 --> 38:26.920]  fraudulent message the same type message we get from the Democrats is a
[38:26.920 --> 38:32.080]  different flavor it's still Kool-Aid at the end of the day with cyanide in
[38:32.080 --> 38:39.320]  politically it's not just that it's boring it's killing this country it's
[38:39.320 --> 38:45.280]  destroying this constitutional republic so the good news is you pull the clip up
[38:45.280 --> 38:50.160]  two years ago Rush Limbaugh was forced to come out and say I've always been a
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.120]  water carrier for the republicans establishment and I'm not doing it
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.360]  anymore he had some kind of pang of conscience and you could hear it in his
[38:57.360 --> 38:59.720]  voice
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.640]  and now what's he doing he's carrying the water I saw a video clip and I forgot
[39:07.640 --> 39:14.520]  to send it to Jaron it was it's in Paul Watson's article from from Saturday
[39:14.520 --> 39:20.160]  what's the headline forget the hoax Ron Paul is a presidential frontrunner and
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.760]  in that is a clip of Limbaugh in his studio looks like his home studio not
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.360]  the regular one and he's talking horrible about Ron Paul and has genuine
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.800]  hatred of him and then he turns to the television he says there he is in front
[39:35.800 --> 39:42.200]  of the ice cream stand in Iowa and goes this is just great it's funny because
[39:42.200 --> 39:46.680]  I've seen that same day I guess later in the afternoon Ron Paul at the in front
[39:46.680 --> 39:49.560]  of the ice cream stand where they were interviewing people at the Iowa straw
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.960]  bulb and it was that hatred that he had that's why you never hear me come out
[39:54.960 --> 40:00.280]  and bash Rush Limbaugh and talk about how he's a drug addict pill head synthetic
[40:00.280 --> 40:04.800]  heroin head and all the rest of it because you know what at the end of the
[40:04.800 --> 40:11.280]  day I don't like just hating on other media personalities but to see his
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.320]  hatred of Ron Paul to see him demonize Ron Paul to see him say Ron Paul can't
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.080]  win it'll destroy the Republican Party hey hey Rush if people like Ron Paul
[40:21.080 --> 40:26.600]  don't get into power in this country America's over buddy boy Ron Paul has
[40:26.600 --> 40:30.920]  laid out everything that was going to happen with total precision and it's
[40:30.920 --> 40:36.040]  art typo that he's the man of the hour right now and is the real frontrunner
[40:36.040 --> 40:40.400]  who could unify this country and kick the globalist out of here at great risk
[40:40.400 --> 40:45.760]  to his own life and you sit there selling the establishment line you know
[40:45.760 --> 40:48.400]  it's not just right mainline radio talk show host and I'll talk about the New
[40:48.400 --> 40:51.280]  World Order and the fellow reserve because they have to because of this
[40:51.280 --> 40:56.160]  show and others and the internet just to stay pertinent to even stay in the game
[40:56.160 --> 41:02.280]  to stay relevant it was people like Newt Gennrich who wrote the forward to
[41:02.280 --> 41:05.840]  Alvin and Heidi Toffler's books two of them where he openly calls for world
[41:05.840 --> 41:09.720]  government and the end of the United States go go pull up the quotes a guy
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.240]  that supports carbon taxes a guy that was sitting there to sabotage like
[41:13.240 --> 41:19.120]  banners doing the true conservative libertarian revolution of 1994 a total
[41:19.120 --> 41:25.080]  CFR globalist picked by the CFR to run for Congress decades ago because he
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.480]  wrote books totally calling for world government and what a new kind of say
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.200]  why we shouldn't abolish the Fed but oh yes I do want it audited and and and
[41:35.200 --> 41:40.640]  just a few years ago he fought auditing it publicly and and Ron Paul turned to
[41:40.640 --> 41:48.200]  him and he said I am so glad that the mainstream is starting to join me see
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.240]  that's what's happening we're winning they're bleeding out and so what do they
[41:52.240 --> 41:55.840]  do they sit up there like a bunch of demonic parrots in a tree saying the
[41:55.840 --> 42:00.000]  same thing over and over again there is no world government there is no global
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.960]  banking cartel but there is and they're gonna fix things with a global VAT tax
[42:03.960 --> 42:11.800]  that Bill O'Reilly pushes and Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win did I tell
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.360]  you Ron Paul can't win and I can't tell you how many local talk show hosts a
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.680]  national I hear say I like Ron Paul but too bad he can't win that is a mind game
[42:21.680 --> 42:29.440]  that they come that they developed to treat you like you're a three-year-old
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.720]  it's like an ice cream truck grows by and your child here's the ice cream truck
[42:34.720 --> 42:38.120]  music and you tell the three-year-old they're out of ice cream honey they're
[42:38.120 --> 42:43.840]  going home and the three-year-old goes oh there's no ice cream it's like a lie
[42:43.840 --> 42:49.160]  you tell a baby so they don't throw a fit oh there's that you hear the ice cream
[42:49.160 --> 42:54.160]  truck but but he's out of ice cream honey maybe sometime down the road it is
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.600]  that they treat you like brain damaged children are you brain damaged children
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.320]  or does it anger you to have these people sit up there and play their
[43:03.320 --> 43:06.560]  psychological warfare games on you you know the minute you're aware of their
[43:06.560 --> 43:11.280]  playbook all their games don't work anymore the minute you're aware of their
[43:11.280 --> 43:20.560]  scams it's game over now I don't get up here like a cheerleader or like a
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.800]  football coach who really thinks my team is going to lose but I tell you you can
[43:25.800 --> 43:30.960]  win because I just don't want you to be embarrassed too bad if I didn't know not
[43:30.960 --> 43:36.520]  think know historically from deep research and in my spirit in my gut
[43:36.520 --> 43:42.240]  and intellectually that not only can we stop the globalist we can defeat them
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.640]  and build an incredible civilization together our greatest days are ahead of
[43:47.640 --> 43:52.600]  us if we wake up out of this television culture of death induced trance this
[43:52.600 --> 43:57.440]  501c3 it's the end of the world Jesus is coming back government financed
[43:57.440 --> 44:02.640]  rapture cult if we can get past all that garbage and if you new-agers stop
[44:02.640 --> 44:07.040]  thinking that Nabooru planet Turkey's gonna kill us if you stop having this
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.600]  defeatist attitude and start believing in yourselves we could turn this
[44:10.600 --> 44:17.200]  civilization around and if your Christians out there don't give me oh
[44:17.200 --> 44:24.000]  no it's it's scripture if my people will humble themselves and and repent that I
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.440]  will free them I mean you know all those verses right what about Nineveh Jonah
[44:28.440 --> 44:31.680]  going to Nineveh the hundred year reprieve and even if it is the end of
[44:31.680 --> 44:38.480]  the world even if the planet Kebler elf is coming to get us you still need to
[44:38.480 --> 44:43.120]  stand up against evil and not use it as an excuse to stand down and lay down and
[44:43.120 --> 44:52.680]  not fight corruption the globalists are not all powerful they realize the
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.840]  individual has incredible power when you have knowledge when you have truth and
[44:56.840 --> 45:02.520]  when you have the will and the courage to execute an operation against the
[45:02.520 --> 45:08.760]  technocrats I crawled up literally from nowhere that's why it's an establishment
[45:08.760 --> 45:12.760]  mantra that I'm establishment and I'm I'm backed by people when it's a
[45:12.760 --> 45:18.280]  complete fraud because they don't want you to believe that you can affect change
[45:18.280 --> 45:25.800]  they don't want you to believe that you have power I'm somebody ladies and
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.400]  gentlemen who was going to community college and about to go to the University
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.280]  of Texas and figure it out it was all a big joke in a game and that they were
[45:34.280 --> 45:38.280]  teaching me RTF information from a decade before that was worthless so I went
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.720]  down and did an access television show I found a place and it took me over a
[45:43.720 --> 45:48.240]  decade to get to where we are now think of where we'll be in a few years we're
[45:48.240 --> 45:53.920]  growing exponentially and it's the same example of where we came with Ron Paul
[45:53.920 --> 46:01.800]  Ron Paul 30 years ago was a voice in the libertarian wilderness but the system
[46:01.800 --> 46:05.880]  was so scared of him that they tried to get him to join them just like they
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.720]  tried to get one of his colleagues to join them his name you may have heard
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.320]  of it is Alan Greenspan who wrote books against the New World Order the world
[46:15.320 --> 46:25.160]  government and the Federal Reserve and called for a gold currency now when he
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.280]  was in Congress 16 17 years ago Ron Paul couldn't get one co-sponsor for his in
[46:30.280 --> 46:35.320]  the Fed legislation last year it passed the House they used the corrupt Senate
[46:35.320 --> 46:40.120]  to kill it they're so scared now that they're going to be able to pass it in
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.200]  the House and Senate as the economy implodes and as the people recognize who
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.680]  was behind this that they've now fraudulently set up a Super Congress for
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.440]  the interim so that Rand Paul can't introduce legislation to get rid of the
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.360]  Fed or audit it and so Ron Paul can't you know he can't introduce that now
[46:58.360 --> 47:03.920]  technically because of the Super Congress they but we but you're like I
[47:03.920 --> 47:08.880]  will see their tyrants yes and we force them to uncloak to use a cheesy
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.840]  Star Trek analogy we force the Klingon vessel to uncloak to fire they
[47:13.840 --> 47:18.400]  uncloaked there they are I mean you think in a fight you're just gonna go up and
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.840]  win the first punch you have to make the enemy show themselves you have to run
[47:22.840 --> 47:26.000]  up against them to expose their weaknesses you have to run up against
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.560]  them so they can smash you and so others see you being smashed and have
[47:31.560 --> 47:35.840]  courage to stand up you see I don't believe that if I'm destroyed that's
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.280]  going to scare people that's going to cause people to see the fact that I
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.320]  stood up and resisted these people that's going to cause you to
[47:43.320 --> 47:47.720]  rise up you people think I'm here trying to scare folks it's the opposite I'm
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.480]  coming from my truthful perspective how icing things and when somebody tells me
[47:51.480 --> 47:55.200]  about tyranny and proves that somebody wants to enslave my family and take my
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.040]  liberty and my property and my freedom and my destiny I get angry and want to
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.880]  fight them so I treat you like you're Alex Jones I imagine you're just like I
[48:03.880 --> 48:09.000]  am red-blooded and I come to you and I don't mince words and I tell you what's
[48:09.000 --> 48:17.400]  going on and I show you the proof and I break it down for you in the belief and
[48:17.400 --> 48:22.640]  in the heartfelt conviction that when you finally wake up out of your trance
[48:22.640 --> 48:30.080]  and face what you're dealing with that you'll decide the only only course
[48:30.080 --> 48:32.920]  that's available because these globalists aren't giving us quarter
[48:32.920 --> 48:36.960]  they're not just trying to enslave us the enslavement is a means to an end they
[48:36.960 --> 48:44.120]  want to exterminate us in every one of their seminal documents foundation in
[48:44.120 --> 48:51.960]  every one of their cannons in every one of their tomes and see that's the one
[48:51.960 --> 48:58.320]  thing they have on us is that good people tend to be blind to evil it it took
[48:58.320 --> 49:07.200]  me over a decade to really believe the globalist on statements it took me a
[49:07.200 --> 49:14.320]  long time to really face just how wicked and evil these people are it took me a
[49:14.320 --> 49:23.400]  very very long time to even be able to deal with this myself and to realize
[49:23.400 --> 49:27.160]  there's no future if I don't fully commit myself to this and have no fear you
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.120]  know I have no fear of being killed or being destroyed or being imprisoned or
[49:31.120 --> 49:38.640]  tortured or lied about my character assassinated I only have fear that I
[49:38.640 --> 49:44.960]  will not live up to the challenge that I will fail you and my family because
[49:44.960 --> 49:49.440]  there is no future if we don't beat these people and it's the minute you
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.640]  realize that it is the second that that light bulb goes off in your heart your
[49:53.640 --> 50:03.880]  soul your intellect your spirit it's the minute that you decide to not play
[50:03.880 --> 50:12.320]  mind games with yourself and oh it's not that bad oh whatever oh some of what
[50:12.320 --> 50:15.360]  that guy says is true and you know a lot of it's come true but I just can't
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.360]  believe it's that bad the minute you stop being in denial the minute you stop
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.080]  being a three-year-old psychologically see three-year-olds think they can
[50:24.080 --> 50:30.080]  change reality by imagining the minute you understand you're not gonna get out
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.680]  of this none of us are gonna get out of this unless we face just how serious the
[50:34.680 --> 50:41.120]  threat is as a Patrick Henry said we'll try to pull up the quote you know I
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.080]  would know the the truth no matter how bad and make preparation for it and we
[50:46.080 --> 50:49.920]  come back I haven't even gotten to the news yet incredible economic news the
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.640]  mainstream media admits they're targeting Ron Paul demonizing him and

[54:06.600 --> 54:15.720]  alright I've been ranting for 54 minutes I apologize I actually don't hate
[54:15.720 --> 54:20.760]  Rush Limbaugh it upsets me to see him turned into just a complete vassal of
[54:20.760 --> 54:26.360]  the New World Order and so pathetic and to see him over the years promote
[54:26.360 --> 54:29.800]  mandatory drug sentencing for young people caught with heroin or cocaine
[54:29.800 --> 54:35.000]  that the military industrial complex ships in publicly and then to still
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.560]  call for mandatory sentencing even though he's been caught with synthetic
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.800]  heroin and I don't think you should get in trouble for his drug addiction
[54:42.800 --> 54:49.040]  problems it's it's an addiction it's a problem but even after that spot-checking
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.560]  and listening he still promotes mandatory drug war garbage I mean that
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.720]  is one evil piece of garbage right there I'm sorry that is just a sold out
[54:58.720 --> 55:06.760]  blob of pus all his money all his power getting off drug charges you know
[55:06.760 --> 55:12.280]  doctor shopping over and over again but he wants some 16-year-old kid caught
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.160]  with drugs to be thrown under the jail so that then that person comes out of
[55:17.160 --> 55:22.400]  prison a hardcore criminal with four to five to seven to ten years of criminal
[55:22.400 --> 55:26.920]  education you know the media is all over the place saying why is the gangster
[55:26.920 --> 55:33.200]  culture of the new culture why are there so many kids raping and robbing and
[55:33.200 --> 55:36.840]  killing all over the Western world because Sumner Redstone and MTV and
[55:36.840 --> 55:42.920]  Hollywood sold it and because kids that go to public schools get beat up by the
[55:42.920 --> 55:48.960]  gang members so they join them out of fear I didn't join him I beat the living
[55:48.960 --> 55:53.280]  daylights out of him when I grew up in Dallas but I was the exception most
[55:53.280 --> 56:01.200]  people got into it there's a bunch of reports on that I'll get to later yes
[56:01.200 --> 56:05.840]  America's culture is a prison culture what do you think you learn at prison

[56:11.400 --> 56:18.120]  and one of the young middle-class kids learn how to do they learn how to be
[56:18.120 --> 56:23.640]  punks they grow up and MTV says you wear your pants down over your hind end to
[56:23.640 --> 56:29.840]  signify that the the intelligency of this country is a sexual toy for someone
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.720]  with HIV in prison that's what a sick joke America is in Europe and that's the
[56:35.720 --> 56:40.120]  yuppie parents that are even bigger sick jokes teaching their kids to go ahead

[56:47.520 --> 56:52.480]  like a punk in a prison when you're 12 instead of telling your kids that's a
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.360]  psychological warfare television that's a system there to destroy you and make
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.160]  you weak you tell your kids that they'll listen to you but you act like a bunch of

[1:00:54.320 --> 1:01:01.520]  to the most important starting here in a moment but if you witnessed all the
[1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:10.760]  incredible duplicity that went on at the Iowa straw pole Michelle Bachman's
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:18.400]  people politicos even reporting putting up fake registration signs saying if you
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.880]  want to be in the straw pole sign up here and buy your ticket for Bachman
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:29.160]  Bachman's rule no vote no Randy Travis she bought 4,000 votes and only beat
[1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:37.480]  Ron Paul by 162 or 212 there's a three different numbers here the point is
[1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:40.840]  Ron Paul really won as usual he did officially win even though they tried
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.760]  to rig it in New Hampshire Michelle Bachman is offering up country singer
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:52.240]  Randy Travis and other bands for free as this brochure being passed out by
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.800]  Bachman volunteers indicates he must first register with her to get to see

[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:46.080]  people they send me emails I see their comments and they say Alex you say
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:49.000]  there's election fraud why don't say it's been proven in federal and state
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.920]  court from Ohio to Texas from California to New York I mean from
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:03:00.840]  Chicago to Miami all the famous cases executives have gone public from

[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:10.120]  after yeah there's massive election fraud all over the country so why then am I
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:15.200]  even covering the election why am I saying vote for Ron Paul because all the
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:19.640]  voting experts I've talked to like Bev Harris and others who've really been
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:24.880]  proven to be accurate so far say that if there's a landslide because of the
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:32.120]  county and state systems is very hard for them to steal it besides resistance
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:36.400]  is victory we make them steal it from Ron Paul there'll be a bigger hubbub to
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.080]  totally discredit these machines that are being pulled out in some areas of
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:45.640]  the country it's a fight it's who wants it most and when Ron Paul gets up there
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:49.520]  in these debates and all the other eight Republicans sit there and say torture
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:55.760]  and war and secret arrest and you know is good and he sits there and points out
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:59.760]  common sense reality it's the three-year-old saying the emperors wearing
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:10.560]  no clothes and so resistance is victory don't you understand that it's easy to
[1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:13.080]  go oh everything's destroyed we can't win there's nothing we can do

[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.920]  news here you know I see these reports every day now and it's certain states it's
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:53.360]  seven states I see doing this Massachusetts is one of the worst
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:59.840]  Maryland's bad like most the cases I see her in those two states Massachusetts
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.240]  police arrest another man on wiretapping charges he recorded the
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:12.080]  traffic stop on his iPhone that's right and he's facing all these felony
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.440]  charges for it now there's no perception of privacy when a cop pulls you over
[1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:20.400]  they've got cameras mounted on them or at least microphones there they're
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:27.080]  videotaping you and they don't care if this isn't wiretapping wiretapping is
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:30.600]  going to put in a wire and recording somebody's phone line or sticking a
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:36.120]  camera up against you know their window through the shades peeping Tom
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:41.960]  behavior wiretapping is not recording the police and they're now charging people
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:47.520]  that film them in plain view oh yeah I've seen cases in Maryland where the riot
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.200]  police are beating people a hundred yards away cops come over beat them on
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:54.640]  camera charge them with assault that matter they didn't touch them the cops
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.240]  just frame you right there because they're acting as criminals and then
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:02.240]  they go ahead and give you a felony charge on top of it for taping them now
[1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:07.760]  that is Nazi Germany that is North Korea everybody knows that if you live in a
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:13.400]  tyranny the cops are bad so as we go into tyranny and and and the police
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:16.840]  don't speak up against this and it varies your addiction to jurisdiction
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:21.480]  police are as varied as sand at the beach they're just they're just like the
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:26.520]  general public but history shows that you give the bad apples a green light
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:30.280]  they will take over departments they will take over your society and set
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:35.760]  themselves up as kings and it's happened and I've got other reports here in the
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:42.360]  news where people are being charged for legal guns in the U.S. and Canada I see
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.760]  these reports about about once a week gun collectors through Toronto police for
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:53.840]  seizing legally owned firearms they swat team demon they and they said we don't
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:57.160]  care if they're legal you're still going to jail I see that all the time so
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:03.160]  that's coming up also we have a good snapshot example of government kill
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:06.280]  switches over the internet telecommunications we've been reporting

[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:20.480]  anonymous is the feds it's just a name they can use to then blame all the whole
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:24.600]  hacker community and then use the hacks as an excuse to take over hackers
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:33.560]  protest Bart decision to block cell phones that's AP San Francisco's cell

[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:56.840]  shut all cell phones down that's a hint of the future oh criticize who's the
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:03.240]  mubarak for doing it but boy good old America's gonna do it but see it's bad

[1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:17.080]  name I'm diametrically opposed to Obama and all his socialist minions run by
[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:20.600]  big banks trying to get us all dependent on their on their plantation
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:26.480]  but at least they admit their dirty low-down rat commies you people run
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:29.460]  around and act like you're free market and all the rest of it but I hear
[1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:34.160]  mainline so-called conservative news never will utter Ron Paul's name unless
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:38.320]  it's negative won't tell you when he wins a straw puller gets second place
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:44.320]  because they feel like they're members of the establishment and they feel like
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:47.000]  oh we just sell out of the establishment we're part of the winners
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.400]  that'll protect our families what happens when everybody sells out to the
[1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:56.240]  establishment societies collapse you people are destroying your own future
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:25:01.720]  you're not gonna have to wait long now it's all these executives and these want
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:07.440]  to be establishment types who are so competitive they sell their soul out
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.160]  don't you understand you have no future when you have this attitude all right
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.200]  let me play this CNN clip with the Politico reporter on there and the
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:22.880]  Politico reporter again plays it perfectly knowing that most people like
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:25.920]  Ron Paul he's got one of the highest approval ratings of anybody like the
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:29.400]  highest out there he's won his congressional seat with record numbers
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.160]  in a very diverse district they've rewritten many times trying to beat
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:39.160]  him and this guy says yeah I really like Ron Paul I shouldn't say I like him so
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.000]  he puts that out there to make folks that like him feel like they're alone he
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.240]  knows the majority likes Ron Paul so he's showing why he's a slime bag reporter
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:51.400]  for Politico everything is crafted with what he says okay these guys right
[1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:56.040]  they're talking points up ahead of time and listen to him he says he says well
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:26:01.000]  I really shouldn't say this but I like Ron Paul and that's meant for those of
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.560]  you that like him to feel like well I better not tell anybody I like him
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:10.080]  because I'm driven by peer pressure I'm weak I go with the herd okay oh but now
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:13.680]  I like this guy because I'm gonna listen to him because he said he likes Ron
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:17.720]  Paul so it has a double meaning I like this guy he's a friend so I'm gonna
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:22.160]  listen to him but we're together in our weirdness okay what do you have to say
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:27.040]  and he goes on and says well the media ignores him even though he's winning won
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:33.360]  the debate second the straw poll because everybody knows he can't win I mean they
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:37.840]  talk to you like you're idiots are you really that stupid America well no I
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:41.200]  guess you're not he won the new Hampshire poll straw poll no one even
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.200]  covered it he won CPAC two years in a row and Fox News dubbed over a tape of a
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:52.160]  year before a him being booed oh it was a technical difficulty later when they
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:27:00.800]  got caught it's a technical difficulty on Soviet fake conservative radio that
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:07.480]  Genesis carries because I guess it's better than Fox or CNN radio news I
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:13.600]  maybe not people would know immediately at least CNN's pure evil I mean they all
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  think you're dumb does that make you mad somebody won't tell you somebody
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.320]  one to make you mad they've all gotten together all these little pencil neck
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:24.440]  nobodies and sit there for hours writing up how to manipulate you thinking
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:27.720]  they're real smart and they're the little insiders and get to giggle and
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:31.280]  laugh at everybody I've been in events I've been around these pundits they are
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:36.640]  a bunch of people who were losers their entire lives and who hate everybody and
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:41.120]  who get off on manipulating people I'm telling you folks nerds are one of the
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:44.440]  most dangerous groups in this country because they end up running things but
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.840]  they still hate everybody because they weren't the jocks in high school so they
[1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:52.280]  play little dirty games on everybody they use their brains to hurt people and
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:58.000]  I'm aware of them okay I'm a I see you little you little rats but here's the
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.040]  clip we are in the business of kicking candidates out of the race man I see one
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:08.120]  once when I say one thing about Ron stop back it up back it up we're in the
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:11.440]  business of kicking people out of the race that's the guy who's got a face
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:16.600]  made for a septic tank he says that first again just throwing the stuff at
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:21.400]  you so you feel like you're smart and parrot what they say stop regurgitating
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:25.240]  what they vomit in your mouth back to the scum we are in the business of
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:29.240]  kicking candidates out of the race when I see one once when I say one thing about
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:34.800]  Ron Paul I find it odd for me to be a Ron Paul supporter but he lost to Michelle
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:40.480]  Bachman by nine tenths of one percentage point in a straw poll that doesn't
[1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:44.280]  suppose isn't supposed to pick winners but it's supposed to tell us which way
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:49.680]  the wind is blowing that's as good as a win so we had a tie for first but where
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:54.840]  where is he on the morning shows this morning where all the stories analyzing
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:29:00.360]  what it means that Ron Paul essentially tied for first place at Ames and what's
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:04.000]  the reason that he's essentially well ignored is the media doesn't believe
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  that Ron Paul has a hoot and hails chance of winning the Iowa caucuses
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.160]  winning the Republican nomination or winning the presidency so we're gonna
[1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:17.960]  all norm go ahead Stephanie I mean I think that's you know Howard because
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:20.400]  that's the one thing Donald Trump has ever been right about is that he's
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:23.960]  unelectable I mean I think you know my favorite part of the debate Thursday
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:27.480]  night is that you know Rick Santorum broke the golden rule of Republican debates
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:33.240]  and that's pretending Ron Paul is invisible you know I mean I I I think
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:35.680]  you're right there's more media attention than there is that you know
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:39.280]  this gonna have to do with the actual results well just to remind people of the
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:42.200]  numbers here this great victory won by Michelle Bachman and I'm not taking
[1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:48.920]  anything away from her she got in late and she's gone back just gone bags we're
[1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:57.440]  on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:28.080]  conservative radio news Donald Trump they're all telling you Ron Paul can't
[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:34.120]  win Ron Paul can't win because he's the only candidate who is talking about real
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:38.520]  issues that would get rid of the Federal Reserve restore the Republic get our
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:43.440]  troops home the globalists aren't failing their program to take America
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:49.360]  over is going quite nicely and here is this this dark horse you have this guy
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:56.320]  of old this constitutionalist who is challenging their tyranny right at this
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:01.320]  key juncture in time God the universe whatever you want to call it has given
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:05.280]  us Ron Paul and they've got the Cointel pro at the grassroots attacking him
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:10.040]  telling lies about him I mean they could save the Loch Ness Monster no proof
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:17.240]  they said it must be true they've got the entire spectrum attacking him oh and
[1:34:17.240 --> 1:34:20.600]  guess what Donald Trump announced last week looks like he's gonna go ahead and
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:26.440]  run for president again of course what did our sources say months ago he got
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.080]  in to discredit the birth certificate and then he would come back in if it look
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:39.280]  like Republicans might beat Obama or if it's not the Republican the
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:43.760]  establishment wants and you watch if Ron Paul ends up winning and getting the
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.840]  nomination in is going to come Donald Trump with all his slick talk and he's
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:52.600]  going to get a big group of so-called conservatives to vote and he's going to
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:35:00.240]  split the race and you're gonna end up with Barack Obama in there again that's
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:03.320]  how the system does it that's how in the last two elections Rick Perry got elected
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:10.320]  with a minority of the votes they always just have a bunch people run and
[1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:15.280]  that's how they're gonna do it again this time that's their plan a casino
[1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:18.760]  owner who gives double the money to Democrats and you idiot
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:22.560]  conservatives were calling me months ago mad that I didn't get behind Donald
[1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:27.760]  Trump I get emails like you're an Obama operative for George Soros you don't
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:34.400]  like Donald Trump I get the same idiotic emails and comments now oh you all
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:38.880]  like Rick Perry huh George Soros paying you well I see this mantra he's paid by
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:42.400]  Soros people are on YouTube saying where's your proof I don't need any I
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:48.480]  know Jones is oh yeah that's why Soros organs attract me 24-7 and basically
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:55.080]  call for my arrest oh yes oh yes Soros mm-hmm because I'm all for the New World
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:01.120]  Order and global banks and carbon taxes mm-hmm yes yes see it's all about labels
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:05.920]  they hope that you just get caught up at Obama and Perry and Mitt Romney when
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:11.680]  at the end of the day the guys are all identical I mean do you actually know
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.000]  their records and I know as my audience you do but we've got to force these
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.520]  political prostitutes on talk radio that like to pose as constitutionalist
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:25.960]  libertarians and conservatives we have got to continue to put them on the
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:30.720]  coals they are already coming around to our way of thinking reality because
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:35.760]  we're putting pressure on them now John Anna TJ Merrill Paul I'm gonna get to all
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:41.320]  of you but I want to finish up this singing in clip because notice every one
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:46.200]  of them saying it's our job to knock candidates out Ron Paul can't win Ron
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:49.720]  Paul and then oh he's winning this straw poll second place in that straw
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.320]  poll number one number two number three and all the major polls record giving
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:57.440]  from small donors more military contributions and all the other
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:03.080]  candidates combined on the Republican side more than Obama oh he's not popular
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:09.600]  Rush Limbaugh says he's evil Glenn Beck says he's evil and see they only say
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.480]  he's evil during the election cycle for years oh he's great I like him yeah
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:18.040]  right when he's about to win that guy's bad news and they take the political heat
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:22.640]  it hurts their audience it hurts their listorship but they've got to carry the
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:27.960]  water for the establishment as Rush Limbaugh said and I'm supposed to just
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:33.080]  sit here and and like the flip-flopping the duplicity I'm not supposed to know
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:36.520]  about Rick Perry in North American Union highways or forced inoculations of
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:40.120]  deadly shots that he knew was killing people or that he worked for Al Gore I've
[1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:43.440]  seen countless comments saying I'm a liar he didn't work for Al Gore Dallas
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.160]  Morning News Associated Press Austin American statesman Rick Perry's own
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:52.800]  gubernatorial website it's on record he was the chairman of Al Gore's campaign
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:58.160]  in Texas so shut up and stop calling me a liar you are like children just because
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:04.480]  you say something doesn't make it reality just because you say Ron Paul's a
[1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:08.600]  cook because he's a statesman and is absolutely on target as a historian and
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:13.080]  economist just because just because you like being fooled and conned doesn't
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:16.840]  mean the rest of us want to be drug into worldwide tyranny and depression with
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:24.120]  you don't drag us down your rat hole with your ignorance and foolishness all
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:27.000]  right that's enough okay let's finish the clip now listen to this simpering
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.080]  woman nobody knows who she is nobody cares she's an empty suit they stick up
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:36.880]  on TV with all the rest of the parents to sit up there and giggle and laugh and
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:40.800]  make fun of Ron Paul hoping their audience is shallow hoping their
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:46.640]  audience is vapid and sophistic hoping their audience has no gravel hoping that
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:51.640]  you have no grit hoping that you're this little fluttering fluttering idiot like
[1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:57.840]  a sponge that oh the pundits up on the fancy stage with the fancy lights behind
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:02.200]  them in suits they didn't say he could win so it doesn't matter what they
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:06.160]  admit he's winning winning winning winning more than anybody else he's got
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:10.720]  the most wins he's got the highest poll numbers he can beat Obama and they
[1:39:10.720 --> 1:39:14.960]  admit all that and then say it's only us the media that talk about him they
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.000]  admit they're ignoring him but then they say in fact we're just talk about him
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:24.040]  too much he isn't even isn't even in the equation it's like you're down to the
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:32.040]  last two laps of a NASCAR Indianapolis 500 Ron Paul is 10 car links ahead the
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:37.960]  other cars behind him are carbon tax lovers Obama healthcare writers forced
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:43.160]  inoculators Al Gore minions I mean look at IRS enforcers she didn't work on
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:47.440]  computers or something at the IRS she wasn't a secretary she was the pit
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.760]  person that raids your house you couldn't pay me ten million dollars to go
[1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:56.000]  into houses with people that are broke while their kids are crying and their
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:03.080]  stuff's being loaded up and their house is being taken but that's who you that's
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:07.680]  who they tell you you want oh look we got this little tart here for you
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.680]  Michelle Bachman and her limp-wristed husband don't they look good and that's
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:19.160]  what you want how about Mitt Romney some corporate whore executive socialism
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:25.280]  Obamacare lover yeah that'll fix things that's another thing I've never brought
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:28.320]  up the fact that you know his Mormonism or whatever I don't get into that but
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:35.520]  they were attacking Ron Paul saying are you for having more than one wife they
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:41.000]  asked him where he stood I think I'm having one of those moments those what's
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  it called when you've got more than one wife the polygamy they asked him where
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.120]  he stood on polygamy and he said well I'm not for it well you're for stage
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.920]  rights he goes well states aren't gonna do that this is nonsensical let's have a
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:58.360]  real discussion here they were all laughing at Ron Paul's he's not for
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:01.720]  torture and the killing of Americans without warrants and just total tyranny
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:05.480]  Ron Paul said we're all in danger folks this is tyranny and they were all
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:11.080]  laughing all these fake tough guy men look at him haha you're not for preemptive
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:15.800]  wars and torture what a wimp he doesn't want Americans to be able to be killed
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:21.640]  for no reason huh it was great in the Soviet Union this guy's a kook we're a
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:26.040]  bunch of colored sellouts Batman you tell him when you used to raid people's
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:30.640]  homes as their families cried you've got little tart eyes tell folks how much
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.840]  you love them that's right let me sit up here like a zombie doll okay okay I
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:39.200]  can't handle it anymore let's just finish the clip and I'm going to your
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:42.680]  calls I'm going I'm going to him one thing Donald Trump has ever been right
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:46.160]  about is that he's unelectable I mean I think you know my favorite part of the
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.640]  debate Thursday night is that you know Rick Santorum broke the golden rule of
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:56.200]  Republican debates and that's pretending Ron Paul is invisible he broke the
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:01.120]  cardinal rule pretending that Ron Paul's invisible they when you look in these
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.560]  zombies eyes every one of them is electrified and scared there's never
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:09.920]  been any real opposition not even Barry Goldwater he wasn't a bad guy but he
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:15.360]  was establishment there's never been anybody like Ron Paul 75 years old works
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:22.560]  18 hours a day dedicated just so good God's given us a choice right now no he
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.400]  fix everything no what's a step in the right direction and they sit up there
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:31.240]  scared to death from every angle attacking him treating you like your
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:36.440]  idiot saying he can't win oh Palente broke the cardinal rule of pretending
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:42.600]  Ron Paul didn't exist did you hear that crowd you little prostitute did you hear
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:47.280]  that crowd they go watch the debate just like you did you're there scared of
[1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:50.760]  them you're there hoping that crowds weak-minded and hoping that you can you
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:55.040]  know what you you might succeed Ron Paul might not win or the voting machines
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:00.360]  will kick in and cheating but don't worry we're gonna remember all of you
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  prostitutes it's already come out the federal government pays most of you on
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.800]  top of your jobs in the media with banker bailout money and and that's called
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:12.680]  aiding and abetting a foreign banking power that took over our country and you
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:19.320]  people well you know what happened after we won the war in 1789 you know what
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:25.440]  happened you are traitors and you're gonna be told get out of this country
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.840]  you understand and I'm serious you people could you believe we'd be about to
[1:43:30.840 --> 1:43:34.520]  be able to audit and get rid of the Federal Reserve we're going just because
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:38.040]  Rick Perry sits up there in a suit and knowingly tells people to take a
[1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:41.920]  vaccine that he knows kills them in many cases and maims people doesn't mean
[1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:44.960]  it's okay just because they take secret money under the table from the
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:50.480]  government MSNBC CNN you name it does it mean that that's not super creepy and
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:54.160]  and any and any legal as the Congressional Budget Office found six
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:44:00.080]  years ago the only way they're getting away with all this is payoffs folks those
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:07.120]  are enemy banker operatives hitting you hard finish up with them
[1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:12.200]  got the clip rest on it I think you're right there's more media attention than
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.480]  there is that you know this gonna have to do with the actual results well just
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:18.440]  to remind people of the numbers here this great victory won by Michelle
[1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:21.520]  Bachman and I'm not taking anything away from her she got in late and she's got
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:26.760]  a lot of momentum but she got 4,823 votes Ron Paul got a couple hundred
[1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:31.920]  less as you say Roger Poletti with 2,293 Jackie Cassini's you mentioned
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:35.640]  earlier Texas Governor Rick Perry the media doesn't believe that Ron Paul has
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:40.040]  a hooten-held hit pause in the video because it's got the headline on one
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:45.160]  to show folks Michelle Bachman wins aim straw poll Tim Poletti gets third
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.880]  there's Politico on your screen of your prison planet dot TV viewer an example of
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:58.880]  hundreds of articles I saw where they wouldn't even mention Ron Paul
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:05.240]  Politico Fox I saw it everywhere why are they all scared because he is holy
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:10.600]  water to these vampires they won't they are scared scared scared not because he
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:14.360]  can't win because he's the only one that can win and only one of he does win that
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:19.400]  could do anything about where we're at he he has given us the prognosis as a
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:25.360]  doctor of exactly the diagnosis of exactly what we have he's got the cure
[1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:28.760]  it's called the Republic it's called Liberty it's called self-sufficiency
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:34.120]  it's called kicking the banksters out and so of course they're all attacking him
[1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:40.400]  all right that's enough I'm gonna go to John Annie TJ Morell Paul and others go
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:42.800]  ahead John you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:46.600]  Hey Alex how you doing first of all I just want to say it's a pleasure to be on
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:50.640]  your show you know to be on with someone that's covering real news it's very
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:56.040]  refreshing first of all what I want to say is I'm a law enforcement officer and
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:46:02.000]  I took a note to protect and defend the Constitution and it makes me sick to my
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  stomach that someone who is a strict constitutionalist like Ron Paul the
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:14.480]  media continues their campaign to discredit him and not give him any
[1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:20.720]  chance of winning the presidency it's just mind-boggling to me that
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:26.040]  political column that says they talk about who wins first place and then
[1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:31.360]  talk about Polenty getting third and completely ignoring second place by the
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:35.600]  way Polenty dropped out just a few hours ago this is a total job but by the way
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:40.600]  he he he is the frontrunner right now that's why they're all attacking him
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:43.320]  that's why Limbaugh came out against him Friday he won the debate hands down
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:48.640]  they're scared just like the Republican establishment went to Kentucky because
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:52.680]  because I hear you say now he has no chance or he may not no no no he's got a
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:56.520]  super good chance even if they keep running this hoax if they got behind
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:01.160]  him and said yeah he is the frontrunner the Ron Paul revolution wow man of his
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:05.800]  time decades fighting in the wilderness now coming to be the leader of
[1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:11.200]  Cinderella story it's tailor-made for them but no they're going to scream and
[1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:15.160]  scream and scream and tell you he's lost so in case they've got to steal the
[1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:19.280]  election from him you'll feel like okay well he couldn't win he would
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:25.840]  guaranteed win and destroy Obama imagine imagine Ron Paul squaring off
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:32.960]  against Barack Obama in a debate can you imagine the utter annihilation can you
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:39.400]  imagine so see that's what's happening here my friend and and and Ron Paul is
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:47.440]  the leader that's why that political prostitute Trump is going after him
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:51.560]  they've got every gun swung around on him does that tell you he's inconsequential
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:57.520]  and doesn't matter what does that tell you John well it tells me that they're
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:02.360]  afraid of it they obviously don't want him in office because they know he's
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:05.600]  absolutely going to go after the elite that are completely controlling
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:13.920]  everything yes you know and the other thing is that you know they're
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:20.480]  completely trying to completely burn the Constitution I see an ad on Time Magazine
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:26.360]  where the cover said they had the Constitution being shredded and it said
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:29.800]  does it even matter anymore and the other thing I can tell you Alex a lot of
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:35.040]  people need to wake up because I work in law enforcement and I hear these
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:41.280]  individuals talk about violating certain people's rights doing things that
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  completely go against the Constitution and the moment you bring in the
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:49.840]  constitutionality part of it then they start to back up it's almost like you
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:53.640]  have to remind the people hey there is this thing called the Constitution that
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:58.240]  gives people well just can't continue well here's the deal they put police in
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:03.040]  an impossible situation it's a galleon dialectic they build giant prisons they
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:06.800]  put the violent people in don't hold them long put them back out cops are
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:11.960]  dealing with scum all day and so cops start thinking well this guy scum I'm
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:15.960]  gonna go ahead and violate the Constitution to get him but then you
[1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:19.240]  get in the habit of doing it now you do it to everybody and see at the end of
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:22.480]  the day that's the issue that Constitution and Bill of Rights is there
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:27.880]  to protect you officers your citizens too it's there to protect you from what
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:32.920]  we now see happening God bless you John I appreciate your call anything else
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:37.400]  no I just wanted to say also there is a website out there that that you can put
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:40.600]  a sticker in your car that says you have a number two on it it protects the
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:44.720]  Second Amendment and I'm trying to educate officers about our rights because
[1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:47.960]  once we take the uniform on we're citizens just like everybody else I'm
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:51.760]  spreading the word Alex and not keep keep up the good work I appreciate it
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:55.840]  thank you John all right I'm really gonna try to go to any TJ Merrill Paul
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:01.120]  and others when we get back but I want to say this here I don't believe in God
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:05.600]  I know God is real I know there's this spiritual force of goodness and creation
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:10.680]  in the universe and I could feel God and I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:13.160]  for God I'm gonna tell you something right now I've studied history and I've
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:18.720]  studied Providence this may be one of the last chances the republics being given
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:23.000]  you notice right as we implode right as we fall to the banksters this little
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  humble doctor grew up milk and cows and his whole career coming towards this

[1:50:41.400 --> 1:50:44.920]  the course people say well if he gets elected they'll just assassinate him you
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:50.960]  know what that'll do if they assassinated Ron Paul they can't win if Ron Paul gets
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:54.680]  in there and that's why they're so scared of him right now God's giving us a

[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:22.960]  by a constrictor or at the beginning of struggling free
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:35.840]  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and Ron Paul is only
[1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:43.760]  one manifestation of that you and I are also manifestations of that don't ever

[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:49.960]  for holding hi Alex it's so great to talk to you I totally agree with
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:54.680]  everything you're saying about the media closing out Ron Paul and what an
[1:55:54.680 --> 1:56:00.400]  incredible they're not the media that the the foreign banker funded whores of the
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:05.960]  New World Order your enemy they are savage enemies that support torture
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:10.520]  secret war taking the troops pension funds these people will do whatever
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:15.320]  they're told these are horrible scum I don't just say that I mean these are
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:21.840]  enemies these are haters of freedom sorry go ahead I have four incredible
[1:56:21.840 --> 1:56:27.400]  suggestions to help us in this incredible moment in history the first one is
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:35.200]  we need a new slogan for Ron Paul how about yes he can absolutely or or or or
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:40.920]  Ron Paul is my president or Ron Paul can and will win absolutely folks it's time
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:47.400]  for people to call Fox CNN Politico and say look man we're not done we see you
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:53.120]  say Michelle Bachman and Palente win and don't even mention Ron Paul I mean that
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:59.240]  is that is so discrediting but they don't care that they think you're stupid
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:06.960]  what are the other suggestions okay the next suggestion is to really clarify for
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:12.440]  people how he is different from what the other Republicans are saying okay
[1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:17.560]  studying the debates that happened last week all of them are talking about
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:23.200]  repealing Obamacare all of them are talking about economic plan that's
[1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:32.000]  forgiven so but mainline Republicans are still not educating themselves enough
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.560]  on what makes Ron Paul different people still don't know and we need to have our
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:44.080]  talking point straight for the mainstream Republicans the independence and the
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:48.800]  dissatisfied Democrats that need to know what makes him different yeah well I'll
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:52.600]  tell you the talking points if you idiots vote for another globalist
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:59.240]  Republican like pointy boots or mr. Obamacare Romney you idiots deserve
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:04.360]  what you get look mainline good Americans aren't really political we just
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:09.000]  want freedom if you go to a mainline Republican function when you see mainline
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:13.400]  Republican supporters they look like they had their souls sucked out they're
[1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:19.320]  these weird the men are very unmasculine they like get off on being
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:23.600]  invited to Republican dinners and they and they get off on being conned it's
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:27.840]  like they're like demon-possessed goblins or something I don't know how to
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:32.160]  explain them I mean and they like it that America's falling they like being

[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:36.120]  him saying that he's done a fabulous job on global warming yeah writing Obama

[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:46.200]  continue with your calls I got a bunch of news obviously dealing with
[2:00:46.200 --> 2:00:51.640]  government shutdown of cell phones to stop free speech more on bizarre
[2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:56.240]  statement by the New York Times writer Krugman about meeting a staged event
[2:00:56.240 --> 2:00:58.520]  in America to get their world government through so we're gonna be
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:02.840]  breaking that down TJ and Georgia than Merrill Paul Alex and others the toll
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:08.720]  free number to join us 800 25 at 990 31 it's now free for all go ahead TJ and
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:16.480]  Georgia um yeah Alex um I have a question mainly on what um about um
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:22.400]  World War three basically when you had um Lindsay back on the show he was
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:29.000]  talking about you know that we are going to betray the entire Middle East my
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:35.040]  question is so after we basically do that that basically leaves by we you mean
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:38.360]  the bankers that run this country through a bunch of zombie television
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:42.680]  watchers or early nothing but sock puppets yeah of course yeah um the
[2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:48.200]  shadow government when they basically do that that leaves basically Israel over
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:52.080]  there so my question is do you think they're all going to converge on Israel
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:56.040]  and it's gonna lead to the World War three the major war they was talking
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:02:01.200]  about at the end of 2012 or you know I don't know if Lindsay William sources are
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:04.940]  right about everything they've been right about most stuff and the Rand
[2:02:04.940 --> 2:02:07.920]  Corporation and others have said they want something bigger than a regional
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:14.240]  war because then the globalist through America we're the beast that gives
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:22.760]  power to the little beast if you want to get into religion into the Bible and
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:25.800]  of course everything is a model of itself these things go throughout history
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:32.280]  and repeat themselves over and over again but the plan is to start a giant war
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:37.840]  and then everybody will accept the carbon taxes and Lord Rothschild and
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:42.520]  and his great minions like Al Gore and others so they need a big war so we'll
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:46.160]  forget I'm gonna get to that later that's actually in the news today so we'll
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:51.440]  forget about the things they've done to us now another thing is like when it
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:55.820]  comes down to Ron Paul you know all these people that are coming against Ron
[2:02:55.820 --> 2:03:01.320]  Paul all of these are they are really nothing but thick twisted people who are
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:07.920]  you know trying to play these little mind games and because I'm 20 years old and
[2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:11.400]  I'm inside college and I've been trying to afford people and I can I can just tell
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:15.280]  you like how many how many of these kids they they just be laughing at me and
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:20.120]  they just be decided you know they're little groups talking about oh TJ he's
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:24.200]  nothing but this crazy individual thinking that this and this is gonna
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:29.000]  happen but you know what the truth is that they know it's true and they are
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.320]  afraid of Ron Paul and they are afraid of people like us all because they
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:38.880]  already know what is what it basically is to come and so here's what happens
[2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:42.880]  TJ when you talk to the average jellyfish who literally is in a lower
[2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:47.880]  brainwave state from television watching that's a fact they get shocked and
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:54.040]  scared and they think you're showing off that you understand some issues and
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:58.080]  have some political ideas that's weird to them and so they're like he's not
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:02.360]  talking about sitcoms or he's not talking about dramas or football games
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:06.440]  this guy is telling me that we need to be involved they think you're telling
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:10.840]  them to go clean the garage they think they can just choose I'm not into
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:15.360]  politics you know I've got my own life they don't understand you get into
[2:04:15.360 --> 2:04:20.480]  politics or you get run over they don't understand that human history is
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:26.000]  slavery and bondage and death and war and pain as Thomas Jefferson said you
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:30.480]  may fight as hard as you can and you're probably gonna lose your freedom but if
[2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:34.200]  you roll over like a bunch of effeminate it's wrong to say effeminate cuz women

[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:02.480]  CNN clip going yes it's our job to ignore him and make sure he can't win
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:09.280]  because he can't win they're not scared of any of the other candidates because
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:18.520]  they're all bought and paid for Michelle Bachman Rick Perry Barack Obama
[2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:27.720]  Mr. Carbon Tax Mr. Obamacare Mitt Romney I mean they all hung their shingle out
[2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:32.680]  their business decades ago and said I'm a political prostitute I am ready to do
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:39.080]  whatever you want me to I mean here it is in the news today under scrutiny
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:47.360]  Perry walks back HPV decision walks back and you read the quote he was asked in
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:53.440]  New Hampshire last night why he signed an executive order to force little girls
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:59.800]  to take the HPV shot and he said well I did the wrong thing and I wasn't as
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:04.600]  informed as I should have been and the Texas legislature got a hold of me and
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:07.920]  I think that's a great I mean you go read the full quotes here let me tell you
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:11.080]  let me tell you briefly then I go back to your calls what what Rick Perry did
[2:10:11.080 --> 2:10:16.440]  why I hate him so much because I didn't hate Rick Perry till he did this not for
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:21.680]  going to Bilderberg group not for supporting the handover of 8,000 miles
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:28.960]  of Texas roads to Central Spain not for passing franchise taxes on businesses
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:32.800]  estate income tax on businesses and a bunch of other taxes not for being
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:37.800]  completely phony I just thought he was another political prostitute another
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:42.200]  unsavory creature of Carl Rove who got him to leave the Democratic camp and to
[2:10:42.200 --> 2:10:49.520]  stop working for Al Gore in 1990 or 91 but I remember when they couldn't get
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:56.200]  merc and their Gardasil shot in 2006 they couldn't get it on the market and they
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:11:00.920]  had trials you just type deaths in the trials of Gardasil they had deaths all
[2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:07.320]  over the US dozens and dozens and dozens now it's in the hundreds and if you
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:11.200]  didn't die people had blood pouring out of every orifice every poor dripping
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:18.920]  blood paralyzed convulsions foaming at the mouth just type in Gardasil side
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:24.520]  effects and I mean you you'll see it in fact guys type into the search engine
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:31.120]  right now Gardasil deaths foaming at the mouth coma and that should get a maybe
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:34.640]  seen is a world nut daily both at somewhere headlines and so we're all
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:39.120]  I'm interviewing women in studio who are paralyzed for months and still can't move
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:43.480]  their arm you know I haven't been studio who barely survived it in the trials and
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:47.240]  I'm reading about cheerleaders dying from it and then Rick Perry comes out and
[2:11:47.240 --> 2:11:54.000]  says it's the law in Texas you will take this shot it's gonna save girls and I
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.160]  went well number one there's not a law he put it on the list of recommended at
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:02.040]  the state health department which the schools then say is part of your
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:07.240]  requirement to go to school but it's a policy not a law and they can't make you
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:11.480]  but then the control freaks want you to still act we as to something says okay
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:15.240]  fine you don't have to just fill out this waiver form and then we keep a list
[2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:22.840]  of you dissenters at the health department but there's no law for that and
[2:12:22.840 --> 2:12:25.680]  again my children have been home schooled and private school the private
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:28.960]  schools always ask for it they always say give us the waiver we say no we show
[2:12:28.960 --> 2:12:33.680]  him the law no waiver needed they say wow thank you for teaching us principles
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:42.360]  don't know this now so he runs this hoax there's several issues here saying
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:47.880]  it's the law you've got to take it if we just type in Rick Perry Gardasil it'll
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:54.320]  come up to associated press Merck Perry ties run deep it's gets got all the
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:57.800]  stuff in it as well there it is CDC reports there's controversy for Merck's
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:04.800]  Gardasil vaccine that's ABC I want to show folks Gardasil foaming at the mouth
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:10.240]  Gardasil comas that should get it for I want to say bleeding and comas I want
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:21.640]  you to see it now continuing here with with the point I was getting to I'll
[2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:28.800]  tell you how to search it search this deaths in Gardasil trials and then that
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:32.600]  brings up the headlines about blood and comas and flopping around and bleeding
[2:13:32.600 --> 2:13:36.400]  out of every orifice there's also videos on YouTube on the news if you can stand
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:40.600]  and look at little girls blood pouring out of every orifice now it's basically
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:47.200]  like a bullet-style death now now the issue is he knew all of this he knew
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:51.640]  all of this Merck said well we can't put it on the market India did trials and
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:56.320]  refused Russia did trials everybody tried it people died so who do they find
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:14:01.400]  in the whole world to a run a hoax and tell you it's the law you got to take it
[2:14:01.400 --> 2:14:06.360]  and then be sit there and watch people die and get Guillain berets and flop
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:12.040]  around and have convulsions what do you do
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:19.680]  well they went to a state called Texas and they found a man called Rick Perry
[2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:24.720]  who not only would he mandate it for all schoolgirls 12 and under now they
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:29.840]  try to mandate boys in Texas the whore media every radio station every TV
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:34.400]  station complicit little prostitutes who will do whatever they're told and love
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:37.960]  putting makeup on being seen on TV or being heard on the radio they probably
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:42.440]  kill their own kids to do it I mean this is a scum of the earth every outlet out
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:47.080]  there ran the headline it's the law the governor says he orders it he's your boss
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:51.240]  and people lined up and the deaths began and the people started rebelling the
[2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:55.440]  legislature had to come in and pass a law explaining to people that it's not the
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:05.600]  law that you got to take this shot now that's the type of person that we have
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:13.520]  in Texas that's the type of individual that we have who said he wasn't going to
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:17.440]  run and pledge and always meant to break the pledge to pick people's
[2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:22.120]  interest in him like he's some type of reluctant hero this guy is a complete
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:26.960]  sickening joke and now this isn't a public reversal he got asked at a press
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.400]  conference and said well I should have handled that better because the news is
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:34.760]  saying this is really hurting him that he's this big libertarian Texan who
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:40.720]  wants to force you to take experimental drugs that Gardasil put out by Merck that
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:44.200]  they wanted to dump on the market but couldn't because this is what happened
[2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:49.600]  when a governor puts it on the list of recommended vaccines mandated as the
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:54.240]  word and the media went along with that hoax to tell everybody that they had to
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:59.560]  take it again just as complicit in the murder and the maiming when he comes out
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:04.240]  and mandates it vaccine liability federal fund kicks in the 10 plus
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:07.800]  billion dollars they've got they quietly pay people off with so they could dump a
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:11.480]  drug they knew was going to maim and kill folks and have federal protection
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:16.600]  because a governor mandated it that's what the federal law states of a
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:21.240]  governor or the president or congress mandate something then the vaccine if
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:24.360]  there's a public health mandate if government says we want you to take
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:27.360]  this well the vaccine makers said well then you've got to cover us well they
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:34.240]  went and sought the government mandate to dump a live virus injection listen
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:38.600]  do this do world net daily Gardasil and it'll come up if I I'll show everybody
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:43.120]  right now watch this there it is death toll linked to Gardasil vaccines rises
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:47.520]  complications include shock foaming at the mouth convulsions and coma awesome
[2:16:47.520 --> 2:16:51.000]  you found it there's also an ABC news when this got it I'm not just saying
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:54.680]  blood pours out every orifice here to get your attention this is what it does
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:58.480]  hundreds and hundreds dead
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:05.360]  we got Warren Buffett coming out saying we got a raised taxes on the rich he
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:08.680]  means somebody making more than you somebody making a hundred thousand a
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:12.160]  year while he's exempt from the taxes that's coming up to I just can't handle
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:15.640]  it anymore these people make me want to throw up and Rick Perry makes me want to
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:21.200]  vomit I got a lot of big breaking news here oh nobody wants to dominate the

[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:29.360]  system yeah let them cut corners but pretty soon there's nothing left of
[2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:35.400]  the Constitution and so the establishment in time magazine news week
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:38.720]  everywhere you heard that police officer call in earlier he was shocked by the
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:42.360]  image of the Constitution being shredded on the cover to time magazine with the
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:47.520]  message does it matter yeah it matters more now than ever you notice as it goes
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:51.840]  away like oxygen out of the room all of our liberties and freedoms and
[2:24:51.840 --> 2:24:57.560]  blessings are gone and now they're selling getting rid of it up completely
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:01.440]  that that'll bring the prosperity back oh yeah it's great in North Korea and
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:08.960]  Mexico and places where they don't have any due process oh it's real good all
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:13.160]  right I'm gonna go to Merrill Paul Alex Paula and Tim and I want to try to go a
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:15.960]  little quicker because I do have to get to the world news the financial news
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:19.440]  there's a bunch of other breaking news that's just blowing me away right now
[2:25:19.440 --> 2:25:28.080]  but I want to go to your calls I just want to point out to people that I
[2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:33.600]  intended to when I was fishing this morning at like 6 to 7 30 just went
[2:25:33.600 --> 2:25:39.440]  fishing real quick with the kids down the street that I was gonna come in here
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:43.360]  and talk about all the positive things and I have talked about a lot of positive
[2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:47.360]  stuff today but perhaps I'll just shoot a special report for prison planet dot
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:51.480]  TV going over all the positive things that have happened because I need to
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:56.880]  categorize it and really give you a progress report from from my perspective
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:00.880]  but we're giving the globalist one hell of a fight you know the biggest thing
[2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:05.880]  that tyrants do is first they tell you there's no good and evil so you don't
[2:26:05.880 --> 2:26:09.320]  have a moral judgment so you're rudderless so they can get away with
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:17.640]  whatever they want but they also break your will they train you to just accept
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:23.160]  more and more to the point of it's abnormal that when I see Politico and
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:29.680]  Fox and CNN and others not even mention Ron Paul in the poll results the
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:34.640]  straw polls in Iowa and I showed examples earlier I mean that is brazen
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:39.560]  it's brazen that when Ron Paul wins polls on Fox they won't show them or that
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:43.440]  CNN was caught using a fake poll and Ron Paul had one another poll a month ago
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:48.640]  and got caught I mean they're not just ignoring him because they're scared
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:53.720]  they're running scared well that's a big positive right there I mean they're
[2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:59.960]  having to absolutely pull out all the stops and just hope that you don't get
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:08.320]  upset about them really abusing you abusing me I mean I am flabbergasted as
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:13.680]  bad as I know these people are that they are this brazen I use that word a lot
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:22.040]  brazen naked hoodspa arrogance in your face hidden in plain view I don't know
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:28.920]  but people ask how does stuff get so bad in North Korea by increments in Russia
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:33.840]  how to get so bad by increments in Nazi Germany by increments in Cuba by
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:41.200]  increments in Venezuela by increments in Rome by increments to Marouche by
[2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:50.760]  increments and again all I've got going for me is that I started reading history
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:55.280]  for entertainment I was about five six years old and I could barely read my
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:28:02.800]  parents had countless time-life books you know do they have these leather
[2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:08.440]  bow ones about the West and it was all gunfights and the history of saloons in
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.160]  the West and they had a big World War two's collection and a big World War
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:16.600]  one collection and they had a Nazi collection and a Soviet collection and
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.560]  by the time I was about 10 because we had a television but we weren't allowed
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:25.200]  to watch it except dinner you know before dinner when my mom was cooking she'd
[2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:29.800]  she'd watch the news they let me watch Shakespearean plays and things on PBS
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:34.600]  sometimes but our and in the summer she let me watch Godzilla week me and my
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:37.560]  friends you know sit there and eat baloney sandwiches and watch that then
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:41.520]  she said now go go to the local pool get out of here go play but but the point
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:48.160]  is is that I read hundreds of history books and I got addicted to those and
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:52.280]  then I started reading hundreds and hundreds of others big thick you know
[2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:57.200]  not not not illustrated time-life stuff which was pretty heavy reading in its
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:03.200]  own right when you're six seven eight nine ten years old but I read rise and
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:07.040]  fall the third Reichshire I read order of the death said Heinz Hubble I read the
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:11.000]  mind of Adolf Hitler secret British wartime report he classified in 66 I
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  read part of rise in decline of the Roman Empire I couldn't quite make all
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:24.160]  that out when I was like 10 well you couldn't get me to do schoolwork you
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:30.000]  get me to read history books because it was so action packed and then I started
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:33.560]  going to college and I and I and I saw Terry being set up I was like I've read
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:37.320]  about this what you're doing you're they look at me in the eye because they're
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:40.600]  the little tyrants their little control freaks they get off on the fact that
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:44.280]  other people aren't aware and all I've ever tried to do is warn people since

[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:43.760]  how you doing pretty good what's your view on all these topics we've been
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:51.560]  covering oh god man you really hitting hitting hard on it I I really agree with
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:57.920]  you I mean I don't know what else to say I had a couple points today a lot of
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:02.960]  people don't realize you know they support this gun control and they just
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:08.800]  don't realize that the ultimate goal is to disarm us to disarm and implement
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:15.040]  tyranny you know Janet Reno is quoted as saying of waiting periods are step
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:21.240]  registration is only a step prohibition of private firearms as a goal by the way
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:25.600]  that's on record that was in a letter to the Brady campaign Obama's on record for
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:30.440]  a total gun ban the violence policy center handgun control link the Brady
[2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:35.400]  Center they admit abolition of individual ownership of guns that's in the UN
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:41.000]  unidire treaty and then when we talk about it the George Soros outfits make
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:44.280]  fun of us like it doesn't exist they know full well it does that's what I mean
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:50.320]  these are duplicitous anti-liberty scum who admit their intentions to
[2:34:50.320 --> 2:34:54.600]  themselves and then we say listen no more gun control you want our guns and
[2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:58.760]  they go we just want to be reasonable that's what I mean folks their
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:06.520]  tyrants their scum stop being conned wake up we're in trouble damn right we
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:12.560]  are oh anyway sir there's another one from Sarah Brady she says our task of
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:18.320]  creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.520]  have been totally disarmed she said that on the house floor that went out live on
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:28.160]  C-span and then it was published in what education corner like yep let's try it
[2:35:28.160 --> 2:35:34.720]  in 1994 yeah total filth I know I know listen notice they're massing their
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:39.440]  weapons against us well they don't want us to have weapons I'm sorry go ahead
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:44.080]  sir look at Britain I mean look what's happening there if they had guns they
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:48.520]  could stand up and defend their business well they think it's weird that a man
[2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:52.520]  these people want to own guns of course we do in every case in history if you
[2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:57.880]  don't own guns you're a slave you're you the state has to protect you from the
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:02.080]  giant welfare class they've created oh it's totally sick anything else so
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:08.680]  Merrill um just keep up the good work I'm fully behind you and you know my
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:15.040]  family thinks I'm crazy but I would like to know one thing is what movie would
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:23.000]  you recommend to wake people up I would have to say Obama deception in game I
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:27.800]  appreciate your call Merrill Merrill but any salesman will tell you the hardest
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:32.120]  people to sell are folks that know you Rick Perry likes to quote it it's true
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:39.160]  a prophet's not known in his own country and your family is gonna think you're
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:43.440]  showing off to him or they changed your diapers and matter of it was 40 years
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:49.080]  ago and I just wouldn't waste your time with your family a lot of times when
[2:36:49.080 --> 2:36:52.840]  you're nice to people and like I really want to warn you they take it as like
[2:36:52.840 --> 2:36:58.320]  you're weak and they're they're they're rebuffing you makes them feel good quite
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:03.640]  frankly if families to mean to you unless it's your wife or whatever how
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:06.800]  about you don't talk to them for six months that'll get me know this is
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:11.760]  serious business here this country's going to hell in a handbasket you're in
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:15.840]  1939 Germany telling him Hitler isn't good and they're laughing at you around
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:20.680]  the dinner table you know I'm not saying Trump top the table over but you know
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:24.760]  what desperate times take desperate measures and years ago I'd say just
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:31.720]  ignore them but but the tyranny is so out in the open now do people have any
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:37.160]  idea what it means when there's no Bill or rights or Constitution it's like
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:42.160]  they're not being a Hoover dam and your house is built down at the bottom what
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:45.520]  happens to the dam suddenly disappeared you'd be in 500 feet of water in
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:51.600]  seconds if they can torture people they can launch wars without any type of
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:57.080]  approval from Congress if the ATF can put new gun laws in place without laws
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:01.960]  if Rick Perry can say it's the law take a shot knowing good and well it's been
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:06.400]  killing people and there's not even a law he just says it and the whole media
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:11.160]  Texas got behind him and the national news and said yeah it's the law take it
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:17.240]  and people started dying they were like yeah and calling us kooks and nuts but
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:21.800]  you know what four years later he's running scared from it lawsuits are all
[2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:27.200]  in place and hardly anybody's taking that shot anymore see it's only tough to be
[2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:34.080]  right up front what is it Mark Twain said in the beginning a patriot is a
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:41.360]  scarce man in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man I'm trying to remember the
[2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:45.160]  exact full quote I start trying to speed up so I get to your calls and I start
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:49.860]  babbling guys pull up the Mark Twain quote for me Mark Twain a patriot is a
[2:38:49.860 --> 2:38:58.280]  scarce man in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:04.600]  scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him because then
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:10.720]  it cost nothing to be a patriot yep there it is Mark Twain quotes in the
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:15.200]  beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and
[2:39:15.200 --> 2:39:20.320]  scorned see I'm always paraphrasing it in the beginning of a change the
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:24.920]  patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:29.640]  succeeds the timid join him for then it cost nothing to be a patriot that was in
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:44.440]  his notebook in 1904 I mean people I have sat there with family and most my
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:47.800]  family are really great awake people but I've sat there with family year after
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:54.560]  year and said you ought to invest in gold and they and they laugh at me as it
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:58.000]  goes up and the next year I see him and I say gold's gone up again and they
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:06.640]  laugh again and the higher gold goes the bigger idiot I am the rider I am and
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.000]  now when I see those people I don't bring up the gold issue they bring it up
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:17.960]  and laugh more now see in the old days a bad decision would mean you'd freeze the
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:26.760]  death or be killed by lions or starve in the old days no matter what culture
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:31.000]  people were real close to reality real close to the where the rubber meets the
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:36.720]  road only in this modern decadent society could could could could cowardly
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:43.000]  people giggle and snicker but when they giggle and snicker looking at me they
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:47.720]  are almost crying they're upset they're scared they're thinking this guy has
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:52.240]  been right about everything and so I'm going to giggle and snicker kind of
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:59.240]  like gallows humor to make themselves feel like they're on top of things that's
[2:40:59.240 --> 2:41:03.920]  what they do and it's it's it's pathetic to the point of I won't even go
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:08.840]  around those people now not because I even hate them it's I don't want to be
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:14.400]  in their presence because people like that are going to buy whatever they're
[2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:18.920]  told you know a lot of you have seen the footage the films of Jews and other
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:24.560]  people being run into dirt pits and shot in the back of the head and I'm
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:27.000]  sure you've seen the footage of the naked women with their babies in their
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  arms being run in there humiliated and being shot in the head and people say
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:36.040]  why did they put up with it because by increments they put up with it if you'll
[2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:47.840]  put up with one inch of tyranny you'll take a million miles and so there are
[2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:54.040]  many people listening right now that would actually to get the approval of
[2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:57.920]  a man in a black uniform would tie their own two-year-old's arms to a post
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:03.760]  before they're shot I mean I I've watched a lot of newsreels raw newsreels
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.080]  that we've actually purchased them from the National Archives I have watched
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:12.720]  hours of newsreels of Nazi executions I've also seen some Soviet executions they
[2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:17.280]  weren't as prolific at documenting and as the Nazis and in most cases the men if
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:21.360]  they were still dressed would take their hats off and and and bow to the Nazis
[2:42:21.360 --> 2:42:26.600]  and try to try to jog perfectly to get their approval and and and we're very
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:30.160]  proud of themselves have they stood up straight to be shot not me ladies and
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:35.440]  gentlemen number one I wouldn't be in that position I'd have been dead a long
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:41.600]  time ago taking a bunch of people with me that's a and B if I would have gotten
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:44.400]  the position of a tasered me or whatever in a month later I'm out of jail
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:47.960]  being run into a bit when I was running by one of the Nazis with all of my
[2:42:47.960 --> 2:42:52.360]  hatred I would grab them and bite their nose off I I would have enough strength
[2:42:52.360 --> 2:42:55.680]  at that point to break their neck with my bare hands any of you can do that I've
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:00.600]  just turned it loose I will not sit here and suck on the gun barrel before you
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:04.960]  blow my brains out you understand me I am not under your mind control I broke
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:12.720]  my conditioning a long time ago and it's time for people to be born again hard
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:16.880]  that's a line from Full Metal Jacket but that's an old saying they had I read
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:20.160]  back in the 50s and 60s the Marine Corps people who are really weak but
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:24.320]  finally went through their pain and woke up and found the strong side it's time
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:28.880]  to be born again hard it's time to get your mind hard and stop being chicken
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:33.520]  necks just because you live in denial doesn't mean all this evil in the
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.320]  swirling around you trying to get rid of the last bits of the Constitution so it
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:46.560]  can run wild on us I am not gonna run into any physical pit or psychological pit
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:52.120]  and lick your boots do you understand that I want that straight I want that
[2:43:52.120 --> 2:43:58.080]  understood Paul in Florida you're on the air go ahead how are you sir good I am a
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:03.040]  Navy veteran from the I was active during the Carter administration and I've
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:06.600]  heard you talk about the Rand Corporation and I applaud you because
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:12.920]  you're you're really close there that's the crux of the biscuit right there I've
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:22.840]  also been in and around CPS there in Austin had my child kidnapped and I
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:28.040]  grew up on the Pacific Missile Test Center at my 18th and 19th birthday on
[2:44:28.040 --> 2:44:32.600]  the San Nicolas Island you should ask your friend Jesse about it and I think
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:37.680]  people should Google it and find out more about it the Rand Corporation was
[2:44:37.680 --> 2:44:43.560]  really embedded in America from the beginning and and I'm sure you catch a
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:47.880]  lot of flak for that because you're over the target I applaud you applaud your
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:54.720]  patience and just stop and waking people up for 30 plus years and it's so much
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:59.400]  easier when I can refer to somebody like you and say hey just go listen to him
[2:44:59.400 --> 2:45:05.120]  just go ahead for an hour and I like what you're doing and I'd love to support
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:11.800]  you in any way I can well thank you so much sir yeah the Rand Corporation has
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:16.800]  really diagrammed in the last 60 years much of what our country is today the
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:24.400]  federalization of police everything and at the end of the day they are nihilistic
[2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:33.160]  atheists who believe in a soulless world and they believe in a one-world
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:39.480]  government and they believe in the end of the family and everything decent and I
[2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:43.680]  don't know what else I can say anything else sir well I can you know I got to
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:47.880]  look at one of their operations manual when I was just a kid and it shocked me
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:52.600]  it woke me up and is a little bit more than a 19 year old can handle and you
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:57.520]  know I've been as I when I went home you know my native Detroit and started
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:01.600]  telling my friends oh my god guys you are not gonna believe this and they
[2:46:01.600 --> 2:46:07.480]  didn't and I plot the way you stitch it all together and you are certainly over
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:13.120]  the target what what particular probably a classified Rand document what did the
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:18.680]  document pertain to oh it was just how they were gonna dumb down America what
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:22.960]  they were gonna use how they were gonna do it what weapons be they mind weapons
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:29.400]  be they physical weapons be they chemical weapons Eli Lilly was tied into it
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:34.840]  quite deeply you know they're they're you know you're right I shouldn't get mad
[2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:38.840]  at the public and then that was another epiphany I have on a daily basis but
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:45.200]  never articulated I get mad at people and call them jellyfish what I'm just a
[2:46:45.200 --> 2:46:49.640]  little more resistant than most people you are as well they've put poison and
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:54.160]  chemicals on record in everything there's a reason men don't look like men
[2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:58.880]  there's a reason IQs are dropping I mean these people are so evil and that's what
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:04.840]  I said earlier it's that we can't recognize it and Rand and others pointed
[2:47:04.840 --> 2:47:08.120]  out they said Hitler moved too quick we're not gonna line you up in ditches
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:13.520]  and shoot you we're gonna line your soda pop cans with this vial a and give you
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:17.880]  cancer and sterilize you we're gonna put it in your GMO we're gonna put it in
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.200]  your water we're gonna put it in your sodium fluoride water and we're gonna
[2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:27.360]  hurt you and isn't that the ultimate form of domination to just slowly poison
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:32.760]  and kill people and and they love the unknown the un-total pain all the death
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:38.440]  all the sorrow all the untimely deaths all the all the adult brains all the
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:42.520]  brain damage it's just beautiful to them because to control freaks if you're a
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:47.200]  David Rockefeller or a or a or a Zbigniew Brzezinski or a Warren
[2:47:47.200 --> 2:47:50.960]  Buffett they can just walk down the street they always act like you on TV
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  interviews with ice cream cones are little sweet guys that care about you
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:56.640]  and they just get to look at everybody and think about what they're doing to
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:02.000]  everybody and Bill Gates is to wears little glasses and smile and act real
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:06.720]  cute to everybody and these are mass murdering killers it's so much fun to
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:14.720]  them isn't it you know all truth goes through three stages opposite you know
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:21.120]  ridicule first and opposition and then acceptance look at Rick Perry anybody
[2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:25.080]  doubts they're trying to kill us they knew for a year and a half Gardasil was
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:28.200]  killing people they couldn't get any country to approve it so they had Rick
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:33.600]  Perry take an experimental vaccine and order it given to children so that once
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:38.800]  it was mandated they got protection I mean Rick Perry is a conscious child
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:45.840]  murderer and I got to have all these little chicken-necked you know the
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:52.000]  types I'm talking about milk toast fake Christian people sit there and send me
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:56.560]  emails about how I'm against a man of the Lord don't they know that the devil
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:00.320]  masquerades is an angel of light it'll quote scripture better than the other
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:04.560]  angels don't they know they don't know it they're a bunch of abominable I'm
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:09.280]  sorry they're not abominable they are drug-addled zombies anything else you'd
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:15.400]  like to add you know I would say that they can be taught and not nobody but
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:21.760]  nobody is exempt from waking up and it's what you do when you wake up
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:27.320]  it's how you stand opposed after it what else I agree with you exactly what

[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:20.320]  hardcore right now and I got all their documents where they admit that they're
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:24.440]  they're doing it that that's what's so sick Aaron Dyke said a 30-minute report

[2:55:28.280 --> 2:55:33.720]  200 million that have watched that report I've done almost three hours of
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:38.760]  radio and haven't plugged a sponsor a book a video anything you believe in
[2:55:38.760 --> 2:55:41.840]  what we're doing please buy the t-shirts the books the videos get them out to
[2:55:41.840 --> 2:55:46.120]  people there at infowars.com we believe in what we've covered here I could tell
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:49.960]  you buy gold and silver from Ted Anderson but the lost leader stuff that he
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:54.560]  promotes here on air he might make 3% on and that's only because he buys the
[2:55:54.560 --> 2:55:57.360]  silver and gold when it dips and then sells it to you when it's high at the
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  old price you know the pitch the pitch is reality the pitches it's a great deal
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:04.720]  and in closing before I end the official radio show and come back in
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:09.960]  overdrive and take some calls Ted Anderson briefly gold is shot back up

[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:31.360]  down by raising the reserve requirements but that didn't last very long and
[2:56:31.360 --> 2:56:35.360]  obviously the country's problems haven't been solved and that doesn't happen
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:39.760]  gold and silver is going to continue to rise just a few stories of Bloomberg

[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:27.440]  listener I love them what you're doing I wanted to call you from the state of
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:32.560]  Indiana where we got FEMA Center from Beach Grove and Mitch Daniels seven I
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:38.240]  69-dollar throat to split our state right in half I wanted to call in and just
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:42.720]  talk about something really quick I didn't start waking up to you until
[3:00:42.720 --> 3:00:47.520]  about three or four years ago when you were talking about AmeriCorps and City
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:51.560]  Corps and all this stuff that they were trying to shove down our throats at that
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:57.560]  time I worked at a hotel and we had the AmeriCorps contract for Indiana and all
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:04.080]  of these it was a it was a really weird experience all these servile weird I
[3:01:04.080 --> 3:01:08.440]  don't even want to explain it would come in and and they want everything for
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:12.360]  free but they were still working for the government and standing for what the
[3:01:12.360 --> 3:01:17.640]  government stood for and couldn't understand that left-right paradigm and
[3:01:17.640 --> 3:01:21.240]  I haven't heard you talk about it for a while and I kind of wanted to get your
[3:01:21.240 --> 3:01:26.240]  opinion on on their propaganda and getting out into the community and
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:31.680]  thinking that government's phenomenal you know well Obama tried to activate his
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:37.240]  multi-million-person goon squad but when they didn't instantly get free houses
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:42.160]  and free cars and free gas none of them showed up so he's gone from being as
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:46.840]  they called him the savior in the news the Christ actually in the US national
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:51.080]  media that he might have been Jesus there was actual talk of that to now the
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:54.000]  lowest approval rating ever for a president two and a half years in
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:59.760]  almost three years in now and so that took place so they've gone with the
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:06.280]  model of the TSA with local police under their command setting the precedent
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:12.560]  for these domestic checkpoints and then they'll also have gaggles of Boy Scouts
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:17.920]  and welfare people in little red uniforms that we show an Obama deception
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:22.320]  for the Republic running around bossing and taddling and and and and
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:26.880]  knitting mainly it's like a nitty force you know the New World Order's main
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:32.320]  forces are are are are Limpris and men with pot bellies for some reason and
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:35.440]  that's their strike force but two Americans were like oh you have a pot
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:41.120]  belly oh they roll over so don't ask me why but that's I mean you you seem like
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:44.960]  you described them that way it's a certain like you know smiley twinkly
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:50.160]  eyed type person that rules up this whole system but that's basically where
[3:02:50.160 --> 3:02:54.600]  all that is going anything else it's really weird how you actually when you
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:59.440]  dive into believing and knowing exactly what you're saying is true how much you
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:04.520]  see that I moved to a hospital and just got let go for other reasons but I
[3:03:04.520 --> 3:03:08.520]  refused to take the vaccines that they were trying to shove down our throat
[3:03:08.520 --> 3:03:11.920]  like see they can't fire for that so they always fire you two months later for
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:16.160]  something else that's exactly what happened I find the waiver and they
[3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:20.360]  said well you why aren't you taking it I said well it has my mirror soul in it
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:26.720]  and they said well my mirror soul is good for you I said it's terrible it gives
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:31.440]  you cancer and they go oh you you're one of those I said well look at this nut
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:38.200]  Martha he thinks mercury isn't good for him this Alex is crazy these people are
[3:03:38.200 --> 3:03:45.440]  nuts oh look the insert says it causes brain damage he knows how to read look
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:51.520]  Rob Paul's winning almost all the polls these crazies think he can win see the
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:55.920]  mind game they play I'm sorry and by the way they've got 20 new vaccines I saw
[3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:58.760]  a report that they want to make mandatory in the next five years by
[3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:02.540]  mandatory they so I guess if you go to work in a hospital now it's like I take
[3:04:02.540 --> 3:04:07.640]  shots every day at lunch I'm sorry go ahead well as soon as as soon as that
[3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:12.680]  whole slime campaign happened through the hospital I got out all your videos
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:16.200]  on their mirror song vaccines and everything to everybody and a bunch of
[3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:19.960]  nurses quit and when they said well who told you that I'm yourself bad it came
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:26.200]  back to me so it's a real disgusting problem but don't worry that you got
[3:04:26.200 --> 3:04:29.200]  fired at least you got a bunch of people to quit over the fact that they were
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:33.320]  lied to now those nurses will go to other hospitals and I'll refuse it's like
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:37.400]  Rick Perry murdering all these kids in Texas and now it's a big national news
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:41.120]  that he knew it was gonna kill him but he did it because he's a he's a literal
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:46.880]  vampire devil worshiping scumbag maggot agent of Satan I'll see you back
