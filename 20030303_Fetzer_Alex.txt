[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  Dotting the landscape from coast to coast with wonderful AM and FM affiliates,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  simulcasting on the internet, and on Global Shortwave, and also on four powerful satellites.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones, and we are joined by our guest, Dr. Jim Thetzer. The website, AssassinationScience.com.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  We have a link to it on InfoWars.com. I know we have John and David and Pat and Tom and many others.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  Holden, we'll get to your calls early in the show. I'll do a part two interview with Dr. Thetzer,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  who's a professor from beautiful Duluth, Minnesota. Back on with me in the noon hour, central Friday.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  We're also riding shotgun with us for as long as we'd like to. Another host here on the network,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  a syndicated talk show host in his own right, Erskine, with Erskine overnight.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  And I haven't even gotten to a lot of the news today. I'm going to have to throw these news items out
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]  and get responses from our guests and the listeners on that as well.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  The tyranny's just hitting us from every side, and it's dizzying at a certain point.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  Dr. Thetzer, good to have you on the show, sir.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  It's been my great pleasure.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  We're going to talk about the Kennedy assassination and how it ties into 9-1-1. I've made this point.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  You've made this point. We'll talk about Northwoods. We'll talk about who really killed Kennedy,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  the ridiculousness of it, the fact that it was the government up one side and down the other.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  We'll tie it all together, and we'll take the calls. Let's bring Erskine back up.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  Erskine interviewed you, and it took two hours just to cover some of the information.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  Saturday night, again, we're honored to have you here.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  Erskine, where's a good place to start with Dr. Thetzer on this whole Kennedy assassination?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  Well, the thing is, it happened 40 years ago. This is old news. Who cares about it?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  Well, I'll tell you, you better care about it, because this was a coup d'etat of the United States government.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  They had an overthrow of the government, and the same people behind what happened then are now taking over today.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  The CIA was in large part behind that, and they put out so much disinformation,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  people running around saying, you know, we had Lee Harvey Oswald who did that all by himself, one lone gunman.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  Yeah, right. If you buy that, then let's talk about the Easter Bunny and some other things.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  Absolutely, totally ridiculous, but people were buying it at the time.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  Talk about your government lies, cover up disinformation.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  This isn't where it started, but this is where a lot started.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  Now, anybody who is brave and courageous enough to overthrow the United States government by killing the president
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  will not stop at a 9-1-1 or anything else.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  These people are totally ruthless, totally power-hungry, and now they've got it to where the American public is waving the flag
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  and waving their rights, anxiously turning over their freedom to the same people that killed our president,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  that have killed the Constitution, and that have totally changed our country.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  It's the exact same crowd, and that's it.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  The same military industrial complex. The serial killers are getting grittier and grittier.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  Dr. Butzer, what's really going on here? Who are we facing?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  Well, I think the key here, Alex, is something Erskine alluded to, namely the capacity to cover it up,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  because if you can falsify x-rays, substitute someone else's brain for the brain of the president of the United States,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  if you can reshoot the autopsy photographs, if you can alter the home movies and photographs of the assassination,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  if you have the capacity to dupe the American people about the assassination of their own president
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  in broad daylight in a major city in the United States, you have an awesome kind of power.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  And that's what was exercised in the case of 22 November 1963.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  And it's precisely because they were able to get away with such a blatant act of deception
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  that I think that the powerful forces involved here have been emboldened to perpetrate other similar deeds and to cover them up.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  And there's a few dates, key dates, 1913 Federal Reserve Act, 1933 War Powers Act, 1947 National Security Act.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  And then, of course, we have what happened in 1963 with the Northwoods document.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  This is part of the Kennedy assassination. It's all coming up with Dr. Jim Fetzer, the website.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  You'll want to check it out. It is AssassinationScience.com.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  We have a link to it on Infowars.com.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  Writing shotgun with me is Erskine. And your call is coming up with our guest.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us. You do not want to miss the next 55 minutes.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Couple of the headlines here. Associated Press. Jennifer L. Brown.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  Bioterrorism test set for rural Oklahoma. They claimed they were going to cancel it.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  Now they're back with a vengeance.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  It says the test is risk-free and may one day save lives, the government says.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  We're not here to stir up unwanted fear and anxiety in the community.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  General officials sent letters to about 600 residents living in three testing areas around Oklahoma City,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  telling them not to worry. They see a crop dust remaining.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  Dust puffs over their heads.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  In about 10 of the 20 articles I've seen in the AP and the Norman papers in the Daily Oklahoman,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  they said, we are going to be spraying you with the bacillus throngenesis,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  which can be dangerous for you, but that's okay.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  But now they don't mention it in this article.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  And then another interesting article.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  New scientists. Stupidity should be curbed, says DNA discoverer.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  Yeah, and he also last month called for national DNA database.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  They want to go ahead and start engineering us before birth. Licensing.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  See, this is the brave new world. It's all part of culture shock.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  They're trying to overwhelm us with every form of bizarre tyranny
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  and then say that we're crazy because we don't want to go along with it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  Just some key info to throw out there.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  Let's go to Dr. Jim Fetzer, expert on the Kennedy assassination
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  and the fact that this government was overthrown with a total military coup d'Ã©tat
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  because Kennedy had issued an executive order to get us out of the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  He issued Lincoln greenbacks with a red seal on them, debt-free money.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  He was getting us out of Vietnam.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  He said he was going to abolish the CIA and give a speech just saying
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  a dark force had taken over the government.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  And he also stood up to the Northwoods document, the U.S. government plan
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  with unanimous support up to his level to blow up jet airliners, commit sniper attacks,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  bomb D.C. to blame it on firing enemies.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  And we're riding shotgun is our good buddy Erskine.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  With Erskine overnight Saturday nights here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  Great show, incredible guest.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  And we've got a lot of callers holding.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  We'll get to you later. Stay there.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  Dr. Fetzer, just go over the basics here, the Bushes there involved in Texas, all of them.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  Give us just the rundown of the proof of the fraud of the story they put out
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  with Arlen Specter and the rest of it.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  Well, it's an enormous, sprawling, complex story, Alex.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  I think something everyone needs to understand is that George Herbert Walker Bush,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  who became President number 41, appears to have had a long history with the CIA
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  well before he was appointed its director, which of course was done with great public fanfare
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  claiming that this was the first time that a civilian who hadn't had a history with the agency
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  had received such an appointment.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]  Just out of nowhere.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  Just out of nowhere, but of course it appears to be poppycock.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000]  There are telling signs that Bush was intimately involved in the planning of the invasion of Cuba,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  the Bay of Pigs fiasco, where in fact it turns out the Soviets had learned a week before the assassination
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  the precise date at which it would take place.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]  The CIA had learned they knew and told everyone they wanted but not the President of the United States,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  the guy who most importantly needed to know.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  Two of the ships were rechristened, the Barbara and the Houston, before the invasion.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  The plan had a code name, Operation Zapata, which happened to be the family oil-drinking operation
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  for the Bush family out of Houston, and I believe that if in fact the operation had been a success,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]  they would have had oil-drilling concessions all over the Caribbean Basin.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  Documents were later revealed that showed that George Bush or the CIA had been briefed on the Bay of Pigs,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  and when the agency was confronted with this, they denied it, saying it was another George Bush.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  Well, there was another George Bush who worked for the agency, but he was a guy who sorted out files
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  and would not have been receiving reports on operations being conducted by the agency.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  All this is disturbing enough, but the fact is that the military played a crucial role here.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  In fact, if you want the bottom line on the assassination, the research I've been engaged in
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  with some of the best qualified people to ever study the case for the last ten years
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  indicates that the Secret Service set him up.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  The CIA, the mafia, and the military took him out, and the FBI covered it up,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  where the whole thing was orchestrated for the benefit of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  with financing from wealthy Texas oilmen.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  The motives were primarily three.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  One was to get in place the policies of Lyndon Johnson over those of JFK, including going to war in Vietnam.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  Another was to blame it on the Cubans.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  Oswald was being sheep-dipped, given a phony persona as a pro-Castroite, even a trip here.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  Just like McVeigh.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  An imaginary trip to Mexico to the Cuban embassy was staged, and in fact they had photographs
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  of the person who was pretending to be Oswald, which doesn't look remotely like him.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  They had tape recordings, which didn't sound at all like him.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  J. Edgar Hoover, of all people, actually distributed a memo to his agents in charge of the different operations for the FBI
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  that someone was impersonating him in Mexico City.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Well, the very existence of such a document, that somebody else was impersonating Oswald,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  implies the existence of a conspiracy when he turns out to be the guy they're going to nail for the assassination.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  Oswald himself actually appears to be on the second floor.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  He was observed before noon, at noon, at 1215, at 1225, down and around the lunchroom.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  He was confronted there by a motorcycle patrolman within 90 seconds of the assassination.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  He was perfectly normal. He wasn't out of breath.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  When he later left the building, he actually boarded the bus to head back to his rooming house.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  When the bus became clogged down in traffic, he exited the bus and went for a taxi.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  A little old lady wore the taxi, and Oswald graciously offered it to her.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  Must be the first time in history when an assassin has made his escape by public transportation.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  Well, it goes on and on, but that's all just the little extra niblets here on the side.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  Let's get into the assassination itself, and LBJ papers that morning already running the headlines
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  that he would be dumped by JFK, and then on top of it, go ahead.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  That's absolutely right, Alex. Richard Nixon was in town.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  In fact, the night before, there had been a social event at the home of Clint Murkison,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  one of the really rich and powerful oilmen in Texas at the time.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  An interesting cast of characters were there. H.L. Hunt was there,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  who described himself as the richest man in the world and may well have been.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  J. Edgar Hoover was there. He frequently came to Texas and would hobnob with these rich fat cats.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  In fact, these guys thought of themselves as the power center of the United States
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  because their oil gave them so much leverage and influence over politics.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  George Brown and Brown and Root Heavy Construction, now a subsidiary of Halliburton, he was there.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  When the Vietnam War went down, Brown and Root got the contract to dredge a new bay at Tamron Bay,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  even though Vietnam has many magnificent ports and they surely could have found an alternative
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  that didn't cost a billion bucks. Richard Nixon was there.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  Madeleine Duncan Brown, a mistress of Lyndon Johnson, by whom he had a son born in 1950.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  I've interviewed her. Lyndon came right out with all this to her.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  He did. I'm getting right to that, too. You're exactly right, Alex.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  Lyndon showed up late that night and these heavy hitters disappeared into a conference room.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  About 15 minutes later, when they broke up, he strode over to Madeleine
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  and she thought he was going to whisper sweet nothings in her ear.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  Instead, he said in a hateful tone of voice that after tomorrow,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  he wasn't going to have to put up with embarrassment from those Kennedy boys.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  On New Year's Eve, six weeks later, they had a rendezvous in the Driscoll Hotel in Austin, Texas,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  and she confronted him with rumors rampant in Dallas at the time that he'd been involved
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  since no one stood to gain more personally.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  He blew up at her and told her, Alex, that the oil boys and the CIA decided that Jack had to be taken out.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  Lyndon's involvement has been corroborated by Billy Saul Asti's Wheeler dealer involved in a lot of scandals
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  that made a lot of money for Lyndon, John Connolly and their cronies.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  He has given an interview with a French investigative reporter, William Raymond,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  that appeared in a French magazine whose title translates Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  saying that Lyndon was in deep trouble.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  He thought his political career was over.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  Jack, in fact, had already decided to drop him.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  There was going to be a vote on the Bobby Baker scandal.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  Bobby had been his chief administrative assistant when he was a majority leader in the Senate,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  and that vote was widely expected to tarnish Lyndon so badly that Jack couldn't possibly run with him again.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  But what Billy Saul added was that Lyndon had Cliff Carter, his chief administrative assistant,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  then come down to Dallas to make sure all the arrangements were in place for the assassination.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]  Let's talk about the shooting itself.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  Erskine, any time you want to jump in, go ahead.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  I think one of the key things is, as Dr. Fesser alluded to,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  is the connection between the CIA, the Mafia and the government,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  how they all were in bed together.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  This is a very important, significant part of the story that Dr. Fesser has brought out.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  That's absolutely right.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  I mean, it goes back to Eisenhower.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  In the waning days of the Eisenhower administration, when Castro had come to power,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  Eisenhower was apparently very upset about this, and he told the Joint Chiefs,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  in particular Lyman Lemnitzer, who was the chairman,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  that if they didn't have a legitimate reason for invading Cuba, they should make one up.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  Lemnitzer apparently took this to heart and solicited the assistance of Edward Lansdale,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  who was a one-star Air Force general at the time.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  Lansdale would become famous for assassinations all around the world.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  He was a very clever guy.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  He had a big role in Vietnam with the fortified Hamlet concept,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  which involved turning these agrarian communities in Vietnam into castle-like entities
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  as though they had a moat around them.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  Lansdale and others came up with schemes such as loading commercial airliner
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  full of college students flying it over Cuba and shooting it down,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  or blowing up the Atlas rocket that was going to take John Glenn into space
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  and blaming it on the Cubans.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  Jack was very dismayed by all these proposals.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  That's Northwood's plan.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  This is the Operation Northwood's exactly right.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  He was very disturbed by all this and had them all turned down.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  In fact, the Joint Chiefs became increasingly dismayed and felt that
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  Jack had betrayed them on several levels.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  For one, he had not supported a military invasion of Cuba, which they had unanimously supported.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  By the way, let me stop you, Doctor.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  By the way, unless anybody thinks, oh, these are good guys,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  you know what they have to do to fight communism,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  these very corporations the whole time were shipping weapons and oil and money
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  through the communists.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]  This was just their enemy they were going to use for their excuse for global domination.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  Go ahead.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  This is just like Halliburton in Iraq.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  Alex, as you well know, Cheney did a lot of business with Iraq.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  Rumsfeld went to Iraq and, you know, was very supportive.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]  Well, he's also the back man with nuclear material,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]  missile material to North Korea and Pakistan.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  This is all very, very serious stuff.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  But going back to Cuba, the chiefs were also upset
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  because John had signed an above-ground test ban treaty with the Soviet Union,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  which they unanimously opposed,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  and now he was pulling our troops out of Vietnam
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  where they thought we had to stand and fight communism.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  So it wasn't difficult for the chiefs to arrive at the conclusion,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  and they were already over the deep edge, as well,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  portrayed by the motion picture Doctor Strangelove.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  I was going to add, Doctor Fetzer, of course,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  you were a Marine Corps captain in Vietnam as well.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  I wasn't in Vietnam, but I was an artillery officer in the Corps at the time.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  All right, I was going over your bio.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  Stay right there, and we will be right back with our guest, Doctor Jim Fetzer.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  And just keep riding along with us, Erson,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  because I know you've got that clip, too, that ties into the Kennedy assassination.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  And yes, we'll get to your calls, so stay with us.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  Thanks for listening to the M2K Talk archives.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  And we are listener-supported with the honors system.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  We ask that you wait.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  Don't donate a dollar at a time.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  PayPal charges a 35-cent surcharge on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  Wait till you listen to five or ten, and then donate, please.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  All right, Doctor Fetzer is going to stay with us for the full hour.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  Erskine, who I really appreciate joining us,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  has this clip of when he interviewed someone involved.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  And understand the CIA brags that they go into all these countries
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]  and use organized crime as a bumper,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  plus they understand the lay of the land and are ruthless.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  And describe this clip you've got for us, Erskine,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  and then play it for us, and we'll go back to Doctor Fetzer.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  Okay, the clip that I'm going to play, and Doctor Fetzer's heard before,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  is from Bill Bonanno, who was the archetype for Sonny Corleone in the Godfather show.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  Bill knew nothing about and had no connection to the Kennedy assassination.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  It seems like it was the Giancana group out of Chicago
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  that was hired in large part by the CIA to do the assassination within the country,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  to why the reasons it was so good.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  But Doctor Fetzer has a lot of information about this up on his website.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  He has a lot of information at AssassinationScience.com.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  And you can also get his book, Murder in Dealey Plaza.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  But this is from the Godfather, Bill Bonanno, from Erskine Overnight.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  And I think you'll hear on this exactly what happened on the Kennedy assassination from the Godfather.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  I hope I can get that clip up for you, Alex.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  And again, folks, there's just mountains of evidence.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  Go ahead.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  Oh, here it is.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  I've detailed in one of the chapters in the book of how I came into this information
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  as to what was happening, what had happened in Dallas on that day.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  And I was in the Federal Correctional Institution of Terminal Island in San Pedro, California.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  And we were sitting around the yard with a bunch of fellows, some Cubans,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  and a fellow by the name of Johnny Roselli.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  And Johnny Roselli, this was in January, February of 1971.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  And Johnny was very upset with some of the people in his organization back in Chicago
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  and was saying things that he shouldn't have been saying.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  Among them was, you know, those guys left me out to dry.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  I was in the manhole.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  It took me 20 minutes to walk the labyrinth underneath, the tunnels underneath to get to the Trinity River.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]  It was my shot that got Jack, and they left me hanging out to dry.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  I'll never forgive them.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000]  When some of us heard this, you know, this was the kind of information that was really a burden
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]  and nobody wanted to have this information because it was long over.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  63 was the number of years before that.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  But I've been asked many times, do you believe that to be true?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]  And I said, of course I believe it to be true.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  And they asked me why I believe it to be true because I knew who I was talking with.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  Here we're talking to a guy by the name of Johnny Roselli who was involved in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  He was one of the shooters in that.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]  Why wouldn't I believe a man who has that kind of a background?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  Plus, we knew each other from the streets.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  Now, that's from Bill Bonanno when he was on Erskine Overnight.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  And the other thing that he said that I thought was so telling was Jack Rubenstein,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  who he knew as everyone knows as Jack Ruby, was as close to Sam Giancana as his pinky ring.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  Now, if you look at this, you look at the cover-up, you look at the FBI
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  and how that J. Edgar Hoover said there never was a mafia.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  And the whole story behind all of this, it all combines in, doesn't it, Jim?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]  Indeed it does.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]  How many times have we been lied to?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  Erskine, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  God bless you.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  You're on Saturday nights.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  Tell them the show time.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  It is on Saturday nights.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  It's 11 o'clock Mountain Time.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  Let's see, it goes on at...
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  11 o'clock Central.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  11 o'clock Central.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  All right.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]  Catch it.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  It's on Genesis Network.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  If we're not on your station, ask for us to be on.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  We'll be on there shortly.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  God bless you.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]  Great Erskine.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000]  Doctor, that's a good place to bring in the movie star's father because he was caught
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]  by the Dallas Morning Herald, a photograph.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  He's in prison for shooting a judge in the neck with a 243.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  Photographs were taken of him at the scene.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  He told people he was involved and later he got up.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  Tell us about Mr. Harrelson.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  Yes, yes.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  Well, just to give you my access route into this thing, I got to know the third of the
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  three tramps, a fellow named Chauncey Holt who had a long history with organized crime.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  Chauncey was a forger and a counterfeiter who was asked to prepare 15 sets of phony
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  Secret Service credentials for use in and around Dealey Plaza.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  He brought them there.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  He was also instructed that he was going to meet up with a couple of individuals and he
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:20.000]  brought phony ID for them too, which was tobacco, firearms, and alcohol ID and weapons.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  Those he met up with included Charles Harrelson, the father of Woody, the actor, and a fellow
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  he knew as Richard Montoya who appears to have been Carl Rogers, who is the subject
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  of the book, The Man on the Grassy Knoll.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]  Rogers appears to have murdered his parents with disposing of the bodies by plunging them
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  down the toilet in small pieces when the police caught up with him, but he was a step or two
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  ahead of them and they were unable to catch him.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]  But Chauncey said that they were all instructed to head for a boxcar behind the Grassy Knoll
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  after the event, which he had told was going to be a non-violent incident to attract attention
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  to our policy in Cuba.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]  Folks, Harrelson is in prison for killing a federal judge at 400 yards.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  All right, you can tell why we have to have him back up Friday with us, and he'll be on
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  for a couple hours on Friday because there's just so much evidence.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  But getting into Harrelson, I mean, I've got the photograph out of the Dallas Morning News
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  where a bunch of photos of him taken with the three bums.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  These clearly aren't bums, they're serious mafia-looking wasps with, you know, in the
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  trench coats, shifty-eyed, walking around from behind the Grassy Knoll, continuing with
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  Mr. Harrelson, who's in federal prison for an infamous crime, killing a federal judge.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]  Go ahead.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  That's right, that's absolutely right.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  Well, Chauncey told me there were quite an assortment of characters in Dealey Plaza on
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  this late morning afternoon, including a lot of mercenaries, assassins, and killers for
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  hire.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  He said there were more bad guys there than you'd meet at a Soldiers of Fortune convention,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  was how he put it.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  And I think a lot of them were there as distractions, so that if somebody started looking at this
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  case seriously, they'd have so many loose ends and leads to follow that it would be
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]  massively confusing.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  But in any case, yes, what happened was when they got down to the railway car, they were
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  told it would look as though it was locked, but actually it would be open.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  It did look locked, but it was open.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  They climbed in and discovered there were lots of weapons and explosives in the car.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]  Later, when they were being escorted through Dealey Plaza and Chauncey thought about it,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]  it occurred to him that it might have been the case that if the original plan for the
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]  patsy hadn't worked out, that they might have been taken and used as the fallback patsies.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  The CIA always had multiple plans.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  So that's absolutely crucial here, I think, Alex, is the military involvement.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  Chauncey told me that he thought the whole execution in Dealey Plaza had the aspects
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  of a military operation about it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  The 112th military intelligence unit, which ought to have been distributed throughout
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]  the city to control the crowd during the entire motorcade, had been ordered to step down.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]  That required a high-level command.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  The officer in charge, in fact, protested vehemently, but was nevertheless overruled.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  Let me stop you.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]  Harrelson also said that, yeah, I did it, then later shut up.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  You're absolutely right.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  Harrelson did at one point claim that he killed Jack Kennedy, by which I take it he meant
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  he fired the shot that entered Jack's right temple.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  This was a frangible or exploding bullet that set up shock waves that blew much of his brains
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  and skull out the back of his head, which had been weakened by another shot fired from
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  the Daltex building that entered the back of his head.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  This is after the driver, by the way, Alex, had brought the limousine to a halt, which
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  took place after bullets had begun to be fired.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  I mean, this was such an obvious indication of Secret Service complicity that the movies
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  of the assassination had to be altered to take it out, so that instead of seeing him
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]  bring the limo to a halt, Roy Tully, Oswald's supervisor in the Book Depository, for example,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  observed that turning the corner from Houston onto Elm, the driver, William Greer, had swung
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  out too widely and nearly hit a concrete abutment, and then he had to swing back into
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]  line, and that when he started down into Dealey Plaza, he pulled the limousine to the left
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  and halted, and I think he pulled it to the left to get Jack's head a little more exposed
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  to the multiple positions from which shooters were firing, which appear to have been at
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  least six in number.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  Jack actually was hit at least four times, and John Connally appears to have been hit
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  as many as three, and there were what appear to be three missed shots.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  And by the way, Connally always said that.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  He said, one bullet didn't hit me all these times.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  Yeah, Connally and his wife, Nellie, always insisted he wasn't hit by the same bullet,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  and in fact, Jack had already been hit.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]  Big John was turning back to his right, but couldn't see what was going on.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  He turned to his left, and that's when he felt his doubling up, and by turning to his left,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  when he was hit on the right side of his back, that shot could well have been fired from
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  the southwest corner of the Book Depository, not the northeast, where Oswald was alleged
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  to have been located.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  Unbelievable.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  Getting back to the military, LBJ was paying particular attention to the Secret Service
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  transmissions that day.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]  That's absolutely right.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  Ralph Yarbrough was riding with him.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]  In fact, there had been a big argument that morning over who should ride with the President
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  of the United States.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  Linden wanted Ralph Yarbrough, his liberal political opponent, to ride with Jack Kennedy,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  but Jack overruled him on the ground that the Chief Executive of the state ought to
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  ride with the Chief Executive of the United States, and I believe that this change in
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  plan simply occurred too late for the assassins to be notified, so that when they were shooting
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  at Connally, they actually intended to be shooting at Yarbrough, and it gives new meaning
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  to Connally's calling out, my God, they're going to kill us all.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  My God, they're going to kill us all.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  It was actually down on the second floor in the lunch room, waiting for a phone call,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  I think, that never came.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  The weapon he was alleged to have used couldn't even have fired the bullets that killed the
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  President because he was killed by the impact of high-velocity bullets.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  That's what this death certificate the Warren Commission concluded and other studies have
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]  shown, and the Mannlicher Carcano with a muzzle velocity of only 2,000 feet per second was
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  not a high-velocity weapon, so it couldn't have inflicted the rounds.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  Plus, it used copper-jacketed ammunition, not exploding bullets.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  You have multiple shooters, multiple locations.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  One shooter appears to be on the south end of the Triple Underpass.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  There were their above-ground sewer openings where a man could stand upright with a little
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  concealment at the top, a perfect shooting location.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]  That appears to have been the location for a shot that actually passed through the windshield
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]  on its way to Jack's throat, where it then fragmented apart, going upward and rupturing
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  this tough membrane over a compact part of the brain at the base called the cerebellum.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]  The membrane is known as the tantorum, a bullet that, when it passed through the windshield,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]  making a sound just like a firecracker.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  Alex, I've got a guy down the south who's going to old junkyards and firing bullets
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  through windshields, and it turns out they sound just like a firecracker.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]  And, of course, a lot of the witnesses said that the first shot sounded different than
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  the others.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]  It sounded like a firecracker.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]  What they appeared to have been hearing actually was...
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  Let's talk about the car, because I was watching Discovery Channel, and they actually admitted
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  this, but just passed right over it.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]  All the evidence, not just his brain, his body, and x-rays, but the car itself.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  Describe what happened to it.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  Well, the vehicle itself was taken back to Ford Motor Company in Michigan.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]  Already Monday, it was stripped down to bare metal, and the windshield was replaced.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]  We actually tracked down the guy who replaced the windshield and confirmed that it had a
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]  through-and-through bullet hole in it.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  Of course, this was a crime scene on wheels, where all kinds of evidence was being destroyed
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]  there outright.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  Lyndon had the thing rebuilt and repainted black, rather than the midnight blue that
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]  Jack Kennedy preferred, but he never rode in it.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  There was massive destruction of evidence.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]  They took it to Ford and broke the whole thing down, stripped it down to bare bones, and
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]  rebuilt it, and they kept using it.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  Paid Ford a million bucks for it.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]  Yeah, it was in the President's fleet of limos, but Lyndon never actually rode in that one
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  again.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]  Interestingly, right after the shooting had taken place, and Greer drove to Parkland Hospital,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  we have photographs of Secret Service agents getting a bucket and sponge and starting to
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]  wash the blood and brains out of limousine already, and the President hadn't even yet
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  been pronounced dead.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]  It's incredible.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  It's just unbelievable, and it goes on and on and on.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  How were the people on the Warren Commission rewarded?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]  Well, it was an interesting lineup.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  There were a couple of senior senators, there was no one on the Commission, by the way,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  who had any political sympathies with Jack Kennedy.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]  The only person who was not really rather conservative was the Chief Justice himself,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  Earl Warren, and Lyndon had strong-armed him into taking that position.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  If you think about it, it's ridiculous for him to have been serving in that capacity.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  If they'd actually done their job and there had been any indictments or a real investigation
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  conducted, then the case no doubt would have made its way through the court system and
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]  eventually come to the Supreme Court.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  Well, look at what the clerk, the specter got, Senator for life, look at what Ford got.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]  Yeah, Ford became President of the United States, of course, and Ford was actually known
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  as the FBI's man on the Commission.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  He would notify J. Edgar Hoover what directions they were going so Hoover could make sure
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  that he would slant the evidence the way he wanted to support the predetermined conclusion.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]  Ford actually was responsible for changing the description of a location of a wound,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  which was about five and a half inches below Jack's collar.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]  This appears to have been fired from the top of the County Records Building at a downward angle,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]  45 to 60 degrees.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]  A shallow shot only went in about as far as the second knuckle on your little finger.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]  He had that description changed to the base of the back of the neck so that it would make
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  the Arlen Specter's magic bullet theory, the idea that one of these bullets had traversed
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]  Jack's neck, come out his throat and gone into John Connally more plausible.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]  And then the bullet wasn't even bent up and anybody that's done a lot of shooting like I have,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  I mean, you fire bullets into water, there's more damage to it.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  Well, it's ridiculous.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  Not only did they assume an impossibility, namely that a bullet could have passed through
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  the neck without hitting any cervical vertebrae, which turns out to be an anatomical impossibility,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  but the wounds in Connally were multiple.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  He had a shattered rib, he had a busted wrist.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]  I mean, these are hard, bony impacts that would have deformed a bullet.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]  This bullet, nevertheless, as you observe, which they claim to have done all this damage,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]  was virtually pristine.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]  It had some slight longitudinal deformity, just like other test bullets that were fired
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  by the Warren Commission or the House Select Committee when it reinvestigated the case
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]  in 1978 into wads of cotton or buckets of water.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]  It was as though it hadn't hit anything.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]  And it goes on and on, and before we go, these calls have been holding patiently.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]  How does it all tie into 9-1-1?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]  Because it certainly does.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]  Well, the fact is that Oswald, being given this phony persona as a pro-Castro communist sympathizer,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000]  was supposed to lead to the American people rising up and demanding a military invasion of Cuba,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]  that we do it right this time.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]  Lyndon knew enough to know that they had tactical nuclear weapons, and he steered them away,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  but he gave them the war in Vietnam.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]  So it didn't play out in the way the Chiefs had planned.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]  But strewn throughout American history, Alex, we find incidents where phony events have been used
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]  as a pretext to get Americans into war.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]  The most recent being in 1991 when this young Kuwaiti girl appeared before Congress
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]  and later the United Nations to claim that she'd seen Iraqi soldiers coming into hospitals
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]  and taking infants out of incubators and leaving them there to die.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]  It was very emotional and very touching, except it turns out to have been untrue.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]  She was, in fact, a daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]  She had never been to Iraq, and she had been trained to do this by a public relations firm.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000]  Now, in relation to 9-1-1, even the House and Senate's own joint investigation led to the conclusion
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]  that the government had to have known what was coming.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]  In fact, Arlen Specter announced that they didn't just have vague impressions,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  they didn't just have dots to connect, they actually had blueprints of what was taking place.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]  By the amount of time the planes were there, Aaron, the complete lack of response,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  I mean, it's not as though the...
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  Well, they had to tell us that.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]  At first they said nothing, then the evidence came out and they,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]  Specter, oh, but it's a big accident, give us more funding.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  What Specter, and it's ironic, because Specter was a bad guy, you know,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]  in covering up in the case of Jack's assassination, but here in the case of 9-1-1,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]  he was actually trying to get the truth out.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]  Specter's report was suffocated in the news that day by the announcement by the administration
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]  that it was supporting the new Department of Homeland Security.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]  But when you think about it, Alex, no one knew yet what had gone wrong.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  There had been no investigation by the government.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  How can you have a solution to a problem if you don't know what the problem is?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]  And, of course, from the government's point of view,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]  the most charitable interpretation you could give is that the CIA and the FBI
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]  had all these massive communications problems and mock-ups,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]  but they weren't even included in the Homeland Security Department reorganization.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]  Plus, a plane that flew into Pennsylvania appears to have been shot down
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]  by our own people.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]  The dispute was distributed over six to eight square miles,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  but it should have been distributed over about a city block.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]  Several witnesses have reported seeing a mysterious white plane with no markings
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]  that circled around after the plane crashed.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]  Lots of the citizens out there reported hearing an explosion,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]  but the FBI, when it was investigated, didn't want to hear about it
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]  and apparently didn't write it down.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]  Well, it's just like TWA, but the people behind this new world order,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]  it's the Rothschilds, it's the Rockefellers, it's all those classic names,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]  and they've got their little minion servant families like the Bushes,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]  who are really Saxe-Coburgs, and that's what the British royal family really is,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000]  is German, and we just got hereditary mafia gangs running the entire country,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]  and now they want it all.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]  How do we stop them?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]  Well, I'll tell you, Alex, we've got to get this group out of office.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]  I mean, these are not Republicans and these are not Democrats.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]  I mean, if you think about a traditional Republican agenda,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]  it includes balanced budgets, it includes constitutional government,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]  it includes non-interventionist foreign policy.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]  These people are contradicting all of that.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]  The key players seem to include Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]  Elliott Abrams, Richard Perle, even Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000]  who all were participants in planning what is known as the New American Century.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]  If you go on my website and just scroll down to the Bush plan, that will take you directly to the...
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]  That was written in 2000, and it says global domination.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]  It says, quote, Saddam is a pretext.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]  That's absolutely right.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]  Written by them.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]  That's right, written by them, and now they're in place,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]  and in fact, the Bush administration is using it as a map for what they should do.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]  The amount of money in terms of a national defense increase
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]  is exactly the amount of money that Bush is budgeting for next year,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]  and the idea of dominating the world by going to the Middle East and taking control
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]  is a key precept of this plan for the New World Order,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]  which appears to have its roots, in turn, in a book published in 1997 by Zbigniew Brzezinski
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]  entitled The Grand Chessboard, where Zbigniew talks about...
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]  We need a Pearl Harbor event.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]  Pardon?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]  He says we need a Pearl Harbor event to unify the people behind the war
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]  for global imperial conquest is one of his quotes.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  That's right, Alex.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]  He says the American people support democracy,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]  and they're not going to support American imperialism
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]  unless they have some event like Pearl Harbor take place,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]  and isn't it a remarkable coincidence that 9-1-1 should occur
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]  just at the time the Bush administration most needs it.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]  The economy is in the toilet.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]  The deficit is massive.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]  The Bush political program is going nowhere.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]  They're raiding pension funds and corporations.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]  We'll take a call.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]  Thanks for holding John in Indiana.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]  You're on the air.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]  Appreciate you holding, John.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]  Go ahead.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]  Yes, Alex, and your guest.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]  I'm sorry.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]  This is kind of not...
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]  It's okay.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]  It's all connected.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]  Go ahead.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]  Yes, hello?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  It's all connected.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]  Go ahead.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]  It is connected.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]  Heads up to your listeners.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]  If they, in different time zones, want to tape Oprah,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]  or if they can't, I advise them today.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]  She had a guest on there, a man named Michael Moore,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]  who totally demonized the people who believe in the Second Amendment,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]  our constitutional rights,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]  and it was a movie that he's made called...
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]  Yeah, Molding for Columbine.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]  Yeah.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]  And he'll expose Bush on 9-1-1 and say,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]  Give us your guns.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]  Yeah, exactly what we need to do.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]  Give our guns to a government that's setting up a dictatorship.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]  Yes.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  But really, people should see it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]  I was talking to TV, and there was no counterpoint there
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]  to ask the important questions.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]  All right, thanks for the call, sir.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]  Okay.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]  I'm aware of it.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]  Let's talk to Pat.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]  Well, actually, next is Tom.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]  Tom in Wisconsin.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]  Tom, you're on the air.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]  Go ahead.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]  Hello?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]  Yes, Tom.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]  Go ahead.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]  Hello?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]  Hello.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]  You're on the air, sir.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]  Okay.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]  Doesn't look like that's going to work.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]  Let's talk to Dominique in Texas.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]  Dominique, you're on the air.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]  Go ahead.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]  Hey, Alex.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]  Listen, really quickly, I had had you guys sent a truth-out letter
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]  on Friday from a U.S. diplomat, John Brady Kiesling, who has just resigned.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]  Yes.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]  And there's a letter...
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]  Do you plan to tap the telephones and...
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]  Yes.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]  I've got it here, Alex.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]  He's making a great point.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]  Part of his letter says,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]  We have not seen such systematic distortion of intelligence,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]  such systematic manipulation of American opinions since the war in Vietnam.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]  The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than before,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]  rallying around us a vast international coalition to cooperate for the first time
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]  in a systematic way against the threat of terrorism.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]  But rather than take credit for those successes and build on them,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]  this administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic political tool,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]  enlisting a scattered and largely defeated al Qaeda as its bureaucratic ally.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]  It goes on.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]  I thought you were talking about the communique that got intercepted
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]  where the CIA and folks are tapping and manipulating there at the U.N.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]  trying to steer through this war resolution.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]  This guy is a political counselor for the American Embassy in Greece
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]  who has resigned and points out,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]  We should ask why we have failed to persuade more of the world
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]  that such a war with Iraq is necessary.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]  We have over the past two years done too much to assert our world partners
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]  that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests overrode the cherished values of our partners,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]  even where our aims were not in question, our consistency is at issue.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]  The model of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]  wondering on what basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]  and in whose image and interests.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]  All right, we've got a break. We'll be right back.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]  And I know callers have been holding a while,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]  and that causes problems sometimes.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]  People need to be by the phone when we go to them.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]  Come back and try to take a few extra calls
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  and hit some other key areas of information.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]  Stay with us.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]  the information war continues.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]  Central Standard Time
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]  on your local AMRFM or simulcasting via Global Shortwave
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]  at 5.085 and 6890 during the day
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]  at 12.172 and 9320.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]  And coming up Friday, Dr. Jim Futz really joining us
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]  for at least an hour and a half.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]  We can really put the phone number out for folks
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]  who want to talk about the Kennedy assassination
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]  because if you're going to have a military coup,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]  you know, they're not going to stop.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]  That's the problem with tyranny.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]  And it just gets worse and worse and worse,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]  turning us around, treating us like trash.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]  The Patriot Act II, by its very definition,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]  is a dictatorship,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]  and you've literally got an hereditary person now in control.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]  The Sachs-Coburg cousin, the Bushes.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]  You can't get any more blue blood than this.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]  Literal British slash German royalty family.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]  I'm not kidding.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]  You can't write fiction this bizarre.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]  They're worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]  No one even knows they're real well.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]  They're absolutely out of control,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]  and they're just mid-level minions in this whole thing.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]  A final overview, how do we stop these people?
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]  What do you think their grand plan is,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]  even though we know it's stated?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]  And do you see America resisting this
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]  or just getting worse and worse and worse
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]  with a globalist using terrorism to get total control?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  Dr. Petsert.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]  Oh, God, I'll tell you,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]  we've got to get these people out of office, Alex,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]  and the sooner the better.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]  Anything for electronic touch screens going in.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]  Yeah, it's frightening.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]  It appears that Georgia, for example,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]  the outcome of the election was controlled electronically
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]  through these voting machines,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]  that Chuck Hagel had illegitimate victories in Nebraska
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]  because he's a part owner of these companies that own it.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]  Diebolt is one of them, and of course,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]  all these ties with the military-industrial complex.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]  I mean, how do they get away with this?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]  That's a hell of a good question.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]  I mean, you know, one thing that was done here
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  in this last election was to not use exit polling.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]  I've been reassured thinking about the forthcoming election
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]  that the exit polls would tell us
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]  whether the elections were legitimate or not.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]  And when the voter news service shut down their exit polling,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]  I had a shudder of apprehension that was going to be great.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]  Oh, they never...
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]  You don't know about DNS?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]  That was shut up under another name, ILBJ,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]  one month after Kennedy got it.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]  Did you know that?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]  They've always been a problem.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]  I didn't, Alex, but I'll tell you,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]  we cannot use electronic voting machines.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]  I agree.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  They're going to steal our democracy style and observe
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]  that it doesn't matter who casts the votes,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]  it matters who counts them.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]  Well, Professor, you know, it's a constitutional republic,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]  and Bush uses this word democracy over and over again
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]  until it's like a drug like opiate, but I...
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]  I mean, it's certainly, even under their terms,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]  not a democracy what they're setting up.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]  It's a command and control, Madison Avenue driven fraud system.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]  We've got to do everything we can to get these people out of office.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]  The idea of building an empire is going to lead
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]  to a different world than we have as a constitutional democracy, Alex.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]  Our quality of life is going to suffer.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]  All of our resources are going to be devoted to maintaining the empire,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]  and we're going to lose money for social security,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]  unemployment insurance for our schools, for our health care.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]  We're going to be enslaved.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]  No one was as enslaved as somebody in Rome.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]  I appreciate you joining us, website AssassinationScience.com,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]  and we will be getting you back on on Friday,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]  and I've been honored to have you here, sir.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]  My great pleasure, Alex.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]  God bless you.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]  See you then.
