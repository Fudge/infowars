[01:36.920 --> 01:41.960]  simulcasting on the GCN radio network all right here is the important news
[01:41.960 --> 01:47.920]  Netanyahu envisions major war in coming months and a speech he gave major war
[01:47.920 --> 01:55.160]  with Iran oh my goodness also scientists warn that global warming could cut
[01:55.160 --> 01:59.320]  population to one billion people this from the New York Times total absolute
[01:59.320 --> 02:04.600]  fair mongering only thing that'll cut the world population down to a billion
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.360]  people is the bio weapons they've developed also anger over firm depletes
[02:10.360 --> 02:14.320]  Obama's political capital the Washington Post reports his approval rating is
[02:14.320 --> 02:24.880]  plunging because people know that he gave well basically a complete pardon to
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.640]  all of the major banks and brokerage firms that got the trillions of dollars
[02:29.640 --> 02:33.640]  and then he only puts out political rhetoric about how he's going to punish
[02:33.640 --> 02:38.480]  them and keep them from getting money they've gotten trillions and trillions
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.080]  and so he's talking about not letting some mid-level executives have a hundred
[02:42.080 --> 02:45.480]  and sixty five million dollars people see right through that that's like Rick
[02:45.480 --> 02:52.760]  Perry Texas got just in one highway fund more than three billion dollars I know
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.360]  it's over ten billion that Texas is slated to get just this year from the
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.560]  seven hundred and eighty seven billion dollar quote stimulus package they passed a few weeks ago but
[03:03.560 --> 03:07.880]  then he turns back five hundred and fifty five million and says oh look how
[03:07.880 --> 03:13.080]  conservative I am I'm not taking the federal money it's more stunts by Obama
[03:13.080 --> 03:20.000]  stunts by Rick Perry stunts by others so we'll go over that and the outrage is
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.760]  just intensifying and intensifying and intensifying as the economy gets worse
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.900]  and worse and people learn that the bankers have stolen trillions this is
[03:27.900 --> 03:31.560]  out of the Associated Press took a double take on this headline
[03:31.560 --> 03:38.360]  senators suggest AIG executives should kill themselves now how about we just
[03:38.360 --> 03:42.840]  arrest the banker heads and put them on trial for all the laws they've broken
[03:42.840 --> 03:46.240]  how about that how about justice be served and we kick the bankers out of
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.840]  control of our government also I saw this in CNN over the weekend and now
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.720]  the VFW president has weighed in it is true they are going to cut all medical
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.680]  benefits to veterans you cannot make stuff of this magnitude up they're
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.440]  saying you're gonna have to just get their own insurance and I was talking
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.840]  to a VA doctor this weekend actually Friday at the New World Order screening
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.440]  here in Austin have another one today and he came up and said how is it that
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.000]  the government can be so evil but then so in up with the VA he goes all I do is
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.240]  fill out hundreds of forms every day and I can't even practice medicine you know
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.440]  the computers tell us what we can and can't do you know somebody's got to hurt
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.520]  back Prozac somebody's dying of something Prozac they won't give them
[04:34.520 --> 04:39.080]  treatment and I said well that's how it works it's evil evil is easy because you
[04:39.080 --> 04:45.280]  just kill things break things take over things good is hard to implement so we'll
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.600]  get into that president won't budge on veteran insurance proposal the size of
[04:49.600 --> 04:57.160]  derivatives bubble $190,000 per person in debt a lot more coming up and some

[06:19.720 --> 06:24.360]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a

[06:28.520 --> 06:33.720]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:33.720 --> 06:39.720]  that's fascism it's not about left-to-right it's about a one-world

[08:30.640 --> 08:39.040]  that some of the other news here DOD in sale of expended metal brass to
[08:39.040 --> 08:44.600]  remanufacturers this is from the shootest one of the biggest online sites for
[08:44.600 --> 08:51.040]  gun owners in the second amendment and it says and so it begins we all wondered
[08:51.040 --> 08:54.520]  when it was going to start when the new administration would make their move
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.320]  against us gun owners oh everybody got upset about HR 45 all but I got over a
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.800]  hundred emails warning me about the draconian gun registration bill that
[09:02.800 --> 09:06.000]  had been introduced in Congress which would make everybody get psychological
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.400]  testing make you pay a yearly registration fee for each firearm make you go
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.720]  through a federal shooting course just the end of the second amendment I would
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.440]  add and every time I tune into neon contact radio they say it's just a
[09:20.440 --> 09:27.480]  rumor that it passed in the 787 million dollar stimulus bill well partially
[09:27.480 --> 09:31.840]  true they passed the psychological testing part of it through the
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.240]  federalization of medicine and and and mental records psychological records
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.760]  going back even into junior high and high school for everybody snatching all
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.400]  those up and paying billions what is it nine billion dollars to have private
[09:46.400 --> 09:51.440]  firms put all that data into databases for them you're already hearing how
[09:51.440 --> 09:55.280]  police may have had post traumatic stress at one time after shooting or
[09:55.280 --> 09:58.920]  military people suddenly are losing their peace officer license or they can't
[09:58.920 --> 10:04.360]  buy firearms it's all over the newspapers so yes they did pass the exact
[10:04.360 --> 10:11.760]  identical subsections that were in there part of HR 45 that's what they do is
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.800]  they try to pass it's like the Patriot Act they tried to pass that for two
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.400]  decades through Congress in piecemeal and in whole just like the omnibus crime
[10:21.400 --> 10:27.360]  bill of 1996 they tried to pass that for a decade before so that's what's going
[10:27.360 --> 10:33.200]  on but this goes continues I was really glad to see Tom Gresham's host of gun
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.520]  talk radio and editor writer television hosts on self-defense TV and one of the
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.320]  foremost gun spokesman come out and tell her by to stop worrying about
[10:40.320 --> 10:44.440]  legislation so absolutely over the top it would never get out of the committee
[10:44.440 --> 10:48.760]  well the point is that Obama's favorite Congress people introduced this and
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.200]  Rahm Emanuel introduced this last year when he was in the house so the point is
[10:53.200 --> 11:01.840]  this is what the White House wants this is their wish list that was the whole
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.600]  point Tom said save your energy for when we really need it don't expend it
[11:08.600 --> 11:12.080]  trying to warn everyone in your email list about legislation that would go
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.120]  nowhere no we need to know that the White House was moving with the most
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.600]  drconian gun control legislation victim disarmament legislation ever seen now
[11:22.600 --> 11:30.680]  Tom just interviewed me and Larry Haney over owner of Georgia firearms on the
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.800]  gun talk radio show and Tom agrees now is the time to unleash the hounds by
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.560]  which he means start emailing and writing your senators in congressman now
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.960]  it has come clear now we know what they intend to do it is an in-run around
[11:46.960 --> 11:51.080]  congress they don't need to try to ban guns they don't need to fight a massive
[11:51.080 --> 11:56.520]  battle to attempt gun registration or limit assault weapons sales nope all
[11:56.520 --> 12:00.240]  they have to do is limit the amount of ammunition available to the civilian
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.400]  market and when bullets dry up guns will be useless think we jest now let's stop
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.440]  right there in California and other states have passed laws to make all
[12:13.440 --> 12:20.080]  guns sold in their state stamp the name make and model basically of the gun
[12:20.080 --> 12:24.640]  an identifying number to that that's tied to when you purchase the gun as a
[12:24.640 --> 12:30.760]  registration form that will bankrupt a lot of gun manufacturers who then have
[12:30.760 --> 12:36.280]  to buy the expense of patent for the gun stamping a pro gun groups who came up
[12:36.280 --> 12:45.600]  with it and that's in quotes it also then allows them in the future to say oh
[12:45.600 --> 12:54.320]  we're gonna ban or restrict guns that don't have this and then when we were
[12:54.320 --> 12:58.080]  covering that state police file calling Ron Paul supporters basically terrorists
[12:58.080 --> 13:01.360]  had a whole section in there about how they need to get the police behind
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.240]  bullets stamping so this is happening everywhere and they're also trying to
[13:08.240 --> 13:14.080]  restrict the importation of ammunition the importation of firearms the feds
[13:14.080 --> 13:20.560]  are moving to regulate and shut down a lot of ammunition producers both the
[13:20.560 --> 13:25.920]  producers that create you know entire bullets and casings but also those that
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.120]  just produced the lead they're trying to restrict lead bullets saying it's bad
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.560]  for the environment they're trying to restrict who can produce the brass but
[13:34.560 --> 13:44.360]  now the military which was the largest source of used shell casings they're
[13:44.360 --> 13:48.440]  going to destroy it and sell it for scrap when they get a lot less money for
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.480]  the scrap than they would just selling the spent casings just billions and
[13:54.480 --> 14:02.880]  millions of 9 millimeter 45 50 cal 223 308 and that's what's being announced
[14:02.880 --> 14:09.400]  here major bullet manufacturers all across the United States are getting
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.760]  letters from the military saying by law but it's not a lot it's a regulation we
[14:13.760 --> 14:21.560]  are no longer going to sell you any of the casings and that's the story from
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.560]  the shoot is up at info wars dot com right now
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.800]  nope all they had to do is limit the amount of ammunition available to the
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.880]  civilian market and when bullets try up guns will be useless think we just hear
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.840]  copies of two letters sent to Georgia Arms just Thursday evening effectively
[14:39.840 --> 14:45.960]  canceling a contract he had to purchase 30,000 pounds of expended military brass
[14:45.960 --> 14:52.520]  and 223 7.62 and 50 caliber and it goes on to say dear valued customer and it's
[14:52.520 --> 14:55.600]  a letter from the Defense Department saying you can't buy this from us
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.240]  anymore it under regulations not a law the White House says it's all to be
[15:00.240 --> 15:06.280]  scrapped so that's just another way that they're doing this and it's been
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.720]  confirmed in the last five six years that the military is buying up more ammo
[15:11.720 --> 15:17.680]  that's then is being used in Afghanistan in Iraq and other areas of the
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.360]  world where US military is in 130 plus countries that they're just hoarding it
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.960]  and warehousing and it's driven up the prices doubled or tripled in some cases
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.320]  and now with all the fear of Obama moving against the Second Amendment even
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.040]  bigger runs against ammo and firearms themselves are accelerating so it's a
[15:34.040 --> 15:40.800]  lengthy article goes through it and it's just outrageous on that front you know I
[15:40.800 --> 15:45.880]  covered last week several mainstream news articles one out of Oklahoma several
[15:45.880 --> 15:49.200]  others around the nation where cities are saying we don't know if citizens can
[15:49.200 --> 15:53.760]  have gardens because we we might need inspections of their gardens because
[15:53.760 --> 15:59.640]  you're guilty until proven innocent and people might be growing marijuana coming
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.080]  up later I want to get into a report out of natural news with Mike Adams who was
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.560]  on with Jason Burmese filling in yesterday shocking video shows Los
[16:07.560 --> 16:11.280]  Angeles City bulldozing community gardens into the dirt they're just saying
[16:11.280 --> 16:14.280]  no more community gardens giant community gardens bulldozing and getting
[16:14.280 --> 16:20.200]  rid of it saying that they don't need that anymore there's all these people out
[16:20.200 --> 16:25.360]  there crying and the police getting in their faces meanwhile Nancy Pelosi is in
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.040]  the San Francisco Chronicle saying they need a federal bailout of newspapers
[16:29.040 --> 16:32.240]  that are failing because the mainstream media is imploding because everybody
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.200]  knows they're a pack of spin doctors we'll get into that report as well Mexico
[16:37.200 --> 16:44.280]  was to impose sanctions on U.S. exports great deal under NAFTA and GATT Burmese
[16:44.280 --> 16:47.280]  covered this some yesterday but I'd like to cover it some later Bilderberg's
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.400]  excite conspiracy theorist and this is not a political and they admit the
[16:51.400 --> 16:54.720]  Bilderberg group is real and that's better than most mainstream media and
[16:54.720 --> 16:59.160]  CBS News picked this up and admitted that we were right admitted that Bilderberg
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.040]  is secret and basically admitted that Barack Obama was having secret meetings
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.160]  with them and is appointing Bilderberg group members you have to understand this
[17:06.160 --> 17:09.760]  is happening simultaneously while mainstream news is still saying it
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.920]  doesn't exist you know and then I went to a hotel and imagined people hiding
[17:14.920 --> 17:22.040]  behind trees in Virginia just like Time Magazine Newsweek everybody's

[24:19.000 --> 24:24.160]  Luke Meyer and Andrew Neal are award-winning filmmakers in fact they
[24:24.160 --> 24:31.040]  won the South by Southwest coveted best documentary in 2006 for Darkon and their
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.080]  new film is New World Order to Sea-Think film we're gonna put that up on screen
[24:36.080 --> 24:41.680]  for everybody the poster is myself looking out of a window from a darkened
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.640]  room we are simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv and we have them with us five
[24:46.640 --> 24:54.520]  minutes to the next hour gentlemen good to have you here so what I mean tell
[24:54.520 --> 24:58.680]  folks about the film the New World Order. New World Order is basically I guess we
[24:58.680 --> 25:04.200]  call it a behind-the-scenes documentary about what people refer to in America as
[25:04.200 --> 25:08.440]  conspiracy theorists so I guess it's sort of a behind-the-scenes look at what
[25:08.440 --> 25:12.520]  your life is like Alex a little bit and other people that we traveled around
[25:12.520 --> 25:20.920]  Jim Tucker, Jack Mclam, Luke Rdowsky, Mike Edgerton and a number of other
[25:20.920 --> 25:27.720]  Seth Jackson and that for an individual speaking is Andrew and Neal Luke
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.600]  tell us about the film well like Andrew said it's a behind-the-scenes look at
[25:32.600 --> 25:42.120]  kind of what goes on in the world of exposing the you know the secret good
[25:42.120 --> 25:46.720]  world one world government that well I want to sure I mean I want to say this I
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.000]  think this is well I think for us what what was important to us is that there's
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.040]  first of all Alex you make many films about it but there's a lot of films
[25:53.040 --> 25:56.320]  out there about a lot of these topics and for us what was really important was
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.040]  to understand what it was like to live the lives of filmmakers of radio hosts of
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.720]  of ambush journalists of of muckraking reporters who do the kind of work you're
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.000]  doing which is generally you know considered to be by a lot of people you
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.680]  know kind of far out there and we wanted to know what it was like to be you guys
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.760]  and and to live your lives a little bit and also really importantly sorry just
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.640]  not to cut you off how you how you how you came to how you came to believe what
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.040]  you believe you know I think if I think understanding other human beings and why
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.120]  they believe what they believe is it is a valuable thing and I think more of that
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.440]  would be a good thing for humanity well I was just gonna say I think this is the
[26:39.440 --> 26:42.960]  fairest documentary and then there's been quite a few that I've been featured in
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.680]  it's the fairest I've seen that said why did you guys go with the hokey angle
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.760]  because that certainly was over sampled from the footage that I saw you guys
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.680]  shoot I mean was that for the comic relief because it did get a lot of laughs
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.000]  so this wouldn't be dark I mean I know you did that with dark on as well but
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.320]  that inherently is kind of you know good what are some of the hokey parts and
[27:04.320 --> 27:07.520]  I'm curious that you feel like it's actually there were more laughs in the
[27:07.520 --> 27:12.000]  audience on Friday night than I think we were we were expecting we didn't know
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.760]  if that was possibly because a lot of the people there knew you and so it was
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.320]  sort of like there was a there was sort of an inside joke going on but I think
[27:20.320 --> 27:24.080]  that there's absolutely there's no question that Luke and I do see comedy
[27:24.080 --> 27:30.120]  in in in in everything even even in horrible things that are happening in
[27:30.120 --> 27:33.600]  the world there is a certain part of the world that I see sort of from the point
[27:33.600 --> 27:41.320]  of view of Voltaire of of of you know just that the human the human comedy is
[27:41.320 --> 27:47.240]  just a is a complicated a mess and I think you know I do see humor in that
[27:47.240 --> 27:52.040]  even even when stuff is serious so I suppose that's sort of my own or our
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.080]  own take on the whole thing but I think in by and large like I thought you know
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.080]  besides some comic relief I thought I thought well Tommy Pallotta thought you
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.400]  know a director and producer he thought that it humanized us and it was a
[28:04.400 --> 28:09.520]  positive thing overall yeah but really I would hope it that it is I mean yeah I
[28:09.520 --> 28:13.200]  mean that's that's a tool like humor itself can be a tool to kind of if it's
[28:13.200 --> 28:18.120]  all serious people sometimes just turn off eventually especially people if it
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.320]  if there's a moment of of laughter of humanity and then a moment where things
[28:23.320 --> 28:27.120]  are serious people will go that going back and forth makes the audience pay
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.240]  attention I mean one of the most one of the things that really want and one of
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.240]  your soundbites actually that we be added in late was your comment about you
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.360]  know a lot of people say that conspiracy theorists you know you know believe
[28:39.360 --> 28:42.240]  this stuff because that you know it makes the world a simpler place or it
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.240]  makes the world knowable to them or whatever and actually I think the film
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.400]  is evidence of a great deal of stress worry and discontent that one must
[28:52.400 --> 28:57.240]  accept if they're going to accept the the worldview that you know you know you
[28:57.240 --> 29:01.640]  people like you Alex have taken on it's not it's I so for that reason I think
[29:01.640 --> 29:06.680]  that's a bit the thesis doesn't work like obviously it's you're not doing it for
[29:06.680 --> 29:10.080]  some kind of satisfaction because like you're under a tremendous amount of
[29:10.080 --> 29:15.280]  stress you know in terms of your your daily lives and and like you said like
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.160]  you know you wake up in the middle of the night sometimes and like you're
[29:19.160 --> 29:25.480]  genuinely afraid of what the future holds and and that's not and I think a
[29:25.480 --> 29:31.000]  lot of people generally try to adopt a belief you know sometimes be it
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.560]  religion be a political ideology where whatever it is so that they don't have
[29:34.560 --> 29:37.400]  to wake up in the middle of the night all right we got a break that's key
[29:37.400 --> 29:42.920]  info Andrew Neil and Luke Meyer see think studios the official film of the
[29:42.920 --> 29:45.840]  year being put out by the independent film channel and I'm very honored to be

[33:58.840 --> 34:02.360]  the regular broadcast rotation actually sometime in May I think the broad
[34:02.360 --> 34:08.920]  cross broadcast rotation will start and and the DVD will be out sometime this
[34:08.920 --> 34:14.400]  fall you guys just come in and run the camera they're gonna move around let's
[34:14.400 --> 34:18.200]  just do it that well direct right here on air right now okay thanks just have
[34:18.200 --> 34:22.360]  to do that we're just working out doing the live TV show in here and we're
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.200]  getting more cameras in here some mounted on the ceiling and other things
[34:26.200 --> 34:32.320]  for TV like a headpiece and things like that someday what about all this
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.360]  pre-promotion I've been seeing for the film well this was this was the world
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.920]  premiere last Friday night and so there's a lot of promotion like you were
[34:41.920 --> 34:46.120]  part of that where you drove around Austin on Friday just for the world
[34:46.120 --> 34:50.800]  premiere of the film there probably will be more promotion when it's gonna come
[34:50.800 --> 34:56.040]  out on IFC but that's that's kind of all I know about right now yeah now should
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.440]  folks just visit the new world order the movie dot-com or is there a see thing
[34:59.440 --> 35:02.760]  site they should check out well you can go to see think comm and you there's a
[35:02.760 --> 35:05.840]  there's a small page for it there and then you can link to the main to the
[35:05.840 --> 35:08.680]  main new world order the movie dot-com from there or you can go straight to the
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.080]  movie site whichever you whichever is best mm-hmm I specifically want to go
[35:13.080 --> 35:17.960]  over some reviews I saw 50 50 positive reviews negative reviews I mean even the
[35:17.960 --> 35:22.000]  negative reviews said they like the film because they took away from it that
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.280]  we're delusional and I wanted to be on record with the filmmakers and read part
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.960]  of a negative review by Scott Von Dovac I believe say pronounce it and this was
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.200]  out of nerve dot-com yeah I read I read that one so let me read some of this it
[35:39.200 --> 35:42.140]  says welcome to the new world order where 9-11 was an inside job and
[35:42.140 --> 35:44.920]  secretive elitist organizations called the Bilderberg group the trilateral
[35:44.920 --> 35:48.000]  commission and or the council in foreign relations know we explain their
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.280]  different governmental systems just like we have a house and a Senate it doesn't
[35:52.280 --> 35:56.200]  mean either one of them doesn't exist you know the Washington DC exists the
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.080]  House the Senate the judiciary the legislative the executive exists and it
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.440]  goes on our only hope is a ragtag band of conspiracy theorist anarchist anti
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.640]  globalist led by the mad prophet of the info wars Alex Jones and then it goes
[36:08.640 --> 36:15.080]  on to say that Meyer and Neil aren't concerned about the reality of these
[36:15.080 --> 36:18.780]  beliefs and they don't present any counter arguments or talking head
[36:18.780 --> 36:22.360]  rebuttals actually there are people in their rebutting they don't have to in a
[36:22.360 --> 36:26.920]  way new world order is an extension of their previous film dark on which was
[36:26.920 --> 36:30.960]  about live-action role-playing gamers the movies tagline was everybody wants to
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.600]  be a hero which could just as easily apply to this one you don't need a PhD to
[36:35.600 --> 36:39.520]  figure out the psychology at work here we'd all like to think that our lives
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.080]  are important that's the classic yuppie thing oh none of us are important let's
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.360]  just have hopeless lives it's impossibly politically active and if you can
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.160]  convince yourself that you're one of the few in the know about what's really
[36:52.160 --> 36:55.800]  going on the world one of the few fighting for good fight against force
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.720]  has been on destroying you well then you have a lot in common with Jones
[36:59.720 --> 37:05.800]  Rodowski Jackson and the rest and then he goes on to say I'm insane basically
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.120]  Bilderberg didn't exist I was imagining cars following us I was imagining
[37:10.120 --> 37:14.640]  Secret Service behind bushes did did a car follow us it's one of the most it's
[37:14.640 --> 37:18.520]  one of the most kind of amusing things to me that like sometimes people some
[37:18.520 --> 37:22.520]  sometimes people are like so is a car really following you or like does so
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.680]  does the Bilderberg group really exist I'm most like yeah man like not only do
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.280]  they exist they admit they exist now and you know there was absolutely no
[37:31.280 --> 37:34.560]  question it's something I wanted to talk about on the show because I wanted to
[37:34.560 --> 37:38.080]  make it clear and I we had a discussion that night the hotel room about it you
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.480]  know there's there's no question first of all in my mind that there were there
[37:42.480 --> 37:47.080]  were people the night before at the bar who were in there who were you know
[37:47.080 --> 37:52.320]  doing some kind of recon of some sort and then the next morning there's
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.200]  absolutely no question that we're being in my opinion we're being followed I
[37:56.200 --> 38:00.720]  mean we took about nine turns that guy tailed us all the way out so we took
[38:00.720 --> 38:04.960]  nine and then he got out he was six foot four built a big guy you know in a dress
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.960]  outfit I mean it's the classic FBI slash you know army commando I mean he was
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.760]  either FBI was an army commando well I mean specifically I mean that was like
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.680]  that's something that you know that's that and I felt like we showed it pretty
[38:18.680 --> 38:23.960]  accurate but I mean how can they not show guys with black sunglasses in police
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.360]  vehicles with police wearing black glasses pointing at us and those don't
[38:28.360 --> 38:32.240]  exist yeah I'm insane I just want to be a hero but none of this exists and that's
[38:32.240 --> 38:36.640]  part of you know that that's part of you know the power of interpretation I
[38:36.640 --> 38:39.680]  think a lot of people will come to this film with preconceived ideas and I
[38:39.680 --> 38:43.520]  think that's why you're gonna see a broad variety of responses to it you know
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.960]  some people are gonna come with preconceived notions that this is all
[38:46.960 --> 38:50.960]  whack-job stuff and they're gonna leave and there and and maybe it won't change
[38:50.960 --> 38:54.440]  their mind and maybe they're gonna come in believing all of it and maybe they'll
[38:54.440 --> 38:57.960]  leave believing all of it I mean you know I what what we hope is that we did
[38:57.960 --> 39:03.360]  show what you guys were like what your experiences had been and why you believed
[39:03.360 --> 39:07.440]  in what you believed and through that to humanize you to take you out of this
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.160]  time this kind of cliched environment where where you know you're just kind of
[39:12.160 --> 39:17.720]  ranting at the margins which which is is really is a danger for your message you
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.760]  know and and and so you know I hope that it would affect things positively in
[39:22.760 --> 39:27.320]  that way comments along those lines yeah when we were having test screenings it
[39:27.320 --> 39:30.720]  was very interesting that people would watch the same film and some people
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.520]  would have a totally negative reaction to everything in there they would think
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.560]  that everything in the whole film wasn't true and there'd be other people that in
[39:38.560 --> 39:41.800]  the same audience that would think everything in there was totally true
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.240]  and totally that it was like it was the beginning of a whole bunch of
[39:47.240 --> 39:50.720]  information that that was out there and then there would be other people in
[39:50.720 --> 39:55.080]  between who would have a transformative experience and watching the film both
[39:55.080 --> 39:59.960]  directions so I think it's interesting that this film you know I hope shows a
[39:59.960 --> 40:06.560]  very honest picture of how things happen when you're out there trying to
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.920]  uncover stuff investigating what's going on out there and if people if people see
[40:10.920 --> 40:21.880]  that that objective honest view into into what into what happens I mean
[40:21.880 --> 40:29.080]  article pisses me off because it's like the guy betrays himself as bias in the
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.120]  first couple sentences of his review if you walk into a review and are like you
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.520]  know and use those like derogatory terms that are clearly like you know
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.960]  pigeon-holing people and and and like clearly he sat through the whole movie
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.040]  he went into the movie thinking that way about them and continued to think
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.360]  about them that way and didn't care to try to look at what he was seeing on
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.320]  string screen didn't care to look at the people who are in front of them and
[40:54.320 --> 40:57.480]  understand why they believe what they believe well Andrew let me make this
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.920]  point here and that's why I'm making a big deal out of this because it isn't
[41:00.920 --> 41:06.360]  just this review I probably saw 20 reviews or more and I have them here in
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.760]  the stack and half of them were yeah these guys seem wild but a lot of it's
[41:10.760 --> 41:14.040]  checking out nowadays and they linked to a few mainstream news articles hey
[41:14.040 --> 41:16.640]  here's Time magazine here's others admitting they're setting up a bank of
[41:16.640 --> 41:19.960]  the world just like the conspiracy theorist always said and they said they
[41:19.960 --> 41:23.960]  would use a economic crisis to do it I mean this is mass delusion you guys
[41:23.960 --> 41:31.480]  were there at the Hyatt we were staying at a few miles away and Davis who's one
[41:31.480 --> 41:35.600]  of your partners he is off at another screening of this right now so you can
[41:35.600 --> 41:39.200]  be here and he comes over me goes you know these guys are cops you know my
[41:39.200 --> 41:43.080]  dad's a cop and he's now a famous probably detective but he want to get
[41:43.080 --> 41:46.760]  into that the point is is that you know he's from Chicago and I go well no I
[41:46.760 --> 41:50.120]  know they're cops this happens everywhere we go we're at the bar right the
[41:50.120 --> 41:55.960]  every time we're eating big guys 45 years old six foot five in suits act like
[41:55.960 --> 41:58.440]  they're with you and they walk up and say hey do you want to attack the state
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.440]  department with us and I'm like just start laughing and I'm saying no we're
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.640]  here journalists to cover this like oh because I really want to help you go
[42:05.640 --> 42:08.800]  attack government buildings right now now if I would have been drunk or
[42:08.800 --> 42:11.640]  something and said yeah just joking I would have been arrested had been on the
[42:11.640 --> 42:14.800]  news that I was an al-Qaeda guy planning terror that this happens every week when
[42:14.800 --> 42:17.680]  you hear about some cell they busted and it comes out later it was at a bar and
[42:17.680 --> 42:22.760]  somebody just joked so you guys were there while feds are on us you're
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.320]  witnessing this happening then as we get kicked out of the other you know base
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.240]  at at Builder Bird I am walking around videotaping security comes up and says
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.040]  don't videotape we say okay they follow us into the bar and they say you know
[42:36.040 --> 42:39.760]  we've had people try to steal things by pulling firearms Rob Jacobson's with me
[42:39.760 --> 42:42.160]  you guys are up in the hotel room I'm about to come up out to the coast to
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.760]  coast a.m. and I say okay finish eating my hamburger and then I go upstairs and
[42:47.760 --> 42:53.960]  and the old the fire alarm goes off and you know and then I've been outside an
[42:53.960 --> 42:57.080]  hour before shooting video the hotel and there were these workmen with these
[42:57.080 --> 43:02.720]  big work trucks going yeah we're gonna you know pull it at about 1 a.m. and I
[43:02.720 --> 43:05.560]  didn't know what they were talking about the time but after that they did the
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.160]  fire alarm for whatever reason on purpose they came up to us and asked us
[43:10.160 --> 43:14.640]  about fire alarms and then it says here I'm a kook crazy person and there's no
[43:14.640 --> 43:17.720]  cars following me there's no secret service I mean let me just read the
[43:17.720 --> 43:20.980]  quote and I'll show up about this it says paranoid delusions are contagious in
[43:20.980 --> 43:26.000]  new world order and Alex Jones is patient zero and it goes on it says his
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.680]  face a puffy fright mask of pop-eyed outrage Joan leads his minions to a
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.280]  hotel where the annual Bilderberg conference is taking place he sees his
[43:34.280 --> 43:37.760]  enemies behind every tree in around every corner he's continually evading
[43:37.760 --> 43:42.400]  cars he imagines are pursuing him and at one point announces that a nearby
[43:42.400 --> 43:48.280]  bear-shirted bicyclist is clearly secret service when a fire alarm goes off in
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.360]  the hotel just as he's to call into our talk show it's simply more confirmation
[43:53.360 --> 43:56.440]  that they're out to get him and then it goes into how I'm this delusional purpose
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.280]  they says he's living in a movie in his mind is evident from the references to
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.620]  the matrix Star Wars and even Ghostbusters that people that pepper
[44:03.620 --> 44:07.880]  his ranch don't know let's stop there I'm shooting footage separately for the
[44:07.880 --> 44:12.200]  Obama film that we were already thinking about making and a JFK film separately
[44:12.200 --> 44:17.400]  away from Bilderberg it's on video it's in I mean you know we have this footage
[44:17.400 --> 44:21.120]  I don't know if I put that part in the Obama deception but or maybe it's in your
[44:21.120 --> 44:26.400]  film actually secret service coming over the police come over or maybe I've
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.040]  watched this so much in my studio you know Chantilly and it in Virginia well
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.040]  no I mean I I can't tell where I saw him I know I was there because I've seen this
[44:34.040 --> 44:40.360]  footage so much it's in my film and in your film similar footage but but I'll
[44:40.360 --> 44:44.080]  put it on the web the point is is that I guess I was just watching the other day
[44:44.080 --> 44:47.280]  in the studio I think people should like you know I mean whatever that nerve
[44:47.280 --> 44:51.880]  calm review you know okay so screw him but like he you know I think with more
[44:51.880 --> 44:59.160]  people most people who watch the movie I don't think what he says there is what
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.400]  comes across in those scenes so like but I'm saying sometimes people ties in
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.160]  though to the mass delusion that I'm talking about I'm the same one but but
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.840]  just finishing my babbling point I'm trying to figure out where the footage
[45:09.840 --> 45:12.960]  is or your footage my footage or so much of it gets confusing the point is
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.240]  we're at the Capitol and then we're at the White House and everywhere we go we
[45:17.240 --> 45:20.760]  should put a vote a video out on this they run up and say turn your cameras
[45:20.760 --> 45:24.240]  off they run over and say you can't film the White House and then we start
[45:24.240 --> 45:28.200]  walking around and the Secret Service guys come out of the gated area they
[45:28.200 --> 45:34.880]  follow us around all around DC for about 30 minutes and so I guess you guys were
[45:34.880 --> 45:37.760]  with us because it's in the family were there and actually I you know of course
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.520]  you know there was actually just a battle in New York City about about a
[45:41.520 --> 45:44.680]  year ago camera right about camera rights on the street the Secret Service has
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.040]  been caught and so the fence following bike rights grips they've been caught
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.240]  following anti-death penalty grips my point is you were there and that was
[45:52.240 --> 45:55.320]  Secret Service following us and Secret Service did come out and tells turn our
[45:55.320 --> 45:59.560]  cameras off I mean am I making that up in DC yeah I wasn't there when Secret
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.760]  Service came up in DC but you know I if you have footage of it I well we weren't
[46:03.760 --> 46:07.600]  there we were well then how does he talk about that here in the from saying the
[46:07.600 --> 46:10.360]  I don't know because remember in our film we're up we're in front of the White
[46:10.360 --> 46:13.600]  House Capitol Police come up had the Capitol Police and you talk to the
[46:13.600 --> 46:18.240]  Capitol Police guy and you're like appreciate you sir but but but but then
[46:18.240 --> 46:22.480]  guys come out I guess you didn't see him they come out on bicycles and start
[46:22.480 --> 46:25.520]  following us around I didn't see them there's a shot in the movie of the guys
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.720]  that you had seen across you saw the guys at the hotel you saw him follow us
[46:29.720 --> 46:33.560]  I'm telling you I saw them come out okay okay no I we didn't get footage of that I
[46:33.560 --> 46:36.360]  was in the on the DC I mean is it a conspiracy theory to say they have
[46:36.360 --> 46:39.160]  Secret Service around the White House no it's not a conspiracy theory at all
[46:39.160 --> 46:42.320]  that's what I think is funny is that so many of these facts that are generally
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.800]  accepted by most everyone when they come through the lens of of a certain
[46:48.800 --> 46:52.880]  demographic basically become a conspiracy theory and in fact actually
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.440]  one of the things that was sort of you know we were kind of stuck in a rock in
[46:56.440 --> 47:00.040]  a hard place just in terms of how we describe the movie you know like the
[47:00.040 --> 47:04.600]  term conspiracy theorists in and of itself is a problematic term and like I
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.440]  think like perhaps a new term people should start using a new term it
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.560]  immediate the conspiracy theorist a tag immediately kind of devalues it's meant
[47:15.560 --> 47:21.160]  to put you in a box and say these are exactly you know and and like I it's
[47:21.160 --> 47:25.320]  kind of a noise me that like we've had to describe it that way for people to
[47:25.320 --> 47:28.840]  understand what the movie is about you know but like I think it's a stereotype
[47:28.840 --> 47:33.120]  it's a stereotype and I think that like it's like calling Galileo a conspiracy
[47:33.120 --> 47:36.600]  theorist because he said that the earth was not the center of the universe right
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.760]  and also but if you just break down even conspiracy theorists what that term means
[47:40.760 --> 47:45.560]  it means that it people are theorizing about conspiracies that may be
[47:45.560 --> 47:48.640]  happening now humans conspire and this is something we talked about a lot we
[47:48.640 --> 47:51.840]  weren't able to get much of it in the film but like human beings have been
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.640]  conspiring for centuries it's something it's a Caesar being killed it's it's
[47:55.640 --> 48:01.960]  yeah yeah I mean look we all conspire in our everyday lives we we can spy
[48:01.960 --> 48:05.840]  it again like you know our girlfriend to do what we want we can spy you know I
[48:05.840 --> 48:10.960]  mean we conspire in little ways every way like to assume that in government at
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.120]  least to some extent there isn't a certain amount of conspiratorial
[48:14.120 --> 48:18.080]  behavior going on is a dangerous state of affairs here's what the first
[48:18.080 --> 48:20.920]  commenter said on this review it says I don't think this guy actually saw the
[48:20.920 --> 48:25.280]  film because in it Jones talks about how many idiots like the guy say it makes
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.080]  the world so fun for them to believe in the New World Order but in all honesty
[48:29.080 --> 48:32.760]  they say that the new order is trying to do is worse than Hitler and the Nazis
[48:32.760 --> 48:37.160]  so this guy who wrote the blog would tell a Jew that they are just trying to
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.560]  make themselves feel better by saying Hitler tried to kill them don't think
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.760]  so nice blog I mean look all I'm trying to say is the Bilderberg group is real
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.840]  we were followed this stuff did happen absolutely there was a small lake right
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.800]  by the hotel there was a guy out there all day fishing and and catching
[48:54.800 --> 48:59.600]  nothing watching us I mean there were there were I mean we had guys in clown
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.600]  mass I don't think most following us I don't think most of the clown mask no
[49:03.600 --> 49:06.640]  you weren't there enough days you're a part of it no I didn't see that but I
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.400]  did the I think that most people that watch this movie aren't going to
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.800]  question those facts and actually but I think that that discussion that you see
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.240]  going on right there even on nerve.com I think it's good that people are
[49:17.240 --> 49:23.200]  having these arguments I think it's good you know if the film you know pushes
[49:23.200 --> 49:27.360]  people to to get into this discussion it's a it's a positive thing you know
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.400]  and and I think like you know Alex because you're bombastic or whatever you
[49:31.400 --> 49:35.640]  know sometimes maybe people people get fired up about it but I think it's a
[49:35.640 --> 49:39.200]  good thing if people are coming out and having a discussion about and I and I
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.720]  think because in a way you know we we try to present like you know the softer
[49:44.720 --> 49:49.200]  side of Alex Jones from time to time I think it's good for people to see that
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.360]  too because like it to turn you into a human being to understand where your
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.840]  ideas come from to understand the history of your journalism is an
[49:57.840 --> 50:00.600]  important thing and to understand what it's like to be behind the scenes. Sure
[50:00.600 --> 50:03.920]  it was great meeting you guys and hope I get to meet you and see you again in the
[50:03.920 --> 50:06.400]  future and we're gonna come back for a few more segments but I want to say you
[50:06.400 --> 50:09.080]  were truthful about what you said you were gonna do that's one of the first
[50:09.080 --> 50:12.440]  times it's ever happened with the national production so I commend you and
[50:12.440 --> 50:15.800]  thank you. I but I would like to give the guy at nerve.com and you guys here's
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.920]  Time Magazine titled the New World Order and this came out it says a new bank of
[50:19.920 --> 50:23.080]  the world will rule the United States and will basically pay our taxes to it it
[50:23.080 --> 50:26.760]  says a central bank of the world to knock heads when needed and to control the
[50:26.760 --> 50:30.720]  United States so I want to present you with the conspiracy theory above Time
[50:30.720 --> 50:34.240]  Magazine or they're saying this is the solution so there's the New World Order
[50:34.240 --> 50:38.560]  and then here's one from the Financial Times and now for World Government and
[50:38.560 --> 50:41.320]  in this this is published by the Bilderberg group. So right so this is an
[50:41.320 --> 50:43.520]  interesting thing right I mean just like the whole. Well they say world
[50:43.520 --> 50:45.720]  governments good here we're gonna come back we're going to break. They say the
[50:45.720 --> 50:48.720]  world government exists they kept a secret from good and the bankers are
[50:48.720 --> 50:52.440]  gonna rule us so I want to present you and nerve and everybody else with again
[50:52.440 --> 50:55.720]  more delusions. According to nerve I probably made this up and typed it up
[50:55.720 --> 50:59.680]  myself. Here's the Times of London we'll be right back.

[54:16.920 --> 54:21.680]  com again the filmmakers we're going to do about 15 after they got to take a cab and
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.000]  go down to be at the end of one of their screenings at a panel so there was about another 20 minutes
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.720]  we've been having heated discussions during the the break you're seeing these type of
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.120]  ridiculous reviews are part of the overall discussion my my problem is they're announcing
[54:34.120 --> 54:38.360]  troops on the streets they're announcing fema camps they are announcing a bank of the world
[54:38.360 --> 54:42.240]  they're announcing the hpv shot is killing people i wasn't a conspiracy theorist the
[54:42.240 --> 54:46.560]  trials of it said it was killing people that you know they admit prozac causes psychotic
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.440]  breaks and people go out and cause mass shooting it's now on the inside of the drug but i was
[54:50.440 --> 54:53.520]  talking about that 12 years ago and called a conspiracy theorist they just put it on
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.600]  the drug two years ago i mean i i know there's all these other cooks who make stuff up and
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.200]  that's our biggest problem yet who who do make up things that can't be proven i don't
[55:02.200 --> 55:06.320]  do that but the only way people are really going to understand what's going on is is
[55:06.320 --> 55:12.000]  when they come across something and stop and think about it read about it themselves if
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  they've you know the people who read something like this and take it just as the final thing
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.720]  right there they're not thinking about what he's saying they're just i mean they're just
[55:20.720 --> 55:24.640]  absorbing it and it's the same for some of some of the stuff that says but you imagine
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.280]  out front i mean look you're you're experiencing some of the frustration now you know they had
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.400]  feds asking us questions following us around you know we got followed out of bill berg by
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.480]  the car that turned this way that way follow us in parking lots gas stations for 20 minutes
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.440]  and then it gets out it's a big fed and it doesn't exist i'm just like it's crazy yeah
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.560]  yeah no i mean i i i think i mean i think one thing i i i i wanted to talk about just
[55:46.560 --> 55:51.080]  because you you were talking about the times like the financial times i mean uh you you
[55:51.080 --> 55:57.760]  know conspiracy theorists label aside okay globalization is a is just about the most
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.920]  real thing that you could possibly imagine i mean people have been thinking about a one
[56:02.920 --> 56:07.480]  world government for a long time and lots of people in high places think it's a good
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.960]  idea for humanity to create a one world government i mean we've seen the creation of the european
[56:12.960 --> 56:18.720]  union um doesn't exist which which is crazy you know so i mean like obviously like there
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.320]  are groups of humans who believe that a one world government is something that is sort
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.680]  of like an evolution of mankind and and and and they've been motivating real currencies
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.520]  and store and i don't even think not even what's so funny about is none of that's going
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.360]  on its secret it's public policy but it's kooky to to be against it and to say that
[56:38.360 --> 56:42.240]  it's bad and that's the point i'm trying to make if you read that financial times of
[56:42.240 --> 56:48.360]  london article published by a belterberg remember owns it mr wolf it says we kept it secret
[56:48.360 --> 56:52.960]  and it's authoritarian so simply see oh peace love world government no more war no it's
[56:52.960 --> 56:57.720]  a worldwide authoritarian corporate state luke has this been an awakening for you making
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.200]  this film or were you aware of the new order before you mean you obviously decided to make
[57:01.200 --> 57:06.040]  it or is it been a growing process for you i mean i had some background in it i mean
[57:06.040 --> 57:12.200]  andrew intentionally tried not to over educate ourselves we were making the film we wanted
[57:12.200 --> 57:18.800]  to we wanted to kind of have you have you and everyone else in the film speak on the
[57:18.800 --> 57:24.040]  issues and we didn't want to become editors on it to sort of editorialize did the different
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.080]  theories that are going on and actually we kept us and actually now we're we're being
[57:28.080 --> 57:32.840]  very strict about like how how like when people say so you know do you believe nine eleven
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.360]  was an inside job do you believe that you believe that we're not getting involved in
[57:36.360 --> 57:40.600]  that discussion because we feel as though there's there's a rock in a hard place situation
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.760]  there we say that we believe in one theory or another people are say oh it's a propaganda
[57:44.760 --> 57:49.560]  movie if we say we don't believe in it then oh it's a hit piece and like so for us we've
[57:49.560 --> 57:54.080]  gone to so much trouble to be objective with this movie to offer you know what we felt was
[57:54.080 --> 57:59.880]  a fair and real you know view into the lives of the people that we decided to follow and
[57:59.880 --> 58:03.680]  you know at this point we're we don't really want to get into that into that whole discussion
[58:03.680 --> 58:09.240]  because we feel like it either way would compromise the like the viewing process for people so
[58:09.240 --> 58:14.440]  what we hope is that people come to the movie with an open mind with with with with a with
[58:14.440 --> 58:22.520]  a fresh perspective and just watch and and and learn what you guys are like as people
[58:22.520 --> 58:27.200]  and if they want if you want to go educate yourself there's a tremendous amount of information

[1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:31.120]  of a segment to go down and speak at the end of a second screening of their already critically
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:36.880]  acclaimed new film new world order andrew you had a question for me during the break yeah
[1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:42.000]  i was just yeah you're you're playing on your show now you you're you're playing a thx and
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.280]  um you know we heard you talk a lot and in fact i think you've mentioned the matrix in
[1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:50.400]  your movie and that guy there in in the in the nerve article kind of like you know took
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:54.280]  a jab at you for that reason but i actually always thought that your theory about a lot
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:58.080]  of these a lot of these up you know obviously fictional movies was really interesting and
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:02.480]  i you saw that as kind of like an echo chamber for what people really thought may happen or
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:08.480]  may be happen yeah no i mean look number one i was you guys were asking me what is the
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:13.720]  washington monument and the masons and other people say it is a spiritual talisman they
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.680]  believe architecture is sacred i've had top masons on university publications have put
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:23.560]  out books about sacred geometry and numbers and so i was explaining in the clip but i
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:29.840]  think it's you know shortened for time that i don't believe ghostbusters is real ghostbusters
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:33.920]  didn't get the idea of the building in the first ghostbusters being a spiritual antenna
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:40.920]  uh out of the you know blue sky they got that from studying the occult and so the and and
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:45.360]  you know zeal the god and the pyramid god and you know other dimensions this is what
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:49.840]  the high level masons believe and so i was using that as an analogy it's like george
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.520]  lucas who made thx 1138 that we just played a little clip up behind me here he said that
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:58.480]  was kind of his remake redo college film they then redid with robert devol as his first
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:04.400]  big film off and see i'm gonna burn all our time answering this question but it's complex
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:10.960]  that that was a remake of brave new world all this hoxley 1933 well hoxley gave speeches
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:15.520]  at berkeley and said my brother was involved in eugenics this is their real plan to chip
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:19.760]  everybody and control everybody and his brother ran the united nations unesco board so see
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:22.760]  they're putting what they're really doing out and then george lucas with revenge of
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.760]  the sith i said this is the political statement about government sponsored terror and george
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:31.400]  bush in 911 lucas basically came out and said yes this is how they stage events this is
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:36.080]  how they're setting up a world by dictatorship and said this is a political message and he
[1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:39.760]  said that about the first star wars and there was even some cut scenes about you know you
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:44.240]  know slaving for the greater good of the empire and then the general public not getting involved
[1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.240]  staying on the farm not going out and taking up their destiny to fight tyranny so it's
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.960]  not just me you know saying that that's actually what the filmmakers themselves were saying
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:58.200]  yeah definitely i think it's one of the most you know powerful you know potential usages
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:03.800]  of fiction you know that you can discuss you know real things are or or potential realities
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:08.200]  i think people see coming in the future and i don't know i just i always enjoyed like
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:13.080]  your references to those movies and and how they're kind of part of part of the main reason
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:17.280]  the main reason i do it in summation is people have heard of ghostbusters they've seen matrix
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:22.360]  they've got that idea of there's another reality okay and and that and that's so much of what
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:28.080]  we've been told or taught is disinformation and so i use those as kind of a way as a cliche
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.360]  just like you guys use the term conspiracy theorist just so you can communicate yeah
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.080]  now i mean it was one of my it was actually one of my one of my favorite parts of shooting
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:41.560]  with you was um a lot of the armchair philosophizing that we did i remember one point i think one
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:47.920]  of my favorite quotes was were a combination of crazy killer apes and um deranged deranged
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:53.880]  peacocks which i thought was kind of amazing so like but it was it was uh it was fun from
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:59.280]  a documentary point of view being around you because uh you do just kind of uh look at
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:04.400]  the world in this meta way uh for some reason your mind is set up in a way that you you
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:09.320]  do kind of remove yourself from um a lot of the generally accepted realities that are
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:15.120]  around us and and and and you then for that reason have a different perspective uh on
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:19.160]  the world and i it was it was really interesting to to be around that and i think that you
[1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:22.920]  know whether people you know they watch this movie they agree with everything you say or
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:28.680]  not i think the most important thing is that you're a voice out here that is questioning
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:32.240]  you know and that old kind of like corny bumper sticker question authority you know jack
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:36.720]  mclam still wears that on his on his cops uniform i mean i think it's a very important
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.840]  thing in a democracy for voices to be out there asking questions and you don't have
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:46.520]  to agree with everything that you say but uh at least it provokes research it provokes
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:51.720]  people thinking about what they're being fed and and so um you know i what i hope is that
[1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.320]  at least to some extent that comes through in the film and that and that and that there's
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:05:01.160]  that that you know your your voice in society i'll segment you gotta break gotta break everyone

[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  know
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:22.480]  i think it's cool i mean you know i i i i i i might be a good question for you i i like
[1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:28.320]  do you think this is the first time that something like this about the topic has come out in
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.560]  the mainstream media i think this perspective i mean usually it's some stuff suit lying
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:37.080]  saying they're my friend when i know that they do it's a hit piece specialist the government
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:40.120]  history channel did the hit piece and you know betrayed michael jackson or whatever
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:44.080]  i'm no fan of him so fine but i i said look i know it's a hit piece and it was a hit piece
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:45.480]  just don't insult me
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:48.320]  and so i've never seen one that wasn't a hit piece
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:51.680]  uh... and so this is the first i mean i really don't want to commend you guys
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.680]  but i also you're pretty sure that when we were doing it that we were going to do that
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:57.960]  i remember we had a lot of discussions and i was
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:09:59.440]  i i i felt
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:03.760]  i felt bad during the whole thing is a felt like i couldn't convince you that we were
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:06.500]  you know going to try to to be fair
[1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:10.800]  and to show what we thought was very well i thought that that that that you guys would
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:15.920]  rationalize yourselves and and and kind of put us in a bad light
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:17.680]  and you know let's say you did it
[1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:20.800]  one degree i thought would be you know ten or fifteen degrees of that you know a lot
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:21.640]  more
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:25.440]  of that i mean it was a little bit of what i suspected but in a way that's who we are
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:26.680]  we were goofy we do
[1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:27.920]  you know funny things in
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:31.680]  uh... but no i mean i was pleasantly surprised i mean i liked you guys
[1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:34.080]  you know you spend a lot of time together off and on
[1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:36.960]  here in austin and dallas and in uh... virginia
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:40.560]  uh... so i wanted to believe you were telling the truth i i i just couldn't
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:41.400]  let myself be
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:43.280]  suckered in in case
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.600]  uh... but i mean i certainly let my guard down because i'm around camera so
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:49.000]  much i can't put a guard on yet
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.280]  but so talking about myself
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:53.640]  we have about five six minutes gentlemen closing comments about
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:54.960]  the film new world order
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:56.480]  uh... first luke
[1:10:56.480 --> 1:10:58.760]  mire and then uh... mr. neil
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:10:59.560]  uh...
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:02.080]  closing comments uh...
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.800]  well i hope a lot of people get a chance to see this film because i i do
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:06.300]  think that it
[1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:08.440]  opens up a discussion about
[1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.840]  what is generally pretty closed
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:11.920]  uh... topic
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:15.920]  just a way to think it was in the nerve dot com article where you know people
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:19.720]  walk into something with an opinion and they they just stick to it
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:21.560]  uh... i think this film
[1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.960]  allows people to kind of
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:28.360]  see things on deeper levels to see the quote unquote conspiracy
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:31.240]  you know subculture well i don't know what you want to call it but
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:33.260]  people that question the official
[1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:33.920]  fiction
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.680]  yeah
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:38.440]  yeah i mean so so often it it feels to me like that just the world breaks down
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:41.760]  into two camps there's people that are screaming on one side about
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.280]  the emphasis what's happening
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:44.480]  this is how it's going to be
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:46.400]  there's people on the other side screaming
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:48.120]  their cooks their wackos
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:52.160]  what i hope is at least to some extent this film will bridge that gap a little
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:54.240]  bit people from both sides
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.680]  either be it you know people who are you know in the conspiracy into the
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:00.160]  conspiracy genre
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:02.800]  uh... more maybe you could call just alternative
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:07.120]  political views will watch this and then people from the other side you know
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:11.000]  either be it you know uh... kind of mainline democrats republicans
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.120]  and and and all of and and all of those people's with their ideologies you'll
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:19.280]  watch it and hopefully will bridge that gap a little bit you know and and and
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:24.120]  and and you know i did you know i i i i i i i i i i know you uh...
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:27.520]  you comment on on on the goofiness a little bit in a way i hope that too
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:32.040]  makes it a bit more accessible to some people who may generally
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.320]  uh... just not watch it on a way like humor sometimes can draw people in it
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:39.960]  can get people coming out of my respect said that it did it he thought it was
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:43.560]  positive and humanized yeah and i want you to comment on this in closing
[1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:46.320]  there are really four camps this is an oversimplification
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:49.120]  two camps on the conspiracy side as people would call it
[1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.440]  and two camps on the establishment side
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:54.920]  on the bad guy side you have the status quo people
[1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:58.280]  that when it came out that hospitals in austin were stealing people's corneas
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:12:59.800]  after they died in organs
[1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:02.040]  they said it was a conspiracy theory to the nurses
[1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:04.240]  then it came out and folks got convicted
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:07.160]  or when you say a vaccine's killing people they call it a conspiracy theory
[1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:08.440]  all you know that it
[1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:11.600]  so it's kind of a denial i mean they said that the mafia didn't exist
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:13.960]  jager hoover he was being uh... blackmailed
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:17.080]  said it's a conspiracy theory and lakosa knows her doesn't exist
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:20.520]  and they look like a fool afterwards so so you have those that are just covering
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:21.240]  up
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:22.880]  and then you have those
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:25.800]  who were just kind of mainstream one i think everything is okay
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:27.920]  one thing the world is working fine
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:29.600]  so that's on the side in denial
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  then on our side the conspiracy side you've got real researchers people
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.920]  understand human history
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:37.920]  they're putting out real information may not present perfectly you know whatever
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:40.320]  uh... you've got folks that really care and are telling the truth and are doing
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:43.080]  something very historical important and the real revolutionaries
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:46.360]  then you've got cooks that talk only about flying saucers juba cabras
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.120]  things that are shocking they call themselves conspiracy theorist
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.880]  they're really just fiction writers claiming their fiction
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:13:53.200]  uh... is uh... real
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:57.080]  and so those are the four camps yeah i think it's funny that we
[1:13:57.080 --> 1:14:00.280]  that that's a that's a really interesting what i i i i kind of wish i'd
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:03.560]  gotten on camera during the doc that's a that's a very clear
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.240]  way of explaining uh... all these conflicting ideologies you know
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:10.720]  we ran into i'll tell you we ran into a lot of reptile talk
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:14.320]  we went ran into a lot of alien talk you're nice not to put that out well
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:16.960]  well i mean i think you put one-brain ship comment
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:20.520]  yeah well i mean you know i i i think there are a lot of people in the world
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:24.680]  that are worried about shipping and like and and and we heard a lot of talk
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:28.240]  about it amongst many people we spoke to but like by and large i think we
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:32.200]  avoided that stuff and tried to stay with the sociopolitical you can make us
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:34.760]  look a lot crazier because we there's a bunch of crazies
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:37.160]  but i mean you're gonna have crazies the question reality
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:40.440]  yeah and see the media can always point at them well yeah and i think often
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:45.040]  people that you know it if you tend to to have the intelligence or the
[1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:48.240]  inclination to look outside the mainline view
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:51.480]  you know there can there can be collateral damage there which means
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:55.720]  that you may come to the wrong conclusion when when you leave the
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:15:00.080]  mainline reality but uh... what's important to me is that is that you
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.560]  know people do you try to leave that mainline reality to try to question what
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:05.520]  they're fed
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:09.440]  uh... and and and and listen to dissenting voices i think it's an
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.680]  important part of a democracy so
[1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:14.840]  i hope that it continues for and and uh...
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.360]  yeah i mean i i just wish you luck down here with the show and like um...
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:20.600]  hopefully you'll see in new york again soon yeah
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:24.080]  absolutely uh... you know i want to thank lucmeyer and andrew neal for being

[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:48.560]  but uh... we'll ask him to see what he says
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:50.560]  but it's not like he's cousin it or something

[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:36.620]  and told me that
[1:17:36.620 --> 1:17:41.360]  basically opium andy which is a huge radio show uh...
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:44.440]  bob of the love sponge howard stern all these kind of
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:46.560]  pop sensation
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:47.920]  uh...
[1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:51.440]  radio shows are talking about the obama deception
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:55.360]  and there are no exaggeration i spent about an hour last night trying to track
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:17:57.120]  a bunch of just on youtube
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.920]  there are over a hundred versions
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.840]  of the obama deception free on youtube and almost every one of them looks like
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:05.840]  unmitigated trash
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:09.360]  because everybody raised wednesday night when i released early
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:12.840]  to grab it as fast as they could lowest quality so they got the lowest quality
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:16.480]  one then they uploaded it in the lowest quality to race to get it up and those
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:18.240]  are the ones with
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:22.560]  i mean one version has like a million views between the twelve parts a million
[1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:23.360]  views
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:27.360]  and it looks like absolute hammered crud
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:30.960]  the version that changed the channel that's the name of uh...
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:32.400]  he's got a directors account
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:34.480]  and we always uploads our films and so
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:37.160]  we're looking to him it's up at about a hundred thousand
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:39.920]  right now just as we went to yesterday from ten thousand
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.720]  and it looks like it's about to be the top link and it's the whole film in one
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:44.240]  place
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:48.600]  so please it's going mega viral i've never had a film go this viral this fast
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:51.840]  uh... i mean i feel like i'm riding a rocket here i feel like i had a strap
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:53.300]  myself to a missile
[1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:56.440]  and we can feel destiny here this film is
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:59.160]  is is is is is is hitting big time
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:02.800]  and waking a lot of obama supporters up and waiting a lot of conservatives up
[1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:05.480]  because they watch the obama deception
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:07.280]  and they find out
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:10.600]  that it's not a left right thing that both parties are controlled that the
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:14.160]  bankers are engineering the collapse of all their own documents and quotes
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:18.640]  and she and then they understand obama's is a sad puppet a sad frontman
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.000]  a sad minion
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:23.680]  uh... and it's just causing huge awakenings right now
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:25.640]  so i'm very exciting but i

[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.760]  hours nine to midnight and info wars dot com the GCN radio network and he said
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:33.440]  this is perfect for his family who are Obama supporters because they knew Bush
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.080]  was a tyrant because the film starts with showing all the horrible things
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:41.800]  Bush did showing him making jokes about no WMD's here no weapons there and we
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:47.280]  cut the images of dead Iraqi children and men and women and then we explained

[1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:58.000]  his lies and then we cover what his real agenda is and the globalist public
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:01.920]  master plan to bankrupt the planet and bring in a world government where
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:05.960]  everybody has a an ID card that's globally set but administered by their
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:09.560]  nation where all your buying and selling is tracked by that in the name of a
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:14.440]  fair tax which they're going to track all your purchases with in the name of
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.240]  stopping the income tax their masters at that make you revolt against one of
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:21.800]  their earlier programs and then drive you right into the new program of total
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  control this is the film to shatter the left-right paradigm this is the film
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:29.960]  that's got the momentum this is the film that can have an even bigger effect you
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:34.560]  know that even loose change did exposing 9-11 as an inside job and all of my
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:38.640]  films and the other great films people made exposing it the Obama deception
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:44.160]  and I'm telling you no rest for us here I'm going to put it out at prison planet
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:51.040]  dot TV we're going to make it in the next three weeks but by the end of next
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:54.800]  month or within about 25 days from now we're going to launch think I'm going to
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:01.760]  call it the Obama deception update the Obama deception update and it's
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:06.280]  probably going to be about an hour and a half long where we go into more detail
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:10.600]  about the big new brzezinski and about the Israeli connection and the Israeli
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:16.400]  lobbyist and who Rahm Emanuel is and all of that and the encircling of Russia and
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:24.360]  the Bali bombings and mass shootings and more of Obama's agenda and I'm also
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.000]  going to sit down and do some shoots here next week with all the latest stuff
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.400]  that Obama's doing and also we didn't get a lot into how everybody's basically a
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:35.800]  mafia don or corrupt or how many people he couldn't appoint because they were
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.400]  getting payoffs and weren't paying their taxes we're going to spend some time on
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:43.960]  that as well and how one of Obama's people just got rated by the FBI one of
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.920]  the people in his administration I mean it is getting crazy and so we're going
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:53.560]  to put that out at prison planet dot TV I mean we've got hours and hours of
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:57.240]  tarpily riveting informative stuff you know hours of Jesse Ventura hours and
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:03.520]  hours of George Humphrey more of KRS one more of professor graph more of
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.840]  Gerald Salente and then more of myself and I'm going to shoot some new stuff
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:10.960]  because some of this stuff was shot a month and a half ago oh it's old already
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:14.600]  and that's how quick this film people are seeing this film and it's like they
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:18.680]  say they're watching the news a lot of people are also trying to nitpick it on
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:23.680]  YouTube and on the pages on info wars in prison planet saying oh Alex's 5,000
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:31.280]  troops have died in the war it's only 4,200 and something number one that
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:36.760]  4,000 number is in Iraq they're not even counting the thousands of dead
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:42.920]  contractors and they don't count it if you die once you get out to Romstein in
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:46.520]  Germany or once you get to England or once you get back to the US they don't
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:49.440]  count that as a combat casualty and I know about a year ago was in the
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:54.440]  newspapers that really more than 15,000 troops have died from injuries from the
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:29:00.160]  war so I had to make a decision making the film I said well I know it's way
[1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:06.080]  more than 5,000 and I know that more dying every day and I know the official
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:10.720]  number is the latest numbers are almost 5,000 I said I'll just say more than
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:17.880]  5,000 because I'm lying to say less than 5,000 and I know it's more like it was a
[1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:22.440]  year ago 15,000 it's a lot higher than that now so see this is how people just
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:28.160]  try to nitpick and try to invent things that aren't in this film or they show a
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:32.440]  clip of the banker bailout and you know we show a clip and people say oh well
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:35.720]  that was Bush's bailout yeah but Obama's people helped engineer and helped
[1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.840]  honcho it that's the whole point we're showing they were all in it together so
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.760]  there's lots of nitpicking watching the intro of the film instead of watching
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:46.640]  the film itself that proves everything that's in the intro the intro is just a
[1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:50.560]  shadow of what comes in the film so we're gonna criticize it watch the whole
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:57.280]  thing we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:05.200]  billion could kill five plus billion people that's the New York Times anger
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:12.080]  over firm depletes Obama's political capital how his approval numbers are
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:14.920]  plunging because people know he's really the people controlling him are
[1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:18.480]  behind the banker bailouts so we're going over all of that senator suggests
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.040]  AIG's action kill themselves right now let's go to Brian in Quebec Brian you're
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:28.360]  on the air hi Alex hi I'd like to start by throwing a brick to the city of
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:31.960]  Montreal which was rather disgusting this weekend the media started by
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:36.920]  demonizing an anti-police demonstration by warning people that it was gonna be
[1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:42.280]  violent ahead of time so when we had 10,000 people show up for anti-Palestine
[1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:47.120]  invasion thing that was good but we only had about 200 show up for the police
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.760]  demonstration in the town where this is probably a worse disease than any other
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:55.600]  disease possible and they beat the heck out of the 200 people and criminalized
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:59.360]  all of them calling them nuts well if I wanted to demonize the police I could
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.600]  every day there's piles of it where there's a new case where the college
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:07.560]  kid they just come to his window at night shine a lightness face he put his
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:10.560]  hand over his eyes and so they shot him in the chest and he's fighting for his
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:15.320]  life and you know it's their phony drug war that you know the real narcotics
[1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:18.200]  are shipped in by the government and they wage this war against the potheds
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:23.480]  and it's just disgusting that this type of stuff is going on and it's only
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:27.960]  gonna get worse but remember police the bankers you work for are completely
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  destroying the country right now your future as well yeah I'd like to speak
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:35.920]  to that all those people that are laughing at us doubting us trying to
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.880]  bring us in with white supremacists and any other thing they can use to
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:44.200]  justify feeling good about themselves you people might want to get it straight
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:48.200]  when they're finished coming after all of us whether we're good or bad you're
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:52.840]  next you got that I hear you and I appreciate your call I appreciate your
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:56.480]  call send me some info and what just happened up in Canada I saw a blurb on
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.760]  that for those that don't know last week we were sent by two different state
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:05.920]  police officers we're gonna get one of them on the show or perhaps both of them
[1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:09.960]  internal federally written guidelines we've got a lot of these similar ones in
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:12.600]  the past but it said Ron Paul supporters are basically cop killing
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:15.480]  terrorists libertarians are cop killing terrorists if you believe in North
[1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:18.480]  American Union you're a cop killing terrorist they called for gun control
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:23.720]  registering basically bullets and it was just unbelievably evil and then it
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:27.680]  would mix gun owners in next to white supremacists all guilt by association
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:32.400]  that's just it's just amazing but doesn't tell the police what what the biggest
[1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:36.160]  per capita danger to them is is illegal aliens and it's not that Mexicans
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:39.360]  from Mexico criminals it's that those that come here many of them are criminals
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:45.280]  and many of them are fleeing the police and so these are hardcore gangbangers and
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:48.800]  drug dealers and they're coming here and they have all these fake IDs and they
[1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:52.680]  can kill kill kill all these examples of serial killers the railway strangler and
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:55.880]  all them he'd been caught what was it 12 times by police but let go under
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:59.520]  different names I mean if you want to know what's actually killing cops you
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:03.480]  should get an intelligence report about the foreigners it's not just Mexicans
[1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:09.400]  it's Chinese it's Russians it's Eastern Europeans it's Filipinos it's you know
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:15.760]  Europeans it's Arabs because they could just total lawlessness statistically
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:19.840]  and I saw a report to the day in the paper finally about how they've quit
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:25.440]  doing TV testing on school teachers and on doctors and nurses and others and TV
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:28.560]  is just the drug resistant type of spreading all over the country I mean
[1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:33.440]  tens of thousands of deaths a year and all these other just leprosy is back in
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:37.240]  mash tens of thousands of cases a year when before there were no cases and it's
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:40.320]  because we're becoming a third-world country I mean at Ellis Island if you
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:44.440]  got off the boat from Germany or Italy or Japan or China 100 years ago they
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:48.640]  tested you for TV they don't do it now and then you talk about this oh you're
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:53.760]  anti-immigrant okay when you get TV they say one person with TV in a business or
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.200]  classroom setting will give 30 plus people TV in a year in fact there's
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:02.320]  undiagnosed TV just everywhere and so they just don't do the test of teachers
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.120]  anymore they just don't do the test of students anymore it's just running rampant
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:10.160]  in Joe I mean you couldn't pay me a million bucks to be a jail guard and to
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:14.960]  work in those facilities where a TV is just everywhere I mean it is just
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:18.240]  incredible these are the real threats but meanwhile oh no there's these people
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:21.320]  to talk about the Constitution and they're secretly al-Qaeda and they want
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:25.840]  to kill cops I mean come on and the cops seem to believe it I mean they're
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:30.560]  shooting people every day and stops at checkpoints and pullovers and at people's
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:33.600]  front doors looking for pot and you shine a light in their eyes they go like
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:37.520]  that oh shouldn't lift your hand that was threatening yeah I mean it's getting
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:43.280]  bad folks let's go ahead and talk to Mike and mass Mike you're on the air yes
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:49.280]  sir I'm a private detective for 15 years part of my job is to check in with
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:53.760]  local state police authorities when I follow a subject into their area and I
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:39:00.440]  just gotta say that I'm blown away at the Nazis these police have become I got
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:06.480]  pulled over last week three different times and I was told very bluntly that
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:11.760]  I was burying myself for exercising my constitutional rights and it's just
[1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:15.800]  gotten out of control I mean these cops make up things I had the chief of police
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:21.880]  tell me in a small town in Massachusetts the other day that that's not the law
[1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:25.800]  and it's not a bylaw that you check in but it is here we're just going to make
[1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:30.320]  it up well you know more than that the sheriff is the only person that can
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:34.560]  tell you to do that and if you're not violating the Constitution bounty hunters
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:39.800]  private investigators that is explicitly guarded in the Constitution
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.720]  Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence and it's been you know a
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:49.160]  profession that has been very important but they can't stand citizens having
[1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:52.360]  that authority that's why they can't stand citizens owning guns and I see
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:56.320]  articles every week in Massachusetts especially but also in Connecticut in
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:00.640]  places where legal people are going to the shooting range now and cops will
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:05.200]  take them to jail for having firearms going to the shooting range so they're
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:09.360]  really coming after the second amendment right now at our gun club last week it's
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:13.680]  funny that you brought that up a trooper pulled into the parking lot and one of
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:16.680]  our board of directors walked over and asked him if he was a member and if he
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.960]  wasn't a member to kindly please leave it's you know it's just one of these
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:24.920]  but that's what they do they wait nobody that was in the they wait till you leave
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:30.560]  the gun club and they arrest you I mean it's like Texas you put a rifle in your
[1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:34.560]  back of your truck to try to go to me totally legal that the SWAT teams
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:39.440]  helicopters flip oh my god a slave's got a gun I mean they are killing our culture
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:44.080]  they are teaching the police that red white and blue is evil I'm license in
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:48.280]  15 states as a private detective and I'm licensed in 32 states to carry a
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:51.880]  concealed firearm some of the states are G license which I can carry in
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.920]  complete full view and I mean you would think that I know a little bit about the
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:00.560]  law but when these cops pull me over I'm all by the way Alex I do have a pocket
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:05.080]  Constitution so that was gave me a little bit of trouble last day
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:08.560]  did they burst into flame when they saw it like a vampire that sees across I mean
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:11.840]  what happened in my car they pulled me out of the car they brought me to the
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:15.800]  back three other cops came a lieutenant came they had me at gunpoint they went
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:19.040]  to go search my vehicle I told me I had no PC to search my vehicle because I
[1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:21.960]  have confidential client files in there and you're not allowed to go in there
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:26.560]  every time I kept correcting them on their procedure it got worse for me and
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:30.960]  basically I was throughout got to go to court next week and they threatened to
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:36.320]  pull one of my licenses and good luck on renewing my gun permit for the state
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.760]  because it turns a right into a privilege that's why they get licensing
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:44.200]  than they say a license is an authorization to do something that
[1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:48.560]  would be legal illegal otherwise now what happened when they found the evil
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:52.520]  Constitution that they sworn off to that's when the lieutenant said you
[1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:55.280]  know you're burying yourself because of this and I said well what do you mean
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:59.400]  sir and he said well by exercising your you know you're right and by carrying
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:04.600]  this this is not good for your case no I said well I said well why don't we just
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:09.480]  let my my attorney discuss that with the town manager and whatnot and you know
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:12.880]  basically they took me in on that and oh this is the best part too he said that
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:18.480]  I couldn't work in their town anymore that day because he's got so so so so
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:23.400]  what do they do so what do they take you in for well they took me in for they
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:26.920]  got an anonymous tip what happened is I rolled up on a surveillance and then
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:30.240]  and then and usually you know people get nervous when they see a strange car in
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:33.560]  their neighborhood his fellow pulled up and he said what are you doing here and
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:36.840]  I knew he was a cop he was off duty but you could just tell he had those beady
[1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:40.400]  little eyes like he had no problem put a bullet in my head so I said listen I
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:43.200]  know you're a state cop or you're a regular town cop I'll give you the
[1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:46.120]  comment courtesy of letting you know what I'm doing here even though it's not a
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:50.920]  law and he says yes it is a law and I said sir no it's not I can call and
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:54.400]  chat login with dispatcher but I don't have to go into the police department
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:57.760]  he said yes you do you got three minutes to do it or I'm gonna come down and
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:01.680]  send the Calvary I said no problem I have my laptop computer right here with the
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:06.440]  town's website up to call them when this guy was giving me this brief so anyway
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.440]  I called right after he left but sure enough he called because he used to
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:14.280]  work on that police department and he indicated to them that I was acting
[1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:18.800]  weird and looking at little kids so even though I had logged in with the police
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:21.920]  department five minutes before they decided to send the Calvary out to
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:30.320]  arrest me this is the new thing in England they walk up and put you in
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:34.160]  terror databases it's that they this is mainstream news all adults if you're
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:37.800]  walking your dog at a park where children are they go ahead and put you in a
[1:43:37.800 --> 1:43:40.760]  child molester file meanwhile the government's running most the real
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:44.280]  child molestation but so specifically they said your things are gonna go bad
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:47.120]  for you now with this evil pocket Constitution did you say to him but
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:49.720]  didn't you swear an oath to that officer I mean isn't this what America's all
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:54.000]  about or I guess they've been given all the federal training that know it's
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:59.760]  evil well you know I kind of choose my battles and when I think that I can
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:04.000]  reason you know just while I was waiting to talk to you an individual here in
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.520]  New Hampshire where I'm working today a cop pulled up and just nice as can be
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:11.520]  you know here I am waiting on old to trash the police and it's not all of them
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:16.400]  it really isn't no but but but they're not punishing the thugs and the thugs
[1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:20.880]  are in command more and more and so this is coming from the top down and they're
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:24.600]  ignorant they really just don't know what they're doing and most of them were
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:27.920]  just in Iraq where they can grease a whole family and not get in trouble so
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:31.560]  there's also that power trip well that's what the state cop with that when
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:35.720]  he when he pulled up I mean he went get this one Alex he brought the police and
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:38.880]  said that I was looking at little kids and acting squirrely and then he went to
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:43.040]  go say and when I told him to call you guys so at that point he was admitting
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:46.320]  that he knew that I was a PI and we had conversation and this is the best part
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:50.040]  it's all been recorded because I record everything so what I want to tell all
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:54.280]  your listeners out there is carry a little pocket voice recorder because it
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:59.240]  comes down to a he said she she said game the one with the video recorder
[1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:03.760]  went well I mean if I was you it's very inexpensive now to have a DVR hidden in
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:07.480]  the dash and a couple of very small cameras we do that around here it's all
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:12.880]  on video some of us even have dummy VHS's under the seat so they think they
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:16.560]  found the tape and take that and you've got them you have got them you have
[1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:21.360]  got a good and all you know I have a window go ahead with your dash camera
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:26.640]  that they took and they they broke on me and I was using that again they said
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.760]  that it was it wasn't right for me to video tape while I was driving oh yeah
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:34.160]  you can't do that just like they have a dash cam on theirs well good to hear
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:36.960]  from you sir I'm sorry you got caught with the Constitution that's that's very
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.000]  evil and I'm sure you'll apologize that and go say some prayers tonight so God
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:44.920]  will forgive you thanks for the call another call with another hard story
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:51.280]  let's talk to Sean in Alabama you're on the air Sean good morning Alex hi yeah
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:56.200]  I'm sure all the listeners have been hearing this feigned fewer from
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:46:00.720]  Congress about these contractually obligated bonuses that AIG has been
[1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:08.840]  paying out I came across a story on Fox business dot com and it turns out that
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:14.720]  Senator Chris died slipped an amendment into the stimulus bill specifically
[1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:19.760]  providing an exception for contractually obligated bonuses you know let me stop
[1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:24.040]  you have you seen the Obama deception yet sir actually I watched it a couple
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:28.720]  days ago and after watching it I ordered the DVD good good well let me just for
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:33.040]  those that haven't seen it and don't know we have the news clips we have the
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:39.880]  bill we have the executive order when Obama says a month ago and it's in the
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:46.000]  film when he said that he was going to stop bonuses to bailout companies
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:53.760]  companies that take bailout money the executive order says from this time
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:59.200]  forward with any further bailouts and that then that has the loopholes you
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:04.320]  mentioned they married that in Congress and that no one can review it or look
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:08.640]  at it and that it's on the honor system and so all the big companies are
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:13.720]  exempted that is in the Obama deception so and so when Obama got upset you're
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:16.560]  not you know you're not allowed to sit or take this money when you're a failure
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:19.560]  you know we honor success in this country but you've taken this money you
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:24.120]  can't have it for bonuses we're talking about trillions that have gone to the
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:28.760]  shareholders of these companies and the private banks okay and so what are they
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:33.840]  talking about in the news Obama's talking about going after one hundred and
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:40.960]  sixty five million out of close to 200 billion they've given to AIG so see
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.160]  this is the trick they know the public doesn't connect one hundred and sixty
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:48.840]  five million to 200 billion with one company just like Rick Perry knows that
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:52.320]  Texans don't connect 10 billion in stimulus money with him turning back
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:58.520]  five hundred and fifty five million it's a stunt it is nothing but a stunt Rick
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:02.280]  Perry took the federal money that was really taxpayer money and then Rick Perry
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.640]  did a stunt and so Obama you watch is gonna make them that they're making a
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:10.360]  big deal out of this and getting a big fewer right now so Obama can take that
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:14.400]  money back now they've already given him bonuses just three months ago and then
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:17.360]  later they'll give him more and so there's gonna be a big fight and then
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.600]  Obama's gonna shake his finger and take the hundred and sixty five mil wouldn't
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:25.240]  you like to have the nine point seven trill wouldn't you like to know where
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:28.240]  that went with the Federal Reserve before Congress and they tell Senator
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.320]  Sanders and others we're not gonna tell you that pull that up Senator Sanders
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:35.040]  Bernanke we're not gonna tell you where the money is wouldn't you like when you
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:38.760]  want to know where the nine point seven trill is or are we gonna let them bait
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:41.480]  and switches with one hundred and sixty five mil you understand how the scam
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:45.360]  works well exactly I understand that they're they're they're going about
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:49.480]  bankrupting the country and in the process making people so desperate that
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:52.040]  they're gonna get to the point where they're willing to throw away our
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:57.400]  constitutional public and replace it with socialism yes but to put the final
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:01.400]  kicker to show that these criminals in our government are colluding with the
[1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:06.880]  criminals on Wall Street speaking of AIG it turns out that the two largest
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:12.720]  recipients of campaign donations from AIG were Chris Dodd and Barack Obama no
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:18.320]  no no Barack Obama on average got four times the money John McCain in from
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:21.920]  Wall Street we're not saying vote for John McCain the issue is they're both
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:25.840]  bought and paid for and here's the analogy the bankers come in and machine
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:33.040]  gun a thousand kids but then they save one and give him a cup of orange juice
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:36.160]  and say we love you and the media goes oh look they're helping the children
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:40.120]  while there's nine hundred ninety nine bloody dead ones see how they do that
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:47.160]  yeah exactly and it's it's like I said that this this thing is such a scam
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:52.320]  there they're up there stealing money from us and giving it to their fellow
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:57.920]  criminals and then and then coming out in in fainting this shock and outrage at
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.120]  how their fellow criminals look like George Bush was guilty of letting the
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:05.440]  banker bailout happen and the people involved with him Paulson and others
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:09.200]  were from Goldman Sachs and deeply involved but you got to tell the truth
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.800]  even more involved were the Clinton era people they actually engineered what's
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.360]  happening now they're the very ones in power shaking their finger at themselves
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:23.040]  saying we're gonna set up a bank of the world with unlimited power in the name
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:27.720]  of saving us so they destroy the economy and then take everything over in the
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:32.280]  name of saving us I mean how rich is that like I'm trying to wake people up
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.560]  and I'm trying to tell them that look this is not about left and right
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:39.440]  Democrat Republican this is about the government versus people it's about
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:44.680]  freedom versus tyranny and people don't wake up this country is gonna be gone

[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:46.000]  okay uh... i was going over my copy of uh... morals and dogma and i got into
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.840]  this section about uh... the twenty eighth degree freemason
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:52.240]  uh... where they reached the night of the son of prince of death
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:55.240]  and something really had intrigued me about the number nine
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:59.680]  you know it's uh... and not a number that is really regarded by them
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:02.880]  and they indicate that it's uh... the ancients regarded as a number with a
[2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:04.800]  sort of terror they considered it
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.320]  bad presage as a symbol of versatility of change
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:11.400]  and the emblem of frailty in human affairs
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:15.520]  well we have a number nine that's coming up update that uh... with a number nine
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:18.000]  that's of uh... extreme significance
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.680]  uh... where i can't i feel that it's possibility might just put in a fall
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:23.640]  flag event
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:26.480]  well remember what happened uh...
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:28.560]  it was
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:30.480]  you know three three three
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:33.080]  on the madred bombing and then seven seven
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:37.160]  uh... on the bombings in england of the trains in the bus
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:40.320]  and then nine eleven all the same and they are i mean it's not us that believe
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:41.120]  in this
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:43.920]  it's the globalist believe in numerology
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:47.400]  they believe in all this esoteric uh... you know uh... architecture
[2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:48.680]  they're into it
[2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:52.360]  and uh... but a lot of folks in obsess over every day they only attack at
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:53.320]  certain dates
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:56.520]  that tends to be when they think the stars are aligned as well
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:00.160]  yeah because i was reading up on the nine it says we multiply by itself or
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:02.640]  any other number get a result who's final
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:04.200]  some of all of mine
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:06.120]  or all of the visible by nine
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:09.880]  we add up nine nine nine which is the date that's coming up
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:11.200]  it was twenty seven
[2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:13.840]  twenty seven being two and seven is nine
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:15.200]  totally freemasonic
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:18.040]  so i just wanted to run that by you and wondered if you had covered that in
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:21.040]  numerology uh... because i missed yesterday but that's a great point i
[2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:24.080]  mean that they thought all hell was going to break loose on six six six why
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:26.360]  is that their number the egyptians
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:29.800]  had that as the mathematical calculation of the sun
[2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:32.640]  and so that's why six six six is the number of the beast the number of the
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:34.360]  pyramid the number of the symbol
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:36.360]  the number of compartmentalization
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:39.840]  and nine nine nine is also eight eight eight is one of the most you know how
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:41.080]  holy numbers
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:43.400]  uh... the asians believe that as well
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:45.420]  uh... and you know a lot of them
[2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:49.120]  big south korean and japanese and chinese corporations do things on eight
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:49.920]  eight eight or
[2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:52.440]  or obsessed with others a lot of restaurants called eight eight eight
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:54.960]  and you know a lot of people call that superstition but this is how the
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:56.280]  elites operate
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:58.360]  this is what they do
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:03:59.520]  as very ancient
[2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:02.960]  and and and just as a sociologist or as an anthropologist or as a behavioral
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:05.520]  psychologist if you know here's a layman studying that
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:08.280]  and study the elites themselves need to study the enemy
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:11.080]  and they certainly believe in all of this in a very very obsessed with it so
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:15.080]  i think that is a very valid point that uh... you have brought up there brian
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:17.560]  well thank you are also you had mentioned a couple of weeks ago i know

[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:02.440]  while exactly what we've said
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:05.080]  the old-timers fifty years ago because the global for planning it then now we're
[2:11:05.080 --> 2:11:07.680]  here it's happening i've been saying it for fourteen years because i had the
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:09.360]  globalist documents
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  but look at the time magazine this is in the obama deception new world order
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:17.600]  and it says a global bank of the world that will pay our taxes to the control
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:19.280]  every nation including u.s
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:21.920]  financial times of london and now for a world government published by the
[2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:24.040]  billard group and i keep going back to this article
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:25.000]  because they say
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:28.840]  we kept it secret for your own good it is all authoritarian that means non
[2:11:28.840 --> 2:11:30.240]  freedom tyrannical
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:33.640]  and we are setting up a world government for the bankers to save you from global
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:37.560]  warming and the banking collapse and terrorism everything they engineer
[2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:40.240]  everything they foster everything they create
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:42.920]  and in meanwhile bermus let me have an article you've got police
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:44.960]  uh... we've got this people
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.800]  the star ledger
[2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:48.400]  uh...
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:52.760]  and it gets into obama serves conspiracy is a feast of bill derbergh
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:54.360]  and cbs news carried
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:57.440]  the politicals huge folks they call me three days last week i think the
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:11:58.680]  message till friday
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:02.120]  call the guy missus call back talk to saturday already filed the story but
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:04.840]  they did quote our websites four times in there
[2:12:04.840 --> 2:12:06.320]  as sources
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:08.840]  and it's the fairest article i've seen so far that they would say that we're
[2:12:08.840 --> 2:12:10.760]  going to exist usually doesn't exist
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:12.200]  alex jones is insane
[2:12:12.200 --> 2:12:14.560]  these dangerous watch out for him you know
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:17.360]  white supremacist talk about this you know that they didn't say that they
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:19.000]  admitted secret meetings
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.960]  and we prove he wasn't the secret meetings they claim he wasn't that bill
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:22.640]  derbergh
[2:12:22.640 --> 2:12:25.400]  last year it's that's why the film fifteen minutes in
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:27.320]  we spend ten minutes on bill derbergh
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:30.680]  because we're showing he's controlled by the same people that bush is controlled
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:34.560]  by but i'm bermus this is amazing that they really are coming what right out in
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:38.200]  the open now but they preconditioned the public for decades it didn't exist so
[2:12:38.200 --> 2:12:39.960]  even when it's being admitted
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:44.360]  uh... polite folk won't talk about it because that's crazy talk
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:48.000]  yeah i mean you like folks on that time magazine new world order article

[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:46.200]  before they read the article and then another seventy percent said well is
[2:13:46.200 --> 2:13:48.520]  there a problem with this and seventy percent said yeah there's a problem with
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:49.880]  this is sound suspicious

[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:04.400]  point call the political guy apologize try to go in three days say isn't this

[2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:19.480]  you mean it feels good but also
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:20.840]  it's kind of scary
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.320]  and every time i've had this business tingly feeling uh... and other
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:26.680]  areas of our or five here
[2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:30.160]  uh... i mean it's it's crazy bermas to have kind of the eye of sauron looking
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:33.440]  right at you know it is a little nuts but you kind of get past it i mean it's
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:37.400]  always a good feeling to make a difference and infiltrate into the
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:41.000]  mainstream media i mean is that what delin and quarry will exchange yeah yeah
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:44.440]  i mean it's a little scary at first but again alex to be at the tip of the
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:48.360]  spear the first person to come out with a truly critical piece on the obama
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:49.200]  administration

[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:52.000]  uh... jesse ventura willy nelson this thing is really gonna go mega viral i
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.600]  don't think we're really gonna see the effects of it for another like three to
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:56.560]  five weeks
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:59.480]  you know thank god it needs to be out there it's really challenging the
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:03.680]  administration it's already gone i mean mega mega viral i mean when you're
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:08.040]  booked on five radio shows a day i mean i can see it going that when a well
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:11.840]  we're pretty much doing that well but just on the obama deception you know a
[2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:15.080]  lot of people still aren't aware of our work for some reason alex they still
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:18.320]  haven't seen these movies they don't know what's up and this is a great tool
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:21.960]  especially because there's a lot of hype around obama people want to check out
[2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:25.880]  what the skeletons are it's incendiary because of all this ball i mean you go
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:26.760]  to the bookstore
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:29.560]  and it's like a obama colt there's posters books on every aisle the
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:31.520]  children sections like half obama
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:35.320]  and and and there's nothing countering him or it's stuff that can't be proven
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:36.800]  or is from a right wing perspective
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:39.240]  yeah we we go over to the local uh...
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:42.320]  local shop to get that kombucha drink we get all the time and in the
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:46.160]  background there's a big poster of gondy and right next to that big poster of
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:48.400]  gondy is a big poster of obama so
[2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:53.080]  i mean i mean gondy led a true revolution against her and he gondy was
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:54.320]  assassinated
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:57.920]  gondy went up against the greatest empire in the world at the time he is not
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:01.000]  mahat mad gondy mahat mad gondy was against the establishment
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.440]  yeah he's absolutely not maroc obama obama is not mahat mad gondy or martin
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:09.000]  luther king i'm sorry where where is his civil disobedience where where is he
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:13.160]  ever taken part in civil disobedience in his lifetime alex i think that's a
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:17.040]  pretty big state when he's been arrested i've been arrested probably ten times
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:19.880]  you've been arrested or have you been uh... no i've never got arrested
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:22.440]  projesse we got your your i've never read it yet
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:25.520]  well i guess not i've always been able to talk my way out of it i've gotten the
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:28.560]  threats of the uh... the little tie bands a couple times and i'm like really
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:30.500]  gonna put tie bands on me really
[2:17:30.500 --> 2:17:32.880]  so what's gonna happen here is i where it's going
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:35.640]  what have i done to deserve time was i try to i try to make him feel guilty
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:37.520]  jones
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:40.000]  uh... bernie
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:44.440]  which i get me once also at the uh... tribeca premier that united ninety three
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:46.920]  and i had to sit there with this cop for like
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:50.680]  forty five minutes and he was actually aware of the ninety three bombings in a
[2:17:50.680 --> 2:17:51.880]  mod salon
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:54.800]  and i think it was peter lanc's book triple cross
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:17:59.120]  so he was kind of on the fence on whether i should be there or not
[2:17:59.120 --> 2:18:01.920]  he was like what you gotta go to this free speech on like there's a it's a
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:05.480]  little cage you're gonna make me stand there on even i don't even have a sign
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:07.560]  you know i'm handing people dvds and whatnot
[2:18:07.560 --> 2:18:11.440]  and basically i just reached out to me talk for like forty five minutes he let
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:13.280]  me hand out my dvds and i was that
[2:18:13.280 --> 2:18:14.600]  now you're very persuasive
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:17.000]  and you're gonna be on the air tonight nine to midnight
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:20.040]  and stations need to pick it up uh... have you talked to ten of they got in the

[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:26.960]  that the satellite's all ready to go he says that the uh... the satellite's been
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.080]  up for two weeks
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:31.200]  but i go on the site and i can't find where there were new satellites listed
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:34.600]  i'll call him immediately stations calling me asking where the satellite
[2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:37.520]  coordinates all right so i will get the satellite coordinates from which do
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:38.680]  everything around
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:42.280]  from ten anderson right after that he's paying for an extra satellite for us
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:45.280]  so we can run my show twenty one hours and your show three hours a day
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:46.920]  live nine to midnight central
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:50.440]  so stations out there that want to record it or air live will get to the uh...

[2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:18.560]  hey alex jones first of all great new movie i love the new obama deception
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:21.040]  uh second of all i want to comment on the new carbon
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:25.840]  um global warming thing how come i've searched the internet and everything
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:29.440]  else nobody's ever said anything about atomic bombs new
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:32.560]  nuclear bombs hydrogen bombs or anything else having to do
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:36.800]  with anything with the global warming
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:39.520]  well i don't think they had a lot to do with global warming but there are a lot
[2:27:39.520 --> 2:27:42.720]  of government studies their own studies that show that it blew holes in the
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:45.520]  ozone layer when they would test them at high altitudes
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:49.520]  up until the 70s the french the u.s the the chinese the russians did that
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:53.520]  they had one test for 60 something high powered hydrogen bombs in the 60s
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:56.400]  it's in that film trinity for discovery channel that was narrated by
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:59.600]  william shatner where it shows them detonating nukes
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:02.640]  at 100 000 feet blowing holes in the atmosphere
[2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:06.000]  and scientists thought it might have ignited the atmosphere on fire but they
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:09.920]  said we're going to do the test anyways but absolutely they won't let us have
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:13.040]  nuclear power which is very safe compared to that you know but they'll
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:15.440]  set nukes off i hear you it's a good point
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:19.120]  but i'm just saying uh it it could be a time release thing i mean something
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:23.360]  that doesn't happen instantly like um you know any uh even the heat from a
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.120]  high powered hydrogen bomb is nothing compared to a volcano
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:30.240]  because the volcano puts out all this particular that then
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:33.360]  do different things with heat in the atmosphere
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:36.720]  there's a power of them of the mirroring effect
[2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:39.760]  pardon me all right so you don't think any atomic bombs neutral
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:45.600]  neutron bombs hydrogen bombs has anything to do with global warming at all
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:50.000]  hundreds of volcanoes going off at any one time just constantly forest fires
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:54.080]  the oceans i mean just the levels of regular carbon
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:58.480]  and the carbon cycle just just from the studies i've seen on nukes being tested
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:01.280]  it is negligible but but i agree with you uh
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:05.040]  that uh look i appreciate your call it's pointless anyways
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:08.960]  it's the sun is the main driver everything else is secondary
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:13.040]  to temperature fluctuations on this planet and now because global warming
[2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:15.840]  has been disproven the earth's the sun just cooled off so we're going to a
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:19.200]  cooling cycle the ice caps of mars we're getting smaller now they're
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:21.520]  getting bigger again the moons that were liquid
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:25.840]  of jupiter and saturn are now frozen again
[2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:29.680]  it's the sun it's the sun it's the sun it's the sun so now that it's been
[2:29:29.680 --> 2:29:32.880]  proven isn't global warming and it's been proven that polar bears do swim
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:36.480]  they're not grounding my god they think we're dumb now they're calling it
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:39.360]  climate change and saying we shouldn't even have seasons
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:43.600]  but don't worry there's a new tax paid to the imf to fund a new global currency

[2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:11.120]  insurance this is CNN news this is off the charts and
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:16.960]  saying but if not today tomorrow well barbara low fisher is co-founder of the
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:19.920]  nonprofit national vaccine information center found in 82
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.360]  parents of vaccine injured children and dedicated preventing vaccine injuries
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:26.800]  and death through public education defending the informed consent ethic
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:30.320]  as president of the largest oldest consumer led vaccine safety advocacy
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:33.280]  organization she has led a national grassroots movement
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:38.000]  to institute vaccine safety reforms and informed consent protection in the
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:41.440]  public health system for more than a quarter century she's the editor of the
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:46.960]  weekly nvice news and a blogger and many of her articles and vaccines and
[2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:50.000]  vaccine policies appear in the nvice's website a lot of newspapers
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:53.600]  publisher stuff she's all over national television
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:57.360]  she is one of the most you know focused well documented researchers out there
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:00.960]  with the scientists and doctors and virologists
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:03.920]  and biologists that she works with exposing this
[2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:06.720]  and the reason i've been covering vaccines a lot is because they're moving
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:10.000]  to try to make a mandatory they always lied and said they were mandatory
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:13.280]  we exposed that that was a fraud so now they're really trying to make a
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:16.560]  mandatory trying to create this illusion that they're mandatory
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:19.840]  trying to prop that up as the deaths amount from different vaccines like
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:23.200]  hpv and others the cancer viruses and many of the vaccines the
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.000]  sterilization compounds they found in tetanus shots
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.440]  this is all confirmed stuff so i wanted to have her up
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:32.400]  for 30 minutes or so and then take calls next hour
[2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:35.440]  your vaccine damage stories or your stories of what happened
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.240]  to you personally 1-800-259-9231 i know we've got
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:43.120]  loaded phone phones from other people but i'm gonna
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:47.040]  ask folks to call back or to specifically address her
[2:35:47.040 --> 2:35:50.320]  and so go through john to find out who wants to specifically talk to her i
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:53.360]  don't screen calls except when a specific guest is on
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:57.200]  about a specific topic but it's a very wide topic informed consent
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:01.520]  you know with so many things they want to start drug testing for everybody that
[2:36:01.520 --> 2:36:04.960]  goes in for unemployment and they want to start drug testing everybody period
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:07.200]  federally if you have a job period then they have
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:11.040]  an army program all over the country i discovered five years ago watching army
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:15.120]  news on local travis county cable they they put it on
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:18.640]  about how the military pays businesses to drug test all their employees
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:21.600]  so they're setting all these precedents of total big brother control and they
[2:36:21.600 --> 2:36:25.120]  have all these excuses so i wanted to have her on just to basically break down
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:28.080]  the current state of the fight and what's happening there
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:33.520]  and to then take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:37.440]  barbara lowfischer good to have you back with us well thank you so much alex
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:42.080]  okay i am going to try to give you the floor just break down
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.760]  the basic history of vaccines how you got involved what we're currently facing
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:48.560]  and what the establishment's trying to do right now
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:51.760]  yeah you know and then i'd like to talk a little bit because i just actually
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:59.440]  watched your film this morning uh end game and i was so blown away that i
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:05.760]  i'm still processing it um but i i went back into my archive and
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:09.200]  looked at some of the information i produced in the 1990s because i've
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:14.640]  been doing this work since 1982 in the 1990s i was very much focused
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:18.880]  on the evolution of the vaccine tracking systems
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:22.400]  uh the electronic medical records tracking systems
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:26.640]  and i went and reviewed that information and and
[2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:30.960]  some of the things that occurred back then became much clearer to me
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:34.080]  within the context of some of the information you gave out in
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:38.880]  in your film which was quite well researched and it was very interesting
[2:37:38.880 --> 2:37:42.080]  uh and i think people don't really understand
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:47.360]  uh what the mass vaccination system has been used for
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:54.560]  in the last few decades to promote this idea of that the greater good
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:59.040]  uh which is defined by those who have a vested interest
[2:37:59.040 --> 2:38:04.880]  in being able to control uh who gets uh you know these vaccines
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:09.280]  um uh that that very much the the vaccination
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:13.280]  the idea of mass vaccination has been used
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:20.000]  to uh lull people into accepting a loss of medical privacy
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:25.200]  a loss of their a right to make choices about the kind of health care that they
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.160]  want including the vaccines that they want to use
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:34.000]  or not do not want to use and it's it it's really i think people need to
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  understand that often the idea of vaccination
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:42.960]  is used as a political tool by those actually in both parties
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:46.800]  who who really want to exert more control over
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:51.520]  what they know about you and your family in terms of the medical choices that
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:56.560]  you make uh in terms of uh your dna uh that right
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:39:01.840]  now there is an attempt in minnesota uh to uh for the state to
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:05.760]  basically own your baby's dna you no longer have the right
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:09.600]  to give consent let me let me fill folks in on that
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:13.680]  for 44 years according to the austral american statesman i thought it was 36
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:17.120]  everyone at birth has their blood taken it was put in secret dna databases they
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:19.440]  now admit it bush signed an executive order to
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:22.000]  counter the moves in texas and minnesota other places
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.200]  to sue and counter that so the state is being forced to declare
[2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:28.960]  no we own your blood there was even a court case in california five years ago
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:32.960]  where somebody was getting some genetic treatments and then they they came back
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:36.000]  it's a little company actually owns that protein that's in your blood
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:39.840]  so you've got to pay them a licensing fee for your own
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:45.120]  uh dna treatment uh so so i've actually had congressmen on and i've had
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:48.960]  lawmakers from australia on this is worldwide in the western world
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:52.000]  for at least 30 plus years they've been taking people's blood secretly now
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.720]  they're just admitting it well and and the thing that that bothered me when i
[2:39:56.720 --> 2:40:00.640]  when i looked at your your film and just many many memories
[2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:05.360]  uh we were reactivated and um i i remembered back
[2:40:05.360 --> 2:40:09.600]  in in the mvic my organization imposed
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:16.160]  the 1996 uh HIPAA law that was that was under the guise of medical privacy but
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:19.440]  what it really did was it was an information grab
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:25.920]  by by uh government to be able to to look at your medical records
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:30.560]  you know when you now go into a and use them for for also for scientific
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:33.920]  research uh and when you go to the hospital they're
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:36.400]  uploading at all of the health department then it goes from there to the
[2:40:36.400 --> 2:40:39.440]  feds and obama with a nine billion dollar package as you know i'm just telling
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:42.400]  folks i just put more funding into that they're going to use that for gun
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.760]  control for those that ever went to a psychologist but go ahead
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:49.200]  and and the reason that i think it's important for people to understand the
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:52.480]  role that vaccination and vaccine policies
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:57.600]  back vaccine tracking system has had in this sort of evolution
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:01.360]  of the idea that that government ought to be able
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:05.120]  to track you and your your personal information
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:12.480]  and it a lot of it was was justified on by the idea that we all should get
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:16.400]  vaccinated and and that that it was a good thing
[2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:19.920]  for everyone to get vaccinated therefore for example
[2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:24.640]  in 1995 it was okay for the secretary of health donna
[2:41:24.640 --> 2:41:27.680]  shellayla at the time to come in and take the social
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:31.360]  security number and use it for the first time for a
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:37.200]  non-social security purpose and that was to use it as a health
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:42.800]  identifier for babies at birth to monitor vaccination status
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.680]  and so they're using the vaccine monitoring system as the skeletal system
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:51.360]  for a total takeover of health care then the bioethicis boards
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:55.120]  to then bring eugenics back into state controlled health care
[2:41:55.120 --> 2:41:59.280]  well you know i mean as you know i've been on your show before and i've always
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:02.880]  said that i was not a conspiracy theorist but i do think
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:07.200]  that we have to that connecting the dots is important
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:11.680]  and i do under i do know something about the vaccination system
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:14.960]  i know something about vaccines and their risk
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:19.600]  and i know that that bottom line we have to have the right
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:23.440]  to freedom to that's where i absolutely agree
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:27.520]  with what what you're trying to do which is foster freedom of the press
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:33.040]  freedom of of expression and i when i watched your film and i
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:36.880]  realized why when i last time i was on i talked about
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.480]  you know how what i experienced in maryland
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:46.160]  in the november of 2007 when they lined up the children and their parents
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:49.600]  and said you know if they didn't get hepatitis b vaccination and the chicken
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:52.400]  pox vaccination or she could show proof that they had
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:55.760]  that the parents would be charged and could be jailed
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:00.240]  uh for failing to show that proof and there was no law there was no law was
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:05.040]  total color of law but go ahead yeah anyway i but and i saw
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:09.360]  you and you were you were at the the belterberg meetings and you and
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:13.280]  there were the policemen with the dogs and i realized why that resonated with
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:15.760]  you because you had been in that kind of a
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:20.000]  situation as well and you know i i really believe
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:23.360]  that we we are at a critical time right now
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:26.960]  and unless we as americans stand up and get involved
[2:43:26.960 --> 2:43:31.680]  at the local and state and federal level in terms of electing the right people
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:36.240]  to represent us we are going to have a very difficult situation in this
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:39.520]  country where we are really having uh incrementally
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:43.040]  we're having our personal freedoms taken from us and certainly
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:46.000]  that one of the the the greatest freedoms we have
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.640]  is the right to be able to to choose what is done to our physical body
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:54.080]  what what what we are have to take into our bodies
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:57.840]  whether it's pharmaceutical drugs vaccines or anything else
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:01.360]  if we're not free if we don't have the right to bodily integrity
[2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:05.200]  the individual and viability we really are cannot be
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:10.000]  deemed to be free in any sense of the word and so i look back and i see this
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:13.760]  evolution of these tracking systems which were justified
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.800]  in the 1980s and 90s because vaccination was a good thing and we and the
[2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:21.040]  government needed to track who was going to be
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:24.400]  who was vaccinated who was not vaccinated for the purpose of being able
[2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:26.880]  to call them up and remind them that it was time
[2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:30.880]  to get vaccinated and then i see in the in the last few years
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:34.240]  leading physicians and and organizations saying
[2:44:34.240 --> 2:44:37.440]  it should they should criminalize non-vaccinators
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:41.840]  that that that there should be a posting in there they're proposing this and
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:45.600]  then lying and saying it's already the law and threatening people
[2:44:45.600 --> 2:44:48.800]  which is an incredible crime and i mean you've seen in game we sent it to you
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:50.960]  i appreciate you taking the time out to watch it it's a two and a half hour
[2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:54.480]  film plus the issue is we show the eugenesis which
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:57.920]  most the major scientists in the west were in the 1920s 20s 30s 40s
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:45:01.760]  hitler learned everything he knew from us they believed in sterilizing people
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:04.960]  they believed in putting seven vaccines to do it we have the quotes
[2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:07.680]  uh... they will you know they took children radiated into death in the
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:12.560]  u.s black men syphilis and then we show scores of cases only a
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:17.120]  very small amount of all the cases we had in the film so my point is
[2:45:17.120 --> 2:45:20.960]  we have this right to say no anyways even if the government was nice but we know
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:25.520]  that eugenesis became the bioethicist and that they run things still today
[2:45:25.520 --> 2:45:29.280]  and we show the proof in the film so uh... it's not a conspiracy theory i
[2:45:29.280 --> 2:45:31.760]  mean this is what they believe in what they're doing
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:34.480]  well i thought it was that's what i thought you had done an awful lot of
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:37.200]  research back into the history i thought it was
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:41.040]  fascinating and i i think that you know the bottom line is
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:43.840]  the right to inform consent of the human right
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:47.680]  and it was defined by the judges at the doctor's trial at nuremberg
[2:45:47.680 --> 2:45:51.360]  as a human right and what was on trial at nuremberg those
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:56.000]  those doctors who they did charge which crimes against humanity and i realized
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:00.240]  some of them didn't even get to that docket but those who they did charge
[2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:03.840]  though the defense by those doctors was the utilitarian rationale
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:07.040]  and that is that their scientific experiments were for the greater good
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:11.280]  for the insurmountable child to death it might save a thousand children down the
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:14.880]  road and so i i think that that principle that
[2:46:14.880 --> 2:46:19.200]  was outlined by the judges they really tried the utilitarian rationale
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:23.200]  as well and they basically said that that the utilitarianism which is that
[2:46:23.200 --> 2:46:25.760]  some can be sacrificed or the well-being of some
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:29.040]  and the happiness of a minority of individuals can be sacrificed for
[2:46:29.040 --> 2:46:32.960]  the greater good that whole idea was was debunked
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:37.920]  by those judges and they said that is not a what not you can't use the utilitarianism
[2:46:37.920 --> 2:46:42.320]  to buttress any kind of state policy that's really what they were saying
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:47.200]  and you know the alver window homes was a was a supreme court justice
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:50.800]  who used jacobson versus massachusetts 1905
[2:46:50.800 --> 2:46:54.320]  which allowed the state to mandate vaccination
[2:46:54.320 --> 2:47:00.000]  they uh alver window homes used that in in in 1927 to justify the forced
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:04.000]  sterilization of what he thought was an entirely retarded girl which was
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:08.560]  actually a girl who was deaf and it was not mentally retarded
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:13.120]  and and yes eugenics was alive and well in this country in the 1920s and
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:18.400]  preceding world war two and homes was uh hillard did
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:21.760]  was an admirer of homes and as you point out in your film
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:28.880]  uh the eugenics idea uh was very much embraced uh in pre-war Germany as an
[2:47:28.880 --> 2:47:33.040]  idea a thought that you know if you cleanse society
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:37.760]  of those who infected society with you know whether they were handicapped or
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:41.200]  they were too old to be productive or they were the wrong
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:46.480]  from the wrong gene pool racial hygiene and yes that's exactly right this idea
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:49.920]  of cleansing society of all those who infect society
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:53.920]  and are a cost to society this kind of mentality
[2:47:53.920 --> 2:48:00.160]  is something that we we have to we must expose and we must fight again
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:04.320]  but barbara that's what i'm saying i have all the government documents it is
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:08.080]  vicious it is done meanly it is eugenics you know they claim there's positive and
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:11.120]  negative eugenics but the real eugenics just
[2:48:11.120 --> 2:48:15.360]  wants to poison wants to kill wants to dumb down wants to hurt people
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:21.360]  uh but the thing is though alex is that i i i don't believe that everyone who
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:25.600]  is in state local or federal no no no they're compartmentalized they think
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:28.320]  it is for the greater good they don't understand
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:32.880]  that the eugenicists publicly went underground in the 1940s
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:36.480]  and are what we call the bioethicist boards today
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.480]  well i totally agree with that that science has is
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:44.240]  and scientists and physicians are being worshiped
[2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:48.560]  in in our society and other technologically advanced societies
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:52.320]  and what we've done is we have allowed an elitist class
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:56.720]  to develop who have a great deal of power now because of the advancement in
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:00.800]  technology and science and what we need to do and they and they
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:04.560]  are eugenicists most of them they believe in that
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:07.680]  and that's what i'm warning people about that that's the whole point
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:12.800]  well i i i think that that you are probably right that there is a certain
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.520]  faction i don't i mean i have a lot of people i know who are physicians inside
[2:49:17.520 --> 2:49:21.040]  this who are good people who who want to do
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:24.720]  want to do the right thing i'm talking about the directors of the system
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:30.080]  yeah i can go show you listen when dr l p anka and it's covered in the film
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:33.680]  yeah god i thought your film was very interesting
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:36.960]  well thank you but but when he gets up an end game
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:41.520]  and he says in austin at st edwards and when he says the texas academy of
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:46.800]  science this meeting in in in south texas 90 percent of us need to die and
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:49.840]  he projects and abola airborne is going to do it
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:53.520]  and he's a biologist and they project an image of skulls on the wall
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:58.000]  crying you know three minutes standing ovations i mean this was in the newspaper
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:02.160]  just you understand 95 percent according to the scientists i had on it
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:05.440]  were in rapture this is the secret religion
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:08.800]  and i know it's hard to you know get through that they're this evil
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:12.960]  but i'm telling you they're on a go to ut where i live or go to any major
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:14.880]  university go talk to the biology department they'll go
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:17.760]  yes there's too many people we need to get rid of 90 percent right now
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:22.160]  absolutely that's in the u n biological diversity and it is a slippery slope
[2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:26.640]  isn't it when one had when one adopts this utilitarian rationale
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.040]  that that some can be sacrificed for the theoretical greater good it is a
[2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:35.040]  slippery slope it's seductive and it can result
[2:50:35.040 --> 2:50:39.120]  in a great deal of harm and that's why i fighting is because i believe in the
[2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:42.400]  informed consent ethics did you see the state of texas
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:46.560]  testifying that we put 67 percent of foster kids on psychotropic
[2:50:46.560 --> 2:50:50.960]  because they have bad gene pools and i did i did see that no no they're all
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:54.480]  look at you genesis it's a cult they run everything
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:57.520]  but i want to hear more about vaccines you're the big expert on that we come
[2:50:57.520 --> 2:51:01.600]  back barbara low fishers our guests stay with us

[2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:14.960]  all right barbara little fishers our guests be sure and fire out the website
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:19.120]  for folks in their own research specifically barbara
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:22.400]  we knew in the trials of h pv for girls
[2:54:22.400 --> 2:54:25.760]  the papillom of our shot that it was killing people and they admitted that
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:29.520]  we talked about it they call this conspiracy terrorist now cbs news admits
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:33.120]  you know big top stories about all the deaths and autoimmune things and it's
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:36.000]  like we're bad for saying girls shouldn't be
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:39.440]  basically told it's the law in texas to take this when there is no law so it's
[2:54:39.440 --> 2:54:42.320]  fraud within fraud what's going on with that right now
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:47.760]  well you know mbic issued a special report a couple of weeks ago what we did
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:51.040]  is we went in and looked at the reports coming into the vaccine
[2:54:51.040 --> 2:54:53.760]  average event reporting system after garter cell
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:57.760]  and after another vaccine called menactra a meningeal coco vaccine both
[2:54:57.760 --> 2:55:01.120]  were given to the same age groups 11 to 12 year olds
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  although menactra was only it was given to boys and girls and garter cell only
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:08.000]  the girls you would expect that you would have if it
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:10.880]  was a coincidence all these events these
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.800]  these deaths and injuries are being reported after garter cell
[2:55:14.800 --> 2:55:19.200]  if it was just a coincidence you would have had no greater number of reactions
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:22.000]  reported after menactra than after garter cell
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:25.600]  what we found was a three to 30 times greater incidence of
[2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:29.440]  serious events industry ported after garter cell confirming
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:33.360]  our origin in 2006 we put out the first press release
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:38.640]  challenging the licensing of garter cell because we we looked and analyzed those
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:42.880]  pre-licensure clinical trials and saw that there were a number of
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:47.360]  of serious injuries and deaths in there and they were writing them off as
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:50.720]  coincidences and what was really awful about those
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:55.840]  pre-clinical trials is they only studied 1200 girls under the age of 16
[2:55:55.840 --> 2:55:59.680]  and yet they targeted the policy at 11 and 12 year old girls
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:02.480]  so what we found when we looked at the VAERS reports
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:07.920]  recently is that you have a lot of really serious events like blood clots
[2:56:07.920 --> 2:56:15.840]  cardiac arrest, hemorrhage, lupus, seizures, strokes, thrombosis, vasculitis
[2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:22.080]  you have you know it's clear that these girls who are a lot of them are very
[2:56:22.080 --> 2:56:26.000]  high-functioning girls because we're getting the reports into MDIC as well
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:29.360]  they're 4.0 students, they're gymnasts, cheerleaders,
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:34.160]  all-american girls, high-functioning girls, they get one or more of these
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:38.000]  shocks, it's given in a three-dose series and all of a sudden
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.040]  they can't go to school, they can't get out of bed,
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:45.200]  their paralysis that comes and goes, they've got
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:49.200]  pain throughout their body, they have seizures,
[2:56:49.200 --> 2:56:52.560]  they are... What about all the deaths? I mean I've got mainstream
[2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:56.000]  I've got all these mainstream newscasts going over all the deaths where
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.840]  mommy's daughter isn't there anymore. That's right and I mean you're talking
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:04.080]  about girls who are perfectly healthy and all of a sudden drop dead
[2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:09.040]  within hours, days or several weeks of this vaccination
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:13.680]  with no explanation. Some of the girls will say you know I feel kind of
[2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:18.320]  dizzy, I'm really tired and then they will just
[2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:22.400]  they will be found dead with no explanation on autopsy, there's no
[2:57:22.400 --> 2:57:27.440]  finding and we can't get the company, Merck, or the
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:30.960]  government to admit that there is a problem with this
[2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:35.840]  vaccine. It's one of the most reactive vaccines I've seen come on the market.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:39.040]  And they are going to now try to force boys to take it and I guess people will
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:41.280]  just die and become ill en masse and they'll just
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:44.400]  have SWAT teams dance around with police dogs and force everybody to take it
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:47.440]  when there's no law. I mean we're not kidding, there's no law but they force
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:50.400]  it through color of law intimidation, it's just
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:54.240]  Nazi Germany on steroids and it's just going to continue on I guess forever
[2:57:54.240 --> 2:57:57.920]  and it was just a few vaccines they used to try to make you take, how many is it
[2:57:57.920 --> 2:58:01.200]  now they try to inject people with? It's 48 doses
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:05.840]  of 14 vaccines before the age of six, before the age of six
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:09.520]  and 69 doses of 16 vaccines if you're a girl
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:13.440]  with the addition of HPV vaccine is the government recommendation
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:17.600]  and like I said it's on the show, this is why I'm concerned is as they add
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:22.080]  more and more doses of vaccines and they couple it with tracking systems
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:26.160]  will the day come when you can't say no?
[2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:29.040]  Well I want to talk with you about how the UN saying they want to because the
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:32.240]  Africans don't trust them, they won't take it because you know they don't know
[2:58:32.240 --> 2:58:35.840]  what they're doing quote they want to now engineer it into food
[2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:41.280]  with pharmacological vaccine crops stay there back in 70 seconds

[3:00:39.760 --> 3:00:48.480]  www.nvic.org that's for national vaccine information center nvic.org
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:53.280]  and there's a lot of free information there a lot of resources of you know
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:58.080]  other websites you can go to and and uh i just urge everybody to become as
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:01.040]  educated as you can about vaccination before
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:07.040]  you or your child gets vaccinated absolutely i what about the moves to
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:11.200]  put vaccines in mosquitoes to make us take our
[3:01:11.200 --> 3:01:17.280]  shots to put it in food yeah i mean there there is a lot of
[3:01:17.280 --> 3:01:21.440]  experimentation going on trying to come they are trying to come up with ways
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:25.040]  that they can get these vaccines to populations
[3:01:25.040 --> 3:01:28.800]  without people really thinking they're getting vaccinated in other words rather
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:32.320]  than putting a needle in your arm are they're not they're looking at novel
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:37.920]  ways to deliver vaccines and what they're not and certainly food
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:42.720]  putting them in foods like vegetables uh they there was a plan
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:46.000]  they talked about you know mosquitoes who would who would then
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:50.080]  transfer these vaccines but what they what they don't stop to consider
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:54.480]  is is what can happen when when when someone gets vaccinated you
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:58.240]  you can always have an average reaction well when i was going over these
[3:01:58.240 --> 3:02:02.320]  documents that i talked about it and i had published in the 1990s
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:06.160]  there was a super vaccine that they talked about in the mid 90s
[3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:09.200]  they actually had a press conference in washington and they what they were
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:13.680]  talking about is all the world governments coming together to finance
[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:18.320]  the development of a super vaccine they called it the holy grail
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:22.480]  and in this vaccine which was an oral vaccine that would be given at the
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:26.800]  moment of birth to every child in the world as they emerged from the boom
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:31.360]  the vaccine would contain 20 to 30 different viral and bacterial
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:36.560]  antigens uh raw dna that would be injected into the cells of the body and be
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:39.920]  time-released and i remember at the time i thought you know
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:44.080]  what happens if there isn't a reaction on the first time release
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:47.920]  how do you get that vaccine out of the body i mean
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:52.640]  it's it's it's really we we don't understand that we have given people
[3:02:52.640 --> 3:02:58.160]  total total power to develop vaccines and drugs etc
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:01.760]  and there's no oversight on what they're doing i mean
[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:05.600]  they may think it's a good idea but what about the people and these are private
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:08.800]  companies private companies that then lobby the government
[3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:12.800]  to try to force you to take the vaccines
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:15.600]  and and even if you believe vaccines are good they admit they don't give a baby
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:18.800]  a lot because it overwhelms them imagine 20 plus things
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:23.200]  orally given to a brand new baby and it won't matter how many die they'll just
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:26.560]  say oh the babies are all dying but it's it's we got to get rid of the
[3:03:26.560 --> 3:03:28.800]  population but has nothing to do with the vaccines
[3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:32.720]  i mean this is so sick well it's i think that we just
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:38.480]  have to understand what's going on and we have to become activist citizens if
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:42.880]  we're all apathetic and we just say oh well let somebody else take care of it
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:45.680]  we eventually get the government we deserve
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:50.240]  we have to stand up as individuals become involved
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:55.200]  at it and make our voices heard as you point out in your film
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:59.760]  we we if we don't do then we're going to be in chains
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:05.760]  well there are hundreds of different vaccine companies they all want to try
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:08.960]  to make a mandatory i mean will someday will it be thousands of
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:11.840]  vaccines where you get hundreds of injections a month or
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:15.520]  i mean i know i know that there's more than 2000 clinical
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:18.240]  trials around the world that are developing
[3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:21.760]  several hundred testing and developing several hundred vaccines
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:25.760]  i my question has always been you know the assumption is
[3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:29.680]  that more vaccination is going to equal long-term
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:33.200]  health better long-term health i think we need to take a look though at the
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:36.720]  last quarter century as we've tripled the numbers of doses of vaccines we're
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:40.000]  giving our children what we've seen is a corresponding rise
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:43.840]  in crying disease and disability no white crimes
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:46.800]  pardon white Crohn's you've got to break Barbara i want to come back and talk
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:50.720]  about uh this this this rise the more vaccines the more
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:54.080]  disease more problems the more autoimmune problems
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:04:57.920]  and also the bird flu vaccine that's killed a bunch of people
[3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:01.520]  in trials as well they admit it's killing people and they say hey

[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:26.720]  started and still heads up the largest and most
[3:08:26.720 --> 3:08:30.480]  active and best informed to group out there exposing the dangers of vaccines
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:33.680]  and how they're trying to force people to take them
[3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:37.360]  the situation with them trying to mix in
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:42.240]  live bird flu with the big batches of vaccines they were testing for the
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:46.480]  flu when i googled it i found all these mainstream
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:50.400]  british and german papers with separate companies in the
[3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:54.000]  homeless being given experimental bird flu shots and dying
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:57.360]  and the authorities admitting they died from it they told them it was regular
[3:08:57.360 --> 3:09:00.880]  flu shots i mean it's just getting crazier and crazier
[3:09:00.880 --> 3:09:03.360]  to the point of we're just kind of accepting of this
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:08.640]  out of control behavior now like oh that's just what they do
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:12.960]  well you know what i was really a couple of
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:17.280]  weeks ago i guess it's about a month ago now the fda
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:21.120]  which meets on a regular basis i was actually a consumer rep on the fda
[3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:27.040]  committee between 1999 and 2003 learned a lot about
[3:09:27.040 --> 3:09:31.440]  about the the workings of the of the fda and
[3:09:31.440 --> 3:09:34.800]  that's that committee is the committee that the companies come
[3:09:34.800 --> 3:09:39.360]  who want to license new vaccines come forward and out and present their data
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:42.320]  like they presented on garter cell i was actually there
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:45.680]  when the first go-round on garter cell occurred
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:48.800]  i wasn't there when the when the committee voted on whether or not to
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:54.080]  license it but about a month ago there was a
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:09:59.200]  a suggestion that they should be allowed to test
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:05.440]  a bird's flu vaccine on six month olds and this is the h5n1 avian flu
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:11.040]  vaccine and i remember thinking six we don't have an avian flu epidemic
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:13.760]  first of all i mean there were some people who died
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:18.000]  who were in close contact with birds over in in asia i mean you have to
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.920]  practically kiss the bird in order to get this avian flu
[3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:25.680]  and in the bird flu epidemic that they predicted has not taken place and yet
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:30.000]  they are aggressively uh researching development of avian flu
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:34.080]  that virus vaccine so that occurred about
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:37.680]  about four weeks ago and then on it was i think it was february 27th that there
[3:10:37.680 --> 3:10:42.320]  was this article uh that was published uh in that
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:47.520]  that h5n1 avian flu viruses live avian flu viruses
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:54.800]  had somehow contaminated regular flu vaccine that is you know given out all
[3:10:54.800 --> 3:10:58.240]  over the world and it was a plant in austria
[3:10:58.240 --> 3:11:02.880]  and they confirmed they confirmed eventually that yes
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:08.160]  there were contaminated uh lots of vaccine contaminated with this h5n1
[3:11:08.160 --> 3:11:12.160]  bird flu virus live virus and it was some worker in
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:17.760]  czechoslovakia who decided to inject the the vaccine into i think it was ferrets
[3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:21.520]  as ferrets ferrets it was just something that was done i guess in a
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:24.960]  regular basis some little guy in a lab in czechoslovakia
[3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:28.720]  who were reported and said wait a minute all the ferrets are dying and that's
[3:11:28.720 --> 3:11:32.400]  how they also said it would have been perfect for it to mutate
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:35.680]  with the regular flu and become highly contagious and airborne did you see the
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:38.960]  london uh telegraph article i'm gonna put it on screen
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:42.480]  homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in poland you see that
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:45.760]  23 of them died i have not seen that no
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.320]  but that's what i mean there's actually hundreds of these you can't keep track of
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:51.760]  it all they told them it was a regular flu vaccine paid them to take it
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:55.280]  they gave it a 300 and something and uh 20 plus died
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:58.400]  just just google homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in poland
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:02.320]  it's up on screen right now london telegraph
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:06.240]  so uh you know that's just how well it is it it
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:09.840]  i wondered because again i've sat here and watched this for
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:18.560]  27 years back in the in the 1990s late 90s early 2000 they decided to lower
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:22.720]  the age for for flu vaccine which is always has always in this country been
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:27.280]  65 years and older they lowered it to 55 i think
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:30.960]  and then they lowered it down to 50 and then the next thing i knew
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:35.520]  they decided that six months old babies had to get it and then they said
[3:12:35.520 --> 3:12:38.560]  that every child between six months and 18 years old
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:41.760]  had to get a should get a flu vaccine every year
[3:12:41.760 --> 3:12:45.040]  and i thought to myself why is there such a push
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:49.360]  for influenza vaccine when the majority of people
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:53.920]  do not have blue and yes it's annoying and yes you're out for you know a week
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:12:56.240]  or whatever trying to get over i mean true influenza
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:12:59.440]  because a lot of flu like illness is is not actually
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.440]  there isn't yeah it's some other virus or or bacteria now
[3:13:03.440 --> 3:13:07.280]  here's the 64 here's the 64 million dollar question
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:11.280]  every day of i google vaccine deaths in news i see scores of articles where it's
[3:13:11.280 --> 3:13:13.760]  killing people all over the place and they admit it
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:16.160]  then they say you know what we're gonna give it to babies and when the babies
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:18.800]  have a convulsion they're gonna charge the parents for beating them up and say
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:22.560]  shaking baby syndrome and it's all compartmentalized and it's a way to
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:26.800]  test the soft kill it's a way to train the doctors
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:29.920]  to not report it properly to just be used to everybody dying around them or
[3:13:29.920 --> 3:13:32.640]  getting sick around them everybody getting crones then finding the
[3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:35.440]  viruses from the vaccines in their intestines as you know
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:40.560]  that's been confirmed and it's just institutionalizing that we shoot you up
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:46.080]  with it you die and that's the end of it i mean i just
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:49.040]  i just gave you the article where it's killing homeless people and nobody gets
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:52.720]  in trouble well i mean i think we do have to pause
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:56.880]  and say why are so many highly vaccinated children
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:02.560]  so sick and disabled why is one in six child in america now learning disabled
[3:14:02.560 --> 3:14:06.640]  why is the one to a hundred one in a hundred to a hundred fifty
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:10.640]  diagnosed autistic why are one in nine child
[3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:15.120]  children in this country suffering from asthma are we creating a niatrogenic
[3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:19.200]  epidemic of chronic disease and disability through the use of more and
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:23.840]  more vaccines in childhood why allergies why are allergies getting
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:26.160]  so bad a lot of mainline doctors as you know barbara
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:30.080]  lofischer are tying it to they give them all these vaccines it causes the
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:33.360]  immune system to go wild brain swelling all this autoimmune
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:36.160]  inflammation and then everything that shouldn't make you
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:40.400]  allergenic is i mean i guess all the cops all the firemen all the
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:42.800]  bureaucrats i guess they got to have dead children or
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:46.560]  hurt children first i mean i guess it's like a black cup of death and we all
[3:14:46.560 --> 3:14:49.840]  drink from it and celebrate and our children the most precious thing fall
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:53.600]  apart before us and we get sick and we just love the government and thank you
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:56.720]  more injections death death death it's so good
[3:14:56.720 --> 3:15:00.320]  i think well you know i understand what i think that
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:03.840]  there have been a lot of people who have believed in the past
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:07.920]  certainly that more vaccination was going to equal better long-term health
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:11.920]  and i think people assume that the majority of people assumed it
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:15.760]  they went along with it and now you've got a re-examination
[3:15:15.760 --> 3:15:20.560]  of that assumption no question there is there are a lot of people now a lot of
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:24.320]  families out there who have sick kids that were healthy before
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:28.240]  vaccination and now are critically ill or disabled are saying wait a minute
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:32.320]  what are we doing and it is that mass examination that's occurring
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:35.840]  by a substantial minority of people a growing minority of people
[3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:40.720]  that is causing a lot of heartburn at the at the federal level the vaccine
[3:15:40.720 --> 3:15:43.920]  policymaking level they are starting to look at
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:47.920]  and and and start to have meetings around the country to ask people
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:51.440]  what what why are you concerned about vaccination and what they're hearing
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:55.120]  from people in every single community that they go out to
[3:15:55.120 --> 3:15:59.520]  is they're hearing well you know what i either have a kid they either have a kid
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:04.320]  who's disabled or they know somebody who is who became disabled
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:07.760]  after vaccination when you have an in your right when
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:11.760]  when it starts to to reach every home in every family
[3:16:11.760 --> 3:16:16.720]  that's when people go wait a minute and we have an opportunity right now
[3:16:16.720 --> 3:16:22.960]  we have an opportunity to as as a a population stand up and say
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:26.800]  we are not just going to sit here and take it anymore we're not we are going
[3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:30.400]  to have the right to make these choices about vaccination
[3:16:30.400 --> 3:16:35.360]  well Barbara it's killing people that the government admits HPV has caused
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:38.800]  deaths they admit the bird flu shots killing people if they
[3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:42.400]  would have shipped out or they're still saying it may happen ship out bird
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:46.880]  flu will they now say dying of bird flu as a vaccine and that death is
[3:16:46.880 --> 3:16:49.360]  good i mean i mean if they cause another swine flu
[3:16:49.360 --> 3:16:51.920]  epidemic that kills tens of thousands from vaccines
[3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:55.120]  will they say death is good and you're going to be arrested if you don't kill
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.000]  your children i mean i mean i see i mean it's it's it's it
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:01.200]  we're you and i aren't even sanely looking at this
[3:17:01.200 --> 3:17:06.000]  okay i mean we're taking it too calm people are dying and being brain damaged
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:10.800]  and it's happening and and and it just it just keeps getting worse and worse
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:15.040]  but here's the thing you know i mean i saw you on your film you had your bullhorn
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:18.960]  and you were doing you know you were sending that message
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:22.400]  you were not afraid we have to not be afraid
[3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:27.120]  to stand up and we you know i i'm a big believer in the u.s constitution
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:31.040]  i'm a believer in the family what the founders of this country tried to do that
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:35.360]  they the type of government they tried to set up a representative government i
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:38.880]  always urge people if you want to change your government you've got to get
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:41.520]  involved but Barbara shouldn't we just shouldn't we just
[3:17:41.520 --> 3:17:44.720]  trust the government and never mind all the deaths and the maimings and the
[3:17:44.720 --> 3:17:47.600]  brain damage we aren't we know no no no i mean if there's
[3:17:47.600 --> 3:17:51.280]  thousands of vaccines on trial shouldn't we all take two or three thousand
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:53.680]  vaccines and then we can all just die i mean
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:57.040]  isn't that what i mean that that's the thing to prove we're not extremist
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:00.480]  is it just it's it's normal to have a government for trying to forcibly inject
[3:18:00.480 --> 3:18:03.680]  everybody and to have all these deaths i mean this isn't like a science fiction
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:07.600]  nightmare or anything we need to go i think that you know i mean
[3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:12.480]  you i don't know i should believe that most people are basically good
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:15.840]  i believe that some people are not good but i believe most people are basically
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:17.920]  they need to take the shots to prove they're good
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:20.960]  well i believe that people have to use their brains however

[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:07.120]  between autism and vaccination because he dared to
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:14.160]  to to investigate a politically unpopular uh politically incorrect subject

[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:17.760]  from brain damage and death they're putting up billboards running tv ads
[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:20.960]  telling us that taking vaccines is good the corn syrup's good
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:23.840]  oh just google corn syrup mercury washington post headline
[3:24:23.840 --> 3:24:27.440]  half of corn syrup has high levels of mercury in it but then i have newscast
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:31.120]  saying mercury's now good for you a federal study
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:34.320]  Barbara have you ever seen that national news story they ran everywhere
[3:24:34.320 --> 3:24:37.920]  saying that uh mercury's now good for children's brains
[3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:41.680]  i've seen over the years funny studies you know where they
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:45.680]  they try to justify uh putting mercury in vaccines i mean
[3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:49.760]  mbic took a position long ago that mercury doesn't belong in any
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:52.960]  product consumed by humans it doesn't make any sense particularly
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:56.960]  injecting mercury so uh i mean that's a i mean that's a fact in
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:25:00.560]  fact uh guys the network and play the audio i want you to google
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:03.520]  newscast vaccine is good for you on youtube we'll play that in the next
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:05.840]  segment barbara i don't mean to interrupt you but let's go ahead and get the
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:10.320]  calls here west in los vegas nevada you're on the air sir
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:15.840]  well hello alex and barbara uh everything i got some notes
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:18.320]  sounds like you're on a speakerphone but go ahead
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:21.200]  no i'm on a cell phone i don't work very good
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:26.480]  um basically my daughter she uh got her shots her hepatitis polo
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:32.240]  mmr shots uh a couple years ago and right afterwards
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:36.560]  we noticed that she uh began to have a mole on her leg
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:40.160]  and when we put it in the kidney garden you know they told us
[3:25:40.160 --> 3:25:44.400]  and something was wrong they did a bunch of testing and they
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:50.720]  they told us that she has a mild autism severe or mild to severe autism
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:56.240]  and mild uh mental retardation and that's what i called the doctor on it
[3:25:56.240 --> 3:26:00.560]  when uh when when he did the shot it was like uh
[3:26:00.560 --> 3:26:04.400]  it was a mark right there was kind of weird yeah well i just had a big study
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:07.520]  come out from a major university with veterinary medicine about massive
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:11.120]  cancer increase in the injection points in the
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:15.200]  tissues that were injected with vaccines barbara low fisher
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:18.480]  yeah i mean certainly that it's interesting that the veterinarians
[3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:22.720]  are doing a lot of work on the vaccines they're given to animals
[3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:27.440]  and the cancer cancer as well as autoimmune problems that that pets are
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:31.120]  now suffering from and actually veterinarians have backed off of
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:36.320]  the use of of so many vaccines uh interestingly ahead of the pediatricians
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:40.400]  who still don't a lot of them don't get it but hey barbara i got a lot of
[3:26:40.400 --> 3:26:43.040]  friends that have lost their dogs every time they go in for a checkup or have
[3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:46.560]  the teeth cleaned every year they inject them and their dogs die they have
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:49.440]  seizures and die on the table boy the doctor i mean that you know they can
[3:26:49.440 --> 3:26:53.920]  figure that out with the dog yeah no it's very interesting how that the
[3:26:53.920 --> 3:26:59.120]  veterinarians are ahead of this um and you know my own son had a very
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:02.480]  violent local reaction my my son who who suffered a
[3:27:02.480 --> 3:27:06.960]  brain inflammation in 1980 after his fourth dpt shot within hours of the
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:11.520]  14th dpt shot but on his third shot he'd had this big hard red hot lump
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:15.040]  that stayed at the side of the injection uh for weeks i remember calling the
[3:27:15.040 --> 3:27:18.400]  doctor's office and the nurse said oh it was a bad lot of dpt vaccine don't
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:21.760]  worry about it and i was so clueless i i thought she meant it didn't work it was
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.040]  too weak or something and i said should i bring him down for another one she
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:29.040]  goes oh no no no but i didn't know at the time that that local kind of reaction
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:32.880]  was actually a contraindication to further pertussis vaccine at least in
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:36.560]  britain so i you know again the people haven't really been informed
[3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:41.600]  about the the risk but i i have not actually looked at the injection site
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:46.160]  in terms of of creation of the mold we have there's a there's at least i
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:48.880]  probably saw 40 studies last week when i looked into it
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:52.640]  with massive increases sir i'm sorry to hear about your daughter detoxer
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:56.880]  keeper off-corn syrup it's filled with mercury uh and and just god bless
[3:27:56.880 --> 3:28:00.160]  anything else uh no alex actually i called your

[3:28:09.200 --> 3:28:12.480]  well just spread the free obama deception out in game out for free that's
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:15.680]  why they're all on the web speak of the video clips
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:19.200]  this is local cbs news but this this was a
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:22.560]  they call them news packages it was produced cbs broadcast center
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:27.280]  it aired in every local cbs affiliate in the country
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:30.720]  uh and so you think you're getting local news but it was it's packaged with the
[3:28:30.720 --> 3:28:34.800]  video they just voice it here they are saying mercury is good for your brain

[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:52.320]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new
[3:28:52.320 --> 3:28:54.800]  studies in the journal pediatrics there have been
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:58.400]  widespread concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:01.200]  impair the neurological development of children
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.560]  these new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:09.520]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance
[3:29:09.520 --> 3:29:12.480]  so there you have a barber i know you kind of giggled probably thought i was

[3:36:04.240 --> 3:36:07.600]  visit your the final organization you head up's website the
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:10.720]  the predominant group out there fighting this
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:14.320]  how do they educate others how do they wake people up about the perils of
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:18.160]  vaccines yes they need to go to nvic.org
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:24.000]  www.nvic.org for national vaccine information center
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:28.080]  i also have a blog that you can access from their vaccine awakening dot blog
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:31.440]  spot dot com where i write commentary i have a we have a free
[3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:35.520]  e-news electronic e-news letter that we i write commentary about
[3:36:35.520 --> 3:36:41.040]  breaking news about vaccination and and research and policy and all that so i
[3:36:41.040 --> 3:36:43.360]  mean i think that it wants to become educated
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:47.680]  knowledge is power and you can then talk to your family your friends
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:51.440]  and you can educate them and it's it really i see
[3:36:51.440 --> 3:36:55.600]  a great awakening occurring with with with the subject of vaccination in this
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:59.200]  country we're in a race we're a race against time
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:02.960]  and we we we have to wake up in order to act
[3:37:02.960 --> 3:37:06.480]  before we have are in a situation where we're not going to be able to make
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:09.200]  vaccine choices and it's not just vaccines it's the
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:12.480]  gmo crops killing the rats and guinea pigs they give it to them or causing
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:16.480]  deformities it's as i mentioned earlier
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:21.600]  half of the corn service and most products now
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:24.720]  has mercury in it put the watch and post back up for folks i want to see it at
[3:37:24.720 --> 3:37:29.600]  prison planet dot tv it's not from alex jones they are now admitting that more
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:32.240]  than 90 percent of the baby formula has melamine
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:35.040]  they always admitted it was deadly before now they just say oh we decided
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:37.520]  melamine isn't bad for you i mean this is the
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:41.200]  this is entering the realm of complete insanity that they're getting away with
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:45.360]  this out in the open barbara well and again i think you know the right to
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:48.960]  to make choices about what you put in your body about what you're exposed to the
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:52.320]  toxins you're exposed to is absolutely a human right
[3:37:52.320 --> 3:37:55.600]  and so you know if if we want to have that right
[3:37:55.600 --> 3:37:59.360]  we can't be complacent and i think that that was the message in your movie as
[3:37:59.360 --> 3:38:02.320]  well you know we just when you interviewed people in
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:06.720]  canada and here who didn't understand that there was even a european union or
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:10.000]  there a north american union for example was being suggested
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:14.320]  that that shows that we've become very insulated sometimes yeah
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:17.760]  i get emails every day saying north american union doesn't exist but also the
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:21.120]  euro doesn't exist yeah well i was in europe uh
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:25.440]  the last year and i hadn't been there for
[3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:29.440]  for many years and i realized how different it was
[3:38:29.440 --> 3:38:33.440]  because everyone has one currency and there are really no borders
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:37.920]  you're able to move between countries whereas you couldn't before you maybe
[3:38:37.920 --> 3:38:41.520]  maybe the euro doesn't exist maybe your europe doesn't exist
[3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:45.360]  yeah i mean that's the level of denial that that that people have gotten to
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:48.320]  barbara it's interesting i think that in
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:52.480]  particularly united states sometimes we tend to be isolated from the news
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:56.560]  of the rest of the world uh... we we just we're very
[3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:00.480]  in that way we don't we don't understand what's going on as well traveled
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:04.160]  americans have the lowest per capita of holding passports of any country
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:08.160]  yeah and and so we just we just don't understand what really is happening
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:12.080]  over there and i remember when i was over there and i saw the bbc who was
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:15.200]  interpreting i would happen to be there when the whole stock market
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:19.200]  crash happened and how they interpreted what was happening in the united states
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:22.240]  and i remember at the beginning of the trip
[3:39:22.240 --> 3:39:25.280]  they were saying oh poor america whatever by the end
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:28.400]  blaming us america they were blaming america it was it was
[3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:32.480]  fascinating to watch their interpretation of what was happening here
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:36.960]  but again the people wonderful people the people over there who
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:42.240]  who now don't i think eventually they there will be no remembrance of what
[3:39:42.240 --> 3:39:46.080]  what belgium for example or austria or germany or
[3:39:46.080 --> 3:39:50.640]  italy or france because it is becoming very blended all one giant global
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:54.480]  corporate state let's talk to robin in ohio you're on the air with
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:57.520]  barbara lofischer go ahead
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:02.640]  thank you hi hi thank you for taking my call and for enlightening us this is a
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:05.360]  great topic and i've been learning a lot
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:09.680]  um i was becoming increasingly concerned with my son he's
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:14.800]  who's now seven um after his it was either an mmr or dip siria
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:20.320]  and he had a reaction to that and so then later i refused the chickenpox
[3:40:20.320 --> 3:40:24.080]  vaccine and i was told by his pediatrician that
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:28.080]  um well that would be becoming a law soon and i said well
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:31.840]  it's not you know don't get me wrong it's not that i want my child to be ill
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:35.840]  but it's um there hasn't been enough research for me to feel
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:40.000]  comfortable but at least he told you that that they were trying to pass a law
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:44.960]  usually they just say police arrest you know and it's like this is alcada we're
[3:40:44.960 --> 3:40:49.760]  talking about i mean uh barbara how i just interrupt robin for a moment i mean
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:52.880]  i see these cases all the time i know you must see a lot where they call cps on
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:55.680]  people that say no to vaccines when there's no law
[3:40:55.680 --> 3:40:59.600]  well there there actually are laws in place but you there is exemption to the
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:03.600]  laws and if you're in texas there's a wonderful organization in texas parents
[3:41:03.600 --> 3:41:06.320]  requesting open vaccine education proved
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:09.200]  headed up by don richardson you talk about a freedom fighter
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:13.040]  she was the one that went to battle for seven years in the state legislature
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:17.440]  against the vaccine lobby forced vaccination lobby
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:21.840]  um and won the right for for people in texas parents in texas to exercise
[3:41:21.840 --> 3:41:26.080]  contact police exemption marbara i hate to disagree with you but
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:29.760]  studying the law on this and having lawyers on concerning it
[3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:34.960]  to be specific take rick perry he says it's the law you've got to take
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:41.680]  the uh human papillomavirus hp v shot all he did was say it's the list of
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:45.680]  mandatory to be in school through the health department and then that's not
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:50.240]  a law it's a regulation so they have you sign the form as a waiver
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:53.200]  you're saying you disagree with that i mean you admit that there was no law in
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:56.480]  maryland but they had the police dogs there and the black uniforms and told
[3:41:56.480 --> 3:42:00.160]  him it was no here's the thing because here's the thing
[3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:04.960]  they there are laws and vaccine laws in every state their state laws but there
[3:42:04.960 --> 3:42:09.120]  are exemptions and they're they're for all states but to have a religious
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:12.560]  exemption to vaccination every state has medical exemption and
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:16.800]  unconscious well 18 states have conscientious belief or
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:20.080]  philosophical or personal belief exemption is stated differently in
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:23.760]  difference in different states now what rick perry did with garter cell
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:27.200]  it was a new vaccine and he issued an executive order
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:30.480]  going over the head of the legislature which eventually
[3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:34.400]  basically overrode his executive order and but
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:37.120]  in texas it's one of the 18 states that allows
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:40.160]  conscientious belief exemption because of the work of parents
[3:42:40.160 --> 3:42:45.440]  in the late late early 2000s so while it's on a law there are exemptions and
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:49.200]  what we have to fight to protect is the religion particularly the religious
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:53.280]  and conscientious belief exemption if we lose those exemptions and we only
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:42:56.800]  have medical we we are going to really be in trouble
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:43:00.000]  i'm not taking any of the shots and they're not killing my kids or maiming
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:03.840]  them and that's the end of it robin so so tell us what happened to your daughter
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:08.720]  again um well it was my son son sorry um
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:11.920]  i could go on about that but tell us go ahead i'm gonna shut up you've got the
[3:43:11.920 --> 3:43:15.840]  floor go ahead um i have a few things and hopefully one one of
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:19.760]  these things will will help other people out there and this is what it's what we
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:22.400]  did but anyway that i just told the doctor that you
[3:43:22.400 --> 3:43:27.200]  know um it's more dangerous to have the chicken pox
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:31.680]  at a later age you know if you're in your 20s it can it can be very serious then
[3:43:31.680 --> 3:43:35.520]  i would much prefer him to have the chicken pox when he is younger can handle
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:39.840]  it a little bit better and so that was why there's not just chicken pox in
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:42.880]  those shots we'll go ahead right but what um
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:48.800]  when my son was born um we did not find his birth certificate
[3:43:48.800 --> 3:43:52.560]  because if you look underneath the section of of of the
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:57.040]  the well they call it an informant and that's what you become an informant to
[3:43:57.040 --> 3:44:00.960]  the government and so we we did not sign his birth certificate
[3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:04.480]  and we did not get him a social security number because
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:07.440]  that social security number was never meant to be
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:10.720]  an id number that's what marlboro was saying at the start of the show right
[3:44:10.720 --> 3:44:14.880]  and so we refused both of those things now we don't get a tax break you know
[3:44:14.880 --> 3:44:17.680]  because he doesn't have a social security number
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:22.080]  but he is a sovereign united states citizen
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:25.520]  and i think more people need to start standing firm on that
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:29.120]  because with what's going on in in um florida
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:32.000]  people are being taken from their from their homes
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  um and that's because probably because they signed these
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:39.520]  these documents yeah the cps onwards of the state
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:43.040]  yeah i hear you robin i hear you robin to dare from you
[3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:48.240]  scott in washington you're on the air go ahead
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:52.560]  yeah thank you for taking my call um for either one of the two of you
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:58.800]  do you know anything about um tb test i used to work in the hospital in
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:03.200]  los vegas some years ago and i don't know whether or not it was the county or
[3:45:03.200 --> 3:45:06.560]  whether it was a state thing where they required anyone who worked in the
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:12.080]  hospital to get um tested for tb on a yearly basis and i don't
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:15.760]  know if there was anything in the south yeah no no no it's well no no no
[3:45:15.760 --> 3:45:20.240]  were you given the tb test is supposedly that the uh the
[3:45:20.240 --> 3:45:25.040]  shells of the of the microorganism to test for antibodies of it to then see if
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:28.160]  you have it because if you have an inflammation that means you have tb
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:30.800]  because you have an autoimmune response barbara
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:34.560]  yeah the tb test is not a a vaccine in that sense
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:39.600]  and uh they are developing a tb vaccine because they're talking about
[3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:43.280]  uh medication resistant tb that is cropping up
[3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:46.640]  around the world and they're afraid that it may come into the united states and
[3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:51.280]  become a problem but right now there is no tb vaccine that is
[3:45:51.280 --> 3:45:55.600]  required in this country although it's called bcg vaccine and there are some
[3:45:55.600 --> 3:45:59.600]  foreign countries who who do require it but we do we do not we do not have a
[3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:02.480]  tb vaccine and that time test is not a vaccine
[3:46:02.480 --> 3:46:06.560]  okay well that's good to know that i still wouldn't tag it because it's a
[3:46:06.560 --> 3:46:11.040]  uh it's a shell of the organism it's dna
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:15.520]  yeah well i no longer work at the hospital and at the time when i
[3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:18.720]  started working there i had matter of fact i had just moved down there and
[3:46:18.720 --> 3:46:22.880]  they said that it was either a law or required i'm not even really even
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:25.840]  sure at this point because it's been so many years ago but
[3:46:25.840 --> 3:46:29.600]  i was just curious to know about what they do is terrorize doctors
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:32.960]  medical workers and they're all scared but there are more and more doctors
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:37.120]  who are vaccine free and will not harass you and get in your face we have a
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:40.880]  pediatrician uh who's like that and it's more and more of us say no
[3:46:40.880 --> 3:46:44.560]  they can't look at you like you got 14 heads when you say no to shots at birth
[3:46:44.560 --> 3:46:47.920]  and then later the nurses the last baby we had said yeah none of us take them
[3:46:47.920 --> 3:46:51.200]  either you ought to see how many kids when we shoot them up have seizures
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:54.000]  yeah none of us take it either but we get trouble if you take that hold on
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:57.360]  hold on uh do you run into a lot of that barbara low fissure where the where the
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:01.040]  medical what i am running into is that there is a growing
[3:47:01.040 --> 3:47:05.280]  resistance among health care workers to being forced to for example get
[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:09.600]  annual influenza vaccine there are several court cases out in the west
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:13.200]  of nurses unions who are protesting being forced to get
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:17.840]  vaccination in vaccinations in order to be able to practice yeah my dad my dad
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:21.120]  won't do it so i mean i think it's becoming an
[3:47:21.120 --> 3:47:25.360]  issue not just for people average citizens but
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:28.960]  even the health care workers are being oppressed now it's going to when the
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:32.480]  smallpox vaccine that they wanted to dilute they wanted to dilute the supply
[3:47:32.480 --> 3:47:34.800]  i tried to make the police take it and they said no
[3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:37.840]  yeah the first responders they try to make take it
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:41.200]  and mvic issued this report about how risky that
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:45.040]  that old small smallpox vaccine really was and
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:49.600]  other organizations then also did it and the health care workers rejected
[3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:53.360]  the smallpox vaccine plan and that's when it fell apart
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:48:00.000]  villain arizona you're on the air go ahead bell arbra you know i i have a
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:03.600]  twelve month your old daughter and now if you'd mention when you came back from
[3:48:03.600 --> 3:48:06.160]  break that some of the biggest challenges
[3:48:06.160 --> 3:48:10.800]  amongst your staff with this topic is really convincing their wives
[3:48:10.800 --> 3:48:14.640]  um about the uh the negative effects of vaccines and that's really the
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:18.400]  challenge i'm having and uh well chances are it'll fry the
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:21.600]  first kid and say next honey can we now have a couple more that
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:25.200]  you you didn't you know basically assault you know i mean
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:28.720]  women are loving and good and are scared for their children and the fear of the
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:31.600]  government you know the fear they put in them makes them go out and take the
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:34.240]  shot barbara you want to comment on this
[3:48:34.240 --> 3:48:38.800]  well i i think that again i'm all for information and i think when people take
[3:48:38.800 --> 3:48:42.240]  the time to read the information we encourage them to read all the
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:45.760]  information that most people who become educated
[3:48:45.760 --> 3:48:50.320]  about vaccination know what to do it's when they they trust
[3:48:50.320 --> 3:48:53.360]  blindly other people telling them what to do
[3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:57.440]  i'm all for people empowering themselves i don't have take anybody's word
[3:48:57.440 --> 3:49:02.560]  exactly i look at the information and i process it and then i make a decision
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:06.320]  as to what is barbara i'm sure you've seen all the tv shows
[3:49:06.320 --> 3:49:09.680]  where the mother goes she was a cheerleader in top of her class and i
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:12.640]  just want to protect her i wish somebody would have told me hp v's been
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:17.440]  killing people my daughter's dead now i mean we've got to warn these people don't
[3:49:17.440 --> 3:49:20.720]  we go ahead yeah we do have to warn everyone to become
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:25.360]  informed because when when something happens to your child
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:29.840]  you who are going to live with the consequences whatever decision you make
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:32.480]  it's not going to be the health official sitting in atlanta
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:36.080]  or in in your state capital or your politics of politicians
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:40.640]  that you elected to office it's going to be you ultimately who live with the
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:44.240]  pain of whatever happens to your child that
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:49.120]  and so you need to take responsibility and understand the choices that you're
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.760]  making and understand that that you're going to be
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:54.880]  accountable and you're going to be responsible ultimately for those
[3:49:54.880 --> 3:49:58.320]  decisions and i think that this is where i i have
[3:49:58.320 --> 3:50:01.600]  a lot of trouble with this sort of greater good argument that they keep
[3:50:01.600 --> 3:50:04.560]  making the argument is you don't have the right
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:08.000]  as an individual parent to make that choice for your child
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:11.120]  because if you don't make the choice that the government says you need to make
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:15.360]  in this case get get vaccinated you put your neighbor's child at risk
[3:50:15.360 --> 3:50:18.800]  i've always said if the vaccines are as effective as the companies
[3:50:18.800 --> 3:50:23.040]  and have said they are then you should have them the vaccinated
[3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:26.800]  should have nothing to fear from those who try to get vaccinated how dominant
[3:50:26.800 --> 3:50:30.160]  the public is they go you know you got to take it because my kid will get
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:34.240]  sick from you well wait i thought you took it all i thought you're protected
[3:50:34.240 --> 3:50:38.640]  yeah i mean this we really have to stop believing uh in myths
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:41.280]  and misinformation and we have to get the information
[3:50:41.280 --> 3:50:44.240]  well barbara lo fisher you know the studies a lot of the outbreaks are
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:48.480]  caused by the vaccines well we have certainly that's true with
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:51.440]  some of the chicken he was mentioning other cars
[3:50:51.440 --> 3:50:56.240]  chicken pox vaccine uh we know now that uh there is reactivations
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:50:58.560]  some of these children are getting vaccinated they're actually having
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:01.680]  vaccine stream chicken pox stay there final segment more calls people around
