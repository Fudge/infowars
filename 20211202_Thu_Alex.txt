[00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:17.263]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.881]  My friends, we are live.
[00:00:52.881 --> 00:01:00.005]  Thank you for joining us on this Thursday, December 2nd broadcast.
[00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.486]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:07.969]  We are going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.650]  Well, we are truly living shelf of heaven now.
[00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:40.037]  Just yesterday, we broke down the propaganda around the Western world, from Australia to the United States, from Germany to England, from Scotland to Spain, with all the paid pundits saying, the time for forced injections has come, we're going to come to your house and forcibly inject you, and if you resist us, the army will kill you!
[00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.039]  Everybody from Howard Stern to Cramer on CNBC.
[00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:58.946]  And of course that was lockstep with the unelected president of the European Union Commission that actually runs the EU, set up in 1956 in the Treaty of Rome.
[00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:01.749]  Look it up.
[00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:07.334]  The entire group running it are literally Austrian-Hungarian Empire royalty.
[00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:08.955]  But they of course got rid of their titles.
[00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:14.787]  The last head of it was in the family, the new head of it is connected to that.
[00:02:14.787 --> 00:02:26.773]  And literal royal Germans are announcing that they've taken over the European Union and that forced injections are about to begin.
[00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:33.136]  I told you to expect Germany within a week to announce forced inoculations door-to-door with the military.
[00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:39.059]  This will be shown all over the news worldwide like it's normal, so it can then be brought here.
[00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.740]  And sure as hell,
[00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.851]  The dictator Merkel, who's staged elections.
[00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:51.333]  The communist, the globalist Merkel has handed power over the new puppet government.
[00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:56.294]  And they have announced February 1st, door-to-door forced injections to begin.
[00:02:56.294 --> 00:02:58.215]  A civil war will break out.
[00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:01.756]  Even 1% of the Germans that are not injected fight back.
[00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:03.437]  It will be catastrophic.
[00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:04.797]  But they have no other choice now.
[00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:17.360]  If Hitler would have just said there was a disease and he had a vaccine, and he was invading countries to save them, he probably would have won World War II.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:29.642]  The globalists have bought up the media, the globalists have bought up the academia, the globalists have set up big tech to censor and control, and now they are making their move.
[00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.383]  And it's being reported by Fox News,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.981]  By Peter Doocy, who's a Doocy of a reporter.
[00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.242]  He's amazing.
[00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:41.783]  Does more than all the other corporate media in the field together.
[00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:51.867]  Biden is set to announce in a few hours draconian controls and threaten the public that anyone that is not vaccinated will be locked in their houses in blue cities.
[00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:59.769]  So everything you see in Germany, everything you see in Australia, everything you see in Spain is coming here if you put up with it.
[00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.110]  Thomas Jefferson was once asked,
[00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:03.614]  In a letter.
[00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:09.377]  What is the level of tyranny in which humans will accept?
[00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:11.679]  Which mankind will accept and live?
[00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:16.942]  And he said, it is the exact level that you will accept.
[00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:19.744]  Whatever level you will accommodate.
[00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:20.544]  That's really true.
[00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:25.267]  You see, there's not a vacuum in nature.
[00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:31.091]  So when you don't stand up for your freedoms and you don't care about your freedoms, bad people will come in and fill the vacuum and you will end up a slave.
[00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:36.174]  And maybe the first managers, you know, aren't that bad, but they always get replaced by worse people.
[00:04:36.174 --> 00:04:39.254]  And finally, you end up with pure evil.
[00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:44.035]  People that want to roast your children on a spit and eat them in front of you.
[00:04:44.035 --> 00:04:48.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's on.
[00:04:48.336 --> 00:04:54.258]  Global corporate exterminist operation using COVID-19 as a pretext to establish total martial law.
[00:04:54.258 --> 00:04:55.778]  And the killing's just getting started.
[00:04:59.324 --> 00:05:09.773]  InfoWars, we have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:03.037]  Big Brother.
[00:06:03.037 --> 00:06:03.957]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.017]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:16.383]  You want answers?
[00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:18.304]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:27.226]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:33.307]  Germany, for over 20 months, has been under martial law lockdown.
[00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:35.308]  Germany runs the European Union.
[00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:40.689]  The European Union was a project of a man you may have heard of,
[00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:47.000]  Adolf Alois Hitler of Austria.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.741]  That's on record.
[00:06:48.741 --> 00:07:01.243]  He also invented the Volkswagen and the modern highways and so many other things that the left doesn't want you to know about because the Nazis were a leftist movement.
[00:07:01.243 --> 00:07:03.764]  Why do I raise that point, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:10.666]  Well, the head of the European Union, the unelected president of the Commission, that's been operating since 1956 under treaty,
[00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.292]  Oh yeah, people thought they were just signing a treaty back in 56.
[00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:21.875]  No, that was putting this commission over their governments.
[00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:26.498]  She announced that they need to prepare for forced inoculation EU-wide.
[00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:37.826]  I said, within a week, you will see Merkel announce forced inoculations, forced injections of the GMO, franken, plot shot, death shot.
[00:07:37.826 --> 00:07:39.808]  Well, she did it quicker than that.
[00:07:39.808 --> 00:07:42.490]  This morning, German time, about 10 hours ago,
[00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:52.204]  They announced, ladies and gentlemen, that forced injections will begin in February.
[00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:55.447]  Door-to-door with the police.
[00:07:55.447 --> 00:08:06.337]  That puts you into a database, it's total control, and obviously the shot is linked to massive cardiac problems and cancer and turns off your DNA so that you rapidly age and die.
[00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:09.379]  Bare minimum, probably get cancer, depending on the case.
[00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:10.480]  That's in mainline studies.
[00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:28.589]  This is their depopulation weapon and the police of Germany, when they follow these orders, are now walking the exact steps of where the Germans went 70 plus years ago.
[00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:34.132]  And remember the Nuremberg trials, just saying following orders did not cut it.
[00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:37.413]  Now a lot of police have joined and military have joined the protesters.
[00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:39.104]  By the millions.
[00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:44.787]  And so the majority of them don't like what's happening, so they're now bringing in special thugs and deputizing them.
[00:08:44.787 --> 00:08:48.949]  They're not wearing badges, who will then go out and try to intimidate the public.
[00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:51.710]  But this is the cover for martial law.
[00:08:51.710 --> 00:09:03.676]  I mean, if they can put in your body an experimental GMO shot that makes you sick and kills you, if they can censor everybody that's against it, if they can shut down all the businesses that they say are non-essential, that will collapse civilization into their control.
[00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:10.705]  And so what you see happening in Germany and Australia and everywhere is coming here.
[00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:14.370]  And Biden is set to announce more draconian controls today.
[00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:18.527]  In fact, let's get that clip ready and we'll play it here in just a moment.
[00:09:18.527 --> 00:09:19.487]  Alert.
[00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:28.711]  Fox's Peter Doocy says that today the White House plans to announce some of the strictest COVID restrictions on Americans yet.
[00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.672]  But they're not COVID restrictions.
[00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:36.514]  They are the cover, the training wheels for martial law.
[00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:39.515]  And now, as you can see, the training wheels are coming off.
[00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:45.789]  Forced injection in your homes, no matter how many times the media says, oh, it used to happen in the past.
[00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:46.410]  That's not true.
[00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:52.016]  A few areas in the South tried it on black people in the 20s at the height of eugenics.
[00:09:52.016 --> 00:09:54.739]  And that later was outlawed in those areas.
[00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:56.541]  So yeah, bad things have been done before.
[00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.964]  Doesn't mean that because bad things were done before, they can do it again.
[00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:04.559]  They already tried this before, ladies and gentlemen, and again, it has nothing to do with protecting you.
[00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:06.880]  It's all about power and control over your body.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:14.946]  You can argue that real vaccines can actually help people, and when they're not tainted and not toxic, they have 100% efficacy in many cases.
[00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:15.867]  These are not vaccines.
[00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:17.408]  They erase your immunity.
[00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:22.951]  And I know this audience knows that, but the mere act and the power and the control
[00:10:23.962 --> 00:10:33.386]  of being able to roll something out that hurts people publicly, and they still get away with it, gives them total, absolute dominance.
[00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:44.391]  And from there, they are going to bankrupt all the major private banks, all the private industry, and consolidate it under the Great Reset in their own words.
[00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:49.734]  Also, there is a standoff going on at the New York police standoff.
[00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:54.734]  New York Police's standoff with armed man at United Nations HQ.
[00:10:57.597 --> 00:10:59.338]  We do have some sources in the SWAT team.
[00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:00.419]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.500]  We've got some calls out.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.303]  Heavily armed New York City police have surrounded the area outside the U.N.
[00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:10.125]  headquarters on East River and are reportedly negotiating the person carrying a gun.
[00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:16.269]  The NYPD has issued a traffic alert for the intersection of 42nd Street and First Avenue right outside the U.N.
[00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:20.572]  HQ and said the public should expect emergency vehicles in the surrounding area.
[00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:22.974]  So we'll continue to watch that as it unfolds.
[00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:24.675]  There's some of the footage of
[00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:31.829]  What's happening now that Newsmax happened to have a reporter on the ground?
[00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:43.953]  Literally 50 yards down from where you see those police, up the road north there, they have big banners up saying, soon you will own nothing and have nothing.
[00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.995]  And soon you will not live in a city, you will live in a commune.
[00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:51.936]  And then it shows like concrete bunkers that people live in.
[00:11:51.936 --> 00:11:53.297]  Just shows you something dystopian.
[00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:56.018]  It says this is good to normalize it.
[00:11:58.359 --> 00:11:59.320]  So here's the headlines.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.843]  Germany imposes national lockdown on non-injected.
[00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:08.668]  Oh, but the other people that have their travel passes, the good little slaves, they get to go outside.
[00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:09.449]  But the key is...
[00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:17.947]  Buried in that is Merkel, the outgoing dictator's comments, announces nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated, total discrimination.
[00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:27.210]  Germany on Thursday announced a nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated as its leaders backed plans for mandatory vaccinations in the coming months.
[00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:33.212]  Unvaccinated people will be banned from accessing all but the most essential businesses such as supermarkets and pharmacies.
[00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:45.664]  To curb the spread of coronavirus, oh yes, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel with her successor Olaf Scholz announced Thursday following crisis talks with regional leaders.
[00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:52.507]  Oh, they've got way more deaths and way more illnesses, they say, from COVID than they did last year, and their hospitals are now actually full.
[00:12:54.096 --> 00:13:04.023]  And the German statistics out of their own government say the majority are the vaccinated and they're twice as likely to die of COVID or other illnesses if you're, quote, double vaxxed.
[00:13:04.023 --> 00:13:08.285]  And now Germany says you got to take a third or a fourth.
[00:13:08.285 --> 00:13:09.746]  You're like, well, that's the death of logic.
[00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:13.749]  Even if this stuff worked, you shouldn't make us take it.
[00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:20.714]  But you see, they want that power and just to drive you into total and complete submission now.
[00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:22.635]  So let's put up the show headline for everybody.
[00:13:24.332 --> 00:13:32.675]  Because what's incredible is every time they roll out more controls, they always bury their real aim in the article.
[00:13:32.675 --> 00:13:34.955]  The big story is not lockdown tubing here.
[00:13:34.955 --> 00:13:36.756]  I've been telling you that's coming for a long time.
[00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:37.956]  You could tell it was.
[00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:47.339]  It was put in the anti-terrorism legislation and the anti-terrorism executive orders that Biden signed in June saying the main threat is people protesting lockdowns.
[00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:50.340]  Gee, what do you think's coming?
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.120]  The Fourth Reich is here.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.961]  Germany announces new lockdowns.
[00:13:57.256 --> 00:14:04.677]  Forced injections to start February 1st.
[00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:17.219]  Germany has now taken full control of the European Union and has announced plans to force COVID injections on the public.
[00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:25.301]  Again, Germany has now taken full control of the European Union and has announced plans for forced COVID injections to begin
[00:14:26.812 --> 00:14:28.973]  Continent-wide.
[00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:30.653]  Today, Deutschland.
[00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:32.314]  Tomorrow, the world.
[00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:40.436]  Meanwhile, in the U.S., Biden is set to follow suit by launching new draconian restrictions today.
[00:14:40.436 --> 00:14:41.457]  Tune in.
[00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:43.017]  Spread the link.
[00:14:43.017 --> 00:14:44.378]  It's an exact program.
[00:14:44.378 --> 00:14:46.238]  It's an exact operation.
[00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:54.681]  They squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, then say, oh, just take the shots, take the digital ID, take the vaccine passport, take the social credit score, and you'll be free.
[00:14:55.598 --> 00:15:00.920]  And then those that comply are given a little bit of room, but then they clamp back down even more.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.462]  And then those that don't submit are totally locked up and taken to camps.
[00:15:05.462 --> 00:15:15.386]  The CDC's own website has the shielding operation, where they say they're going to lock down every town, every city, and have armed block captains that control where you can go and what you can do.
[00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:19.147]  We are literally going to have communists running around pointing weapons at us.
[00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:23.669]  And most of your gun owners, when they do it, will actually give them the guns and
[00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:26.789]  Say, would you like to have my children?
[00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:29.931]  I mean, that's who America's become.
[00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:35.474]  But not everyone has become this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:35.474 --> 00:15:38.336]  Not everyone has bowed down to all of this.
[00:15:38.336 --> 00:15:43.959]  But they are taking microchips in Europe under government auspices, in Sweden and other countries.
[00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:45.940]  There's footage on screen.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.862]  If you really want to be cool and trendy, you get your vaccine pass right in your hand.
[00:15:49.787 --> 00:15:53.210]  There's just so many injections, so many violations, so much rape.
[00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:58.374]  They want control over our bodies to force us into the metaverse.
[00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:04.018]  If you're concerned about the power grid and... We have launched the most important sale of the year.
[00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:09.543]  Because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:09.683]  So...
[00:16:10.902 --> 00:16:21.335]  Right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning, and it's only going to run until the end of the month, and that's now only six, seven days.
[00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:25.280]  InfoWars store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:27.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[00:16:27.702 --> 00:16:28.942]  It's our best seller.
[00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:30.642]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:16:30.642 --> 00:16:36.764]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the T-amino acids, everything you need for your immune system and your body.
[00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:38.145]  And it tastes great.
[00:16:38.145 --> 00:16:39.985]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:44.447]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:47.530]  And so much more at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.355]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[00:16:52.355 --> 00:16:55.859]  Bet on freedom, bet on InfoWars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:59.863]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:04.847]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:06.909]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:12.393]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:17:12.393 --> 00:17:13.494]  But we failed.
[00:17:13.494 --> 00:17:15.156]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:17:15.156 --> 00:17:16.657]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:17:16.997 --> 00:17:23.020]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, Great Reset.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:31.945]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:17:31.945 --> 00:17:37.468]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:17:37.468 --> 00:17:40.049]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:42.871]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:43.951]  What are champions made of?
[00:17:43.951 --> 00:17:45.112]  Here's a man who can show you.
[00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:14.336]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:15.997]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:17.379]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:20.101]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139
[00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:32.272]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:08.111]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[00:19:08.111 --> 00:19:09.932]  I've had a lot of loss.
[00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:10.752]  Everybody else has.
[00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:24.620]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.361]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:37.019]  And I see the general public in a medically-induced, scientifically-induced, behavioral, psychologically-controlled trance.
[00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:41.424]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[00:19:41.424 --> 00:19:51.133]  But this is the process of birth, and then growth, and then falling apart, and then degenerating and collapsing, and then coming back to life again.
[00:19:52.270 --> 00:20:01.632]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[00:20:01.632 --> 00:20:10.874]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.874 --> 00:20:14.075]  Here we are, on planet Earth.
[00:20:20.004 --> 00:20:23.887]  Staring into infinity.
[00:20:23.887 --> 00:20:26.048]  I'm your host Alex Jones, very honored to be here.
[00:20:26.048 --> 00:20:33.794]  Alright, I reached out to our sources that are on the ground in New York, and they said that it appears to be somebody trying to be suicided by a cop.
[00:20:33.794 --> 00:20:34.955]  They don't know what's in the, uh...
[00:20:36.254 --> 00:20:36.354]  Okay.
[00:20:36.354 --> 00:20:37.495]  Here's what's going on.
[00:20:37.495 --> 00:20:38.596]  We have a really interesting lady
[00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:16.145]  Joining us in the second hour, I had a chance to meet her in person in San Antonio a few weeks ago, General Flynn, Melissa Tate.
[00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:21.370]  And I think that she's one of the smartest young women out there fighting the globalists.
[00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.334]  She also grew up in an African country that was a paradise.
[00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:32.147]  Until the authoritarian communists took over to describe what that was like coming up next hour.
[00:21:32.147 --> 00:21:46.310]  Then I'm gonna open the phones up in the third hour, the entire third hour, and then the Kate Daly takes over in the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schroyer today.
[00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.811]  The time that we're in is so insanely important that
[00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:57.081]  I think it's very, very central to be calm about this and really let things sink in.
[00:21:57.081 --> 00:22:00.403]  Now, when I give you that advice, I'm giving myself that.
[00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:03.566]  You saw me get really angry yesterday and get upset.
[00:22:03.566 --> 00:22:05.027]  And that was very real.
[00:22:05.027 --> 00:22:13.153]  And that was me passionately trying to fight these people as much as I can with the truth and with the information and with the oratory skills.
[00:22:13.153 --> 00:22:15.235]  And it certainly has its place in motivating people.
[00:22:15.235 --> 00:22:20.739]  But we need to just sit back and really decide what we're going to do and then start taking action.
[00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:42.152]  Because the images of Obama and Fauci going to public schools with big lines of elementary students looking scared, staring up at the monsters while they helped the, quote, nurses, the executioners, the medical workers, inject them with the evil GMO garbage.
[00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:44.093]  So I was already upset seeing that in the morning.
[00:22:44.093 --> 00:22:49.996]  And then I read about how they're announcing forced inoculations and dictatorship in Europe and how that's the same crew running the whole planet.
[00:22:52.336 --> 00:23:01.807]  And witnessing then people escaping camps and checkpoints in Australia and then...
[00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:21.724]  The first 30 pages of 500 a month order to be released by a federal judge of Pfizer and the FDA, and the first 30 pages say thousands of deaths, massive increases in miscarriages, thousands of miscarriages, blood clots, heart attacks, and they tried to suppress that.
[00:23:21.724 --> 00:23:24.085]  We already knew that, we could see it happening, but...
[00:23:24.685 --> 00:23:32.207]  To know that they know, and then they knew this in February, because they're only releasing stuff from the second half of January.
[00:23:32.207 --> 00:23:34.307]  Remember, the shot started mid-January.
[00:23:34.307 --> 00:23:42.449]  So they released two weeks of data of adverse reactions, or adverse events, AEs.
[00:23:42.449 --> 00:23:45.750]  And I should just only be covering that here today, again.
[00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.330]  But, oh, they just hope we glaze over it, and then that's it.
[00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.271]  No, these are murderers.
[00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:51.011]  These are criminals.
[00:23:52.884 --> 00:24:06.606]  And when you watch the children scared in the videos of Obama and Fauci, I mean, and their parents clutching them and holding them, it's like watching a crocodile walk over and, you know, grab a kid at Disney and drag it into the pond and eat it.
[00:24:06.606 --> 00:24:09.807]  But it's going to be done in slow motion.
[00:24:09.807 --> 00:24:12.528]  So, this just tears my guts out.
[00:24:12.528 --> 00:24:16.788]  And we're going to be breaking it down today.
[00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.029]  But let me do this.
[00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:19.029]  This is a shorter segment.
[00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:20.269]  A longer segment is about to come up.
[00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:31.762]  I'm going to talk about something when we come back that if you do it, and if I do it, we're going to win very quickly.
[00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:36.845]  And Tucker Carlson understands this, and that's why he's a leader.
[00:24:36.845 --> 00:24:47.511]  Tucker Carlson did not go on TV last night and endorse me because he wanted to just fawn over Alex Jones.
[00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:49.012]  He signed as John Hancock.
[00:24:50.267 --> 00:24:52.548]  On the Declaration of Independence 2.0.
[00:24:52.548 --> 00:24:58.852]  And the way you do that is say Alex Jones was right.
[00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:01.313]  That's the revolutionary, I am Spartacus.
[00:25:01.313 --> 00:25:06.656]  When they came to find Spartacus to kill him, you know, the gladiator slave revolt leader, he'd already been killed.
[00:25:06.656 --> 00:25:09.578]  They didn't know it, the Romans.
[00:25:09.578 --> 00:25:11.659]  We're killing thousands of people saying, tell us where he is.
[00:25:11.659 --> 00:25:13.560]  And they kept saying, I'm Spartacus.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.341]  I'm Spartacus.
[00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:15.261]  I'm Spartacus.
[00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:17.462]  It's not Alex Jones he's talking about.
[00:25:17.462 --> 00:25:18.203]  It's all of us.
[00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:20.917]  It's populism.
[00:25:20.917 --> 00:25:27.222]  And so, they ridicule me, they lie about me, they sue me, they demonize me, they attack my family.
[00:25:27.222 --> 00:25:29.084]  I understood that.
[00:25:29.084 --> 00:25:32.847]  And I believed that other men and women would see what was happening and stand up.
[00:25:32.847 --> 00:25:37.271]  And I could be an example to others of perseverance.
[00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:48.276]  And so Tucker is better spoken than I, and more focused than I, and he does a wonderful, fabulous, very populist, very liberal show.
[00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:51.957]  Classical liberal, not modern leftist.
[00:25:51.957 --> 00:25:55.118]  And he understands that.
[00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:58.999]  Just like Joe Rogan went on air two weeks ago and said, Alex Jones is always right.
[00:25:58.999 --> 00:26:00.880]  Well, I'm really right most of the time.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.461]  But it's a saying just to say, in the general main, I'm dead on.
[00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:17.762]  And when people adopt my perspective, it's not my view or what I said was going on so it magically popped out.
[00:26:17.762 --> 00:26:23.204]  When people actually look at things from the angle I'm looking at and go, oh my God, they're going to see everything.
[00:26:24.588 --> 00:26:29.089]  And I'm going to show you some footage when we come back before I play the Tucker Carlson to really illustrate this.
[00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:39.813]  And if you're a radio listener, I really want you to go to Band.Video or Infowars.com forward slash show to the Alex Jones section and get the live feed so you can see this for yourself.
[00:26:39.813 --> 00:26:47.355]  Because this is an allegory and a parallel that really explains everything.
[00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:53.077]  There's something we're going to show you in the Florida Everglades that is a perfect analogy.
[00:26:54.554 --> 00:26:56.476]  And it ties into Tucker Carlson and everything that's happening.
[00:26:56.476 --> 00:27:09.706]  And if you do this mind trick with yourself, you can get control of your mind, like Elon Musk has been talking about, by removing their software and then operating on the software God originally gave you.
[00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:12.027]  Also, I want to thank the listeners for your support.
[00:27:12.027 --> 00:27:21.555]  When you buy books and films and water filters and air filters and shortwave radios and other survival gear at infowarestore.com, you are funding the very tip of the spear and changing the world.
[00:27:21.555 --> 00:27:23.877]  So, the success I've had is your success.
[00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:25.890]  We are a family.
[00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:33.759]  This is a wonderful time, despite its pain, because it's really showing us who's good and who's bad.
[00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:34.780]  It was the best of times.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.262]  It was the worst of times.
[00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:37.083]  A Tale of Two Cities.
[00:27:38.817 --> 00:27:47.583]  But now, with all the things the globalists are doing and all the things they're up to, it's time to boost your immune system and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win, all at the same time.
[00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:53.607]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, free shipping, double patriot points, 40% off.
[00:27:53.607 --> 00:27:56.448]  Storewide free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:27:58.598 --> 00:28:03.421]  Or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:10.486]  888-253-3139 or Infowarsstore.com.
[00:28:10.486 --> 00:28:13.628]  And I hope we back the globalists off and things get better.
[00:28:13.628 --> 00:28:16.910]  But as bad as things are, war could start with Russia or China any day.
[00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.552]  We could be off the air any minute.
[00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:20.133]  That could be it.
[00:28:20.133 --> 00:28:20.993]  No more communications.
[00:28:20.993 --> 00:28:21.774]  You never see me again.
[00:28:21.774 --> 00:28:22.634]  I never talk to you again.
[00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.355]  I never see you again.
[00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:29.136]  So, take every day as potentially our last to be able to communicate.
[00:28:29.136 --> 00:28:31.439]  I'd get those Infowars t-shirts now.
[00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:32.320]  I'd get those films.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.101]  I'd get those books.
[00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:34.123]  I'd get that information.
[00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:35.404]  I'd save the shows.
[00:28:35.404 --> 00:28:37.527]  I'd download them and put them on thumb drives.
[00:28:37.527 --> 00:28:40.491]  Because in the future, if the enemy gets to the next level and we don't back them off,
[00:28:41.684 --> 00:28:44.185]  This information will be like platinum.
[00:28:44.185 --> 00:28:45.546]  It will not be allowed anywhere.
[00:28:45.546 --> 00:28:47.647]  You'll be sent to a FEMA camp if you have it.
[00:28:47.647 --> 00:28:50.629]  But out of the information we cover here, we will beat these people.
[00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:51.289]  We don't have a choice.
[00:28:51.289 --> 00:28:52.870]  They're coming to kill us anyways.
[00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.171]  They are coming to kill you and your family.
[00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:54.851]  Know that.
[00:28:54.851 --> 00:28:56.352]  Their plan is to murder you and your family.
[00:28:59.844 --> 00:29:01.165]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:03.187]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[00:29:03.187 --> 00:29:03.607]  Welcome.
[00:29:03.607 --> 00:29:04.328]  Hello, Alex.
[00:29:04.328 --> 00:29:04.928]  Yes, Malcolm.
[00:29:04.928 --> 00:29:05.288]  All right.
[00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:09.432]  I'll make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:13.775]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroer.
[00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:16.798]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:19.440]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.481]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:26.365]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:33.150]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.991]  This is like a very fine wine.
[00:29:34.991 --> 00:29:37.113]  In fact, each batch is different.
[00:29:37.113 --> 00:29:39.214]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:42.837]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[00:29:42.837 --> 00:29:43.777]  That's just how it is.
[00:29:43.777 --> 00:29:44.438]  It's how it works.
[00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:49.143]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[00:29:49.143 --> 00:29:52.966]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:15.758]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[00:30:15.758 --> 00:30:19.421]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:26.127]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[00:30:26.727 --> 00:30:30.808]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:33.549]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:34.369]  It's high quality.
[00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:37.570]  It's very, very low cost at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:44.951]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:51.113]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:30:51.113 --> 00:30:55.594]  That's how you fight the Great Reset, is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[00:30:55.874 --> 00:30:59.696]  So get prepared now at m4warstore.com.
[00:30:59.696 --> 00:31:05.079]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:14.765]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[00:31:15.405 --> 00:31:25.375]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[00:31:25.375 --> 00:31:32.141]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:33.582]  But there is only two things to do.
[00:31:34.683 --> 00:31:37.847]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[00:31:37.847 --> 00:31:41.151]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:46.558]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[00:31:46.558 --> 00:31:48.380]  And so, we must prepare.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.203]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods.
[00:31:50.883 --> 00:31:52.785]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:59.152]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals
[00:32:07.921 --> 00:32:16.510]  Hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.955]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:29.344]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:32.546]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:32.546 --> 00:32:41.254]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made-in-America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.

[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.022]  A true 360 win.

[00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:54.105]  Check out the new line.
[00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:54.666]  It's amazing.
[00:33:01.064 --> 00:33:16.217]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.217 --> 00:33:24.824]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.886 --> 00:33:32.569]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:32.689]  OK.
[00:33:32.689 --> 00:33:41.516]  Let me play a little bit of Tucker Carlson's defense of free speech and defensive journalism last night.
[00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:51.183]  Why would he come out knowing he's going to be attacked and say Alex Jones is a better journalist than mainstream media, than ABC, CBS, CNN?
[00:33:51.183 --> 00:33:52.144]  Well, because it's true.
[00:33:52.144 --> 00:33:56.267]  They lie to you on purpose.
[00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:57.268]  They're bought and paid for.
[00:33:59.738 --> 00:34:04.020]  They promote the ongoing tyranny of the COVID lockdowns.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.122]  They prop up Joe Biden.
[00:34:07.122 --> 00:34:18.607]  And so all these Republicans and all these establishment types, who aren't really globalist, go along with the system because they're scared of the dying, dead, dinosaur media.
[00:34:18.607 --> 00:34:21.149]  The zombie media, because it's been dead a long time.
[00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:24.450]  Tiny viewerships.
[00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:27.232]  Local AM radio shows that are number one in their town.
[00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:32.511]  Have up to 50 to 100,000 people listening to them in big cities.
[00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:37.574]  CNN doesn't have 100,000 viewers on their average show system-wide.
[00:34:37.574 --> 00:34:40.195]  They have to pay to be in the airports.
[00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:45.018]  And so he is basically saying, hey, I don't go along with the system.
[00:34:45.018 --> 00:34:47.419]  I'm not scared of ridicule by them.
[00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:48.400]  I like Alex Jones.
[00:34:50.302 --> 00:35:08.748]  Not because he's trying to prop up Alex Jones, not because he's trying to earn brownie points with me, because Tucker Carlson knows that I'm a good person that's trying to tell the truth, and that is really on to the New World Order, and understands what's happening, and that we better break with the system or it's all over.
[00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:15.370]  Because when you're going along with the surface propaganda, you don't see the forest for the trees.
[00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:16.030]  You don't see
[00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:33.738]  When your feet are dangling over the side of the culvert, when your feet are dangling over the side of the creek, that while you're looking at that little bass swimming up to your lure, you didn't see an alligator swimming right up underneath your feet about to attack you.
[00:35:33.738 --> 00:35:42.524]  I'm going to show some of that footage in a minute of a family, and they're there on the side of the road with a culvert.
[00:35:43.595 --> 00:35:54.663]  They're trying to catch some bass in Florida and they don't see because they're busy looking at the little bass in the reeds that a big old 15-foot alligator is coming up to eat the little girl.
[00:35:54.663 --> 00:35:59.847]  But as soon as you see the alligator, once they see it and jump up and point it out, you can't unsee it.
[00:35:59.847 --> 00:36:10.635]  But when you're looking at the bass and looking at the lure, you can't help as a hunter, as a human, who is designed to focus on your goal and what you're looking at.
[00:36:11.596 --> 00:36:17.359]  That while you're looking at the magician's beautiful assistant, he's getting the next trick ready.
[00:36:17.359 --> 00:36:20.901]  And putting the rabbit in the compartment under the hat.
[00:36:20.901 --> 00:36:28.824]  So while they're looking at the fish and the lure, right here's an alligator about to eat the little girl.
[00:36:28.824 --> 00:36:33.387]  And then finally they stand up and look and see it last minute and don't die.
[00:36:34.244 --> 00:36:39.930]  You see, that's the Alex Jones moment when you pull back and go, wait, they want me to see this and that.
[00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.691]  Let me pull back.
[00:36:40.691 --> 00:36:42.033]  Whoa!
[00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:46.918]  There's the New World Order alligator, the crocodile about to eat you right there.
[00:36:46.918 --> 00:36:48.340]  That's my allegory of this show.
[00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:59.197]  Tucker has the understanding that we're not going to get out of this tyranny unless we break with the system and get out of their mind control and expand our awareness.
[00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:03.582]  We need the 35,000 foot view and we need the one inch view.
[00:37:03.582 --> 00:37:09.668]  Instead, we're only focused on one little tiny corner of something instead of the big picture.
[00:37:09.668 --> 00:37:11.070]  So here's Tucker last night.
[00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:15.223]  Really picking a fight with the establishment and throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:37:15.223 --> 00:37:18.784]  And this is what everybody else needs to do is stop being scared of info wars.
[00:37:18.784 --> 00:37:24.345]  Stop being scared of talking about the New World Order or the globalists or all these real things.
[00:37:24.345 --> 00:37:28.007]  The New York Times will call you names if you talk about globalists and say it doesn't exist.
[00:37:28.007 --> 00:37:31.307]  They have globalist conferences calling themselves globalists.
[00:37:31.307 --> 00:37:34.208]  Stop letting them bully you.
[00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:36.029]  Embrace liberty and freedom.
[00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:37.349]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:38.349]  He is the maxim.
[00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:39.210]  They're scared of it.
[00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:39.950]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:37:40.555 --> 00:37:45.098]  The January 6th committee has been an exercise in armed political intimidation.
[00:37:45.098 --> 00:37:45.878]  How did it start?
[00:37:45.878 --> 00:37:47.319]  You may have forgotten.
[00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:50.702]  Congress formed the committee after several members of the U.S.
[00:37:50.702 --> 00:37:57.286]  Capitol Police, the same people responsible for protecting members of Congress, anonymously commanded them to do it.
[00:37:57.286 --> 00:37:58.867]  So effectively, it was a ransom note.
[00:37:58.867 --> 00:38:00.268]  Prosecute our political opponents.
[00:38:00.268 --> 00:38:01.909]  That's an order from your bodyguards.
[00:38:01.909 --> 00:38:02.770]  Amazingly, they did it.
[00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:10.233]  So from the very first day, the January 6th committee was never about gathering information.
[00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:13.414]  Obviously, Congress already has the information.
[00:38:13.414 --> 00:38:17.535]  Nancy Pelosi knows exactly how many federal agents were in the crowd that day.
[00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:18.976]  She won't tell us.
[00:38:18.976 --> 00:38:23.197]  Pelosi could release thousands of hours of videotape evidence from January 6th.
[00:38:23.197 --> 00:38:24.498]  She refuses to do that.
[00:38:24.778 --> 00:38:25.838]  You know what we're gonna do?
[00:38:50.885 --> 00:38:56.190]  I usually nail it, but I looked at the time on this video wrong.
[00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.371]  It's a little bit longer than I thought.
[00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:02.174]  So we're going to go to break in four or five minutes, come back and I'll play it from the start again and then give commentary.
[00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:05.677]  But let me just speak to what he was getting to right there.
[00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:11.322]  Steve Bannon is asking for their subpoenas to him to be public, which in almost every case they would.
[00:39:11.322 --> 00:39:14.784]  They're declaring a bunch of weird national security stuff and saying no.
[00:39:14.784 --> 00:39:16.486]  And now he's trying to subpoena the committee.
[00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:21.561]  Which you're supposed to do in a criminal case and they're saying no.
[00:39:21.561 --> 00:39:26.062]  He's been indicted for contempt of Congress, two counts.
[00:39:26.062 --> 00:39:31.044]  And it's the same thing with my civil cases that the Democrat Party runs.
[00:39:31.044 --> 00:39:34.806]  We gave them everything they wanted that wasn't even related to defamation.
[00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:38.367]  And they just lied and said we didn't.
[00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:40.468]  But they, again, overstepped with Owen Schroer.
[00:39:41.616 --> 00:39:52.430]  Because they never subpoenaed him, they never deposed him, they never asked him for a single thing, and they said he too is defaulted for not giving them information.
[00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.895]  They don't even care if the fraud is totally transparent anymore.
[00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:57.602]  They're going for broke.
[00:39:57.602 --> 00:40:03.168]  They believe they control the military and the Justice Department and the media, but they don't control the military.
[00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:04.930]  The military hates the New World Order.
[00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.251]  They don't control the public's mind.
[00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:07.532]  We hate the mainstream media.
[00:40:07.532 --> 00:40:10.215]  What, you stole the election, so that means you're legitimate?
[00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:11.477]  Everybody hates Joe Biden!
[00:40:13.134 --> 00:40:16.715]  So as long as we're aware of that, understand their tricks, they're going to fail.
[00:40:16.715 --> 00:40:28.219]  Their problems are more lockdowns, more fear, more division, telling the vaccinated, oh, you're sick because of the unvaccinated, which is a total fraud on his face.
[00:40:30.888 --> 00:40:33.330]  And moving against us.
[00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.654]  And then, so they can be the victims, attacking their own facilities.
[00:40:37.654 --> 00:40:43.340]  Bombing Pfizer, bombing Moderna, bombing Bill Gates' facility in Washington State.
[00:40:44.878 --> 00:40:47.720]  That's the kind of stuff that's in their quiver.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.181]  That's their arrows.
[00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:50.322]  Do not do it.
[00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:51.723]  Do not be violent.
[00:40:51.723 --> 00:40:55.466]  Do not engage in anything that would turn these people into victims.
[00:40:55.466 --> 00:40:56.987]  Expose the science.
[00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.428]  Expose how they're killing us.
[00:40:58.428 --> 00:41:00.209]  Expose their eugenics backgrounds.
[00:41:00.209 --> 00:41:05.273]  Expose how they lied about the shots working, when they actually do work to make you sick and erase your immune system.
[00:41:05.273 --> 00:41:08.816]  And continue to hammer them, and hammer them, and hammer them.
[00:41:09.957 --> 00:41:14.839]  Let me go ahead and show the crocodile footage now, and we'll come back and play the Tucker Carlson footage.
[00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:27.325]  This is Florida Everglades' Never Fails to Amuse and Terrify, and you can find it there on Cape Coral Jade's channel.
[00:41:27.325 --> 00:41:35.909]  And here's the family at the culvert fishing, and they don't see the alligator right there about to eat their daughter, who's sitting on the edge of the culvert.
[00:41:38.075 --> 00:41:44.818]  On the pipe under the road so water can flow to the other side of the stream because they're too busy looking at the lure and the little fishies in the water.
[00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:45.218]  Here it is.
[00:41:45.218 --> 00:41:53.382]  Babe, come look!
[00:41:53.382 --> 00:42:01.866]  Watch where he's falling.
[00:42:01.866 --> 00:42:03.887]  Gators?
[00:42:03.887 --> 00:42:04.427]  Where'd he go?
[00:42:07.972 --> 00:42:11.214]  He said, that's plastic.
[00:42:11.214 --> 00:42:14.796]  The gator car was sniffing.
[00:42:14.796 --> 00:42:16.037]  Oh my God!
[00:42:16.037 --> 00:42:19.699]  Holy s***!
[00:42:19.699 --> 00:42:21.280]  Oh my God!
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:26.323]  I just got... Oh my God!
[00:42:26.323 --> 00:42:27.583]  Guys, I'm not kidding.
[00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:28.324]  Stop right there.
[00:42:28.324 --> 00:42:33.367]  We're gonna come back with the rest of it next segment, but the point is the little girl sees the gator.
[00:42:33.367 --> 00:42:36.348]  She's toddling her feet, the little six-year-old, right above it.
[00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:37.049]  It's about to kill her.
[00:42:38.046 --> 00:42:39.247]  I have to grab her.
[00:42:39.247 --> 00:42:41.229]  And she's like, oh, look, the gator thought I was slipping.
[00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:42.830]  That's because he's coming up to get her.
[00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.331]  And then they're not listening to the child.
[00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:45.772]  And finally they go, whoa, my gosh!
[00:42:45.772 --> 00:42:47.233]  See, I'm like a little kid.
[00:42:47.233 --> 00:42:49.175]  I'm just dangling my feet going, oh, there's the gator.
[00:42:49.175 --> 00:42:50.856]  People don't see it yet.
[00:42:50.856 --> 00:42:55.440]  Once you see it, well, then you're all Alex Jones, that the global predator is coming to kill you.
[00:42:58.393 --> 00:42:59.994]  For a fraction of the cost.
[00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:09.398]  We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[00:43:47.407 --> 00:43:51.291]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:55.695]  Bet on freedom, bet on InfoWars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[00:43:55.695 --> 00:43:59.740]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:08.442]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces.
[00:44:08.442 --> 00:44:15.943]  That the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[00:44:15.943 --> 00:44:20.784]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[00:44:20.784 --> 00:44:23.084]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[00:44:23.084 --> 00:44:27.065]  They know that the people are starting to get wise to this depopulation agenda.
[00:44:27.972 --> 00:44:39.724]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher percentage up front, and so people are waking up.
[00:44:39.724 --> 00:44:42.947]  The weapons work a little too good.
[00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:47.752]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead, they're making too big of a noise!
[00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:50.614]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:52.355]  They're coming after our children.
[00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:57.457]  So it's up to us to protect our little children, or God will not look favorably on us.
[00:44:57.457 --> 00:44:59.658]  Remember, God is watching.
[00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:03.500]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.681]  And with spiritual warfare, and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods, it's all come out.
[00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:16.463]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:19.684]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[00:45:19.684 --> 00:45:25.445]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[00:45:27.358 --> 00:45:33.161]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:45.408]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:49.850]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep InfoWars in the air now more than ever.
[00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:55.554]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe hammock.
[00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:59.356]  And we are opposing the one world government and the Mark of the Beast they just announced.
[00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:04.710]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:06.771]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[00:46:06.771 --> 00:46:12.254]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[00:46:12.254 --> 00:46:13.355]  But we failed.
[00:46:13.355 --> 00:46:15.016]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[00:46:15.016 --> 00:46:16.517]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[00:46:16.877 --> 00:46:22.882]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[00:46:22.882 --> 00:46:31.809]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:37.333]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[00:46:37.333 --> 00:46:39.916]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[00:46:39.916 --> 00:46:42.738]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[00:46:43.579 --> 00:46:44.259]  We're good to go.
[00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:18.091]  Yippee-yi-ay!
[00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:20.355]  Yippee-yi-ay!
[00:47:20.355 --> 00:47:24.621]  Yippee-yi-oh!
[00:47:24.621 --> 00:47:26.144]  Ghost Riders!
[00:47:26.144 --> 00:47:30.010]  Ghost Riders in the sky!
[00:47:33.827 --> 00:47:44.830]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.991]  Very honored and thankful to be here.
[00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:51.211]  And if you're a radio listener, you hear me describing it.
[00:47:51.211 --> 00:47:59.313]  A family, a mother, a father, several of their children, their younger daughter has her feet hanging over the side of a culver at the Everglades and they're catching bass.
[00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:08.763]  And you see little fish about to hit their lure and the little girl's going, Oh, look, the gators over here, the gator.
[00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:09.344]  They're not listening.
[00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:15.048]  They're busy watching the dad and the bass run into the water, not knowing that the gator is coming up a little girl.
[00:48:15.048 --> 00:48:19.771]  And she's like, Oh, he thought I was going to slip in because she sees him coming in her.
[00:48:22.028 --> 00:48:24.209]  She's thinking, oh, he thinks I'm jumping in with him.
[00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:26.231]  She's not even thinking he's about to kill her.
[00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:34.756]  But she would drag her under, drown her, and then put her under a sunken log until she rot, got, became rotten so he could, you know, eat her.
[00:48:34.756 --> 00:48:35.396]  That's how they do it.
[00:48:35.396 --> 00:48:38.358]  They age your meat.
[00:48:38.358 --> 00:48:45.823]  It doesn't matter if you're at Disney World, your child's playing in the backyard at the condo you rent, and they didn't clean it out of alligators, your child's gonna get eaten too.
[00:48:45.823 --> 00:48:50.846]  But the point is, once you see that alligator, you can't unsee
[00:48:53.157 --> 00:48:56.120]  The alligator, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:04.188]  Once you see the tiger in the bush, or the lion about the ear of the wolf, or the predator, the Fauci, you can't unsee it.
[00:49:05.845 --> 00:49:07.326]  But imagine people that don't see it.
[00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:14.069]  They're there, oh, Fauci and Obama are here to help us at the elementary school.
[00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.950]  Aren't they nice?
[00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.711]  They care so much about the children.
[00:49:16.711 --> 00:49:18.412]  Meanwhile, we have all the documents, the facts.
[00:49:18.412 --> 00:49:18.972]  They knew.
[00:49:18.972 --> 00:49:19.933]  They suppressed it.
[00:49:19.933 --> 00:49:21.614]  It's going to ruin their immune systems.
[00:49:21.614 --> 00:49:24.115]  It's going to give so many of them heart problems.
[00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:26.997]  And God knows what else.
[00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.418]  Kills almost all the rodents they did studies on it with.
[00:49:30.984 --> 00:49:34.686]  People can't get their mind around, it's a predator.
[00:49:34.686 --> 00:49:36.046]  They just can't believe it.
[00:49:36.046 --> 00:49:51.913]  Because they're busy, oh the school play's coming up, oh my cell phone, oh my in-laws are coming down, oh we're gonna go see a movie tonight, and you're distracted with a little fishing lure the globalists have put in front of you, of Netflix, while you're already basically in the alligator's belly.
[00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:55.031]  So that's where we are.
[00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:56.692]  So Tucker Carlson understands that.
[00:49:56.692 --> 00:50:01.453]  He understands that InfoWars is the most accurate overall operation out there.
[00:50:01.453 --> 00:50:03.373]  He can do his own research and everything we talk about.
[00:50:03.373 --> 00:50:04.174]  He can see it's there.
[00:50:04.174 --> 00:50:06.494]  And it's being adopted.
[00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:09.095]  I mean, Joe Rogan sounds more and more like Alex Jones every day.
[00:50:09.095 --> 00:50:11.315]  It's not that Joe even listens to me.
[00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:12.896]  He now gets the perspective.
[00:50:12.896 --> 00:50:13.716]  He sees the alligator.
[00:50:16.141 --> 00:50:18.142]  He sees the elephant in the room.
[00:50:18.142 --> 00:50:20.163]  It's just like subliminal images.
[00:50:20.163 --> 00:50:27.586]  You see an image on a wall, you can't tell what it is, but as soon as somebody points it out, you can't un-see it.
[00:50:27.586 --> 00:50:30.968]  That's really what Reset Wars is all about.
[00:50:30.968 --> 00:50:35.190]  And it drops at ResetWars.com on December 7th.
[00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:40.232]  Hard to believe just five days from now and you'll learn all about it then.
[00:50:40.232 --> 00:50:41.153]  Biggest thing we've done yet.
[00:50:42.925 --> 00:50:50.150]  So I am extremely blessed and honored to be in the zeitgeist, and you put me there, you kept us here, this is all of our victory.
[00:50:50.150 --> 00:51:00.417]  As bad as things are, at least we're the tip of the spear, and humanity's got a fighting chance, and the globalists admit their programs of control are not going so well.
[00:51:00.417 --> 00:51:03.159]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:04.940]  And the red pill is InfoWars.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.621]  InfoWars is the symbol.
[00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:08.862]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:51:08.862 --> 00:51:09.543]  Is the maxim.
[00:51:10.848 --> 00:51:14.310]  And I said that just yesterday.
[00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:17.372]  And you saw what Tucker Carlson said at night.
[00:51:17.372 --> 00:51:18.152]  He agrees.
[00:51:18.152 --> 00:51:18.892]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:51:18.892 --> 00:51:21.814]  I'm not talking about our private conversations.
[00:51:21.814 --> 00:51:29.978]  But he understands we need a chain reaction of leaders and of men and women to recognize the truth and say no to the globalist.
[00:51:29.978 --> 00:51:34.441]  We're not going to get out of this if we don't do it.
[00:51:34.441 --> 00:51:36.142]  The New World Order is very serious.
[00:51:36.142 --> 00:51:38.263]  The New World Order is very, very dangerous.
[00:51:38.263 --> 00:51:40.124]  The New World Order means business.
[00:51:41.994 --> 00:51:42.774]  And we're here now.
[00:51:42.774 --> 00:51:45.036]  We're not, oh, New World Order's coming.
[00:51:45.036 --> 00:51:47.997]  We're not, oh, you better listen or this is going to happen.
[00:51:47.997 --> 00:51:50.458]  We now know basically exactly what they're going to do.
[00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:53.019]  It's just the time frame is a little fluid.
[00:51:53.019 --> 00:51:54.660]  But the good news is we know.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:59.363]  So we can make preparation for it and be who we were designed by God to be.
[00:51:59.363 --> 00:52:00.463]  This is the big test.
[00:52:00.463 --> 00:52:01.924]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:52:02.622 --> 00:52:07.246]  The January 6th committee has been an exercise in armed political intimidation.
[00:52:07.246 --> 00:52:08.006]  How did it start?
[00:52:08.006 --> 00:52:09.447]  You may have forgotten.
[00:52:09.447 --> 00:52:12.830]  Congress formed the committee after several members of the U.S.
[00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:19.415]  Capitol Police, the same people responsible for protecting members of Congress, anonymously commanded them to do it.
[00:52:19.415 --> 00:52:21.016]  So effectively, it was a ransom note.
[00:52:21.016 --> 00:52:22.397]  Prosecute our political opponents.
[00:52:22.397 --> 00:52:24.059]  That's an order from your bodyguards.
[00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:24.919]  Amazingly, they did it.
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:32.365]  So from the very first day, the January 6th committee was never about gathering information.
[00:52:32.365 --> 00:52:35.548]  Obviously, Congress already has the information.
[00:52:35.548 --> 00:52:39.671]  Nancy Pelosi knows exactly how many federal agents were in the crowd that day.
[00:52:39.671 --> 00:52:41.112]  She won't tell us.
[00:52:41.112 --> 00:52:45.336]  Pelosi could release thousands of hours of videotape evidence from January 6th.
[00:52:45.336 --> 00:52:46.637]  She refuses to do that.
[00:52:47.177 --> 00:52:49.281]  So whatever else this is, don't let them lie to you.
[00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:52.165]  This is not a fact-finding effort.
[00:52:52.165 --> 00:52:55.991]  This is a highly obvious attempt to punish critics of the Democratic Party.
[00:52:55.991 --> 00:52:58.575]  And for months, that's exactly what the committee has been doing.
[00:52:59.406 --> 00:53:05.452]  Using the pretext of January 6th, Biden's Justice Department has indicted former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.
[00:53:05.452 --> 00:53:06.112]  What?
[00:53:06.112 --> 00:53:07.353]  What was his crime exactly?
[00:53:07.353 --> 00:53:09.956]  Oh, talking about election fraud on a radio show.
[00:53:09.956 --> 00:53:11.437]  That's illegal now.
[00:53:11.437 --> 00:53:14.780]  Pelosi's January 6th committee had him arrested.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:21.526]  Liz Cheney, by the way, who is being used as a Republican cover for all of this, stood back and watched it happen.
[00:53:21.526 --> 00:53:25.210]  Liz Cheney should be ashamed, but she's become far too degraded for shame, unfortunately.
[00:53:26.073 --> 00:53:29.734]  And Bannon, by the way, is not the only prominent Republican who might go to jail.
[00:53:29.734 --> 00:53:34.435]  The committee has now subpoenaed several former Trump advisors, as well as the fiancé of another.
[00:53:34.435 --> 00:53:37.795]  They've even subpoenaed Roger Stone yet again.
[00:53:37.795 --> 00:53:39.496]  Where was Stone on January 6th?
[00:53:39.496 --> 00:53:42.336]  He was in a hotel room as the Capitol was being breached.
[00:53:42.336 --> 00:53:44.897]  He had literally nothing to do with it.
[00:53:44.897 --> 00:53:45.937]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:53:45.937 --> 00:53:47.357]  He's criticized Joe Biden.
[00:53:47.357 --> 00:53:49.398]  He could be going to jail again.
[00:53:49.398 --> 00:53:54.619]  Now the committee's decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[00:53:54.619 --> 00:53:55.279]  Yes, journalist.
[00:53:55.959 --> 00:54:02.261]  Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance, but the truth is he has been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[00:54:02.261 --> 00:54:11.144]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News national security correspondent Ken Delanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS.
[00:54:11.144 --> 00:54:14.905]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:54:14.905 --> 00:54:19.946]  And if Jones sat down with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists are supposed to do.
[00:54:19.946 --> 00:54:21.507]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[00:54:22.478 --> 00:54:27.097]  But Alex Jones makes fun of Joe Biden, so the January 6th committee is threatening him with prison.
[00:54:28.007 --> 00:54:37.090]  Now, the irony here, and there are many layers of irony here, but the main one is that Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:42.791]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:46.092]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it.
[00:54:46.092 --> 00:54:50.514]  We happen to know this for a fact, because we looked into it in some detail for Patriot Purge.
[00:54:50.514 --> 00:54:53.675]  It's our three-part documentary series on Fox Nation.
[00:54:53.675 --> 00:54:54.415]  Here are the facts.
[00:54:59.944 --> 00:55:03.546]  So the Republican Party, I just want them to hear this message.
[00:55:03.546 --> 00:55:05.888]  Look at this crowd.
[00:55:05.888 --> 00:55:08.910]  We are the people that you must represent.
[00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:15.714]  January the 6th was all about, it was just about making sure that if you called yourself a conservative, that you stood with the conservative movement.
[00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:19.497]  And unfortunately, it spiraled out of control.
[00:55:21.016 --> 00:55:22.077]  We coordinated with the U.S.
[00:55:22.077 --> 00:55:23.077]  Capitol Police.
[00:55:23.077 --> 00:55:28.541]  Nearly every day, a lot of people don't know that Stop the Steal actually had a permit on the Capitol grounds.
[00:55:28.541 --> 00:55:32.023]  So not the Capitol itself, and not the Capitol Plaza.
[00:55:32.023 --> 00:55:34.365]  The Capitol grounds, Law 8, we had a permit.
[00:55:34.365 --> 00:55:37.887]  So let's just imagine this.
[00:55:37.887 --> 00:55:41.109]  20,000 to 50,000 people inside the President's Park.
[00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:42.470]  We're sitting there at the very front.
[00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:45.552]  I'm dead center of the President, front row.
[00:55:45.552 --> 00:55:50.295]  A Trump campaign staffer walks up to me and says, you know, Ali, there are people leaving the overflow.
[00:55:51.875 --> 00:55:54.236]  And there are already tens of thousands of people at the U.S.
[00:55:54.236 --> 00:55:55.657]  Capitol.
[00:55:55.657 --> 00:56:02.141]  With your presence and the presence of Alex Jones, why don't you guys walk down Pennsylvania, gather people together.
[00:56:02.141 --> 00:56:04.623]  We're coming for creatures!
[00:56:04.623 --> 00:56:07.664]  And then position them for your rally on Lot 8.
[00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:12.267]  I wasn't at the Capitol when it descended into chaos.
[00:56:12.267 --> 00:56:16.149]  And that's only by God's grace, because I was scheduled to be there.
[00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:20.192]  Secret Service let us out at a point where we would have been there when the first punch was thrown.
[00:56:22.884 --> 00:56:24.445]  And that's strange.
[00:56:24.445 --> 00:56:28.546]  The only reason that we weren't there is because we stopped and gave an impromptu speech.
[00:56:28.546 --> 00:56:41.171]  I get a text from the campaign that you should get there and de-escalate because things are not going well.
[00:56:45.305 --> 00:56:53.692]  So, we started to approach the side of the Capitol, where no protests had happened in November, no protests had happened in December.
[00:56:53.692 --> 00:56:57.475]  All I thought was, I need to get them to the other side, and I need to get them to Lot 8.
[00:56:57.475 --> 00:57:00.478]  Let's march around to the other side!
[00:57:00.478 --> 00:57:03.160]  And all we are equipped with are megaphones.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.563]  Let's call the police and get the system what they want!
[00:57:06.563 --> 00:57:09.105]  Maybe a thousand people are listening to us.
[00:57:10.265 --> 00:57:12.246]  Come off the stands!
[00:57:12.246 --> 00:57:14.827]  And 75,000 to 100,000 people there in front of us.
[00:57:14.827 --> 00:57:17.548]  And it was a very helpless feeling.
[00:57:17.548 --> 00:57:21.169]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a complication with the police.
[00:57:21.169 --> 00:57:23.170]  We're going to make that the story.
[00:57:27.608 --> 00:57:30.329]  So the trail of that documentary got a lot of attention.
[00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:32.931]  If you haven't seen the documentary itself, we think that you should.
[00:57:32.931 --> 00:57:34.091]  It's called Patriot Purge.
[00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:43.717]  We think it is the most comprehensive, the most honest, the most fact-based account of what actually happened on January 6th and what has happened on the basis of January 6th that has been made.
[00:57:43.717 --> 00:57:45.318]  We're really proud of it.
[00:57:45.318 --> 00:57:48.079]  You can start streaming Fox Nation, by the way, by going to TuckerCarlson.com.
[00:57:50.117 --> 00:57:51.438]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:57:51.438 --> 00:57:53.459]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[00:57:53.459 --> 00:57:53.880]  Welcome.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.600]  Hello, Alex?
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.140]  Yes, Malcolm.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.483]  Alright, I'm gonna make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[00:57:59.483 --> 00:58:04.066]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[00:58:04.066 --> 00:58:07.068]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:09.710]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.751]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[00:58:11.751 --> 00:58:16.635]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[00:58:16.635 --> 00:58:23.420]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.262]  This is like a very fine wine.
[00:58:25.262 --> 00:58:27.383]  In fact, each batch is different.
[00:58:27.383 --> 00:58:29.845]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[00:58:29.845 --> 00:58:33.108]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:34.048]  That's just how it is.
[00:58:34.048 --> 00:58:34.709]  It's how it works.
[00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:39.440]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.229]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[00:58:50.178 --> 00:59:04.686]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[00:59:05.466 --> 00:59:10.649]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[00:59:10.649 --> 00:59:19.554]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[00:59:19.554 --> 00:59:27.118]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[00:59:27.118 --> 00:59:27.899]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:59:28.891 --> 00:59:31.693]  We are crossing the Rubicon now.
[00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:34.955]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[00:59:34.955 --> 00:59:41.299]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:43.341]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:46.783]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:52.987]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[00:59:52.987 --> 00:59:56.930]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.286 --> 01:00:32.552]  A woman who experienced a wonderful, open, free society described as a paradise, not just by her, but by people that experienced it and outsiders that wrote about it at the time in Africa, who then witnessed it overnight be destroyed into an authoritarian, communist hellhole.
[01:00:32.552 --> 01:00:37.274]  She's going to be joining us, Melissa Tate, for 30 minutes, coming up at the start.
[01:00:38.345 --> 01:00:50.128]  of the next segment, but I wanted to air this extremely powerful report again that's at Bandot Video in the Gregory's section.
[01:00:50.128 --> 01:00:52.889]  Fauci's dead baby's graves from the past.
[01:00:52.889 --> 01:01:01.572]  Only has 183,000 views, folks, that he literally took children from their parents and murdered them.
[01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:02.272]  Murdered them.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.780]  This will bring them down.
[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.961]  The whole media is trying to prop up Fauci because he's the kingpin.
[01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:09.661]  Get the video and share it.
[01:01:09.661 --> 01:01:17.482]  Here it is.
[01:01:17.482 --> 01:01:19.743]  The reception of Robert Kennedy Jr.'
[01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:26.184]  's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, is clear evidence of a mass awakening.
[01:01:26.184 --> 01:01:31.765]  The people are waking up to see Fauci for what he is, an absolute psychopath.
[01:01:33.263 --> 01:01:47.666]  We've learned of how he directed experiments at the NIAID in which beagles had their vocal cords removed and their heads enclosed in cages where sand fleas ate them alive.
[01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:57.548]  And we've learned of how he fraudulently used PCR tests to illegitimately push a known deadly drug upon tens of thousands of people.
[01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:11.018]  And many are now learning that in 1992, under the direction of Anthony Fauci, the NIAID funded drug trials on HIV-positive children.
[01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:26.409]  Although many of the children were healthy and asymptomatic, they had merely tested positive via faulty PCR tests administered through New York's Child Welfare Department, who then handed them over to the deadly experiments.
[01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:38.561]  Most of the drugs being tested on the children were already known to cause deformities, organ failure, brain damage, and other lethal side effects.
[01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:44.627]  And yet, the children were required to continue with the drugs regardless of negative side effects.
[01:02:45.408 --> 01:02:57.744]  Those administering the drugs were explicitly told that all adverse side effects they witnessed in the children were being caused by the HIV infection and not the drugs.
[01:02:58.869 --> 01:03:13.221]  When parents refused to consent to these barbaric trials, Children's Services took their kids and placed them with foster families or children's homes where participation in the trial would be assured.
[01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:18.806]  When the children resisted the deadly drugs, they were brought to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
[01:03:19.526 --> 01:03:30.313]  Where plastic tubes were surgically inserted into their stomachs and the deadly drugs they were trying to escape were pumped directly into their bodies.
[01:03:30.313 --> 01:03:36.438]  Once the children died, their bodies were added to a mass grave in Hawthorne, New York.
[01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:39.580]  A large pit with astroturf thrown over it.
[01:03:40.581 --> 01:03:49.571]  To get around the Nuremberg Code and other laws, the state of New York created a special review board comprised of the hospital stakeholders.
[01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:58.001]  One may wonder, other than torturing and killing innocent children, what were they trying to accomplish?
[01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:02.942]  They already knew of the negative side effects that these drugs were having on adults.
[01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:10.223]  But the more we learn about Anthony Fauci, the more we realize that he is an absolute psychopath.
[01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:13.604]  And it doesn't matter why psychopaths do what they do.
[01:04:14.745 --> 01:04:20.747]  Fauci and his criminal cohorts belong in cages, at the very least.
[01:04:20.747 --> 01:04:37.652]  Anthony Fauci is just one old crook in a massive conspiracy that is aggressively pushing to inject everyone's children with the new deadly and debilitating mRNA experimental jabs, whether you like it or not.
[01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:42.274]  Going after Fauci is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a start.
[01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.808]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:05:10.765 --> 01:05:21.181]  Right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning, and it's only going to run until the end of the month, and that's now only six, seven days.

[01:06:07.648 --> 01:06:15.576]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.336 --> 01:06:20.779]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Melissa Tate joins us.
[01:06:20.779 --> 01:06:26.724]  She's a Christian conservative author, activist, political commentator, and social media influencer, born and raised in Africa and Zimbabwe.
[01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:34.271]  Melissa came to the United States at the age of 19 to attend college, where she earned a degree in business administration after working for a large bank for three years.
[01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.252]  We're good to go.
[01:06:51.144 --> 01:06:57.433]  The right Melissa on Twitter, and she has a lot of courage and is pro-free speech and has defended us when we've been under attack.
[01:06:57.433 --> 01:06:59.556]  We really appreciate her, and she's been on a few times before.
[01:06:59.556 --> 01:07:00.858]  She's only got two segments.
[01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:01.619]  We wish she had longer.
[01:07:01.619 --> 01:07:03.502]  We know she's a busy, hard-working lady.
[01:07:03.502 --> 01:07:06.386]  But I've heard you on other shows, because I'm a fan, I follow you.
[01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.962]  I've heard you talk about Zimbabwe and your experience, and I've read about that.
[01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:13.022]  I've seen some of the film.
[01:07:13.022 --> 01:07:15.663]  It was like Hawaii, as I was described.
[01:07:15.663 --> 01:07:20.984]  Paradise, super low crime, happy people, folks getting highly educated.
[01:07:20.984 --> 01:07:29.806]  I mean, a real example, a real oasis, and then destroyed basically overnight by Robert Mugabe, and you draw parallels to that to here, and what we saw in Venezuela.
[01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:34.028]  In the 60s, Venezuela had more money per capita than Americans.
[01:07:34.028 --> 01:07:35.089]  Now it's a hellhole.
[01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:39.673]  Same story over and over again, and it's what really concerns you because you love America so much.
[01:07:39.673 --> 01:07:41.855]  I'm putting words in your mouth, but I've heard you speak to this.
[01:07:41.855 --> 01:07:47.300]  Please recap that for folks that haven't heard your story because it's really informative.
[01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:51.111]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:51.111 --> 01:07:56.378]  I came to the United States when I was 19 years old and I came from Zimbabwe.
[01:07:56.378 --> 01:07:58.801]  Zimbabwe, growing up, was a great country.
[01:07:58.801 --> 01:08:03.527]  It was actually known as the breadbasket of Africa because we were exporting food to
[01:08:04.108 --> 01:08:14.036]  The entire southern African region depended on Zimbabwe for agricultural products and food and so forth.
[01:08:14.036 --> 01:08:22.823]  Zimbabwe was nicknamed the breadbasket of Africa and we used to supply flowers and all kinds of agricultural products even to Europe.
[01:08:22.823 --> 01:08:27.587]  We had flights leaving Zimbabwe every day to Europe just with flowers, for example.
[01:08:28.155 --> 01:08:32.179]  So Zimbabwe was just this beautiful country, cosmopolitan.
[01:08:32.179 --> 01:08:37.084]  I mean, when I went to school, I went to a private school and I went to a school with people from all over the world.
[01:08:37.084 --> 01:08:44.691]  I'm talking Sweden, Yugoslavia, Botswana, South Africa, people from all over the world, Australia.
[01:08:45.655 --> 01:08:51.818]  So, a lot of people migrated to Zimbabwe and lived there because it was such a great country to live in.
[01:08:51.818 --> 01:08:53.359]  It was very peaceful.
[01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:57.761]  I used to walk miles to school, even as a young child.
[01:08:57.761 --> 01:08:59.082]  Never had any issues.
[01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:05.845]  Very peaceful, very open-minded, very cosmopolitan, great weather.
[01:09:05.845 --> 01:09:09.307]  They say it has the best climate in the world, you know, till today.
[01:09:09.967 --> 01:09:16.470]  You know, we have 82 degree days pretty much every day, and our winters are like 75 degrees.
[01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.571]  So it was just great growing up there.
[01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:23.593]  I could never have asked to live anywhere else but in Zimbabwe.
[01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:35.338]  And describe what you witnessed in the time frame growing up of it going from, I've heard it described as Westerners that live there as like Hawaii, and just being this paradise, and then now just destroyed.
[01:09:37.031 --> 01:09:41.185]  Well, it's actually a lot like South Florida, is what I would describe it as.
[01:09:43.317 --> 01:09:49.520]  Actually, when I go to South Florida, it's so reminiscent of Harare, which is where I grew up, the capital city.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.883]  You know, the palm trees, the bungalows, beautiful streets, you know, lined with palm trees and so forth.
[01:09:55.883 --> 01:09:58.344]  So, you know, it was a great country.
[01:09:58.344 --> 01:10:03.726]  Yeah, beautiful pictures you're showing over there, jacaranda trees, purple trees.
[01:10:03.726 --> 01:10:06.067]  And it was just an amazing place to grow up.
[01:10:06.067 --> 01:10:07.948]  And then gradually, I mean, this
[01:10:08.948 --> 01:10:11.069]  It happened over a 20-year period.
[01:10:11.069 --> 01:10:20.071]  So when I look at what's going on right now in America, you know, you may not feel like this is something that is happening now, but it is something that is going to take some time.
[01:10:20.071 --> 01:10:26.012]  It may take 5 years, 10 years before you actually see a total collapse like we saw in Zimbabwe.
[01:10:26.012 --> 01:10:38.015]  Because it started gradually, probably in the early 90s, now looking back in retrospect, because I was young, but now looking back in retrospect, I started realizing how, you know, the IMF
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:49.703]  You know, had come in and they had this economic structural redevelopment plan that they instituted in Zimbabwe, where they basically were encouraging Zimbabwe to devalue their currency.
[01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:54.957]  You know in exchange for all this funding that they were going to give Zimbabwe.
[01:10:54.957 --> 01:11:11.712]  So already in the 90s I started to hear you know family older family members complaining about inflation and so forth but it wasn't so bad until it hit probably 2002 is when we started to see real hyperinflation.
[01:11:11.712 --> 01:11:14.495]  I mean I remember when I was first coming to Zimbabwe
[01:11:15.365 --> 01:11:21.408]  Because in the early, earlier on, like maybe in the early 90s, the Zimbabwean dollar was so strong.
[01:11:21.408 --> 01:11:23.529]  I mean, it was even stronger than the U.S.
[01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:28.532]  dollar because it was 1 is to 1 with the British pound, probably in the 80s.
[01:11:28.532 --> 01:11:35.235]  In the 90s, you know, people were complaining because it was like 1 is to 10, which, you know, that was a big jump.
[01:11:35.928 --> 01:11:40.331]  And then by the time I was coming to the United States, it was now one dollar was about 30.
[01:11:40.331 --> 01:11:41.812]  I mean, one U.S.
[01:11:41.812 --> 01:11:44.154]  dollar was now about 35 U.S.
[01:11:44.154 --> 01:11:48.116]  dollars, and people were totally freaking out because we were not used to that.
[01:11:48.116 --> 01:11:51.539]  You know, 35 dollars for every Zimbabwean, for every U.S.
[01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:51.859]  dollar.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:00.543]  And then now you fast forward from that point when I started leaving for Zimbabwe, it was really hard for my mother to even get U.S.
[01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:02.244]  dollars from the bank.
[01:12:02.244 --> 01:12:04.525]  So people had to go to the black market.
[01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:07.686]  So the bank rate would be $35 for one U.S.
[01:12:07.686 --> 01:12:08.026]  dollar.
[01:12:08.026 --> 01:12:12.088]  But then on the black market, it would be like $150, which is ridiculous.
[01:12:12.088 --> 01:12:15.589]  $150 of your own money to get one U.S.
[01:12:15.589 --> 01:12:15.869]  dollar.
[01:12:15.869 --> 01:12:17.490]  And that was a lot of money back then.
[01:12:18.522 --> 01:12:25.077]  And then you fast forward within like two years it went to like from one US dollar is $35 to like one US dollar is now $1,000.
[01:12:29.693 --> 01:12:47.026]  You know and then and so on and so on until it became like you're showing that hundred trillion dollar note to where one US dollar you needed to have something like 500 million Zimbabwean dollars and that's how quickly the currency just devalued.
[01:12:47.026 --> 01:12:50.328]  It was it was almost like it happened overnight.
[01:12:50.328 --> 01:12:59.055]  I mean I remember being in the store with my mom and we are putting groceries in the cart and by the time we get to the checkout
[01:13:01.195 --> 01:13:03.857]  The checkout lady tells us that the price has changed.
[01:13:03.857 --> 01:13:05.058]  It's gone up.
[01:13:05.058 --> 01:13:07.720]  And that's how quickly the prices were changing.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.922]  You're literally shopping in the supermarket.
[01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:16.887]  When you get to checkout, the price has to be readjusted because that's how quickly the inflation was.
[01:13:16.887 --> 01:13:24.493]  So I looked at the percentage before I came on and I see different percentages that were estimated of percentage of inflation.
[01:13:24.493 --> 01:13:26.914]  One of the ones that I saw was something like 750 million percent.
[01:13:32.065 --> 01:13:37.889]  So when you hear Biden and the private central bank, the Federal Reserve, and all of them saying inflation is actually good,
[01:14:01.283 --> 01:14:02.584]  But historically, it never is.
[01:14:02.584 --> 01:14:16.530]  And what happened in Weimar, Germany, where people would pay for their dinner at the beginning of dinner, because it might be 20, 30, 40 percent more in just a few hours, you experienced what Weimar, Germany, which we know what that brought in, you experienced that yourself.
[01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:26.074]  What is it like now to be a successful American, the American dream, exactly the type of immigrant we want, amazing person, to see now another country you love being destroyed?
[01:14:28.414 --> 01:14:35.497]  I realize this is what makes me speak up because I don't want to see what happened to Zimbabwe happen in the United States.
[01:14:35.497 --> 01:14:38.598]  And sadly, I'm starting to see the parallels.
[01:14:38.598 --> 01:14:46.982]  You know, just listening to Biden and the Democrats is literally like deja vu taking place because I hear them talking about printing all this money.
[01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:57.066]  And that's exactly what was happening leading up to the economic collapse that we had in Zimbabwe is the spending, reckless spending, printing of money,
[01:14:58.056 --> 01:14:59.525]  Out the wazoo.
[01:14:59.525 --> 01:15:00.572]  So it's just...
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:11.346]  It's just really hard to watch because I'm seeing so many parallels from what was happening leading up to what happened in Zimbabwe.
[01:15:11.346 --> 01:15:23.174]  And I just want to warn Americans, you know, because one of the things that I learned from that situation was that having tangible assets is what really is going to save you from this.
[01:15:23.174 --> 01:15:29.458]  Because the one thing that survived from my mom's life savings was the one little property that she had.
[01:15:29.878 --> 01:15:30.178]  Absolutely.
[01:15:30.178 --> 01:15:31.579]  Well, we're learning through your experience.
[01:15:31.579 --> 01:15:39.162]  Melissa Tate, one more segment with you, and we'll talk about what's currently happening in the world and your ideas to get us out of it straight ahead.
[01:15:39.162 --> 01:15:40.242]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.298 --> 01:16:00.599]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:02.641]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:03.061]  Welcome.
[01:16:03.061 --> 01:16:03.761]  Hello, Alex?
[01:16:03.761 --> 01:16:04.402]  Yes, Malcolm.
[01:16:04.402 --> 01:16:08.645]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[01:16:08.645 --> 01:16:13.229]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:16.231]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[01:16:16.231 --> 01:16:18.873]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[01:16:19.113 --> 01:16:20.915]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[01:16:20.915 --> 01:16:25.819]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[01:16:25.819 --> 01:16:32.605]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:34.447]  This is like a very fine wine.
[01:16:34.447 --> 01:16:36.568]  In fact, each batch is different.
[01:16:36.568 --> 01:16:39.011]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:42.293]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:43.214]  That's just how it is.
[01:16:43.214 --> 01:16:43.875]  It's how it works.
[01:16:44.877 --> 01:16:48.604]  So, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:52.413]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:15.212]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[01:17:15.212 --> 01:17:18.875]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:25.581]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:30.263]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[01:17:30.263 --> 01:17:33.004]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[01:17:33.004 --> 01:17:33.825]  It's high quality.
[01:17:33.825 --> 01:17:37.026]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[01:17:37.026 --> 01:17:44.410]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:48.332]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[01:17:48.692 --> 01:17:49.493]  I am a worldly person.
[01:17:49.493 --> 01:17:50.953]  Meaning, I like going to ball games.
[01:17:50.953 --> 01:17:51.814]  I like going to concerts.
[01:17:51.814 --> 01:17:53.295]  I like going to play golf.
[01:17:53.295 --> 01:17:54.355]  I like going out to dinner.
[01:17:54.355 --> 01:17:55.596]  I like the metropolitan life.
[01:17:55.596 --> 01:17:57.037]  I like everything that comes with this.
[01:17:57.037 --> 01:17:59.678]  But see, I have the survival instinct
[01:18:14.747 --> 01:18:17.870]  That is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities.
[01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.612]  Get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:24.136]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[01:18:24.136 --> 01:18:25.957]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[01:18:25.957 --> 01:18:28.059]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[01:18:28.059 --> 01:18:29.020]  Just get off-grid?
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.461]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:31.582]  Just live off the land?
[01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:32.964]  That's the survival instinct.
[01:18:32.964 --> 01:18:37.248]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[01:18:37.848 --> 01:18:38.749]  Stay in the city.
[01:18:38.749 --> 01:18:43.754]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever notioned that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[01:18:43.754 --> 01:18:50.241]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:55.006]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[01:18:55.006 --> 01:18:57.568]  And so we have the best ones at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:57.568 --> 01:18:59.030]  InfoWars!
[01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.851]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:01.308 --> 01:19:02.729]  Keep us on air.

[01:19:24.723 --> 01:19:27.185]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D Gummies,
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.982]  This is a great thing for your kids.
[01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:30.663]  They're going to love it.
[01:19:30.663 --> 01:19:32.384]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[01:19:32.384 --> 01:19:33.786]  It's healthy.
[01:19:33.786 --> 01:19:35.308]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[01:19:35.308 --> 01:19:36.869]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[01:19:36.869 --> 01:19:39.052]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[01:19:39.052 --> 01:19:39.973]  Calcium, good for them.
[01:19:39.973 --> 01:19:40.453]  The vitamin D.
[01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:44.766]  So, that's at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:19:57.257 --> 01:20:00.279]  We cannot thank you enough.
[01:20:00.279 --> 01:20:06.184]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:17.501 --> 01:20:19.062]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.062 --> 01:20:22.085]  Melissa Tate is riding shotgun with us until 45 after.
[01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:25.847]  Then I'm going to hit all the other world news and information that's breaking.
[01:20:25.847 --> 01:20:27.669]  There's a lot of it at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:29.212 --> 01:20:35.734]  I put the headline up this morning, the Fourth Reich is here, Germany announces new lockdowns, forced injections to start February 1st.
[01:20:35.734 --> 01:20:36.914]  That is so huge.
[01:20:36.914 --> 01:20:41.555]  Paul Watson put a new video out at Bandot Video just minutes ago titled, Germany has fallen.
[01:20:41.555 --> 01:20:43.136]  We're going to air that after Tate leaves us.
[01:20:43.136 --> 01:20:45.696]  But this is really big historic stuff.
[01:20:45.696 --> 01:20:51.058]  And people that go, oh well, it's just third world countries like Venezuela or Mexico or Zimbabwe that have this.
[01:20:51.058 --> 01:20:51.158]  No.
[01:20:51.658 --> 01:21:09.326]  The same central banks, the same globalist forces go in, they get leaders that'll do this, and then for the first few years, and you heard it took 20 for it really to get to where it ended, where it took a trillion bucks for a loaf of bread or whatever, they would buy up real things with the money they printed to take control.
[01:21:10.285 --> 01:21:15.727]  Then they leave you with all the inflation, the devaluation, and it destroys poor people in the middle class.
[01:21:15.727 --> 01:21:22.410]  So what she's saying isn't just a warning, it's the same globalist groups now doing it to us.
[01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:24.311]  They know they're destroying our countries.
[01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:25.672]  They know they're destroying our futures.
[01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.533]  This is the Great Reset.
[01:21:27.533 --> 01:21:37.237]  Melissa, your view on the Great Reset and what's currently happening in America and the culture wars and how they're all trying to make us fight with each other, isn't that just the British Empire divide and conquer strategy over and over again?
[01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:47.755]  Absolutely it is, and the thing is what's happening here is the exact same thing that happened in Zimbabwe, the divide and conquer narrative.
[01:21:47.755 --> 01:21:54.783]  Like I go into the race issue with what happened in Zimbabwe, there's a strong parallel to what's going on right now.
[01:21:54.783 --> 01:22:00.309]  You see the demonization of white people is the exact same thing that happened in Zimbabwe leading up to the collapse.
[01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:07.170]  And really, the collapse was triggered by that demonization of the white farmers in Zimbabwe.
[01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:09.551]  And those were the people that were producers.
[01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:13.012]  They were the producers of the agricultural industry.
[01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:24.714]  So when that completely fell apart, when they were scapegoated for all the problems that were happening in the country, because basically, I mean, you had corrupt government that was taking people's pension funds, taking people's money.
[01:22:25.615 --> 01:22:32.567]  And when people started to wake up to it and start living in poverty, they started to question it and started going after the government.
[01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:38.017]  And instead of taking ownership of their own failed policies, they just shifted the attention.
[01:22:38.817 --> 01:22:44.260]  Over to the white farmers and scapegoated them and said, well, your problem is not us.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.741]  Your problem is the white farmers.
[01:22:45.741 --> 01:22:46.801]  They took all your land.
[01:22:46.801 --> 01:22:47.542]  They took.
[01:22:47.542 --> 01:22:50.183]  So that's when that rhetoric started coming.
[01:22:50.183 --> 01:22:59.248]  And that rhetoric didn't exist, you know, prior to that, because when Mugabe came into power, he was very
[01:23:00.262 --> 01:23:02.203]  Welcoming to the white community.
[01:23:02.203 --> 01:23:17.374]  And so when I grew up in Zimbabwe, there was really no like racial contention or people were, you know, the attitude was, we're going to move forward from colonization and all these colonial years that we've been through, but we're going to look forward.
[01:23:17.374 --> 01:23:18.936]  We're going to look to the future.
[01:23:18.936 --> 01:23:23.039]  And that was the narrative, you know, for the longest time that I was growing up there.
[01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:24.740]  And then all of a sudden there's a shift.
[01:23:25.749 --> 01:23:26.970]  Oh, it's the white people.
[01:23:26.970 --> 01:23:27.750]  They're the problem.
[01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:30.351]  They're the reason why the country's falling apart.
[01:23:30.351 --> 01:23:38.756]  And then everybody turns the attention to the white farmers as the root of all the problems in Zimbabwe, and it simply wasn't true.
[01:23:38.756 --> 01:23:46.400]  And then, for those that don't know, there was an ethnic cleansing that took place, and the very same communist international forces have now done that in South Africa.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.303]  And they're now trying to run those same ideas in Europe and here.
[01:23:50.303 --> 01:23:52.726]  It's the most powerful banks and families.
[01:23:52.726 --> 01:23:55.628]  Again, they're going to loot everybody and then make it a racial issue.
[01:23:55.628 --> 01:23:57.871]  This is a tried and trusted game.
[01:23:57.871 --> 01:24:02.095]  Do you think they'll be able to replay this yet again and do it again?
[01:24:04.463 --> 01:24:07.707]  Well, I see it happening right now in the United States.
[01:24:07.707 --> 01:24:13.473]  They've basically instituted critical race theory in every sphere of American culture.
[01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:19.560]  When you're looking at every sphere of influence, you're talking education, media, entertainment, sports.
[01:24:21.161 --> 01:24:27.867]  You know, education, everything, every sphere of influence right now is now riddled with critical race theory.
[01:24:27.867 --> 01:24:33.352]  And it seems like that is the operating system that they're using to take down America.
[01:24:33.352 --> 01:24:39.097]  Because everything that you see happening is being filtered through this critical race theory narrative.
[01:24:39.097 --> 01:24:46.304]  That it's the white people that are bad, it's the reason why everything is, you know, falling apart, it's white people, it's white people, it's white people.
[01:24:46.906 --> 01:24:55.650]  And you see that it's a tactic that, you know, Marxists have always used, so they exploit whatever division they can exploit in any country.
[01:24:55.650 --> 01:24:57.571]  Exactly, and that's what I want to be clear about.
[01:24:57.571 --> 01:24:58.752]  The Marxists don't want...
[01:25:00.029 --> 01:25:00.289]  We're good
[01:25:19.292 --> 01:25:19.632]  That's right.
[01:25:44.662 --> 01:25:47.565]  And then they go on to chant, Death to America!
[01:25:47.565 --> 01:25:49.928]  I mean, my God, these people are the plague!
[01:25:49.928 --> 01:25:50.729]  They are cancer!
[01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:54.859]  It's pure communism, Alex.
[01:25:54.859 --> 01:25:55.719]  That's what it is.
[01:25:55.719 --> 01:26:01.541]  I mean, now I just started to connect all the dots when I started to see it happening here in the United States.
[01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:07.483]  Because when I came to the United States 18 years ago, the race issue was never even an issue at all.
[01:26:07.483 --> 01:26:13.305]  Like, you would never turn on the TV and start to hear about racism and all this stuff.
[01:26:13.305 --> 01:26:19.467]  This is something that started to creep in and probably in the second term of Obama is when I started to notice it.
[01:26:20.411 --> 01:26:25.792]  And towards, I mean, and then the left just took it into overdrive during Trump.
[01:26:25.792 --> 01:26:27.633]  And that's when I started to connect the dots.
[01:26:27.633 --> 01:26:34.414]  I'm like, OK, this is the exact same playbook that was played in Zimbabwe that is now being played over here.
[01:26:34.414 --> 01:26:36.675]  It's just the divide and conquer narrative.
[01:26:36.675 --> 01:26:41.496]  I mean, if you look at it in Russia, you know, they couldn't exploit race because everybody is the same color.
[01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:47.177]  But in any country where there is, you know, different races, they exploit the racial issue.
[01:26:47.677 --> 01:26:47.917]  Absolutely.
[01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:08.210]  Yeah, and what we need to do is to transcend that.
[01:27:08.210 --> 01:27:09.871]  And that's what I speak about.
[01:27:09.871 --> 01:27:15.672]  That's one of the things that I try to speak about and really zone in on is the race issue.
[01:27:15.672 --> 01:27:21.354]  Because I say that, you know, we need to come together as humanity and realize that we have a common enemy.
[01:27:21.354 --> 01:27:23.335]  No matter what color you are, whether you're black,
[01:27:23.935 --> 01:27:29.136]  Whether you're brown, whether you're white, whatever color you are, really we have a common enemy.
[01:27:29.136 --> 01:27:33.878]  And it is the people that are trying to destroy prosperity and freedom.
[01:27:33.878 --> 01:27:37.639]  People that are trying to destroy the renaissance that we live in right now.
[01:27:37.639 --> 01:27:44.280]  Because when you look at this as a historical context, you look and you see that before America, we lived under a feudal system.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:49.822]  Humanity has always lived under a feudal system where you had a tiny group of elites that controlled everything.
[01:27:50.382 --> 01:27:56.751]  And then the masses would just pour and lived at the behest and at the service of the tiny rich elite.
[01:27:57.603 --> 01:28:03.946]  And then now we live in an enlightened period, but we've always lived in it, so we just take it for granted.
[01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:20.974]  And the thing is, the education system has been so dumbed down to where people don't have this historical context, that we're literally living through the best time in history for humanity, where we have liberty and freedom, and have the power to make something of ourselves, where we have a power
[01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:27.466]  To go from a poor class to make and become successful, something that I did.
[01:28:27.466 --> 01:28:34.169]  I came to the United States at 19 with literally $300 in my pocket and a suitcase full of clothes.
[01:28:34.169 --> 01:28:38.671]  Within less than a decade, I had a business that was doing seven figures in revenue.
[01:28:38.671 --> 01:28:41.492]  I had multiple employees.
[01:28:41.492 --> 01:28:43.733]  I graduated with a business degree.
[01:28:43.733 --> 01:28:45.394]  You know, I had a good life.
[01:28:46.357 --> 01:28:49.841]  And that is something that is very unique to the United States.
[01:28:49.841 --> 01:28:50.362]  Absolutely.
[01:28:50.362 --> 01:28:52.384]  It's a place where you can shine and shine.
[01:28:52.384 --> 01:28:52.884]  You do.
[01:28:52.884 --> 01:28:54.566]  One more segment with Melissa Tade.

[01:29:58.301 --> 01:29:59.602]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:01.645]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[01:30:01.645 --> 01:30:01.945]  Welcome.
[01:30:02.045 --> 01:30:02.766]  Hello, Alex?
[01:30:02.766 --> 01:30:03.467]  Yes, Malcolm.
[01:30:03.467 --> 01:30:07.633]  Alright, I'm gonna make this quick and real short, where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[01:30:07.633 --> 01:30:12.219]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[01:30:12.219 --> 01:30:15.243]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.867]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[01:30:18.107 --> 01:30:19.908]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[01:30:19.908 --> 01:30:24.811]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:31.576]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[01:30:31.576 --> 01:30:33.857]  This is like a very fine wine.
[01:30:33.857 --> 01:30:35.558]  In fact, each batch is different.
[01:30:35.558 --> 01:30:37.960]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.282]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[01:30:41.282 --> 01:30:42.202]  That's just how it is.
[01:30:42.202 --> 01:30:42.863]  It's how it works.
[01:30:43.584 --> 01:30:47.593]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[01:30:47.593 --> 01:30:51.402]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[01:30:59.636 --> 01:31:03.917]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:12.259]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:15.799]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[01:31:15.799 --> 01:31:24.361]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:31:25.181 --> 01:31:32.229]  I also need you to wear a mask, and I also need you to only shop at Mega Corporation.
[01:31:33.064 --> 01:31:43.508]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:31:43.508 --> 01:31:46.269]  You will then be my slaves.
[01:31:46.269 --> 01:31:50.911]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[01:31:50.911 --> 01:31:56.993]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.

[01:33:17.116 --> 01:33:27.064]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.064 --> 01:33:34.130]  Well, I know a leader when I see one, and man, is she smart, is she on target, is she wonderful.
[01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:37.973]  Melissa Tate, RealMelissaTate.com, and on Twitter, The Real.
[01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:41.744]  The Right Melissa at The Right Melissa.
[01:33:41.744 --> 01:33:45.846]  And of course, her book is somewhere around the office, but I've got a printout here.
[01:33:45.846 --> 01:33:47.046]  Choice.
[01:33:47.046 --> 01:33:49.787]  White's checked out there, and it says privilege.
[01:33:49.787 --> 01:33:52.008]  Choice, privilege.
[01:33:52.008 --> 01:33:55.790]  So tell us about your book.
[01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:59.571]  Tell us about your worldview on where all this is going.
[01:33:59.571 --> 01:34:04.093]  And then you were making those great points about transcending the divide and conquer strategy.
[01:34:04.093 --> 01:34:06.074]  But first, tell folks about your book and where people get it.
[01:34:07.972 --> 01:34:10.113]  Okay, so my book is Choice Privilege.
[01:34:10.113 --> 01:34:15.095]  It's a play on the words white privilege, but I cross where it says white and I put in choice.
[01:34:15.095 --> 01:34:23.638]  So I basically make the argument that it is the choices that you make in life that really determine your destiny and the quality of your life and not the color of your skin.
[01:34:23.638 --> 01:34:25.539]  And that's what I was taught as a child.
[01:34:25.539 --> 01:34:29.601]  And basically my mom told me that if you make good choices, you're going to have a good life.
[01:34:29.601 --> 01:34:32.342]  If you make bad choices, you're going to have a bad life.
[01:34:32.342 --> 01:34:34.623]  And that's the philosophy that I've always lived by.
[01:34:35.963 --> 01:34:41.067]  So this idea that, you know, in America, if you're white, that that's what gives you privilege.
[01:34:41.067 --> 01:34:41.828]  No, it doesn't.
[01:34:41.828 --> 01:34:49.374]  My husband is white and he grew up poorer than I did, you know, as a black person in growing up in Zimbabwe.
[01:34:49.374 --> 01:34:51.735]  So that idea is completely false.
[01:34:51.735 --> 01:34:54.878]  But, you know, the book, I actually it's actually very well cited.
[01:34:54.878 --> 01:34:56.699]  So it's not just it.
[01:34:56.699 --> 01:35:05.226]  I talk a little bit about myself and my history in Zimbabwe, but I actually dig deep into critical race theory and debunk it.
[01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:20.839]  You know, so using data and facts and well cited information as far as, you know, the narrative that is out there that, you know, police are out there gunning down black people and all this stuff that the left puts out there really to create racial division.
[01:35:20.839 --> 01:35:22.280]  So the book is very well cited.
[01:35:23.163 --> 01:35:32.689]  It's a great book to give to your family members who, you know, might buy into this Black Lives Matter ideals, you know, Black Lives Matter stuff.
[01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:38.413]  You know, I've had people give it to nieces and nephews and they read it, you know, and some people are like, well, I don't want to read it.
[01:35:38.413 --> 01:35:42.656]  I'm like, well, you tell your niece that she's racist if she's not going to read a black woman's book.
[01:35:44.466 --> 01:35:46.407]  So it's a good way to wake people up.
[01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:52.209]  So I always tell people, you know, grab a few copies, hand it to people, because it will wake them up.
[01:35:52.209 --> 01:36:00.493]  Because I talk about the parallels with what happened in Zimbabwe, because it's the same playbook that they're playing, that they play in every country.
[01:36:00.493 --> 01:36:03.514]  It's really just race, divide and conquer.
[01:36:03.514 --> 01:36:05.555]  And that's what's frustrating is
[01:36:06.874 --> 01:36:12.599]  White people that are leftists use it because it gives them power and control, and it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the documents, we know they do it.
[01:36:12.599 --> 01:36:19.644]  And it's mainly weirdo white academics, but some Asian, some Hispanic, some black, but mainly white people using race for control.
[01:36:19.644 --> 01:36:25.529]  Well, no matter how you do it, it truly is racist, it truly is off of just what color somebody is, and it's a fraud.
[01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:28.692]  And the opposite of what Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:36:28.692 --> 01:36:33.937]  talked about, that we all embrace is common sense and makes sense at a spiritual and cellular level.
[01:36:33.937 --> 01:36:35.939]  You don't judge somebody off of what they look like.
[01:36:35.939 --> 01:36:38.362]  You judge off what they produce, what they do.
[01:36:38.362 --> 01:36:39.463]  I mean, I go to a restaurant.
[01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:41.365]  I don't care what color the people are cooking in.
[01:36:41.365 --> 01:36:44.008]  If the food's good, I'm not asking what color is the cook.
[01:36:44.008 --> 01:36:46.310]  Or if I'm listening to music, I'm not saying, well, I'm not listening to Jimi Hendrix.
[01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.771]  He's black.
[01:36:47.071 --> 01:36:49.134]  I love Jimi Hendrix.
[01:36:49.134 --> 01:36:49.735]  Or Beethoven.
[01:36:49.735 --> 01:36:50.596]  He's German.
[01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:52.919]  I'm like, what color is this guy?
[01:36:52.919 --> 01:36:55.041]  Everybody instinctively gets that.
[01:36:55.041 --> 01:36:59.747]  And the left is openly promoting the opposite, saying everything is about what color you are.
[01:36:59.747 --> 01:37:03.172]  And now they're dividing us on vaxed, unvaxed.
[01:37:03.172 --> 01:37:04.874]  And so that's the next big divide and conquer.
[01:37:06.548 --> 01:37:13.555]  Absolutely, and it's not only racist, but it's also very patronizing.
[01:37:13.555 --> 01:37:23.566]  It's very condescending to a lot of black people like myself, this idea that because I'm black, I'm oppressed.
[01:37:23.566 --> 01:37:25.548]  I don't buy into that.
[01:37:25.548 --> 01:37:26.128]  I reject that.
[01:37:26.128 --> 01:37:27.590]  You don't look too oppressed to me.
[01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:29.432]  You look like you're thriving and kicking ass.
[01:37:30.967 --> 01:37:32.048]  Exactly.
[01:37:32.048 --> 01:37:45.755]  So it's like, you know, the left, and this whole thing is really driven by a lot of white liberals who, you know, they look at black people as a pet project, as, you know, they look at black people as pets that they need to save and all, and there's this whole white savior
[01:37:47.135 --> 01:37:51.957]  I'm not a white saver.
[01:37:51.957 --> 01:37:52.957]  I want you to save me.
[01:37:52.957 --> 01:37:56.519]  I think you... I can see a leader when I see one.
[01:37:56.519 --> 01:37:59.780]  I'm counting on you to go out there and wake these people up before we have a race war.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.781]  So will you save me, please?
[01:38:01.781 --> 01:38:04.802]  Seriously.
[01:38:04.802 --> 01:38:05.902]  I will.
[01:38:05.902 --> 01:38:06.182]  Good.
[01:38:06.182 --> 01:38:06.682]  I know you will.
[01:38:06.682 --> 01:38:08.363]  That's what I'm saying is, exactly.
[01:38:08.363 --> 01:38:09.523]  We're all victims.
[01:38:09.523 --> 01:38:09.843]  No, no.
[01:38:09.843 --> 01:38:10.604]  We have power.
[01:38:10.604 --> 01:38:11.484]  You have power.
[01:38:11.484 --> 01:38:12.944]  We have even more power together.
[01:38:12.944 --> 01:38:14.225]  How about we save each other together?
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.721]  Absolutely.
[01:38:16.721 --> 01:38:17.582]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:38:34.551 --> 01:38:41.393]  Judge, if they keep testing for different strains of coronavirus, we're going to be locked down for the rest of our existence.
[01:38:41.393 --> 01:38:43.334]  I am, you know, I had cancer.
[01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:46.795]  My oncologist is a specialist in bone cancer.
[01:38:46.795 --> 01:38:54.157]  And he, you know, every oncologist who deals with bone cancer identifies hundreds of coronaviruses inside of our bones.
[01:38:54.157 --> 01:38:58.318]  They've created a problem that can never actually be solved.
[01:38:58.318 --> 01:39:01.939]  So they can justify whatever it is they want to do.
[01:39:02.239 --> 01:39:05.261]  And if you look around you, everything is falling apart.
[01:39:05.261 --> 01:39:08.262]  Even the vote audits are going ahead.
[01:39:08.262 --> 01:39:09.783]  Durham is moving ahead.
[01:39:09.783 --> 01:39:14.505]  Over time, people can see that the vaccines have nothing to do with Trump or left or right.
[01:39:14.505 --> 01:39:16.826]  Many black people don't want to get vaccinated.
[01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:24.890]  You cannot justify losing 3,000 to 5,000 border patrol agents, 12,000 pilots, you know, for something that has the death rate of flu.
[01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:31.314]  And even if this is lethal, Americans have the right under the Constitution to their civil liberties.
[01:39:31.974 --> 01:39:36.458]  Let me be suspended temporarily for it to be lawful.
[01:39:36.458 --> 01:39:38.459]  This is not lawful.
[01:39:38.459 --> 01:39:40.201]  And she goes on to call him Joseph Mingala.
[01:39:40.201 --> 01:39:41.362]  I got attacked for that.
[01:39:41.362 --> 01:39:44.664]  Trying to make people take experimental garbage, violates the Nuremberg Code.
[01:39:44.664 --> 01:39:46.586]  It's the definition of Joseph Mingala.
[01:39:48.197 --> 01:39:50.179]  My goodness, she's absolutely right.
[01:39:50.179 --> 01:39:54.464]  And I actually met her in San Antonio that same day I ran into you.
[01:39:54.464 --> 01:39:55.946]  She's a great lady.
[01:39:55.946 --> 01:39:57.648]  Oh wow, she was there and I missed her.
[01:39:57.648 --> 01:39:59.730]  This is pure torture.
[01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:00.811]  It was great to meet you in person.
[01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:02.313]  She was there, yeah.
[01:40:02.313 --> 01:40:03.194]  Wow.
[01:40:03.194 --> 01:40:04.596]  So she's really awake now, huh?
[01:40:04.596 --> 01:40:05.497]  Yeah, she spoke.
[01:40:05.937 --> 01:40:09.060]  She got up there and spoke and she had a very powerful speech.
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.861]  You should go back and watch it.
[01:40:10.861 --> 01:40:12.402]  I mean, she's absolutely right.
[01:40:12.402 --> 01:40:16.365]  I mean, what we're seeing is absolutely devastating.
[01:40:16.365 --> 01:40:18.687]  I cannot believe what's happening.
[01:40:18.687 --> 01:40:24.431]  I mean, I used to watch you, Alex, and I used to think, you know, I used to watch you and I used to enjoy all your content.
[01:40:24.431 --> 01:40:26.453]  But at some point I was like, you know what?
[01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:28.154]  Maybe he's going a little bit too far.
[01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:33.078]  And now I think you didn't go far enough because witnessing is
[01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.806]  Unbelievable, unbelievable what we're seeing.
[01:40:37.806 --> 01:40:46.739]  When you see them forcing a vaccine that we now know is killing a lot of people, causing all these health issues,
[01:40:47.506 --> 01:40:50.548]  And then they just gloss over it like it's not even happening.
[01:40:50.548 --> 01:40:53.110]  It's like we're living in Twilight Zone.
[01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:56.793]  It's absolutely amazing to see what is happening.
[01:40:56.793 --> 01:40:57.994]  Choice, privilege.
[01:40:57.994 --> 01:40:59.135]  It's totally true.
[01:40:59.135 --> 01:41:01.957]  The choices you make is your privilege.
[01:41:01.957 --> 01:41:03.558]  It's who you associate with.
[01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:04.318]  It's who you're around.
[01:41:04.318 --> 01:41:08.942]  And my experience in life is, unless you're talking about globalists who are really evil and a very small percentage of people,
[01:41:09.642 --> 01:41:14.146]  Is folks want to be around winners and happy people and folks that want to work hard and play hard.
[01:41:14.146 --> 01:41:24.755]  They don't give a damn what color you are and people are just looking for other nice people and they want us all to only judge each other off our race so that we get in fights with each other so they can control us.
[01:41:24.755 --> 01:41:29.839]  It's totally transparent and I see them pushing all this division as a sign of their weakness.
[01:41:29.839 --> 01:41:33.922]  I think when we beat this we're going to see an amazing coming together of humanity.
[01:41:33.922 --> 01:41:34.783]  What do you think in closing?
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.221]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:37.221 --> 01:41:45.226]  I believe that what we're seeing right now is just a cornered animal because I feel like there is a great awakening that's happening.
[01:41:45.226 --> 01:41:57.615]  And I actually look back and say what happened with the stolen election was actually providential because I feel like it's actually what has awakened people and caused people to start being involved on a local level.
[01:41:57.615 --> 01:42:05.181]  And actually people starting to not just watch content online and, you know, wring their hands about what's going on, but actually start getting involved.
[01:42:05.641 --> 01:42:06.862]  And that's what we need to do.
[01:42:06.862 --> 01:42:12.708]  So in closing, I'd like to say that everybody needs to figure out what they need to be doing in this fight.
[01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:15.571]  You know, this is no longer a spectator sport.
[01:42:15.571 --> 01:42:20.596]  We can't just watch and listen and see what's happening and do nothing about it.
[01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:27.661]  And it's encouraging to see that a lot of people are now starting to stand up because you see a lot of mothers going to school boards.
[01:42:27.661 --> 01:42:29.883]  You see people are running on a local level.
[01:42:29.883 --> 01:42:36.628]  Right now, the left is panicking because, you know, the precinct level positions are being filled by MAGA people.
[01:42:36.628 --> 01:42:37.989]  So we need more of that.
[01:42:37.989 --> 01:42:42.652]  And that's how we're going to solve this issue is we can't just wait for politicians.
[01:42:42.652 --> 01:42:44.834]  We have to start being involved in education.
[01:42:45.678 --> 01:42:53.701]  In media and entertainment and all these spheres of influence that we have allowed the left to completely take over because this is... Melissa Tate, I totally agree.
[01:42:53.701 --> 01:42:54.722]  Amazing job.
[01:42:54.722 --> 01:42:56.062]  The book, Choice Privilege.
[01:42:56.062 --> 01:42:57.263]  God bless you.
[01:42:57.263 --> 01:43:03.805]  For a fraction... The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[01:43:03.805 --> 01:43:13.189]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[01:43:13.829 --> 01:43:23.793]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[01:43:23.793 --> 01:43:30.555]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[01:43:30.555 --> 01:43:31.976]  But there is only two things to do.
[01:43:33.116 --> 01:43:36.257]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[01:43:36.257 --> 01:43:39.558]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[01:43:39.558 --> 01:43:44.959]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[01:43:44.959 --> 01:43:46.779]  And so, we must prepare.
[01:43:46.779 --> 01:43:57.182]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:43:57.862 --> 01:44:01.525]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:44:01.525 --> 01:44:03.307]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:03.307 --> 01:44:14.757]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:44:15.538 --> 01:44:24.869]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:24.869 --> 01:44:35.561]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:36.081 --> 01:44:38.722]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:44:38.722 --> 01:44:40.482]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:40.482 --> 01:44:50.184]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:50.184 --> 01:44:52.865]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[01:44:52.865 --> 01:44:57.746]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:44:59.258 --> 01:45:06.381]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet.
[01:45:06.381 --> 01:45:09.002]  I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has.
[01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:22.908]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[01:45:22.908 --> 01:45:24.649]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[01:45:26.574 --> 01:45:35.080]  And I see the general public in a medically-induced, scientifically-induced, behavioral, psychologically-controlled trance.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:39.702]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder, and it's so incredibly sad.
[01:45:39.702 --> 01:45:49.409]  But this is the process of birth, and then growth, and then falling apart, and then degenerating, and collapsing, and then coming back to life again.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:46:00.199]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[01:46:00.199 --> 01:46:01.141]  This is a great sponsor.
[01:46:01.852 --> 01:46:07.335]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[01:46:07.335 --> 01:46:12.078]  You can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[01:46:12.078 --> 01:46:16.301]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for in your car or in your house that also are on the site.
[01:46:16.301 --> 01:46:18.182]  Infowarsphone.com.
[01:46:18.182 --> 01:46:19.683]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[01:46:19.683 --> 01:46:22.585]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems as well.
[01:46:22.585 --> 01:46:29.909]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone of $650 value, absolutely free, at Infowarsphone.com.
[01:46:30.729 --> 01:46:32.930]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:33.390]  These aren't.
[01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:35.371]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[01:46:35.371 --> 01:46:39.732]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes.
[01:46:39.732 --> 01:46:40.132]  150 minutes.
[01:46:40.132 --> 01:46:41.352]  So, the calls you were free.
[01:46:41.352 --> 01:46:42.493]  It works like a regular cell phone.
[01:46:42.493 --> 01:46:43.793]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[01:46:43.793 --> 01:46:45.073]  And I keep one in my car.
[01:46:45.073 --> 01:46:46.774]  I've given them to my parents as gifts.
[01:46:46.774 --> 01:46:49.315]  Way out in the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[01:46:49.315 --> 01:46:50.135]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1020.
[01:46:50.135 --> 01:46:51.415]  941-955-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[01:47:00.586 --> 01:47:05.190]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:06.492]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:37.581 --> 01:47:38.581]  Let me tell you something.
[01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:44.122]  They've done studies that, quote, conservatives and Christians are better looking than communists and devil worshippers.
[01:47:44.122 --> 01:47:47.303]  I've got a great example of that here for you just in a moment.
[01:47:47.303 --> 01:47:54.925]  We're going to play a Paul Joseph Watson report, and in this clip, commie teacher brags she's indoctrinating students to turn leftist.
[01:47:54.925 --> 01:47:56.825]  And it's not even the shapes of their bodies.
[01:47:56.825 --> 01:48:02.206]  The ugliness shines out of communists and devil worshippers.
[01:48:02.206 --> 01:48:05.467]  You know, I didn't know that Laura Logan was at that event that I was at with
[01:48:07.113 --> 01:48:07.653]  General Flynn.
[01:48:22.657 --> 01:48:27.021]  Women that are awake and that care, I mean, they're just like ten times more beautiful.
[01:48:27.021 --> 01:48:28.782]  It's just shining.
[01:48:28.782 --> 01:48:32.245]  Laura Logan and Melissa Tate that we just had on.
[01:48:32.245 --> 01:48:33.966]  And that's not me coming on to these women.
[01:48:33.966 --> 01:48:37.429]  It's like looking at a beautiful sunset or something.
[01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:40.211]  It's like, wow, it's radiating.
[01:48:40.211 --> 01:48:42.333]  And then you just see the people promoting evil.
[01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:43.914]  They look like demons.
[01:48:43.914 --> 01:48:49.359]  Even if they physically have a nice look, it's just there's something about them.
[01:48:49.359 --> 01:48:49.539]  Now,
[01:48:50.959 --> 01:49:01.466]  It makes me feel good, you know, to talk to somebody like Melissa Tate, who's so loving and smart, and it gives me hope.
[01:49:01.466 --> 01:49:07.951]  Because there's something so good about loving, smart women like my daughters.
[01:49:07.951 --> 01:49:08.792]  They're the whole future.
[01:49:08.792 --> 01:49:09.752]  They just give you hope.
[01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:10.353]  They're the goddess.
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.281]  And it's what the system is attacking.
[01:49:13.281 --> 01:49:14.961]  It claims all day it cares about women.
[01:49:14.961 --> 01:49:16.281]  It can't stand them.
[01:49:16.281 --> 01:49:18.962]  The big biomedical labs want to take over women.
[01:49:18.962 --> 01:49:21.303]  They want humans grown in tanks.
[01:49:21.303 --> 01:49:22.883]  They hate women.
[01:49:22.883 --> 01:49:26.644]  Their whole system is against women.
[01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:28.025]  Somebody else claimed he was for women.
[01:49:28.025 --> 01:49:29.185]  His name was Hitler.
[01:49:29.185 --> 01:49:33.767]  He absolutely hated women as well.
[01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:38.468]  And when you talk about Germany, my mom's dad
[01:49:39.738 --> 01:49:41.239]  Was super smart.
[01:49:41.239 --> 01:49:45.901]  My grandfather and he was German, German immigrant families in Texas.
[01:49:45.901 --> 01:49:49.562]  But that's how the family was very German.
[01:49:49.562 --> 01:49:52.183]  And growing up in Dallas.
[01:49:52.183 --> 01:50:01.367]  And he was that family was wealthy and was in with the rich German community there in Hyde Park and other areas up in Dallas.
[01:50:04.694 --> 01:50:07.096]  And he just told me everything when I was a little kid.
[01:50:07.096 --> 01:50:16.702]  I didn't roll my eyes, but he told me there'll be a European Union, and Germany will take over the European Union, and then out of the European Union, they're going to take over.
[01:50:16.702 --> 01:50:22.406]  And it wasn't the Germans that are going to do it, it's that empire, those elite families, the same ones.
[01:50:22.406 --> 01:50:25.428]  The House of Windsor is that German family.
[01:50:25.428 --> 01:50:30.411]  So when you think of the UK and the British Empire, and then you think of Germany, it's the same thing.
[01:50:31.889 --> 01:50:36.411]  That was just cousins fighting with each other in World War I and World War II.
[01:50:36.411 --> 01:50:45.414]  The Russian Tsars were first cousins with the German Sachs-Coburg Goths and the King of England.
[01:50:45.414 --> 01:50:49.636]  Type in the last Tsar with the British King.
[01:50:49.636 --> 01:50:54.057]  There's photos of them in 1910, 1915, and you can't tell the two men apart.
[01:50:54.057 --> 01:50:58.019]  They were like a breed of dog, so inbred that they look identical.
[01:50:58.019 --> 01:51:00.900]  They couldn't be told apart if they weren't wearing different uniforms.
[01:51:02.039 --> 01:51:02.979]  The King of England and the Tsar.
[01:51:02.979 --> 01:51:06.920]  There have been photos of the last Tsar with the King of England.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.540]  You'll see the photos.
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:15.061]  And the reason I raise that is, when you see the European Union, that's a Nazi project.
[01:51:15.061 --> 01:51:17.122]  I mean, that's who created that.
[01:51:17.122 --> 01:51:21.683]  And when you see what they're doing, it's not, oh, Nazis want to kill the Jews.
[01:51:21.683 --> 01:51:26.524]  Yeah, there's a great example.
[01:51:26.524 --> 01:51:28.264]  That's just a little side issue.
[01:51:29.721 --> 01:51:30.701]  For them.
[01:51:30.701 --> 01:51:33.363]  They want control over everything.
[01:51:33.363 --> 01:51:36.784]  And they don't think white people deserve to live either.
[01:51:36.784 --> 01:51:39.126]  They are super out-of-control elitists.
[01:51:39.126 --> 01:51:41.607]  Look at how they're always trying to kill their other cousins.
[01:51:41.607 --> 01:51:43.128]  Their cousins ran Russia.
[01:51:43.128 --> 01:51:45.749]  Their cousins ran Europe.
[01:51:45.749 --> 01:51:54.173]  And then what of the big group that had gotten control of England in the 1700s?
[01:51:54.173 --> 01:51:55.374]  We were fighting King George III.
[01:51:57.153 --> 01:52:01.014]  In 1776, he was the third German king of England.
[01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:03.215]  He was not British.
[01:52:03.215 --> 01:52:04.615]  But that part doesn't matter.
[01:52:04.615 --> 01:52:07.356]  What I'm getting at is, this is the group.
[01:52:07.356 --> 01:52:08.917]  You want to know who runs the New World Order?
[01:52:08.917 --> 01:52:10.337]  Put them back on screen.
[01:52:10.337 --> 01:52:12.538]  King of England with the Tsar.
[01:52:12.538 --> 01:52:13.858]  That's who runs things.
[01:52:13.858 --> 01:52:15.359]  You want to know who's in charge?
[01:52:15.359 --> 01:52:16.299]  Those guys.
[01:52:16.299 --> 01:52:17.099]  Right there.
[01:52:17.099 --> 01:52:19.980]  They run it all.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:26.162]  And when you look at Prince Charles saying he wants to kill everybody in world government, that's where he comes from, folks.
[01:52:27.594 --> 01:52:30.136]  And they cannot help it.
[01:52:30.136 --> 01:52:32.678]  They want power over everybody.
[01:52:32.678 --> 01:52:34.459]  And they do not like big crowds of people.
[01:52:34.459 --> 01:52:38.101]  They want to kill.
[01:52:38.101 --> 01:52:40.143]  And I guess their instincts have got them where they are.
[01:52:40.143 --> 01:52:42.785]  I mean, they're in charge of the planet.
[01:52:42.785 --> 01:52:44.886]  But notice, they killed their own people.
[01:52:44.886 --> 01:52:48.149]  Think about, once the globalists get full control, they're just going to keep killing each other forever.
[01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.909]  They're never going to stop.
[01:52:48.909 --> 01:52:50.810]  They admit that in their own literature.
[01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:54.713]  They say there will only be one of them left at the end.
[01:52:54.713 --> 01:52:56.915]  Why would you let people like this run things?
[01:52:59.215 --> 01:53:05.399]  So Paul Watson did a video, it's on Infowars.com and Band.video, it's Germany has fallen.
[01:53:05.399 --> 01:53:07.180]  You're living in historic times.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.901]  This is a globalist takeover.
[01:53:08.901 --> 01:53:12.143]  This is real.
[01:53:12.143 --> 01:53:21.889]  And everything you're seeing with the UN and the EU and the New World Order and all of this is their takeover of the planet to depopulate you.
[01:53:21.889 --> 01:53:23.770]  Hitler was just a research project.
[01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:25.031]  He was the beta test.
[01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:26.031]  This is the big one.
[01:53:26.031 --> 01:53:26.452]  Here it is.
[01:53:27.213 --> 01:53:30.396]  Germany has today become the next domino to fall.
[01:53:30.396 --> 01:53:36.781]  The unvaccinated will be banned from shops and every other area of society besides essential services.
[01:53:36.781 --> 01:53:41.845]  That means that the government is graciously still allowing them to buy food.
[01:53:41.845 --> 01:53:42.686]  At least for now.
[01:53:43.226 --> 01:53:44.327]  And that's basically it.
[01:53:44.327 --> 01:53:48.292]  So long as they properly segregate themselves from other vaxxed shoppers.
[01:53:48.292 --> 01:53:50.715]  Yeah, that's an actual supermarket in Germany.
[01:53:50.715 --> 01:53:57.623]  But they are banned from bars, restaurants, cinemas, all lifestyle, all culture, basically everything else.
[01:53:57.623 --> 01:53:58.003]  They've even
[01:53:58.063 --> 01:54:04.706]  I'm told the unjabbed are only allowed a maximum of two people inside their own homes over Christmas.
[01:54:04.706 --> 01:54:06.227]  No jab, no life.
[01:54:06.227 --> 01:54:11.989]  And pretty soon, no jab, no job, as authorities announced they'd make the vaccine mandatory by February.
[01:54:11.989 --> 01:54:15.751]  And for those who still refuse, well, it'll probably be the same as in Austria.
[01:54:15.751 --> 01:54:19.513]  But don't worry, they're not going to forcibly drag you off to a vaccination centre.
[01:54:19.633 --> 01:54:24.697]  They're just going to forcibly drag you off to a detention centre until you get vaccinated.
[01:54:24.697 --> 01:54:26.779]  See, they're nice, reasonable people.
[01:54:26.779 --> 01:54:31.822]  Before the vax was available, Germany was already incarcerating rule breakers in detention camps.
[01:54:31.822 --> 01:54:34.204]  Such facilities are really going to come in handy.
[01:54:34.204 --> 01:54:41.390]  Germany using emergency powers to segregate, stigmatise, persecute and ultimately imprison an oppressed minority.
[01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:43.311]  What could possibly go wrong?
[01:54:43.311 --> 01:54:47.414]  Think I remember reading about something similar happening at some point in history.
[01:54:47.414 --> 01:54:49.595]  Can't for the life of me remember when.
[01:54:49.595 --> 01:54:51.557]  Germany and authoritarianism!
[01:54:51.557 --> 01:54:53.218]  Name a more iconic duo.
[01:54:53.218 --> 01:55:02.844]  The upcoming compulsory vaccination is the biggest political breach of promise in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, says the former editor-in-chief of Build.
[01:55:02.844 --> 01:55:06.427]  This is Angela Merkel's parting gift to her countrymen.
[01:55:06.427 --> 01:55:07.467]  Thanks, Angela!
[01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:11.450]  Life in Germany is already almost intolerable, even for the fully vaxxed.
[01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:15.976]  Getting a haircut in Germany is now worse than going through airport security.
[01:55:27.961 --> 01:55:32.506]  With hairdressers, the 3G access model is optional.
[01:55:32.506 --> 01:55:38.053]  This means that only vaccinated, cured or tested people are allowed to stay in the shop.
[01:55:38.053 --> 01:55:40.516]  There is no digital tracking here.
[01:55:40.516 --> 01:55:42.418]  The contact information is written.
[01:55:44.167 --> 01:55:49.430]  States in Germany have, of course, been imposing similar 2G powers for months.
[01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:55.614]  And it's been such a rip-roaring success that Germany just reported its highest corona death toll in nine months.
[01:55:55.614 --> 01:56:02.178]  Virtually every other country currently experiencing a Covid wave in Europe is also... Alright, see the full report.
[01:56:03.263 --> 01:56:06.126]  See the full report at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:06.126 --> 01:56:09.429]  Yes, the more VACs, the more debt, the more sickness.
[01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:10.590]  My grandparents moved to Austin.
[01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:14.213]  They lived in Hyde Park when I was a kid.
[01:56:14.213 --> 01:56:18.778]  They lived in Highland Park when he was growing up in Dallas.
[01:56:18.778 --> 01:56:23.002]  But my point is that this is just what he was told by all these people at the time.
[01:56:24.082 --> 01:56:31.888]  There's a lot of rich Germans living in Dallas at that time, and we're just talking about all these plans, pre-Hitler, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:31.888 --> 01:56:34.770]  But it doesn't matter what my grandfather told me when I was 10 years old.
[01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:43.397]  You're now seeing it all happen right now in front of you.
[01:56:43.397 --> 01:56:46.640]  You're now witnessing every damn bit of it.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:52.644]  We're gonna go to break, we're gonna come back, and we're gonna open the phones up and cover a ton of news in the third hour.
[01:56:53.837 --> 01:56:56.782]  It'll just be an open free-for-all, first-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:56:56.782 --> 01:56:57.743]  You agree, you disagree.
[01:56:57.743 --> 01:56:58.925]  I want to hear from you.
[01:56:58.925 --> 01:57:01.249]  We'll get the number out, start of the next hour.
[01:57:01.249 --> 01:57:01.950]  Hell, let's just do it now.
[01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:02.010]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:02.130]  877-789-2539. 877.

[01:57:29.690 --> 01:57:31.231]  It all ends.

[01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:37.317]  T-shirts are also being sold at cost.

[01:57:47.455 --> 01:57:48.695]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:57:48.695 --> 01:57:58.119]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[01:58:44.414 --> 01:58:48.358]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:58:48.838 --> 01:58:50.800]  I am a worldly person.
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:53.082]  Meaning, I like going to ball games.
[01:58:53.082 --> 01:58:54.443]  I like going to concerts.
[01:58:54.443 --> 01:58:55.804]  I like going to play golf.
[01:58:55.804 --> 01:58:57.605]  I like going out to dinner.
[01:58:57.605 --> 01:58:59.527]  I like the metropolitan life.
[01:58:59.527 --> 01:59:01.549]  I like everything that comes with this.
[01:59:01.549 --> 01:59:04.031]  But see, I have the survival instinct
[01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:10.356]  That is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[01:59:10.356 --> 01:59:13.880]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.681]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.803]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[01:59:17.803 --> 01:59:18.744]  Just get off grid?
[01:59:18.744 --> 01:59:20.205]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[01:59:20.205 --> 01:59:21.326]  Just live off the land?
[01:59:21.326 --> 01:59:22.688]  That's the survival instinct.
[01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:26.992]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says no, no, no, no, no.
[01:59:27.592 --> 01:59:31.013]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.275 --> 02:00:18.683]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the undue access of power and the consolidation of power of the military-industrial complex.
[02:00:18.683 --> 02:00:23.446]  There does exist and will continue to exist.
[02:00:23.446 --> 02:00:27.748]  And he goes on to talk about the corporate takeover through the scientific dictatorship in 1961.
[02:00:30.788 --> 02:00:39.874]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-259, to start going to your phone calls.
[02:00:39.874 --> 02:00:43.357]  Next segment, and I'll just say this.
[02:00:43.357 --> 02:00:49.842]  I feel guilty that I can't cover all this stuff.
[02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:57.607]  I mean, I read it, I looked at it, just each one of these is so nightmarish that this is what a war is, though.
[02:00:57.607 --> 02:00:58.748]  We're just totally overwhelmed.
[02:01:00.771 --> 02:01:06.898]  And all we can do, I guess, at the end of the day is resist this and just know everything they do is pure evil and out to get us.
[02:01:06.898 --> 02:01:17.309]  I mean, I see even the senators being lied to and being attacked by the system and being censored by big tech.
[02:01:17.309 --> 02:01:22.075]  And they still address the power structure like it just doesn't know what it's doing.
[02:01:23.447 --> 02:01:25.348]  Like, I saw Harrison Smith this morning.
[02:01:25.348 --> 02:01:26.208]  He's a really smart guy.
[02:01:26.208 --> 02:01:26.789]  I love the show.
[02:01:26.789 --> 02:01:28.209]  I was watching him.
[02:01:28.209 --> 02:01:34.652]  He's like, I just don't know why the media keeps saying Ivermectin doesn't help you when it does.
[02:01:34.652 --> 02:01:36.433]  I mean, why would they want everybody to die?
[02:01:36.433 --> 02:01:39.975]  And I know it's a rhetorical question by him, but that's the whole point.
[02:01:39.975 --> 02:01:46.017]  These are ruthless murderers.
[02:01:46.017 --> 02:01:47.218]  So just cut to the chase.
[02:01:47.218 --> 02:01:48.639]  And you know, I get it.
[02:01:48.639 --> 02:01:51.360]  It's impolite at Thanksgiving while everybody's giving each other...
[02:01:52.481 --> 02:01:57.946]  Champagne toast, like at my house.
[02:01:57.946 --> 02:01:59.006]  And I just couldn't help it.
[02:01:59.006 --> 02:02:00.648]  I just, you know, I sat at the table.
[02:02:00.648 --> 02:02:08.074]  I said, well, this might be the last Thanksgiving because they're going to bring new lockdowns in and forced evacuations in Europe, and there'll be a world financial collapse.
[02:02:08.074 --> 02:02:09.315]  They're going to bring in a world ID.
[02:02:09.315 --> 02:02:14.339]  So I want all of you to get ready when you go back to where you live in different parts of the country.
[02:02:15.538 --> 02:02:18.079]  Everybody's like, oh, well, I know Alex.
[02:02:18.079 --> 02:02:18.579]  I hear you.
[02:02:18.579 --> 02:02:24.401]  And I'm like, hey, listen, I'm not trying to grandstand at this Thanksgiving where we stuff ourselves with turkey and ham and brisket.
[02:02:24.401 --> 02:02:25.501]  We had all three.
[02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:31.183]  I'm just telling you that what created this bounty has been flushed down the toilet.
[02:02:31.183 --> 02:02:34.464]  And they're coming for our children with these poisonous shots right now.
[02:02:36.098 --> 02:02:36.798]  Oh, we agree.
[02:02:36.798 --> 02:02:37.819]  We know you're right.
[02:02:37.819 --> 02:02:39.360]  Hey, I don't want you to tell me I'm right.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.681]  This ain't about Alex Jones putting his testicles on the table.
[02:02:41.681 --> 02:02:42.982]  I didn't say that part.
[02:02:42.982 --> 02:02:44.083]  And, oh, I'm the big man.
[02:02:44.083 --> 02:02:45.103]  I'm King Kong.
[02:02:45.103 --> 02:02:47.084]  You need to salute me right away.
[02:02:47.084 --> 02:02:48.885]  I don't give a damn about that.
[02:02:48.885 --> 02:02:52.387]  We're under attack, and I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough.
[02:02:52.387 --> 02:02:54.789]  Now, I haven't figured out what it is I'm supposed to do.
[02:02:54.789 --> 02:02:55.649]  I'm on air.
[02:02:55.649 --> 02:02:56.450]  I'm warning people.
[02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:57.811]  I'm trying to influence folks.
[02:02:57.811 --> 02:03:01.873]  I'm behind the scenes doing stuff that may be more important than I do publicly.
[02:03:03.629 --> 02:03:10.233]  But it's my public war that got me the respect with all these people so they listen to me.
[02:03:10.233 --> 02:03:13.095]  But I know how to beat these people, and I know you know how as well.
[02:03:13.095 --> 02:03:20.560]  But you gotta stop worrying about being perfect in your execution of a resistance, and you gotta just start doing it.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:26.344]  I don't want you to go to Fauci's house and shove a gun in his mouth and blow his little head off, because that'll turn him into a victim.
[02:03:26.344 --> 02:03:27.825]  That's the last thing I want.
[02:03:27.825 --> 02:03:32.168]  I want you to politically, non-violently line him up
[02:03:32.748 --> 02:03:41.070]  Like a firing squad of truth and fired trillions of bullets of information into him non-violently and politically with how he's a murderer.
[02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:45.751]  And how he did secret medical tests on little black children and killed them on purpose.
[02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:47.771]  And how he's a murderous ghoul.
[02:03:47.771 --> 02:03:48.951]  And how he's your enemy.
[02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:50.812]  And how he created the bioweapons.
[02:03:50.812 --> 02:03:52.312]  And how he must fail.
[02:03:52.312 --> 02:03:54.813]  And the whole system's trying to prop him up.
[02:03:54.813 --> 02:03:57.853]  But I can tell you, he's folding right now.
[02:03:57.853 --> 02:03:59.674]  We're becoming stronger.
[02:03:59.674 --> 02:04:00.934]  He's becoming weaker.
[02:04:02.284 --> 02:04:09.350]  And I want you to pray for God to bring judgment upon him in the Lord's will and the Lord's grace.
[02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:16.816]  Please, God, in the name of your Son and our Savior Jesus Christ, deliver us from Anthony Fauci.
[02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:19.558]  Deliver us from Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[02:04:19.558 --> 02:04:23.542]  And if it is your will, then we pray in your heavenly name.
[02:04:25.552 --> 02:04:34.216]  O King of all the hosts, to bring judgment upon this plague and upon these devils in the name of Jesus Christ!
[02:04:34.216 --> 02:04:38.938]  Amen!
[02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:44.581]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:46.362]  We are the dealers.
[02:04:46.362 --> 02:04:49.263]  We'll give you everything you need.
[02:04:49.263 --> 02:04:50.724]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:04:56.212 --> 02:04:59.656]  There are so many crap... Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:04:59.656 --> 02:05:01.698]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[02:05:01.698 --> 02:05:02.098]  Welcome.
[02:05:02.098 --> 02:05:02.819]  Hello, Alex?
[02:05:02.819 --> 02:05:03.420]  Yes, Malcolm.
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:07.704]  Alright, I'll make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[02:05:07.704 --> 02:05:12.289]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[02:05:12.289 --> 02:05:15.292]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[02:05:15.292 --> 02:05:17.915]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[02:05:18.175 --> 02:05:19.975]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[02:05:19.975 --> 02:05:31.638]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[02:05:31.638 --> 02:05:33.478]  This is like a very fine wine.
[02:05:33.478 --> 02:05:35.618]  In fact, each batch is different.
[02:05:35.618 --> 02:05:37.719]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[02:05:37.719 --> 02:05:41.340]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:42.260]  That's just how it is.
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:42.920]  It's how it works.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:47.642]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[02:05:47.642 --> 02:05:51.443]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[02:06:07.745 --> 02:06:12.570]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:14.892]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.892 --> 02:06:19.076]  Well, the spirit is strong now.
[02:06:19.076 --> 02:06:25.582]  Because they are injecting children and maiming and killing children all over the western world right now.
[02:06:25.582 --> 02:06:29.046]  And Fauci says in the new year they're coming for newborn babies with the deadly shots.
[02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:52.149]  And so all that discernment, all that energy, all that power you're feeling right now as a person that loves God, that has God consciousness, as Dr. Zelenko would say, that transcends Judaism, Christianity, all of it, it is the Christian God, it is the Judaic God, it is the one God, but it is God, not what men call it.
[02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:57.931]  God is shining through you to resist and say no to this and defend children.
[02:06:59.042 --> 02:07:08.366]  So I'm telling my listeners, and I'm going to do it this weekend, despite the fact that I've got being deposed by the Democratic Party and their Sandy Hook operation this Saturday for eight hours.
[02:07:08.366 --> 02:07:18.449]  Despite the fact I got all the stuff I'm doing, I will be out this weekend at poison shot injection centers protesting.
[02:07:18.449 --> 02:07:20.170]  I will be in the field.
[02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:23.411]  I will be taking action.
[02:07:23.411 --> 02:07:28.273]  You've got my absolute commitment that I'm going to be doing that.
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.520]  Because we have to operate in the third dimension.
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:36.981]  We have to take action.
[02:07:36.981 --> 02:07:39.682]  That's why we've been given a spirit of victory.
[02:07:39.682 --> 02:07:46.463]  Not to sit there and talk about how Christian we are all day and how good we are and how we don't sin.
[02:07:46.463 --> 02:07:48.383]  Let me tell you what God hates.
[02:07:48.383 --> 02:07:52.604]  God hates cowards.
[02:07:52.604 --> 02:07:57.625]  The real sin right now that God will slam the door on you for eternity is not standing up for these children.
[02:08:01.451 --> 02:08:04.993]  I can feel God's rage right now.
[02:08:04.993 --> 02:08:11.897]  The only way to survive that rage is to comport myself into it as an instrument or a weapon against these people.
[02:08:11.897 --> 02:08:14.819]  You should not even worry about what your neighbors or people think.
[02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:16.320]  You shouldn't worry about prison.
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:17.860]  You shouldn't worry about death.
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:22.603]  You should only worry that God is angry.
[02:08:22.603 --> 02:08:24.744]  I can feel it.
[02:08:24.744 --> 02:08:25.545]  I know you can too.
[02:08:29.718 --> 02:08:37.002]  But we have to be as wise as serpents and as peaceful as doves.
[02:08:37.002 --> 02:08:48.770]  And we have to savage these people with our speech and with our knowledge and with our truth and with our prayer and with our action and with our giving and our financial resistance.
[02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:52.992]  That's a form of sacrifice of your work and your labor.
[02:08:52.992 --> 02:08:56.234]  And if you won't do it, you will be destroyed.
[02:08:56.234 --> 02:08:57.235]  And you will be alone
[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:15.349]  In a spiritual dungeon, begging for God to help you, and God's gonna say, I did help you, I gave you the power, I gave you the birthright, I gave you everything, and you did nothing!
[02:09:15.349 --> 02:09:23.633]  I came knocking over and over until my hand was bloody, begging you to help me, and you wouldn't do anything!
[02:09:23.633 --> 02:09:25.534]  So don't come to my door, I don't know who you are.
[02:09:25.534 --> 02:09:27.275]  I wanted to know you!
[02:09:28.382 --> 02:09:31.964]  I wanted to be with you forever and you wouldn't be with me!
[02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:34.085]  You slammed the door on me!
[02:09:34.085 --> 02:09:35.885]  That's what God's saying.
[02:09:35.885 --> 02:09:38.407]  You think I want to damn you to hell?
[02:09:38.407 --> 02:09:45.089]  You think I want to cut you off when I made you?
[02:09:45.089 --> 02:09:45.790]  No.
[02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:49.551]  But you cut yourself off.
[02:09:49.551 --> 02:09:53.693]  Because you wouldn't stand up against these snakes.
[02:09:53.693 --> 02:09:55.074]  We're not snakes, my friends.
[02:09:55.074 --> 02:09:57.115]  We're as wise as serpents.
[02:09:59.397 --> 02:10:04.339]  We have the knowledge of their operation.
[02:10:04.339 --> 02:10:10.302]  And those of us that are as wise as serpents have to start using that knowledge.
[02:10:11.698 --> 02:10:19.080]  To not just make money in business, not just to pick up women, not just to be cool, not just for everybody to think you're the boss.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.640]  You're given that information to fight the evil ones.
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.982]  The knowledge of evil is not some information for you that's a curiosity.
[02:10:27.982 --> 02:10:34.103]  It is given to you to know the enemy's plans to defeat them.
[02:10:34.103 --> 02:10:38.244]  I have not been given the knowledge of the enemy to become a new enemy.
[02:10:39.218 --> 02:10:50.891]  We've not been given the ring of doom or the knowledge of how it operates to join with Satan, but to be at opposition with Satan!
[02:10:50.891 --> 02:10:52.453]  Alright, look.
[02:10:52.453 --> 02:10:56.137]  You want to see Satan?
[02:10:56.137 --> 02:10:56.838]  Let's compare.
[02:10:56.838 --> 02:10:59.521]  Melissa Tate we just had on.
[02:11:01.152 --> 02:11:10.417]  But this woman that's on Infowars.com, there's a bunch of videos, everyone's going to play one, bragging that she's a leftist and bragging that she's got your children.
[02:11:10.417 --> 02:11:26.165]  Imagine the galactic spiritual crime of you pay taxes, you send your children to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, and some satanic blob with a gargoyle on her chest says, I'm the teacher you're scared of, I'm corrupting your children.
[02:11:27.887 --> 02:11:34.092]  And of course, she's an ugly, disgusting sack of filth.
[02:11:34.092 --> 02:11:37.875]  But let me tell you who's worse than her.
[02:11:37.875 --> 02:11:42.800]  People that let their children be in the countenance with her.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.961]  Let me tell you something.
[02:11:43.961 --> 02:11:51.847]  You can't sit there when these demon blobs come from your children and then just say, well, you know, that's what I did or whatever.
[02:11:57.415 --> 02:11:59.196]  It's very simple.
[02:11:59.196 --> 02:12:03.499]  Protect your children from these people, or God is going to damn you to hell.
[02:12:03.499 --> 02:12:04.500]  And let me tell you what hell is.
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.641]  Hell is eternity with that thing.
[02:12:06.641 --> 02:12:10.304]  I mean, it's separation from God, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:10.304 --> 02:12:15.207]  Can you imagine being locked up with that creature for eternity?
[02:12:15.207 --> 02:12:21.452]  No, she just wants to drag your children into the mouth of hell with her.
[02:12:21.452 --> 02:12:22.733]  Let's hear from this piece of filth.
[02:12:22.733 --> 02:12:23.133]  Here she is.
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.543]  Ask me why every conversation in class devolves into me ranting about capitalism.
[02:12:30.543 --> 02:12:33.785]  It's because I'm the teacher that your parents warned you about.
[02:12:33.785 --> 02:12:36.906]  I'm the professor that's gonna turn your kids leftist.
[02:12:36.906 --> 02:12:39.788]  Welcome.
[02:12:39.788 --> 02:12:51.274]  Yep, and you're the person that's gonna make them take forced injections, and you're the person that's gonna ruin their immune system, and you're the person that's got all this power to make us submit to you because you don't have power, witch!
[02:12:52.489 --> 02:12:57.692]  The only power is jumping into the current of God and turning loose.
[02:12:57.692 --> 02:13:00.494]  The only power is submission to Jesus Christ.
[02:13:00.494 --> 02:13:04.776]  The only power is turning loose your little devilish ego, you little monster.
[02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:13.962]  The thing in her thinks that she can destroy innocence and take soul's weather.
[02:13:13.962 --> 02:13:18.424]  Look at the arrogance, look at that look, look at that face.
[02:13:18.424 --> 02:13:20.906]  She's already in her own private disgusting hell.
[02:13:22.079 --> 02:13:24.700]  The female version of Brian.
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:28.381]  Looks like a you-know-what Stelter.
[02:13:28.381 --> 02:13:30.222]  Alright, I'm going to go to break in about three minutes.
[02:13:30.222 --> 02:13:31.843]  I'm going to come back and talk to you.
[02:13:31.843 --> 02:13:33.303]  Look, folks, I've got hundreds of videos.
[02:13:33.303 --> 02:13:37.485]  I mean, when I say hundreds of videos, I mean I've got a hundred videos right here.
[02:13:37.485 --> 02:13:39.565]  Look at this one.
[02:13:39.565 --> 02:13:40.486]  Queue this up.
[02:13:40.486 --> 02:13:41.606]  Poor crew's got hundreds of clips.
[02:13:41.606 --> 02:13:43.527]  I've got to find them when I call for them.
[02:13:43.527 --> 02:13:46.128]  Watch British Health Secretary talk about a Creepazoid.
[02:13:47.654 --> 02:13:52.337]  I mean, Hannibal Lecter tries to act scary in the first Silence of the Lambs, he does an okay job.
[02:13:52.337 --> 02:13:56.020]  You watch this, it's 50 times more scary, because it's real.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:58.562]  He's like, talking to the reporter, why don't you take it?
[02:13:58.562 --> 02:13:59.582]  You haven't.
[02:13:59.582 --> 02:14:01.504]  Why don't you take it into your body?
[02:14:01.504 --> 02:14:02.985]  Take the third shot.
[02:14:02.985 --> 02:14:03.705]  Okay, I will.
[02:14:03.705 --> 02:14:05.606]  Good.
[02:14:05.606 --> 02:14:10.190]  You're like, man, over and over again, giving us shots that don't protect us, giving us shots that make us sick.
[02:14:10.190 --> 02:14:12.531]  That's how you turn people against you.
[02:14:12.531 --> 02:14:13.392]  Well, because you're awake.
[02:14:14.582 --> 02:14:16.023]  They're gonna put you in a camp if they can.
[02:14:16.023 --> 02:14:18.165]  They're gonna kill you with guns.
[02:14:18.165 --> 02:14:24.250]  But for people under Stockholm Syndrome, it's the power of, you've already had two shots, you're not feeling too well, and you're not protected.
[02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:27.553]  Instead of saying, hey, you're a liar, get away from me, take your third.
[02:14:27.553 --> 02:14:33.177]  She goes, okay, oh God, yeah, oh, oh, put it in me, put the needle in me, baby, baby!
[02:14:33.177 --> 02:14:37.160]  I mean, literally, it's a rapist wanting to rape her with a bioweapon.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:37.521]  Here it is.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:44.125]  Oh, we don't have it yet.
[02:14:44.125 --> 02:14:44.606]  Oh my God.
[02:14:44.606 --> 02:14:47.989]  See, I was like, as I said earlier, I said earlier, get it for me.
[02:14:47.989 --> 02:14:49.290]  And I guess you guys didn't hear that.
[02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:51.692]  So I was like, I'm going to give you a little moment to find it.
[02:14:51.692 --> 02:14:53.014]  Let me give you the headline for everybody.
[02:14:53.014 --> 02:14:55.956]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:14:55.956 --> 02:15:02.402]  And it's watch British health secretary coaxes double jab reporter into getting third shot.
[02:15:02.402 --> 02:15:03.163]  See, I love you guys.
[02:15:03.163 --> 02:15:05.405]  But the cue was, hey, get it ready, guys.
[02:15:05.405 --> 02:15:06.206]  You see, we don't have it.
[02:15:06.206 --> 02:15:06.867]  We don't have it in my ear.
[02:15:08.188 --> 02:15:09.349]  I love the crew, they're the best crew ever.
[02:15:09.349 --> 02:15:10.629]  But people think they're talking in my ear?
[02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:11.590]  No, they're not.
[02:15:11.590 --> 02:15:15.931]  They should be talking in my ear more, not like once a day or whatever.
[02:15:15.931 --> 02:15:17.192]  I don't know, we have time to play it now.
[02:15:17.192 --> 02:15:18.432]  We'll go to break, we'll play it.
[02:15:18.432 --> 02:15:23.795]  But I mean, you talk about satanics, oh baby, come on, I've already done it twice, do it again.
[02:15:24.315 --> 02:15:27.376]  And once I've got you three times, over and over.
[02:15:27.376 --> 02:15:30.297]  Oh, the blood clots, the heart attacks, sweetheart.
[02:15:30.297 --> 02:15:32.477]  I'll let you go outside your house if you take it.
[02:15:32.477 --> 02:15:34.638]  If you rub the lotion on your skin.
[02:15:34.638 --> 02:15:37.879]  If you don't rub the lotion on the skin, I'm gonna spray water on you.
[02:15:37.879 --> 02:15:40.200]  You're in my pit now, baby!
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:50.263]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:15:50.263 --> 02:15:51.023]  And your phone calls.
[02:15:55.236 --> 02:16:12.962]  Hey everybody, Confused about... In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[02:16:12.962 --> 02:16:16.623]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[02:16:16.623 --> 02:16:23.325]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[02:16:23.945 --> 02:16:28.028]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[02:16:28.028 --> 02:16:30.770]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:31.570]  It's high quality.
[02:16:31.570 --> 02:16:34.792]  It's very, very low cost at infowarestore.com.
[02:16:34.792 --> 02:16:42.157]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[02:16:42.157 --> 02:16:46.080]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:46.821]  That's right.
[02:16:56.587 --> 02:16:58.828]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[02:16:58.828 --> 02:17:00.409]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[02:17:00.409 --> 02:17:03.291]  Why do they hate America so much?
[02:17:03.291 --> 02:17:10.735]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with.
[02:17:10.735 --> 02:17:11.655]  It's very, very simple.
[02:17:11.655 --> 02:17:23.522]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenic system to flourish, freedom and liberty and due process and justice and God-fearing systems must fail.
[02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:26.843]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[02:17:26.843 --> 02:17:29.804]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[02:17:29.804 --> 02:17:31.745]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[02:17:31.745 --> 02:17:34.766]  They started a fight with you.
[02:17:34.766 --> 02:17:43.309]  And they're not gonna back down, and they're not gonna go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[02:17:43.969 --> 02:17:49.595]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism, or about corporate fascism.
[02:17:49.595 --> 02:17:56.501]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack, that we have any chance of beating these people.
[02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.302]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:58.769 --> 02:18:00.170]  Keep us on air.
[02:18:00.170 --> 02:18:02.711]  We'll continue to bring you the banned guests.
[02:18:02.711 --> 02:18:06.572]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[02:18:06.572 --> 02:18:07.352]  Keep us on air.
[02:18:07.352 --> 02:18:08.633]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:08.633 --> 02:18:22.178]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the InfoWars Life Supplement line, the Vitamin D3 with Calcium Gummies, the Vitamin C with Zinc, and the Whole Food Multivitamins, or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:22.178 --> 02:18:24.639]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D Gummies,
[02:18:25.677 --> 02:18:27.439]  This is a great thing for your kids.
[02:18:27.439 --> 02:18:28.119]  They're going to love it.
[02:18:28.119 --> 02:18:29.841]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[02:18:29.841 --> 02:18:31.242]  It's healthy.
[02:18:31.242 --> 02:18:32.744]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[02:18:32.744 --> 02:18:34.325]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[02:18:34.325 --> 02:18:36.507]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[02:18:36.507 --> 02:18:37.408]  Calcium, good for them.
[02:18:37.408 --> 02:18:37.888]  The vitamin D.
[02:18:39.184 --> 02:18:42.207]  So, that's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:42.207 --> 02:18:44.850]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.

[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:58.143]  We cannot thank you enough.
[02:18:58.143 --> 02:19:01.546]  What are champions made of?
[02:19:01.546 --> 02:19:02.688]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:10.841]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.

[02:19:43.889 --> 02:19:45.029]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:45.029 --> 02:19:48.970]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:55.952]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[02:20:55.952 --> 02:21:04.716]  All right, let's go right to your phone calls on this live December 2nd, Thursday transmission.
[02:21:04.716 --> 02:21:06.097]  What a time to be alive.
[02:21:06.097 --> 02:21:09.158]  History's happening right now in front of us.
[02:21:09.158 --> 02:21:19.223]  We got Ian, JR, Kyle, Jason, Kate, David, Savarino, Bob, Jordan, and Clown Car.
[02:21:20.287 --> 02:21:26.232]  From New York, we're going to take all the calls in the order that they were received.
[02:21:26.232 --> 02:21:28.734]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jordan in New Jersey.
[02:21:28.734 --> 02:21:33.878]  Welcome.
[02:21:33.878 --> 02:21:35.540]  How's it going, Jordan?
[02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:36.921]  He just dropped right as I went to him.
[02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:37.722]  Wow.
[02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:40.344]  Okay, let's go to FEMA Region 10.
[02:21:40.344 --> 02:21:42.005]  Let's go to Kyle.
[02:21:42.005 --> 02:21:42.626]  You're on the air.
[02:21:42.626 --> 02:21:42.906]  Welcome.
[02:21:48.339 --> 02:21:49.920]  You know, this happens every once in a while.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:53.582]  A couple times a year, we have a phone system failure.
[02:21:53.582 --> 02:21:55.623]  We have a computer phone system, and it just does this.
[02:21:55.623 --> 02:21:56.804]  So, it's fun.
[02:21:56.804 --> 02:21:58.064]  I wanted to play the clip earlier.
[02:21:58.064 --> 02:21:59.565]  Couldn't play it.
[02:21:59.565 --> 02:22:00.806]  Now we can't take calls.
[02:22:00.806 --> 02:22:03.927]  What I've always noticed is problems cascade.
[02:22:03.927 --> 02:22:07.289]  You know, here in the Great Reset, and that's what they want.
[02:22:07.289 --> 02:22:13.553]  Can you imagine all this complex technology, if it actually starts breaking down?
[02:22:13.553 --> 02:22:15.894]  You know, I forgot I was supposed to play this.
[02:22:18.609 --> 02:22:19.390]  We already tried earlier.
[02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:20.611]  We're going to try it again now.
[02:22:20.611 --> 02:22:21.512]  This is our big day.
[02:22:21.512 --> 02:22:22.433]  This is the big moment.
[02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:24.015]  This is the big thing.
[02:22:24.015 --> 02:22:29.481]  British Health Secretary coaxes double jab reporter into getting third shot.
[02:22:29.481 --> 02:22:33.306]  Bizarre footage out of the UK shows British Health Secretary
[02:22:36.158 --> 02:22:42.642]  Sajid Javid pressuring a vaccinated reporter to get the third COVID jab.
[02:22:42.642 --> 02:22:51.647]  Despite the fact that it erases your immunity, the third shot in Israeli studies accelerates that, gives you no protection, he's just there saying, take it, take it, take it!
[02:22:51.647 --> 02:22:58.311]  Because if you'll take the third, you'll take the fourth, you'll take the fifth, you'll take the sixth, you'll take the 20th, you'll take the 87 millionth.
[02:22:58.311 --> 02:23:00.773]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:23:00.773 --> 02:23:01.133]  Here it is.
[02:23:02.056 --> 02:23:02.979]  Have you got boosted yet?
[02:23:02.979 --> 02:23:04.764]  No, I'm 64 and I've still not had it.
[02:23:04.764 --> 02:23:05.125]  You haven't?
[02:23:05.125 --> 02:23:05.767]  Why not?
[02:23:05.767 --> 02:23:09.559]  Well, partly because I got COVID at the Hartlepool by-election.
[02:23:10.504 --> 02:23:11.505]  You should be okay now.
[02:23:11.505 --> 02:23:15.688]  And so I didn't have my second till the 14th of June.
[02:23:15.688 --> 02:23:18.570]  So under the six-month rule, that takes to the 14th of December.
[02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:19.871]  But under the new rule, you'll be okay.
[02:23:19.871 --> 02:23:20.411]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:20.411 --> 02:23:22.193]  You'll come back here later this week.
[02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:22.773]  Yeah.
[02:23:22.773 --> 02:23:24.614]  What time do they open here?
[02:23:24.614 --> 02:23:26.236]  Uh, they open till eight, I think.
[02:23:26.236 --> 02:23:28.017]  In fact, they might give it to you now if you walk in.
[02:23:28.017 --> 02:23:28.557]  You think so?
[02:23:28.557 --> 02:23:29.158]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:29.158 --> 02:23:29.818]  Yeah.
[02:23:29.818 --> 02:23:31.860]  I've got to go back to work, though.
[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:32.800]  No, just do it.
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:34.202]  Can you make me a promise?
[02:23:34.202 --> 02:23:34.762]  Sorry?
[02:23:34.762 --> 02:23:35.322]  Make me a promise.
[02:23:35.322 --> 02:23:35.803]  Just go and do it now.
[02:23:36.755 --> 02:23:38.376]  This is a total cult!
[02:23:59.445 --> 02:24:07.927]  Wanting to rape your body, wanting to get everybody under peer pressure, because they've learned psychologically the average person will not admit they're wrong when they're conned.
[02:24:07.927 --> 02:24:10.747]  Now we have a horrible, horrible announcement.
[02:24:10.747 --> 02:24:14.288]  Some terrible video to play, but we knew it was coming.
[02:24:14.288 --> 02:24:16.269]  We have several Joe Biden videos.
[02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:20.509]  One, he makes sick jokes about Fauci and his wife.
[02:24:20.509 --> 02:24:25.911]  At least it's not about his daughters and granddaughters.
[02:24:25.911 --> 02:24:27.311]  And how Fauci's really the president.
[02:24:28.595 --> 02:24:30.176]  That clip's in a moment.
[02:24:30.176 --> 02:24:33.397]  But the first clip just came out, just happened a few minutes ago.
[02:24:33.397 --> 02:24:37.079]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:24:37.079 --> 02:24:45.662]  Biden says he'll do everything in his diseased brain who doesn't read bills, who doesn't read what he's signing.
[02:24:45.662 --> 02:24:46.563]  We have that new video.
[02:24:47.728 --> 02:25:03.806]  to make sure under fives get the shot even though statistically nobody died under five even if you believe the official story and there's all these hundred-to-one side effects for any benefits I mean just talk about doubling down he'll do everything in his power
[02:25:05.316 --> 02:25:08.838]  They've already fired the boards on the FDA and CDC to do this.
[02:25:08.838 --> 02:25:14.121]  He'll do everything in his power to get the FDA to approve for children under five.
[02:25:14.121 --> 02:25:16.182]  And then once they're approved, they're mandatory.
[02:25:16.182 --> 02:25:18.143]  And they try to make them take them at birth.
[02:25:18.143 --> 02:25:19.743]  When your kid dies, they just laugh at you.
[02:25:19.743 --> 02:25:23.826]  It's all a big, sick, satanic ritual.
[02:25:23.826 --> 02:25:25.787]  My God.
[02:25:25.787 --> 02:25:26.807]  We won't stand up for the children.
[02:25:26.807 --> 02:25:27.708]  Nobody will stand up for us.
[02:25:27.708 --> 02:25:29.208]  Here it is.
[02:25:29.208 --> 02:25:30.029]  I have a three-year-old.
[02:25:31.184 --> 02:25:34.005]  Is there going to be a time that that can, am I going to be okay?
[02:25:34.005 --> 02:25:34.945]  Is she going to be okay?
[02:25:34.945 --> 02:25:36.785]  Or is he going to be okay?
[02:25:36.785 --> 02:25:43.207]  And let me say this, I strongly support the independent scientific review of vaccine uses for children under five.
[02:25:43.207 --> 02:25:54.230]  We can't take shortcuts with that scientific work, but I'll do everything in my power to support the FDA to do this safely and quickly as possible when we get around to that point.
[02:25:55.037 --> 02:26:05.880]  What a creepy, evil, demonic... Oh, I agree, the safe, independent, outside, independent review, total opposite, pharma, revolving door, with the very same people.
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:08.260]  I mean, this is a rape!
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:09.661]  A bio-weapon rape!
[02:26:09.661 --> 02:26:11.021]  And you're like, why would they do that?
[02:26:11.021 --> 02:26:13.402]  Because they like to kill people, because they're sick freaks!
[02:26:14.062 --> 02:26:19.745]  They see resources, and money, and numbers, and see a social services net that you've invested in.
[02:26:19.745 --> 02:26:20.905]  Well, how about we just get rid of police?
[02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:21.666]  Let everybody kill them.
[02:26:21.666 --> 02:26:22.786]  We've got private security.
[02:26:22.786 --> 02:26:28.689]  Why don't we just cut off their social security, and their Medicaid, and their Medicare, and their pensions?
[02:26:28.689 --> 02:26:30.850]  Why don't we just devalue all their currency?
[02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:38.874]  You know, we ran this Ponzi scheme to take over, and it says we've all got billions in our bank accounts, but if these people have their way, we won't.
[02:26:38.874 --> 02:26:40.495]  Well, let's just kill everyone!
[02:26:40.495 --> 02:26:43.036]  That's the oldest trick in the book!
[02:26:48.103 --> 02:26:50.464]  And of course, they're always reordering, reordering.
[02:26:50.464 --> 02:27:01.146]  Remember last year, they reordered until 2027 in Canada?
[02:27:01.146 --> 02:27:05.307]  And I said, watch, they're going to announce forced booster shots because they already freaking ordered it all!
[02:27:05.307 --> 02:27:07.388]  It's all preordained!
[02:27:10.199 --> 02:27:11.060]  They admit it is!
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:13.361]  It's all a sick plan!
[02:27:13.361 --> 02:27:22.628]  And then, it collapses civilization with all the sick people, they fire everybody else that won't take it, then that breaks things down, and they get what they want, because we won't take the poison shot.
[02:27:22.628 --> 02:27:30.653]  And I'm not saying take the poison shot, but you get the real effect is, a third of the workforce gets fired or quits, now stuff really collapses.
[02:27:30.653 --> 02:27:32.734]  Which was their goal.
[02:27:32.734 --> 02:27:34.055]  And who do they blame for the collapse?
[02:27:34.055 --> 02:27:37.438]  The unvaccinated, when they're the ones that ordered the system that did it.
[02:27:38.547 --> 02:27:49.055]  The key is exposing that they are behind it and it's their plan and having a revelation of this understanding and then they get hung at Nuremberg 2 and we restart civilization and go to the next level.
[02:27:49.055 --> 02:27:51.036]  Or we all die and sit here like idiots.
[02:27:51.036 --> 02:27:58.122]  And if you are lazy and if you don't care about others and you don't think of yourself as big, you deserve to die and they will kill you.
[02:27:58.122 --> 02:28:00.484]  As for me and mine, we're fighting.
[02:28:00.484 --> 02:28:00.844]  Here it is.
[02:28:02.833 --> 02:28:06.334]  I've seen more of Dr. Fauci than I have my wife.
[02:28:06.334 --> 02:28:09.056]  We kid each other, but... There you look.
[02:28:09.056 --> 02:28:10.116]  Who's president?
[02:28:10.116 --> 02:28:11.957]  Fauci.
[02:28:11.957 --> 02:28:17.579]  But all kidding aside, I sincerely mean it.
[02:28:17.579 --> 02:28:19.280]  All kidding aside, I sincerely mean it.
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.501]  I'll give my wife sexually, do a gangbang with all these people, these satanic orgies.
[02:28:23.501 --> 02:28:24.322]  That's nothing.
[02:28:24.322 --> 02:28:26.123]  Then I have sex with my children, my grandchildren.
[02:28:26.123 --> 02:28:27.143]  I mean, it's all on record.
[02:28:27.143 --> 02:28:28.864]  He screws his grandchildren.
[02:28:28.864 --> 02:28:31.845]  I mean, that's who the president is, is a puppet that rapes children.
[02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:34.357]  It's total hell on earth.
[02:28:34.357 --> 02:28:40.300]  I mean, who do you think would inject people with deadly poison and say, I really want to give it to three-year-olds?
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:46.242]  He wants to stick his metal needle of rape, of genetic rape, and murder the DNA.
[02:28:46.242 --> 02:28:49.404]  Not just rape the child, he wants to murder them.
[02:28:49.404 --> 02:28:51.284]  He wants to murder your children.
[02:28:51.284 --> 02:28:52.045]  He's a murderer!
[02:28:55.114 --> 02:28:58.575]  If you're concerned about the power grid and... Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:28:58.575 --> 02:29:00.616]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[02:29:00.616 --> 02:29:01.036]  Welcome.
[02:29:01.036 --> 02:29:01.756]  Hello, Alex?
[02:29:01.756 --> 02:29:02.376]  Yes, Malcolm.
[02:29:02.376 --> 02:29:06.637]  Alright, I'll make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:11.218]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[02:29:11.218 --> 02:29:14.219]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[02:29:14.219 --> 02:29:16.840]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:18.901]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[02:29:18.901 --> 02:29:23.805]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[02:29:23.805 --> 02:29:30.570]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[02:29:30.570 --> 02:29:32.412]  This is like a very fine wine.
[02:29:32.412 --> 02:29:34.553]  In fact, each batch is different.
[02:29:34.553 --> 02:29:36.955]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[02:29:36.955 --> 02:29:40.278]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[02:29:40.278 --> 02:29:41.198]  That's just how it is.
[02:29:41.198 --> 02:29:41.859]  It's how it works.
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:46.589]  Uh, so, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[02:29:46.589 --> 02:29:50.397]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[02:29:57.208 --> 02:30:08.955]  So, when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:30:08.955 --> 02:30:11.697]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1.
[02:30:12.597 --> 02:30:26.240]  It worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter, you came out with XT, you know, with a deep root source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened, you know?
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:35.501]  I could think again, I could connect with people again, and over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:30:35.501 --> 02:30:37.882]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[02:30:37.882 --> 02:30:39.002]  The one I like recently,
[02:30:39.002 --> 02:30:40.344]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:30:40.344 --> 02:30:42.386]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:30:57.284 --> 02:31:02.647]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[02:31:02.647 --> 02:31:12.052]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[02:31:12.692 --> 02:31:22.660]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:29.425]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[02:31:29.425 --> 02:31:30.866]  But there is only two things to do.
[02:31:31.967 --> 02:31:35.128]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[02:31:35.128 --> 02:31:38.429]  If enough people awaken from the cult spell, then we win.
[02:31:38.429 --> 02:31:43.831]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[02:31:43.831 --> 02:31:45.652]  And so, we must prepare.
[02:31:45.652 --> 02:31:55.696]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:59.142 --> 02:32:04.106]  If you only knew the power of the dark side.
[02:32:04.106 --> 02:32:11.032]  Join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[02:32:11.032 --> 02:32:17.036]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[02:32:17.036 --> 02:32:19.899]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:22.952]  They must first play God.
[02:32:22.952 --> 02:32:29.403]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[02:32:29.403 --> 02:32:30.825]  And, in a way, they're right.
[02:32:30.825 --> 02:32:33.970]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us...
[02:32:34.858 --> 02:32:36.819]  Destroy our children's futures.
[02:32:36.819 --> 02:32:38.501]  The evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[02:32:38.501 --> 02:32:42.223]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[02:32:42.223 --> 02:32:44.044]  So I ask you now.
[02:32:44.044 --> 02:32:48.727]  Are you going to step up and expose the New World Order even more?
[02:32:48.727 --> 02:32:52.350]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[02:32:52.350 --> 02:32:57.994]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.gov.
[02:32:57.994 --> 02:33:02.597]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:02.597 --> 02:33:03.878]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.683 --> 02:33:17.485]  The idea of a lockdown just two years ago was unthinkable.
[02:33:17.485 --> 02:33:19.806]  I told you that.
[02:33:19.806 --> 02:33:22.587]  The plan.
[02:33:22.587 --> 02:33:24.948]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.948 --> 02:33:26.909]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:26.909 --> 02:33:28.389]  Or you're mine.
[02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:36.052]  I said by the winter of 2021 it will be the unvaccinated that they will lock down.
[02:33:36.052 --> 02:33:39.593]  Then the forced inoculations, the roundups, and then the terror attacks.
[02:33:40.689 --> 02:34:03.938]  Against police, against military, against Pfizer, against Moderna, that they themselves will stage to blame us and start the full persecution and the armed conflict, which will bring down Europe and bring down the United States in a fiery war, Australia, and they believe the bankers will sit offshore and we kill each other five, ten years while China takes over the planet.
[02:34:09.013 --> 02:34:16.338]  And then out of that, they'll finally come with the big banks, and after everybody's done starving to death and saving, just turn your guns in and pledge allegiance to us.
[02:34:16.338 --> 02:34:19.700]  We will give you the new global social credit score.
[02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:20.801]  And that's where we're going to go.
[02:34:20.801 --> 02:34:23.783]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:34:23.783 --> 02:34:35.551]  Every one of you, I don't care if you're a firefighter, a school teacher, an FBI agent, an astronomer, a factory worker, a farmer, a rancher, a psychologist, somebody that works at McDonald's.
[02:34:39.775 --> 02:34:45.977]  You are about to go through this hell.
[02:34:45.977 --> 02:34:48.998]  And the German military is going to march out and force the injector.
[02:34:48.998 --> 02:34:52.359]  They say every two months with a new shot until you die.
[02:34:52.359 --> 02:34:54.620]  Everybody will Stockholm Syndrome out and be part of it.
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:57.661]  And just we agree and just hope they don't die.
[02:34:57.661 --> 02:35:02.243]  That's where we are.
[02:35:02.243 --> 02:35:06.744]  So I don't want the truck bombings of the Pfizer facility.
[02:35:06.744 --> 02:35:07.945]  They're going to do it themselves themselves.
[02:35:09.437 --> 02:35:11.459]  I don't want any of this.
[02:35:11.459 --> 02:35:13.682]  And hey, we got Joe Rogan awake saying no.
[02:35:13.682 --> 02:35:15.184]  We got Tucker Carlson awake saying no.
[02:35:15.184 --> 02:35:16.485]  We got so many others.
[02:35:16.485 --> 02:35:21.110]  We need Congress and governors to just come out and say, this is a world government, new world order takeover.
[02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.811]  It's globalism.
[02:35:21.811 --> 02:35:23.773]  Address it head on and say no.
[02:35:23.773 --> 02:35:26.416]  And just tell the public in a press conference, Governor Abbott.
[02:35:27.148 --> 02:35:33.973]  Governor DeSantis, if you're really with us, about what's going down and what's happening, and then everybody will rally behind you and we'll stop it.
[02:35:33.973 --> 02:35:43.100]  But only admitting you're in a war with the UN and the global corporations doing this do we have a chance to beat it.
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:49.865]  But if we have the leadership to say no to all this, it'll be easily defeated.
[02:35:51.069 --> 02:35:53.170]  And I can tell you, and I want to go to your calls now.
[02:35:53.170 --> 02:35:56.732]  I'll go 15 minutes to the next hour, guest hosts can push over, they understand.
[02:35:56.732 --> 02:36:00.054]  I promise you with all these calls.
[02:36:00.054 --> 02:36:05.898]  I promise you that it's going to be better to stand up to this than to submit to it.
[02:36:05.898 --> 02:36:09.460]  You don't need me to tell you that, you already know it.
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:14.723]  But I promise you, more importantly, that their program's not going well.
[02:36:14.723 --> 02:36:16.183]  Here's the problem.
[02:36:16.183 --> 02:36:17.724]  They don't give up.
[02:36:17.724 --> 02:36:20.306]  And so as it falls apart, they're going to double down.
[02:36:21.391 --> 02:36:23.792]  This is going to be extremely explosive.
[02:36:23.792 --> 02:36:30.315]  Do not kill anybody offensively, but guard yourself now for real.
[02:36:30.315 --> 02:36:30.795]  This is it.
[02:36:30.795 --> 02:36:37.398]  Because I mean, killing military and police, the globalists, that's their main target.
[02:36:37.398 --> 02:36:40.139]  They want to use them in an attack against us to knock them out.
[02:36:41.858 --> 02:36:46.402]  And it's the same way they get the companies to fire all their key employees to break the civilization down.
[02:36:46.402 --> 02:36:52.167]  This is globalist war by finance banks that are sitting back waiting for the collapse to then come in and take over.
[02:36:52.167 --> 02:37:02.155]  That's in the IMF World Bank documents that came out in 2002 where I told you the next plan is to implode our economies in the first world like they've already done in the third world because that was in the documents.
[02:37:02.155 --> 02:37:04.937]  And Greg Palast of the BBC got those secret documents and released them.
[02:37:06.681 --> 02:37:09.423]  What was the 100-point plan of the IMF and World Bank?
[02:37:09.423 --> 02:37:12.845]  We have the plans to the frickin' Death Star!
[02:37:12.845 --> 02:37:17.027]  We know how to beat them!
[02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:17.928]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:37:17.928 --> 02:37:25.853]  Unless you're worth $20 million and got an armored underground fortress in New Zealand, you're not protected from this.
[02:37:25.853 --> 02:37:29.035]  These are nihilists that want to commit suicide but want to take us with them.
[02:37:32.253 --> 02:37:35.595]  So people tell me, Jones, you've got courage taking them on.
[02:37:35.595 --> 02:37:36.996]  Courage?
[02:37:36.996 --> 02:37:38.456]  This is the opposite of courage.
[02:37:38.456 --> 02:37:44.199]  I am not a coward, but I don't want to die and have my children die.
[02:37:44.199 --> 02:37:45.060]  I don't want them to win.
[02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:46.681]  This is self-preservation.
[02:37:46.681 --> 02:37:52.864]  So it looks like I have all this courage to fight these people and I'm not worried about, we're all dead if they win.
[02:37:52.864 --> 02:37:56.746]  What are you talking about?
[02:37:56.746 --> 02:38:00.568]  There's been a few famous cases, movies made about it, documented cases, I forget the names.
[02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:22.381]  Where a pretty good sized ocean liner or ship turns over and there's a bunch of people stuck in it and it's sinking in the next few hours and somebody's got to swim 100 yards, 200 yards in the dark through a ship to get out, they hope through a bulkhead to then get to the surface and turn the pumps on and save the ship.
[02:38:22.381 --> 02:38:27.283]  But we saw a real example of that, was it Thailand or whatever when the cave came in and there was a big flood?
[02:38:31.786 --> 02:38:33.586]  And they sent the army divers in.
[02:38:33.586 --> 02:38:34.086]  Some died.
[02:38:34.086 --> 02:38:35.087]  Some of the kids died.
[02:38:35.087 --> 02:38:40.628]  They'd have to go in through, you know, a half mile through tiny openings to try to get children and bring them back out.
[02:38:40.628 --> 02:38:44.608]  But they did it.
[02:38:44.608 --> 02:38:55.791]  Those guys had courage because they didn't have to go into the flooded cave where the kids were on the school field trip and save them.
[02:38:55.791 --> 02:38:57.331]  But they did it because they were men.
[02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:02.523]  So, so I'm not the guys in the flooded cave.
[02:39:03.933 --> 02:39:05.654]  Going and doing that.
[02:39:05.654 --> 02:39:08.535]  I'm the child in the cave!
[02:39:08.535 --> 02:39:11.676]  Literally with a radio transmitter and everybody else saying, save us!
[02:39:11.676 --> 02:39:12.036]  Save us!
[02:39:12.036 --> 02:39:12.676]  We're under attack!
[02:39:12.676 --> 02:39:13.976]  God, the New World Order's really bad!
[02:39:13.976 --> 02:39:14.817]  They're really evil!
[02:39:14.817 --> 02:39:16.057]  We better do something right now!
[02:39:16.057 --> 02:39:17.318]  God, they want to kill everybody!
[02:39:17.318 --> 02:39:21.679]  I mean, I mean, like, oh Jones, you've really got courage to warn people!
[02:39:21.679 --> 02:39:32.463]  You're like, on the air, warning people about the New World Order, and man, you've got the Justice Department's coming after you, and you know, they're attacking you in the media, and you're being deposed of Sandy Hook, I mean, you know, my goodness, aren't you scared?
[02:39:34.977 --> 02:39:41.403]  That's like a fly landing on my shoulder while my house is burning down.
[02:39:41.403 --> 02:39:48.469]  I want you to get out of this mindset that you're doing this because you're a hero or you're doing this because you're something special.
[02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:55.716]  We are all children in the cave with the water raising about to die!
[02:39:55.716 --> 02:39:59.339]  And we gotta call on God to save us and then that's what's gonna happen.
[02:40:00.256 --> 02:40:03.017]  So no, I'm not the scuba divers that went and did that.
[02:40:03.017 --> 02:40:04.118]  I'm not them.
[02:40:04.118 --> 02:40:07.039]  I'm like the child in the cave with the water rising.
[02:40:07.039 --> 02:40:08.740]  And I'm at least saying, we need to get out of here.
[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:09.560]  This isn't good.
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:10.301]  This is a problem.
[02:40:10.301 --> 02:40:10.881]  Hold yourself!
[02:40:10.881 --> 02:40:12.502]  You've got some courage to say it!
[02:40:12.502 --> 02:40:15.223]  Because people can't admit they're under attack.
[02:40:17.776 --> 02:40:20.217]  I'm already in the last segment of the hour.
[02:40:20.217 --> 02:40:21.538]  Who knows if the phone system works?
[02:40:21.538 --> 02:40:23.418]  We're going to try right now.
[02:40:23.418 --> 02:40:25.979]  Clown Car, Rob, George, Kate.
[02:40:25.979 --> 02:40:27.980]  Let's go to Kate.
[02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:31.121]  Kate in FEMA Region 7.
[02:40:31.121 --> 02:40:33.622]  And if the lines don't work, we'll just won't do calls today.
[02:40:33.622 --> 02:40:34.543]  Kate, you're on the air.
[02:40:34.543 --> 02:40:36.444]  Go ahead, Katie.
[02:40:36.444 --> 02:40:44.767]  Hey Alex, you are spot on when you talk about critical thinking skills and they are lacking sorely and they have been replaced by learned helplessness.
[02:40:45.342 --> 02:40:47.063]  And I say learned helplessness.
[02:40:47.063 --> 02:40:48.463]  People have learned this.
[02:40:48.463 --> 02:40:49.243]  It's fake.
[02:40:49.243 --> 02:40:50.024]  It's not real.
[02:40:50.024 --> 02:40:51.424]  We are not helpless.
[02:40:51.424 --> 02:40:59.327]  And these totalitarian regime plans cannot be carried out unless they have minions to execute them.
[02:40:59.327 --> 02:41:08.890]  Those minions are nurses, doctors, pharmacists, who are sticking those needles in the arms of our family, our friends, our children, even babies right now.
[02:41:09.449 --> 02:41:11.470]  We need to expose them.
[02:41:11.470 --> 02:41:19.012]  We need to reach them on a human level before these jabs get taken over by robots, because I predict that's coming.
[02:41:19.012 --> 02:41:24.074]  Humans need to defend humanity, and we need to wake up humanity.
[02:41:24.074 --> 02:41:26.915]  And one of the ways we do it is to start thinking critically.
[02:41:26.915 --> 02:41:30.116]  I applaud you that you've got that training planned.
[02:41:30.116 --> 02:41:37.779]  We need to get out of this learned helplessness, and we need to fight back with our minds, because this is a war for our minds.
[02:41:37.779 --> 02:41:38.799]  It's on that level.
[02:41:39.378 --> 02:41:40.879]  It's mind control.
[02:41:40.879 --> 02:41:42.339]  Don't be controlled.
[02:41:42.339 --> 02:41:43.240]  Think critically.
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:44.080]  Think for yourself.
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:48.902]  Connect with God, first of all, because that will give you the real battle plan.
[02:41:48.902 --> 02:41:50.282]  We are on God's side.
[02:41:50.282 --> 02:41:52.703]  If God be for us, no one can be against us.
[02:41:52.703 --> 02:41:55.204]  And we need to be strong, courageous.
[02:41:55.204 --> 02:42:00.827]  We need to fight for our family, our friends, for all of humanity, and stand up and wake these minions up.
[02:42:00.827 --> 02:42:04.448]  CVS, Walgreens, all of these places that are complicit with this.
[02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:06.629]  They're making a killing, literally.
[02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:10.091]  Sticking this poison in our fellow humans.
[02:42:10.091 --> 02:42:11.772]  We need to put an end to that.
[02:42:11.772 --> 02:42:17.794]  We need to have civil disobedience, carry signs in front of those places, write to their leaders.
[02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:21.055]  I've been in the belly of the beast and I know how it works.
[02:42:21.055 --> 02:42:22.535]  And it's very ugly.
[02:42:22.535 --> 02:42:24.596]  It's a sordid industry.
[02:42:24.596 --> 02:42:27.757]  So we need to stand up to it and fight for humanity.
[02:42:27.757 --> 02:42:28.717]  Wow, that's amazing.
[02:42:28.717 --> 02:42:30.018]  How are you in the belly of the beast, Katie?
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:39.587]  I have been, for the past 10 years, an insider in the so-called healthcare industry, and it's anything but, Alex.
[02:42:39.587 --> 02:42:43.911]  I could tell you more than you could probably listen to in a week.
[02:42:43.911 --> 02:42:49.877]  Well, we're going to get your name off record, Katie, if you want to give it to us and have you on as like a guest during a podcast, because I want to hear from you.
[02:42:49.877 --> 02:42:50.517]  But stay there.
[02:42:50.517 --> 02:42:51.098]  Don't hang up.
[02:42:51.098 --> 02:42:52.239]  A few more minutes on the other side.
[02:42:52.239 --> 02:42:53.500]  I want to hear more from you and then more calls.
[02:42:55.250 --> 02:42:56.611]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:42:56.611 --> 02:43:06.055]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[02:43:06.055 --> 02:43:17.841]  So, right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning, and it's only going to run until the end of the month, and that's now only six, seven days.
[02:43:17.841 --> 02:43:21.803]  Infowar Store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[02:43:22.623 --> 02:43:24.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[02:43:24.224 --> 02:43:25.444]  It's our bestseller.
[02:43:25.444 --> 02:43:27.165]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:43:27.165 --> 02:43:33.288]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the key amino acids, everything you need for your immune system and your body.
[02:43:33.288 --> 02:43:34.668]  And it tastes great.
[02:43:34.668 --> 02:43:36.489]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[02:43:36.489 --> 02:43:41.411]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double Patreon points.
[02:43:41.411 --> 02:43:44.052]  And so much more at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:43:44.052 --> 02:43:47.613]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[02:43:48.854 --> 02:43:52.340]  Bet on freedom, bet on InfoWars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:56.046]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:43:59.212 --> 02:44:01.294]  Your voice counts.
[02:44:01.294 --> 02:44:06.357]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[02:44:06.357 --> 02:44:08.939]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[02:44:08.939 --> 02:44:10.441]  They know you're angry.
[02:44:10.441 --> 02:44:15.304]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[02:44:15.304 --> 02:44:26.453]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds, both the regular shows, the special reports, and share them with everyone you know.

[02:44:38.816 --> 02:44:45.917]  Or, text the word SHOW to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[02:44:45.917 --> 02:44:50.398]  Take action now, create the chain reaction, and tell others to share those texts.
[02:44:50.398 --> 02:44:51.298]  Get news alerts at 833-470-0438.
[02:44:58.148 --> 02:45:02.529]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[02:45:02.529 --> 02:45:10.831]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[02:45:10.831 --> 02:45:14.372]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[02:45:14.372 --> 02:45:17.873]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors.
[02:45:19.173 --> 02:45:23.755]  For the next 15 days, to flatten the curve.
[02:45:23.755 --> 02:45:31.659]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[02:45:31.659 --> 02:45:42.085]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[02:45:42.085 --> 02:45:44.086]  You will then be my slaves.
[02:45:45.592 --> 02:45:49.774]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[02:45:49.774 --> 02:45:56.578]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:45:56.578 --> 02:46:01.421]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the Globalist.
[02:46:01.421 --> 02:46:03.482]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:46:03.482 --> 02:46:08.965]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:46:08.965 --> 02:46:10.065]  But we failed.
[02:46:10.065 --> 02:46:11.726]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:46:11.726 --> 02:46:13.227]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:46:13.567 --> 02:46:19.590]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:28.513]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:46:28.513 --> 02:46:33.956]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:46:33.956 --> 02:46:36.597]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[02:46:36.597 --> 02:46:39.438]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[02:46:39.858 --> 02:46:40.458]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:47:18.127 --> 02:47:20.208]  In constant sorrow.
[02:47:20.208 --> 02:47:25.349]  All right, Kate, medical whistleblower, FEMA Region 7.
[02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:26.869]  We want to get you on as a guest sometime.
[02:47:26.869 --> 02:47:29.750]  You're a really well-spoken lady.
[02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:33.911]  Give us a few more minutes of data that people should know.
[02:47:33.911 --> 02:47:34.631]  Sure, Alex.
[02:47:34.631 --> 02:47:43.454]  Well, these globalist controlled insurance companies, health care insurance companies, so-called, are all about money.
[02:47:43.454 --> 02:47:44.294]  They're about power.
[02:47:45.183 --> 02:47:58.673]  You can look on the CMS website right now, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and get some idea of what measures are being tracked by these insurance companies.
[02:47:58.673 --> 02:48:00.615]  Many of them relate to vaccinations.
[02:48:00.615 --> 02:48:10.703]  There was just a bulletin put out today on counseling children for COVID vaccination and incentivizing financially these companies to do this.
[02:48:10.703 --> 02:48:14.906]  This is absolutely a demonic industry.
[02:48:16.412 --> 02:48:28.091]  I am very proud to say I took a stand and have lost my position recently with one of them and I would do it all over again, but I know a lot of things that I would like to share.
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:31.901]  That would probably curl most people's hair.
[02:48:31.901 --> 02:48:36.282]  Well, hey, if you want to get in touch with Robert Kennedy Jr., I can get you in touch with him.
[02:48:36.282 --> 02:48:41.824]  And I'm helping folks follow suit with the whistleblower tomorrow.
[02:48:41.824 --> 02:48:43.405]  So, absolutely.
[02:48:43.405 --> 02:48:45.665]  Listen, I'd love to get you on as a guest.
[02:48:45.665 --> 02:48:48.806]  I don't want to say your name or anything, but that's just par for the course.
[02:48:48.806 --> 02:48:53.488]  But we need to get more amazing people like you to stand up and tell the truth, and this system will go down.
[02:48:54.944 --> 02:48:58.826]  Absolutely, we have to tell the truth and God will take care of us, Alex.
[02:48:58.826 --> 02:49:00.247]  I'm not worried about it.
[02:49:00.247 --> 02:49:03.988]  I had family and friends telling me, oh, you need to be careful.
[02:49:03.988 --> 02:49:05.029]  You're going to lose your job.
[02:49:05.029 --> 02:49:06.409]  What's going to happen to you?
[02:49:06.409 --> 02:49:07.710]  I said, God's in control.
[02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:08.751]  I'm doing the right thing.
[02:49:08.751 --> 02:49:10.631]  If you do the right thing, God takes care of you.
[02:49:10.631 --> 02:49:13.193]  That's been proven throughout my life many times.
[02:49:13.193 --> 02:49:22.697]  Well, Katie, I totally agree, but I mean, now going after five-year-olds and now babies next month or in a month and a half, I mean, this is so obvious.
[02:49:22.697 --> 02:49:24.418]  I mean, this is not even hard now.
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:32.163]  No, it's a concerted effort to kill the human race.
[02:49:32.163 --> 02:49:41.087]  And I guarantee you, this is my prediction, I haven't seen it anywhere else, but you've heard it here first then, the robots will be the ones to inject us going forward.
[02:49:41.087 --> 02:49:51.271]  Or Bill Gates has this nice little auto-immunization system where you just stick a snake-like tooth set up into your skin.
[02:49:51.271 --> 02:49:52.651]  You know, you can vaccinate yourself.
[02:49:52.651 --> 02:49:53.812]  That's been talked about before.
[02:49:54.614 --> 02:49:55.955]  All of this is coming.
[02:49:55.955 --> 02:50:01.881]  If people don't wake up and learn to think critically, and I think your program is going to be great to help them with that.
[02:50:01.881 --> 02:50:07.667]  If they don't get that information and they just continue in this state of learned helplessness where they do whatever they're told,
[02:50:08.246 --> 02:50:10.027]  Then they're going to be injecting themselves.
[02:50:10.027 --> 02:50:11.628]  They're going to stick out their arms for robots.
[02:50:11.628 --> 02:50:15.410]  They're going to stick their hands in a machine and let it stick a needle in them or a chip.
[02:50:15.410 --> 02:50:26.816]  Remember Walmart tried to roll out with those robots that would give you a diagnostic and just like the whole system that came out with the blood testing that was a fraud, it was a fraud as well.
[02:50:26.816 --> 02:50:28.017]  Beautifully said.
[02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:31.899]  Kate, if you want to talk to us, Katie, give us your name and number because I'm going to be starting.
[02:50:33.533 --> 02:50:44.289]  In the New Year, three nights a week, a three-hour show, commercial-free, just for listeners to call in and special guests.
[02:50:44.289 --> 02:50:47.434]  And so, and people are like, God, that's a lot, Jones.
[02:50:47.434 --> 02:50:47.835]  I gotta do it.
[02:50:49.537 --> 02:50:52.700]  And we don't do the podcast thing because we're on a bunch of radio stations.
[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:56.585]  We do the radio format that has 14 minutes of ads an hour, which is fine.
[02:50:56.585 --> 02:50:57.926]  That's a standard deal.
[02:50:57.926 --> 02:51:03.131]  But it's going to be three hours and we play a video report or something as the break.
[02:51:03.131 --> 02:51:04.012]  There's not going to be breaks.
[02:51:05.072 --> 02:51:09.873]  And there's so much more behind it, I can't tell you about it yet.
[02:51:09.873 --> 02:51:14.494]  But just let me tell you, our best work is happening now, and it's the Holy Spirit doing it all.
[02:51:14.494 --> 02:51:19.235]  And I'm working with really great people, with a real social network.
[02:51:19.235 --> 02:51:21.875]  You know, Trump can't launch one, he doesn't know how.
[02:51:21.875 --> 02:51:23.616]  This is beyond a social network.
[02:51:23.616 --> 02:51:26.196]  This is everything that all the systems have in one.
[02:51:26.196 --> 02:51:33.618]  And you'll see what I do is new, and then it's just one part of it, and then it explodes.
[02:51:34.318 --> 02:51:37.299]  It's like a bomb, a peaceful type of bomb.
[02:51:37.299 --> 02:51:41.480]  But I mean, I can tell you, you think we've delivered so far?
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:42.921]  It's all God gets the glory.
[02:51:42.921 --> 02:51:47.802]  You think Alex Jones has kicked some globalist ass?
[02:51:47.802 --> 02:51:49.783]  No.
[02:51:49.783 --> 02:51:55.444]  Next year, ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you in 2022 is the year of Alex Jones.
[02:51:55.444 --> 02:51:58.205]  I intend to peak next year.
[02:51:58.205 --> 02:52:00.306]  I intend to throw everything I've got at him.
[02:52:01.584 --> 02:52:05.425]  I mean, on my knees every day praying, I'm like a kamikaze.
[02:52:05.425 --> 02:52:06.786]  So, next year.
[02:52:06.786 --> 02:52:08.026]  Next year's the big year.
[02:52:08.026 --> 02:52:08.506]  Watch.
[02:52:08.506 --> 02:52:09.627]  Watch.
[02:52:09.627 --> 02:52:11.527]  This is the year, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:11.527 --> 02:52:16.529]  My full will, everything I got, powered by Jesus, just right into them.
[02:52:16.529 --> 02:52:17.729]  Next year.
[02:52:17.729 --> 02:52:18.950]  Everything I got, next year.
[02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:19.650]  I'm pouring it out.
[02:52:20.401 --> 02:52:21.862]  Just getting ready right now.
[02:52:21.862 --> 02:52:27.907]  I'm going to give you every ounce of my will, every ounce of my guts, every ounce I got for the children.
[02:52:27.907 --> 02:52:29.388]  Because there are going to be a lot of kids dying.
[02:52:29.388 --> 02:52:30.729]  They're already dying.
[02:52:30.729 --> 02:52:33.031]  So we got to do this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:33.031 --> 02:52:34.052]  We got to do this now.
[02:52:34.052 --> 02:52:40.456]  We're going to do it together.
[02:52:40.456 --> 02:52:41.918]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls here.
[02:52:41.918 --> 02:52:44.079]  I don't even know who to go to next.
[02:52:44.079 --> 02:52:44.920]  My God, there's so many.
[02:52:46.189 --> 02:52:46.669]  Let's go.
[02:52:46.669 --> 02:52:47.710]  We already tried him earlier.
[02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:49.971]  We'll see if Kyle this time is there.
[02:52:49.971 --> 02:52:51.532]  Kyle in FEMA Region 10.
[02:52:51.532 --> 02:52:52.072]  You're on the air.
[02:52:52.072 --> 02:52:54.193]  Go ahead.
[02:52:54.193 --> 02:52:55.613]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:52:55.613 --> 02:52:56.714]  Sorry, I missed you last time.
[02:52:56.714 --> 02:52:57.274]  It's my pleasure.
[02:52:57.274 --> 02:52:58.275]  Whatever it is, I love you.
[02:52:58.275 --> 02:52:59.395]  Go ahead.
[02:52:59.395 --> 02:53:01.696]  I'm used to going by Bone Crusher.
[02:53:01.696 --> 02:53:09.120]  So, up here in Washington State, FEMA Region 10, we had this sign up that the Health Department was putting up, the State Department.
[02:53:09.756 --> 02:53:11.376]  The Nazis had a red armband with a swastika.
[02:53:11.376 --> 02:53:12.597]  The new Nazis have the face mask.
[02:53:36.311 --> 02:53:38.092]  Yep, I don't wear them anywhere I go.
[02:53:38.092 --> 02:53:41.553]  I walk in there, I went to go get my tabs the other day from my car, and walked into the office.
[02:53:41.553 --> 02:53:42.613]  Everybody's standing in there.
[02:53:42.613 --> 02:53:46.674]  It's packed full like sardines, and they all are wearing masks.
[02:53:46.674 --> 02:53:48.295]  And I just walked out.
[02:53:48.295 --> 02:53:49.255]  I just left.
[02:53:49.255 --> 02:53:53.796]  And I just went back there later in the day, because it's just... You gotta just bullhorn them.
[02:53:53.796 --> 02:53:54.756]  They're slaves, man.
[02:53:54.756 --> 02:53:58.318]  These are people in Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:53:58.318 --> 02:54:00.658]  Because in a normal tribe, your tribe is good.
[02:54:00.658 --> 02:54:01.598]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:54:01.598 --> 02:54:03.039]  Drugs even says, masked forever.
[02:54:04.232 --> 02:54:05.052]  No, it's crazy.
[02:54:05.052 --> 02:54:11.614]  And then, so, have you seen that they got the new variant now, it's the Omicron, or whatever they got?
[02:54:11.614 --> 02:54:14.034]  And the one before that was the Mu.
[02:54:14.034 --> 02:54:16.495]  Well, they skipped Nu and Qi.
[02:54:16.495 --> 02:54:19.616]  They skipped Qi, just because of Qi and China.
[02:54:19.616 --> 02:54:24.457]  No, they said Xi Jinping, so they got a new, it's all made up, exactly.
[02:54:24.457 --> 02:54:26.278]  It's just, yeah, it's crazy.
[02:54:26.278 --> 02:54:28.358]  I mean, they're releasing real bioweapons.
[02:54:28.358 --> 02:54:31.739]  There's real stuff going on, but yeah, whatever they're officially telling you is pure crap.
[02:54:32.816 --> 02:54:35.279]  Well, yeah, they're appeasing China.
[02:54:35.279 --> 02:54:39.723]  They skipped the Xi variant just because they didn't want to offend China.
[02:54:39.723 --> 02:54:40.804]  The Xi variant?
[02:54:40.804 --> 02:54:43.067]  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, brother.
[02:54:43.067 --> 02:54:44.008]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:54:44.008 --> 02:54:48.532]  And so then I also just wanted to just plug some products.
[02:54:48.532 --> 02:54:50.554]  You guys got great coffee, Patriot Blend.
[02:54:50.554 --> 02:54:51.876]  I'm always drinking that every morning.
[02:54:53.105 --> 02:54:55.146]  Um, I'm using super male vitality.
[02:54:55.146 --> 02:55:05.691]  Let me just tell you that that stuff works and I had to get some super female vitality for my girlfriend to keep up because it's, yeah, that stuff works.
[02:55:05.691 --> 02:55:06.392]  That's all I'm going to say.
[02:55:06.392 --> 02:55:08.293]  We'll just leave it at that.
[02:55:08.293 --> 02:55:11.014]  And, uh, took some knockout last night.
[02:55:11.014 --> 02:55:12.875]  Some of the best sleep I've had.
[02:55:12.875 --> 02:55:14.996]  I've been working my butt off the past few days.
[02:55:15.985 --> 02:55:18.367]  And your stuff works, man.
[02:55:18.367 --> 02:55:19.228]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:55:19.228 --> 02:55:20.108]  Yeah, it works.
[02:55:20.108 --> 02:55:20.749]  That's all I can say.
[02:55:40.143 --> 02:55:41.584]  Alex, you're the best, man.
[02:55:41.584 --> 02:55:42.545]  You're the best.
[02:55:42.545 --> 02:55:46.788]  And thank you for giving time to your listeners to call in.
[02:55:46.788 --> 02:55:52.792]  So forgive me for speaking out loud here as you're speaking and as I'm listening.
[02:55:52.792 --> 02:55:55.715]  I really think that the solution is from the inside out.
[02:55:55.715 --> 02:56:05.202]  The people who are the last 30% of the unvaxxed hospital workers have to turn, put their hands up and stop the injection sites.
[02:56:05.202 --> 02:56:08.404]  If you go to Austere Scholar on Rumble, you'll see where I've been.
[02:56:09.031 --> 02:56:09.511]  In New York.
[02:56:23.184 --> 02:56:26.505]  Uh, we're so overpowered by the police, which is another story I'll get to.
[02:56:26.505 --> 02:56:32.348]  I mean, they put 25 cops on the street, opened a paddy wagon, and there was 12 of us inside.
[02:56:32.348 --> 02:56:37.149]  And it was the most peaceful... Yeah, there's the police, who themselves don't want to take the shot.
[02:56:37.149 --> 02:56:43.192]  They're to enforce on you and stop you doing a sit-in, that you don't want some GMO garbage from Pfizer in your body.
[02:56:43.192 --> 02:56:45.132]  And that's their final revolution.
[02:56:45.132 --> 02:56:46.633]  Total control over our bodies.
[02:56:46.633 --> 02:56:47.733]  It's here.
[02:56:47.733 --> 02:56:50.334]  But I gotta tell you, man, we do a lot of protests.
[02:56:50.334 --> 02:56:52.135]  There's stuff going on every two, three days.
[02:56:52.728 --> 02:56:55.790]  Sometimes they're big, sometimes they're lame, or they're always being ignored.
[02:56:55.790 --> 02:56:59.233]  What matters is you're with other humans fighting back, and that's beautiful.
[02:56:59.233 --> 02:57:01.054]  We're showing some footage.
[02:57:01.054 --> 02:57:02.596]  Are you an Austri scholar?
[02:57:02.596 --> 02:57:05.198]  Austere scholar, yeah.
[02:57:05.198 --> 02:57:06.418]  Austere scholar.
[02:57:06.418 --> 02:57:07.639]  There it is on screen, brother.
[02:57:07.639 --> 02:57:12.243]  Austere scholar if you're a New Yorker.
[02:57:12.243 --> 02:57:13.224]  What does that mean?
[02:57:13.224 --> 02:57:14.725]  Is it austere or austrate?
[02:57:14.725 --> 02:57:16.106]  What's it mean?
[02:57:16.106 --> 02:57:18.087]  Remember when Soleimani was killed?
[02:57:19.164 --> 02:57:20.764]  The headlines were austere scholars.
[02:57:20.764 --> 02:57:21.645]  No, I said austere.
[02:57:21.645 --> 02:57:22.605]  That's what I thought it read.
[02:57:22.605 --> 02:57:23.725]  Yeah, austere.
[02:57:23.725 --> 02:57:24.205]  Holy cow.
[02:57:24.205 --> 02:57:26.226]  All right, I'm watching this, man.
[02:57:26.226 --> 02:57:27.226]  So it was lame.
[02:57:27.226 --> 02:57:28.227]  See the guy with the blue shirt?
[02:57:28.227 --> 02:57:30.447]  Man, he was, it was just like, he was peaceful.
[02:57:30.447 --> 02:57:31.327]  He did the right thing.
[02:57:31.327 --> 02:57:34.928]  And I even, this video will even show, I had a little... No, beautiful.
[02:57:34.928 --> 02:57:38.109]  What they're doing in Germany and New York and everywhere is total tyranny.
[02:57:38.109 --> 02:57:38.990]  People gotta resist.
[02:57:38.990 --> 02:57:39.810]  You're on our side.
[02:57:39.810 --> 02:57:40.390]  God bless you.
[02:57:40.390 --> 02:57:41.310]  Incredible job.
[02:57:41.310 --> 02:57:42.591]  We'll be back with our number four.
[02:57:42.591 --> 02:57:43.091]  More calls.
[02:57:43.091 --> 02:57:43.471]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.031 --> 02:57:47.953]  For a fraction of... Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:57:47.953 --> 02:57:49.975]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[02:57:49.975 --> 02:57:50.395]  Welcome.
[02:57:50.395 --> 02:57:51.116]  Hello, Alex?
[02:57:51.116 --> 02:57:51.736]  Yes, Malcolm.
[02:57:51.736 --> 02:57:56.240]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:00.583]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[02:58:00.583 --> 02:58:03.586]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[02:58:03.586 --> 02:58:06.168]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[02:58:06.448 --> 02:58:08.269]  Supermill Vitality really, really works.
[02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:19.933]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up, and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[02:58:19.933 --> 02:58:21.773]  This is like a very fine wine.
[02:58:21.773 --> 02:58:23.914]  In fact, each batch is different.
[02:58:23.914 --> 02:58:26.235]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[02:58:26.235 --> 02:58:29.556]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[02:58:29.616 --> 02:58:30.557]  That's just how it is.
[02:58:30.557 --> 02:58:32.218]  It's how it works.
[02:58:32.218 --> 02:58:33.859]  So, it's always good.
[02:58:33.859 --> 02:58:35.961]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[02:58:35.961 --> 02:58:39.804]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[02:58:46.317 --> 02:58:51.161]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[02:58:51.161 --> 02:58:53.223]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[02:58:53.223 --> 02:58:58.687]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[02:58:58.687 --> 02:58:59.828]  But we failed.
[02:58:59.828 --> 02:59:01.470]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[02:59:01.470 --> 02:59:02.971]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat-footed.
[02:59:03.311 --> 02:59:09.333]  But they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization Great Reset.
[02:59:09.333 --> 02:59:18.256]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[02:59:18.256 --> 02:59:21.537]  So we've got to information warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda.
[02:59:21.537 --> 02:59:23.778]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[02:59:23.778 --> 02:59:26.339]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storable food.
[02:59:26.339 --> 02:59:29.180]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices.
[02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:31.841]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:12.657 --> 03:00:14.579]  I see you again.
[03:00:14.579 --> 03:00:23.707]  Alright, I want to go to Jason, and then Ian, and then Clown Car, and the order these calls are received.
[03:00:23.707 --> 03:00:24.949]  George and others are going to your calls.
[03:00:25.865 --> 03:00:27.826]  Let's go to Jason in Texas.
[03:00:27.826 --> 03:00:30.788]  He asks, when will the next phase kick off?
[03:00:30.788 --> 03:00:32.869]  Specifically, the globalist takeover?
[03:00:32.869 --> 03:00:34.449]  I think we're in the next phase right now.
[03:00:34.449 --> 03:00:36.270]  What do you think?
[03:00:36.270 --> 03:00:37.511]  Of course, I agree with you.
[03:00:37.511 --> 03:00:41.273]  I've been listening to you for about 17 years, called you multiple times.
[03:00:41.273 --> 03:00:45.315]  We're usually right about everything we talk about.
[03:00:45.315 --> 03:00:51.438]  Remember when the reporter asked Joe Biden when, you know, what are you going to do about the people who refuse the vaccine?
[03:00:51.438 --> 03:00:53.119]  He said, oh, we'll deal with them.
[03:00:53.723 --> 03:00:55.165]  So what does that mean?
[03:00:55.165 --> 03:00:56.646]  Where is he going with that?
[03:00:56.646 --> 03:00:58.167]  Lockdowns, absolutely.
[03:00:58.167 --> 03:01:01.070]  The globalists run the plan.
[03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:04.934]  So whatever you see in Germany or Australia or the UK, that's coming here next.
[03:01:04.934 --> 03:01:06.296]  Canada, the same deal.
[03:01:06.296 --> 03:01:07.617]  Everything you see is what they want.
[03:01:07.617 --> 03:01:10.460]  They just know Americans have such a history.
[03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:14.023]  I wanted to say this at the start of the show today and I forgot to say it.
[03:01:14.023 --> 03:01:15.605]  Everybody bashes America all day.
[03:01:17.199 --> 03:01:18.820]  And says, oh, we're not that free of a country.
[03:01:18.820 --> 03:01:19.540]  And I agree.
[03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:22.881]  We're the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[03:01:22.881 --> 03:01:27.844]  But now you're seeing how good America is and how good conservative Christian states are.
[03:01:27.844 --> 03:01:36.487]  Because we're some of the only countries and only areas in the world, because states are countries, we're a confederation of countries, that have any freedom, brother.
[03:01:36.487 --> 03:01:37.908]  Go ahead.
[03:01:37.908 --> 03:01:42.810]  And then like in Australia, how they're, you know, locking the people up and putting them in these camps.
[03:01:43.334 --> 03:01:46.258]  Where do you think, here, will they start doing that?
[03:01:46.258 --> 03:01:49.663]  Will they start using, like, football stadiums or all the closed Walmarts?
[03:01:49.663 --> 03:01:55.111]  Yeah, they're gonna do it in blue cities and blue states by collapsing the economy by firing all the uninjected.
[03:01:56.516 --> 03:01:56.756]  Exactly.
[03:01:56.756 --> 03:01:58.197]  Well, the good news is that
[03:02:24.392 --> 03:02:27.294]  Liberal, Nazi, slob teacher.
[03:02:27.294 --> 03:02:31.017]  She'll be dead soon from all her poison shots and boosters and all that.
[03:02:31.017 --> 03:02:35.279]  And the only place she'll be teaching is in hell.
[03:02:35.279 --> 03:02:35.920]  I agree, brother.
[03:02:35.920 --> 03:02:38.742]  I mean, we have Aborigines in Australia doing SOSs.
[03:02:38.742 --> 03:02:40.723]  They're taking them to camps.
[03:02:40.723 --> 03:02:48.488]  This is all a cover for evil activity with evil globalists giving orders to police and military to see if they follow the orders.
[03:02:48.488 --> 03:02:52.091]  We have to be moral and say this is wrong and say no.
[03:02:52.091 --> 03:02:52.391]  That's it.
[03:02:54.156 --> 03:02:55.376]  Damn right.
[03:02:55.376 --> 03:02:57.197]  God bless you, brother.
[03:02:57.197 --> 03:03:06.620]  I mean, what's crazy is because of America's Republic and because of the Second Amendment and the First Amendment, we're still barely hanging on.
[03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:08.381]  But I don't know how long.
[03:03:08.381 --> 03:03:14.303]  So we're just hanging on as long as we can, folks, to tell the truth and be a testament to the world.
[03:03:14.303 --> 03:03:19.385]  That's why every article, every video, everything we put out is so precious.
[03:03:19.385 --> 03:03:22.006]  Download it, save it, share it, edit it, cut it up.
[03:03:22.546 --> 03:03:24.208]  I don't care how you do it or what you do.
[03:03:24.208 --> 03:03:25.909]  You make your own decision.
[03:03:25.909 --> 03:03:31.815]  Magnify, amplify this broadcast and other broadcasts that tell the truth.
[03:03:31.815 --> 03:03:33.797]  And then do your own broadcast.
[03:03:33.797 --> 03:03:35.158]  Don't make excuses.
[03:03:35.158 --> 03:03:35.899]  Go on YouTube.
[03:03:35.899 --> 03:03:36.780]  Go on Twitter.
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:37.500]  Go on Facebook.
[03:03:37.500 --> 03:03:38.862]  They're enemy platforms.
[03:03:38.862 --> 03:03:40.963]  Operate until you get banned.
[03:03:40.963 --> 03:03:42.505]  And go magnify others.
[03:03:42.505 --> 03:03:44.167]  We need leadership.
[03:03:45.177 --> 03:03:48.360]  And leadership is not people that want power like these politicians.
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:57.128]  It's people that see a need, that step up in that time and place to help humanity.
[03:03:57.128 --> 03:04:00.931]  And so now, it's just an incredible time to be alive.
[03:04:00.931 --> 03:04:06.516]  All right, Ian, Jay, R., George, and Clown Car.
[03:04:06.516 --> 03:04:10.020]  Four calls, 10-minute segment, coming up.
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:11.241]  We'll go to break, we'll go to you.
[03:04:12.722 --> 03:04:14.825]  You're going to look back on this if you survive this.
[03:04:14.825 --> 03:04:16.447]  And a lot of us aren't going to survive it.
[03:04:16.447 --> 03:04:17.689]  Just get ready for death.
[03:04:17.689 --> 03:04:19.051]  And I don't say that to act dramatic.
[03:04:19.051 --> 03:04:23.737]  I mean, this is just... They just started.
[03:04:23.737 --> 03:04:25.320]  Those of you that survive this...
[03:04:27.526 --> 03:04:34.512]  Are going to look back on this and go, my God, I can't believe I was alive and involved in such a historic time.
[03:04:34.512 --> 03:04:37.434]  I mean, this is just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse.
[03:04:37.434 --> 03:04:42.918]  This is going to normalize piles of dead bodies or normalized wars or normalized power outages, everything.
[03:04:42.918 --> 03:04:44.920]  I mean, this is the end of civilization.
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:45.921]  This is the mass culling.
[03:04:45.921 --> 03:04:47.722]  This is this is agenda 2030.
[03:04:47.722 --> 03:04:50.244]  This is the new world order.
[03:04:50.244 --> 03:04:52.306]  We didn't do it, but we're going to fight back against it.
[03:04:55.313 --> 03:04:57.315]  Info Wars, get prepared.
[03:04:57.315 --> 03:05:00.177]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[03:05:00.177 --> 03:05:14.167]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[03:05:14.167 --> 03:05:18.090]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:27.478]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[03:05:27.478 --> 03:05:30.220]  That's why everybody should visit InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:30.220 --> 03:05:35.065]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made-in-America products.
[03:05:35.345 --> 03:05:35.625]  Thank you.
[03:06:11.476 --> 03:06:22.340]  Mr. Fauci, as you advise the President about the possibility of new testing requirements for people coming into this country, does that include everybody?
[03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:37.066]  The answer is yes, because you know that the new regulation, if you want to call it that, is that anybody and everybody who's coming into the country needs to get a test within 24 hours of getting on the plane to come here.
[03:06:37.346 --> 03:06:42.408]  What about people who don't take a plane and just these border crossers coming in in huge numbers?
[03:06:42.408 --> 03:06:43.408]  That's a different issue.
[03:06:43.408 --> 03:06:47.569]  For example, when you talk, we still have Title 42 with regard to protection at the border.
[03:06:47.569 --> 03:06:55.812]  So there are protections at the border that you don't have the capability, as you know, of somebody getting on a plane, getting checked, looking at a passport.
[03:06:55.812 --> 03:06:57.072]  We don't have that there.
[03:06:57.072 --> 03:06:59.033]  But we can get some degree of mitigation.
[03:07:03.174 --> 03:07:07.556]  All the students about to come to campus today to do online studies.
[03:07:07.556 --> 03:07:08.697]  Let's go!
[03:07:08.697 --> 03:07:15.500]  So you guys are students here at, where are we at?
[03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:15.740]  DCTC?
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:17.521]  Dakota County Technical College.
[03:07:17.521 --> 03:07:23.264]  They didn't get told they couldn't attend today until 3.30 this morning they got an email.
[03:07:23.264 --> 03:07:31.228]  So they also said that some of their friends were here and there were buses of students coming from the cities that are all paid actors.
[03:07:31.768 --> 03:07:34.629]  And a few actual students were allowed in here.
[03:07:34.629 --> 03:07:37.250]  It's just so typical of the Biden administration.
[03:07:37.250 --> 03:07:39.070]  We got fake students.
[03:07:39.070 --> 03:07:40.590]  We got a fake president.
[03:07:40.590 --> 03:07:42.951]  We got a fake White House TV set.
[03:07:42.951 --> 03:07:45.972]  And the real people, they're locked out.
[03:07:45.972 --> 03:07:46.872]  Wow!
[03:07:46.872 --> 03:07:48.553]  Freaking wow!
[03:07:48.553 --> 03:07:49.433]  Wow!
[03:07:50.673 --> 03:07:54.276]  So, you guys were told not to go to school today, is that correct?
[03:07:54.276 --> 03:07:54.776]  Yes.
[03:07:54.776 --> 03:07:56.837]  We cannot, we're not allowed on campus today.
[03:07:56.837 --> 03:08:02.381]  There's going to be strict security due to Joe Biden's visit, and that we'll have an assignment digitally.
[03:08:02.381 --> 03:08:05.282]  We didn't hear about this until about 3 a.m.
[03:08:05.282 --> 03:08:05.643]  3 a.m.
[03:08:05.643 --> 03:08:05.983]  today?
[03:08:05.983 --> 03:08:07.004]  Yeah.
[03:08:07.004 --> 03:08:08.705]  And it's November 30th, 2021.
[03:08:08.705 --> 03:08:14.568]  People that they brought in fake students that do not go to DCCC that are paid to pretend like they have students here.
[03:08:14.568 --> 03:08:18.030]  Because obviously they're not letting any students in today, right?
[03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.111]  Yeah.
[03:08:19.011 --> 03:08:20.832]  That is unbelievable.
[03:08:20.832 --> 03:08:25.695]  This was one of the most conservative schools in the state, and then you let it go.
[03:08:25.695 --> 03:08:26.195]  I see.
[03:08:26.195 --> 03:08:28.057]  So they don't want all the commotion.
[03:08:28.057 --> 03:08:32.419]  They want to show the narrative that they want to show for what he's sitting on.
[03:08:32.419 --> 03:08:33.260]  Very interesting.
[03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:34.400]  Thank you guys so much.
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:40.764]  Stand up and fight and take this country back!
[03:08:40.764 --> 03:08:46.248]  They don't even deny that they shut down colleges when he comes, and they just bring actors there.
[03:08:47.168 --> 03:08:50.309]  And then he goes on TV yesterday and says, I don't read the bills.
[03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:52.770]  I don't even want to know what this is.
[03:08:52.770 --> 03:08:54.331]  I just sign whatever they say.
[03:08:54.331 --> 03:09:02.493]  That's the part about having a senile person in there because the globalists can blame him later once he has dementia so bad he can't even wipe his own ass.
[03:09:02.493 --> 03:09:05.774]  Here's a clip of him talking about it.
[03:09:05.774 --> 03:09:11.096]  All right.
[03:09:11.096 --> 03:09:12.457]  Here we go.
[03:09:12.457 --> 03:09:12.937]  Mental.
[03:09:12.937 --> 03:09:15.298]  Well, I'm not going to read it all.
[03:09:15.298 --> 03:09:15.818]  Just sign it.
[03:09:23.442 --> 03:09:26.264]  Well, over to the globalists to do whatever they say.
[03:09:26.264 --> 03:09:28.326]  Ian in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[03:09:28.326 --> 03:09:29.347]  Welcome.
[03:09:29.347 --> 03:09:30.408]  Hello?
[03:09:30.408 --> 03:09:31.168]  Yes, Ian, welcome.
[03:09:31.168 --> 03:09:32.129]  Can you hear me?
[03:09:32.129 --> 03:09:33.770]  I can hear you, Ian.
[03:09:33.770 --> 03:09:34.671]  What's up, Alex?
[03:09:34.671 --> 03:09:36.893]  I just actually left my job.
[03:09:36.893 --> 03:09:41.697]  I love when I have to leave my job because they just nag at me all day.
[03:09:41.697 --> 03:09:43.078]  Oh, put your mask on.
[03:09:43.078 --> 03:09:44.359]  When are you getting vaccinated?
[03:09:44.359 --> 03:09:48.402]  My last day is the 14th because I didn't turn in a religious exemption.
[03:09:48.402 --> 03:09:50.464]  I'm not getting vaccinated.
[03:09:50.464 --> 03:09:52.205]  And I just want to ask you, have you ever heard of the 100th
[03:09:54.996 --> 03:09:56.698]  I have heard of the 100th monkey effect.
[03:09:56.698 --> 03:10:00.841]  It just happened with Elon Musk when he went on Joe Rogan years ago.
[03:10:00.841 --> 03:10:06.466]  He basically, two months after I said it, repeated it, but said more about the interdimensional stuff.
[03:10:06.466 --> 03:10:14.393]  And then he just came out and said, we've got to remove the false software they placed on our minds and connect to the universe that God gave us.
[03:10:14.393 --> 03:10:16.275]  And that's exactly what's in Reset Wars.
[03:10:16.275 --> 03:10:18.097]  So that's the 100th monkey effect.
[03:10:18.097 --> 03:10:20.419]  Why don't you tell people about the 100th monkey effect?
[03:10:21.698 --> 03:10:27.400]  Well, I think that we're going to see something like that kind of coming up soon.
[03:10:27.400 --> 03:10:39.225]  I just think about all these, I mean, I was just listening to the ad that came on before of the people getting interviewed or whatever they're talking about, how there was no students there, all paid actors.
[03:10:39.225 --> 03:10:46.788]  And just every little thing that happens like that, even if it's just 10 or 20 people who get a whiff of like, something's not right here.
[03:10:47.307 --> 03:10:49.188]  You know what I mean?
[03:10:49.188 --> 03:11:04.078]  I totally agree and that's why they're suing me all over is they don't want anybody questioning public events like Jesse Smollett or so many others because so many times they've got hired actors and provocateurs there and that's a fact.
[03:11:04.078 --> 03:11:06.099]  They want to just accept their BS.
[03:11:06.099 --> 03:11:06.600]  Guess what?
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:07.480]  We're not!
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:08.861]  Sue, sue away!
[03:11:08.861 --> 03:11:10.142]  Ha ha ha!
[03:11:10.142 --> 03:11:12.424]  Alright, if I tell you a little story real fast.
[03:11:12.424 --> 03:11:12.724]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:14.270 --> 03:11:18.532]  Alright, so before 9-11 happened, my dad's a tattoo artist.
[03:11:18.532 --> 03:11:25.356]  And this guy, this is in like a year or two before 9-11 happened.
[03:11:25.356 --> 03:11:26.277]  2000.
[03:11:26.277 --> 03:11:28.318]  This guy wanted a tattoo of Trenton.
[03:11:28.318 --> 03:11:28.998]  He's from Trenton.
[03:11:28.998 --> 03:11:32.900]  He wanted the Trenton skyline just on fire.
[03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:36.862]  And my dad said there's no really building in Trenton that's notable.
[03:11:36.862 --> 03:11:37.703]  You know what I mean?
[03:11:37.703 --> 03:11:40.965]  So we should do the Twin Towers being firm.
[03:11:40.965 --> 03:11:41.245]  And then
[03:11:42.017 --> 03:11:48.442]  Next thing you know, this guy has a tattoo and he looks at it and it's literally a picture of the Twin Towers being burnt.
[03:11:48.442 --> 03:11:54.347]  And then for like a couple months after that, people were just coming to my dad like, God, tattoo me.
[03:11:54.347 --> 03:11:55.868]  I don't even know what I want.
[03:11:55.868 --> 03:11:57.630]  Just put it on me.
[03:11:57.630 --> 03:12:01.393]  I think your father was an oracle looking into the future.
[03:12:01.393 --> 03:12:04.295]  I think we're all oracles at the end of the day if we give into God's will.
[03:12:04.295 --> 03:12:05.356]  Thank you, Ian.
[03:12:05.356 --> 03:12:05.816]  All right.
[03:12:05.816 --> 03:12:06.757]  Let's take another call.
[03:12:06.757 --> 03:12:09.479]  Let's talk to Clown Car in New York.
[03:12:09.479 --> 03:12:10.080]  You're on the air.
[03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:10.360]  Welcome.
[03:12:11.323 --> 03:12:16.148]  Alex Jones is the general in charge of this information war that we are in.
[03:12:16.148 --> 03:12:18.591]  So this is what's happened, Captain.
[03:12:18.591 --> 03:12:21.274]  I'm trying to figure out this way out of the rabbit hole.
[03:12:21.274 --> 03:12:32.525]  So, I mean, we got the jury there, and that's followed by orders of the New York, you know, newscast that was run by the woman who's actually an Asian exchange student from California University.
[03:12:32.525 --> 03:12:33.927]  Then you got the wife of
[03:12:34.822 --> 03:12:41.666]  One of the Clinton attorneys getting shot and killed by Alec Baldwin, but didn't get shot by Alec Baldwin.
[03:12:41.666 --> 03:12:42.207]  Exactly.
[03:12:42.207 --> 03:12:46.189]  Definitely the deep state is blackmailing each other over Epstein.
[03:12:46.189 --> 03:12:48.390]  There's an internal war going on.
[03:12:48.390 --> 03:12:49.611]  That's what we need to do, Alex.
[03:12:49.611 --> 03:12:51.512]  A weekly wrap-up like you were talking about.
[03:12:51.512 --> 03:12:55.795]  Have the callers just call in and throw stuff on the wall and let's go through what sticks.
[03:12:55.795 --> 03:12:57.636]  We need to have a roundtable weekly.
[03:12:57.636 --> 03:13:01.058]  By January 19th, I think that's the Monday,
[03:13:02.119 --> 03:13:02.880]  Or is it 18th?
[03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:06.062]  I'm going to start three days a week.
[03:13:06.062 --> 03:13:10.505]  We're thinking Monday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[03:13:10.505 --> 03:13:11.526]  We're still gauging it.
[03:13:11.526 --> 03:13:16.450]  We're going to do a three-hour commercial-free show because it's just going to be all callers and guests.
[03:13:16.450 --> 03:13:17.751]  I totally agree with you.
[03:13:17.751 --> 03:13:18.391]  It's happening.
[03:13:18.391 --> 03:13:18.712]  It's done.
[03:13:18.712 --> 03:13:19.612]  I'm getting the crew set up.
[03:13:19.612 --> 03:13:21.214]  It's all happening.
[03:13:21.214 --> 03:13:25.056]  And I also bet my friend that you would say Clown Car is right, just like I said Alex Jones is right.
[03:13:25.056 --> 03:13:28.079]  Also, Alex, I want to bring up- Yes, Clown Car is always right.
[03:13:28.803 --> 03:13:29.624]  Thank you, my brother.
[03:13:29.624 --> 03:13:31.586]  Listen, I broke down a code.
[03:13:31.586 --> 03:13:33.168]  You know, sometimes you get the downloads.
[03:13:33.168 --> 03:13:34.389]  I get the weird downloads.
[03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:37.392]  I got this weird one when I saw the executive order going into play.
[03:13:37.392 --> 03:13:39.635]  I started looking at the numbers weird.
[03:13:39.635 --> 03:13:41.757]  It was put in forth on November 26th.
[03:13:41.757 --> 03:13:50.246]  It doesn't take effect until December 26th and it is over on January 15th, which leaves the middle of that all to be exactly
[03:13:50.751 --> 03:13:55.992]  From the fact that this date to the end of the date, excuse me, New Year's Day, January 1st.
[03:13:55.992 --> 03:13:58.572]  So I have a weird feeling about January 1st.
[03:13:58.572 --> 03:14:01.013]  I wanted to bring it up to you guys.
[03:14:01.013 --> 03:14:02.013]  Brother, I hear you.
[03:14:02.013 --> 03:14:03.513]  I got a weird feeling about it all.
[03:14:03.513 --> 03:14:06.534]  The globalists are at war with humanity.
[03:14:06.534 --> 03:14:07.914]  People are under attack.
[03:14:07.914 --> 03:14:12.115]  Don't be victims, be champions, but admit you're under attack and do something about it.
[03:14:12.115 --> 03:14:14.455]  Okay, let's talk to JR in New York.
[03:14:14.455 --> 03:14:16.176]  JR, take us out of the segment.
[03:14:16.176 --> 03:14:16.836]  Go ahead, JR.
[03:14:18.215 --> 03:14:19.315]  Alex, I love you.
[03:14:19.315 --> 03:14:20.696]  We pray for you every night.
[03:14:20.696 --> 03:14:22.216]  Thank you.
[03:14:22.216 --> 03:14:23.497]  Yeah, man.
[03:14:23.497 --> 03:14:26.158]  So, I just wanted to talk about your recent wars.
[03:14:26.158 --> 03:14:27.038]  I can't wait to see it.
[03:14:27.038 --> 03:14:29.139]  I had some information that might be good.
[03:14:29.139 --> 03:14:31.559]  You know that we are light.
[03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:33.900]  We are electricity and magnetism.
[03:14:33.900 --> 03:14:35.141]  We are, yes, sir.
[03:14:35.141 --> 03:14:37.581]  We are beings of light.
[03:14:37.581 --> 03:14:38.061]  That's right.
[03:14:38.061 --> 03:14:39.362]  They don't want us to know that.
[03:14:39.362 --> 03:14:44.063]  That's why they remove specific books out of the Bible, like the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip.
[03:14:44.063 --> 03:14:45.864]  In the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip,
[03:14:46.266 --> 03:14:49.669]  They really go into ways to access our consciousness.
[03:14:49.669 --> 03:14:56.514]  One of the ways is, and this is why the evil ones, the globalists, they know about sex magic, but in the negative way.
[03:14:56.514 --> 03:14:58.236]  In the Gospel of Philip... No, no, no.
[03:14:58.236 --> 03:15:00.338]  Men and women coming together is the big ritual.
[03:15:00.338 --> 03:15:01.238]  That's superpower.
[03:15:01.238 --> 03:15:02.219]  Exactly.
[03:15:02.219 --> 03:15:02.980]  Exactly.
[03:15:02.980 --> 03:15:08.104]  So, but the thing is, is that even as single... This is why they put out pornography.
[03:15:08.104 --> 03:15:13.548]  It's because every time that we have an orgasm, basically, we discharge our electricity.
[03:15:13.548 --> 03:15:14.049]  That's why
[03:15:14.580 --> 03:15:19.464]  When a boxer or anyone in martial arts, they know not to do that before a fight.
[03:15:19.464 --> 03:15:20.925]  That's our spiritual storehouse.
[03:15:20.925 --> 03:15:21.866]  That is the Holy Spirit.
[03:15:21.866 --> 03:15:22.927]  That's why it says in the Bible,
[03:15:24.744 --> 03:15:26.566]  The Holy Spirit is the Logos.
[03:15:26.566 --> 03:15:29.949]  The Logos is the seed.
[03:15:29.949 --> 03:15:34.713]  That's definitely what the whole Alistair Crowley Group knows, and they're doing their own operations.
[03:15:34.713 --> 03:15:37.636]  Big guest host coming up after the break.
[03:15:37.636 --> 03:15:38.957]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:38.957 --> 03:15:43.741]  And Owen Schroyer is live, ladies and gentlemen, at 3 p.m.
[03:15:43.741 --> 03:15:45.543]  Central Standard Time.
[03:15:45.543 --> 03:15:47.624]  Thank you so much for everybody.
[03:15:47.624 --> 03:15:48.585]  We really appreciate you.
[03:15:48.585 --> 03:15:49.026]  Stay with us.
[03:15:54.500 --> 03:16:04.605]  What if you could cut your... It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[03:16:04.605 --> 03:16:11.668]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[03:16:12.408 --> 03:16:17.953]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[03:16:17.953 --> 03:16:20.715]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[03:16:20.715 --> 03:16:27.601]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[03:16:27.601 --> 03:16:29.643]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[03:16:29.643 --> 03:16:31.645]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[03:16:32.445 --> 03:16:39.029]  ...is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN.
[03:16:39.029 --> 03:16:42.091]  They have weather control treaties from 1979.
[03:16:42.091 --> 03:16:45.473]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[03:16:45.473 --> 03:16:52.777]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[03:16:52.777 --> 03:16:54.558]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[03:16:56.111 --> 03:17:00.336]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[03:17:00.336 --> 03:17:01.697]  I like going to concerts.
[03:17:01.697 --> 03:17:03.059]  I like going to play golf.
[03:17:03.059 --> 03:17:04.881]  I like going out to dinner.
[03:17:04.881 --> 03:17:06.783]  I like the metropolitan life.
[03:17:06.783 --> 03:17:08.805]  I like everything that comes with this.
[03:17:08.805 --> 03:17:17.033]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[03:17:17.594 --> 03:17:21.116]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[03:17:21.116 --> 03:17:22.936]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[03:17:22.936 --> 03:17:25.057]  Just time to go get a piece of property in the woods?
[03:17:25.057 --> 03:17:25.998]  Just get off-grid?
[03:17:25.998 --> 03:17:27.458]  Just get the emergency food supplies?
[03:17:27.458 --> 03:17:28.559]  Just live off the land?
[03:17:28.559 --> 03:17:29.939]  That's the survival instinct.
[03:17:29.939 --> 03:17:34.841]  But see, the worldly part of me, that's still probably the majority part of me, says, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:17:34.841 --> 03:17:35.742]  Stay in the city.
[03:17:35.742 --> 03:17:41.424]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere that would ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[03:17:41.424 --> 03:17:45.346]  That's the internal struggle that, my guess is, a lot of you in the audience
[03:17:45.706 --> 03:17:56.535]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[03:18:11.567 --> 03:18:16.772]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[03:18:16.772 --> 03:18:25.659]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[03:18:25.659 --> 03:18:33.225]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[03:18:33.225 --> 03:18:34.006]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:18:34.980 --> 03:18:37.781]  We are crossing the Rubicon now.
[03:18:37.781 --> 03:18:41.043]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[03:18:41.043 --> 03:18:47.385]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[03:18:47.385 --> 03:18:49.646]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[03:18:49.646 --> 03:18:53.028]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[03:18:53.028 --> 03:18:55.209]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[03:18:55.629 --> 03:18:58.270]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[03:18:58.270 --> 03:18:59.170]  They're here.
[03:18:59.170 --> 03:19:03.491]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[03:19:03.491 --> 03:19:13.893]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[03:19:13.893 --> 03:19:22.115]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[03:19:22.475 --> 03:19:24.277]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[03:19:24.277 --> 03:19:32.085]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high-quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.

[03:19:57.289 --> 03:20:03.195]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.823 --> 03:20:16.685]  Hi, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for this hour.
[03:20:16.685 --> 03:20:18.867]  So appreciate, Alex, and what a show!
[03:20:18.867 --> 03:20:20.168]  It's always what a show, right?
[03:20:20.168 --> 03:20:25.192]  I just got to my 10-year anniversary, Mark, on the radio.
[03:20:25.192 --> 03:20:27.254]  I know, it seems like a crazy decade.
[03:20:27.254 --> 03:20:29.635]  I never thought I would be in radio.
[03:20:29.635 --> 03:20:34.359]  And when I started out, I was only hired because I watched Fox News.
[03:20:34.359 --> 03:20:35.360]  Can you believe it at the time?
[03:20:36.341 --> 03:20:39.243]  That was literally the reason I was hired.
[03:20:39.243 --> 03:20:42.705]  I think probably many people like me were hired because of that.
[03:20:42.705 --> 03:20:44.426]  Because, yeah, do you know anything about politics?
[03:20:44.426 --> 03:20:45.727]  Well, I watch Fox News.
[03:20:45.727 --> 03:20:47.488]  Well, you're hired.
[03:20:47.488 --> 03:20:54.433]  So it was an interesting beginning as a neocon turning into this sort of quest for research.
[03:20:55.033 --> 03:20:58.774]  And wanting to know more and more because I knew the world did not add up.
[03:20:58.774 --> 03:21:06.177]  I knew that what I was being told on the TV set just was not going on the way that I was viewing this world.
[03:21:06.177 --> 03:21:09.098]  And so it brought me to some really obvious conclusions.
[03:21:09.098 --> 03:21:10.879]  And I want to share some things with you.
[03:21:10.879 --> 03:21:15.440]  And I also want to share with you what's coming because there is some interesting technology.
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:23.463]  If you really follow these people and what they're all about and how evil they are, you really get an idea of why they do what they do and where we're headed in AI.
[03:21:23.923 --> 03:21:29.448]  So, before we get there, I've had over 28,000 hours of research now.
[03:21:29.448 --> 03:21:31.410]  That's a lot of research.
[03:21:31.410 --> 03:21:32.851]  That's a lot of research.
[03:21:32.851 --> 03:21:33.492]  And you know what?
[03:21:33.492 --> 03:21:36.975]  I always wish that people would ask me, so what have you learned?
[03:21:36.975 --> 03:21:37.675]  What happened?
[03:21:37.675 --> 03:21:40.118]  What did you come across?
[03:21:40.118 --> 03:21:41.439]  I don't get that.
[03:21:41.439 --> 03:21:42.560]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:43.240]  You know what I get?
[03:21:43.240 --> 03:21:47.985]  I get, well, does it align with what I've learned from the mainstream media line scumbags?
[03:21:48.525 --> 03:21:51.887]  Is what you say different than what they say?
[03:21:51.887 --> 03:21:57.771]  Ooh, then I might not like what you have to say because truth is a tough thing to listen to.
[03:21:57.771 --> 03:22:04.536]  And when I, when I, uh, last Christmas, I remember calling out, I kept seeing these memes for peace on earth.
[03:22:04.536 --> 03:22:06.357]  Can we just have peace on earth?
[03:22:06.357 --> 03:22:08.999]  And I remember thinking, no, we don't need peace on earth.
[03:22:08.999 --> 03:22:10.480]  You know what we need?
[03:22:10.480 --> 03:22:12.501]  We need truth on earth.
[03:22:12.501 --> 03:22:14.743]  That would actually bring peace.
[03:22:14.743 --> 03:22:16.324]  A lot of truth on earth.
[03:22:17.361 --> 03:22:23.104]  And I appreciate what InfoWars has done because InfoWars is bringing truth to the forefront.
[03:22:23.104 --> 03:22:26.046]  And this is what I have been in a quest to do.
[03:22:26.046 --> 03:22:31.689]  See, people can call me a conspiracy theorist because I get down to the facts that actually make sense and I don't put my head in the sand.
[03:22:32.349 --> 03:22:39.754]  When you put your head in the sand, and you have to artfully do this enough to become what I call a coincidence theorist.
[03:22:39.754 --> 03:22:42.556]  A coincidence theorist says everything's a coincidence!
[03:22:42.556 --> 03:22:49.500]  Oh my gosh, you mean the elite pretty much fondle each other and feel each other up and love each other to death?
[03:22:49.500 --> 03:22:50.961]  Oh, they're all in the same circles?
[03:22:50.961 --> 03:23:00.268]  You mean they're all marrying each other and all of their kids hang out and there's pictures together like Ghislaine Maxwell and good old Boris and all of these people?
[03:23:00.268 --> 03:23:02.329]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[03:23:03.129 --> 03:23:12.335]  I'm talking about the fact that these people, it's not a coincidence, that they hang out every five seconds together and remedy some of their plans together.
[03:23:12.335 --> 03:23:15.857]  In fact, there's just so many things that happen that I can't ignore.
[03:23:15.857 --> 03:23:22.682]  Let me give you just a little tiny list from what happened over the last decade of myself being on radio, right?
[03:23:22.682 --> 03:23:25.623]  The planes didn't make the towers fall.
[03:23:25.623 --> 03:23:28.305]  Neither did a plane full of Saudis.
[03:23:28.305 --> 03:23:30.386]  Many of the school shootings have been false flags.
[03:23:30.386 --> 03:23:31.367]  I'm sorry, but they have been.
[03:23:32.219 --> 03:23:34.440]  Too many things didn't add up.
[03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:37.941]  Too many strange things were at fault, right?
[03:23:37.941 --> 03:23:39.581]  Too many strange things.
[03:23:39.581 --> 03:23:45.203]  We don't have any adults over the age of 50, or at least one in 40, that has autism.
[03:23:45.203 --> 03:23:49.124]  There's a definite problem there that we need to research, right?
[03:23:49.124 --> 03:23:50.004]  And we have.
[03:23:50.004 --> 03:23:50.824]  Trust me.
[03:23:50.824 --> 03:23:59.226]  Education was taken over in 1907 by two groups that were considering themselves non-profits who are still going strong today.
[03:24:01.604 --> 03:24:02.885]  That's a fact.
[03:24:02.885 --> 03:24:06.506]  They actually colluded to do that, and they did it successfully.
[03:24:06.506 --> 03:24:08.207]  It took over education.
[03:24:08.207 --> 03:24:10.208]  Kennedy was taken out.
[03:24:10.208 --> 03:24:11.629]  I'm sorry, but he was.
[03:24:11.629 --> 03:24:13.570]  Feminism didn't just occur.
[03:24:13.570 --> 03:24:14.910]  It was planned.
[03:24:14.910 --> 03:24:18.412]  Women didn't just get angry all in one decade and resent their lives.
[03:24:18.412 --> 03:24:20.633]  No, it was artfully planned and executed.
[03:24:20.633 --> 03:24:28.056]  A lot of people on the scene to encourage women to get very angry and unfulfilled, right?
[03:24:28.056 --> 03:24:29.197]  People don't realize that.
[03:24:30.191 --> 03:24:39.853]  The CIA has done nothing but install presidencies worldwide, disrupt this planet, and destroy the family, culture, media, truth, and elections.
[03:24:39.853 --> 03:24:41.873]  Sorry, but that's just the fact.
[03:24:41.873 --> 03:24:44.074]  Fauci is our version of Mengele.
[03:24:44.074 --> 03:24:45.634]  I just call him Fengela.
[03:24:45.634 --> 03:24:47.335]  It's easier.
[03:24:47.335 --> 03:24:49.435]  Honestly, it's what he's about.
[03:24:49.435 --> 03:24:50.755]  He's been doing this for 30 years.
[03:24:50.755 --> 03:24:52.055]  He holds all the patents.
[03:24:52.055 --> 03:24:54.316]  It's a joke that we don't realize this.
[03:24:54.316 --> 03:24:58.617]  Little Hitler man has been out in the press saying the things he's been saying.
[03:24:58.617 --> 03:24:59.277]  It's absurd.
[03:25:00.040 --> 03:25:00.941]  He's a disgrace.
[03:25:00.941 --> 03:25:02.121]  He's evil.
[03:25:02.121 --> 03:25:03.743]  Let's recognize it.
[03:25:03.743 --> 03:25:07.725]  For seven decades, you have not actually been affected by climate change, have you?
[03:25:07.725 --> 03:25:08.806]  Of course not.
[03:25:08.806 --> 03:25:11.648]  And we didn't die at the end of every decade.
[03:25:11.648 --> 03:25:17.292]  And, you know, when people kind of stop recognizing God, what happens?
[03:25:17.292 --> 03:25:20.094]  They start hating other people for existing.
[03:25:20.094 --> 03:25:24.857]  Bill Gates has a wonderful little clip in which he diagnoses the problem of the universe.
[03:25:24.857 --> 03:25:26.438]  The problem is us.
[03:25:26.438 --> 03:25:28.179]  It's competition for resources.
[03:25:28.179 --> 03:25:29.300]  He doesn't want us around.
[03:25:30.049 --> 03:25:33.251]  He's an avowed atheist, right?
[03:25:33.251 --> 03:25:38.434]  Back in George Magazine in 1998, George Magazine named for George Bush, by the way.
[03:25:38.434 --> 03:25:39.435]  Senior Bush.
[03:25:39.435 --> 03:25:41.016]  Anyway, total traitor.
[03:25:41.016 --> 03:25:46.059]  The interview happened with Bill Gates in 1998 and this is what he said.
[03:25:46.059 --> 03:25:48.121]  Keep a close tab on this.
[03:25:48.121 --> 03:25:59.128]  He said, my own views, this was at the end of the interview, my own views are those you'd expect from somebody who feels like he's been very, very lucky and the resources under his command are really society's resources.
[03:25:59.748 --> 03:26:04.054]  And I have to be clever about how I'm going to funnel those back in.
[03:26:04.054 --> 03:26:06.417]  I fund education products.
[03:26:06.417 --> 03:26:09.180]  I fund population control.
[03:26:09.180 --> 03:26:11.223]  And I'm very big in the United Way.
[03:26:11.223 --> 03:26:14.667]  Yeah, the United Way.
[03:26:14.667 --> 03:26:16.830]  We'll have to have a talk about that sometime.
[03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:18.552]  I've done a lot of research on the United Way.
[03:26:19.577 --> 03:26:21.698]  So that happened back in 1998.
[03:26:21.698 --> 03:26:28.783]  He's been very, very proud of his ability to entrench himself into population control.
[03:26:28.783 --> 03:26:29.643]  Very proud of it.
[03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:30.584]  He loves it.
[03:26:30.584 --> 03:26:32.225]  They usually are.
[03:26:32.225 --> 03:26:33.306]  COVID is a label.
[03:26:33.306 --> 03:26:34.306]  I'm sorry, but it is.
[03:26:34.306 --> 03:26:37.368]  It's a label for 98 symptoms.
[03:26:37.368 --> 03:26:42.291]  98 symptoms that pretty much fill in the blank for any illness and any disease you could possibly have.
[03:26:42.291 --> 03:26:44.693]  That's the truth.
[03:26:44.693 --> 03:26:46.814]  Honestly, they're using medicinide
[03:26:47.512 --> 03:26:51.053]  Medicine, centralized medicine, to execute people.
[03:26:51.053 --> 03:26:53.133]  It's the truth.
[03:26:53.133 --> 03:26:57.094]  There are no laws on the books, and mandates are not a thing.
[03:26:57.094 --> 03:27:00.254]  But OSHA concocted a regulation not based on any U.S.
[03:27:00.254 --> 03:27:09.736]  code or law to give themselves power to say to companies all over the country that they must mandate a, you know, a vaccine, right?
[03:27:09.736 --> 03:27:14.177]  Although they had to step down because they knew that it was all smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:14.177 --> 03:27:15.437]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:16.972 --> 03:27:18.533]  It's always smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:18.533 --> 03:27:22.115]  Truth is very, oh, I don't know, straightforward?
[03:27:22.115 --> 03:27:25.476]  And lies always require smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:25.476 --> 03:27:30.559]  And King fraud a lot, and Hormala, I like to call her Hormala, she slept her way to the top and she's proud of it.
[03:27:30.559 --> 03:27:31.320]  You know what?
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:34.241]  No one wanted that little poop-your-pants idiot in office.
[03:27:34.241 --> 03:27:35.962]  Nobody!
[03:27:35.962 --> 03:27:37.723]  Name one person who did!
[03:27:37.723 --> 03:27:38.883]  Nobody did.
[03:27:38.883 --> 03:27:39.124]  Right?
[03:27:39.124 --> 03:27:42.986]  He couldn't even get 16% of his own party to vote for him.
[03:27:42.986 --> 03:27:43.506]  And, uh,
[03:27:44.278 --> 03:27:50.582]  We have to realize that the elites run this little circus in all of these relationships they have with each other.
[03:27:50.582 --> 03:27:57.166]  In order to ignore all of those things that I just said, you have to make sure that you realize that everything is a coincidence, right?
[03:27:57.166 --> 03:27:59.948]  You have to believe that everything is a coincidence.
[03:27:59.948 --> 03:28:01.569]  Well, it's not.
[03:28:01.569 --> 03:28:04.651]  In fact, government is very, very powerful, and we know this.
[03:28:05.680 --> 03:28:09.884]  Where do you think Joseph was headed with Mary when they were about to give birth to the Christ child?
[03:28:09.884 --> 03:28:11.606]  Here we are at Christmas time, right?
[03:28:11.606 --> 03:28:13.308]  He was going to pay his taxes.
[03:28:13.308 --> 03:28:21.476]  He risked the life of his newborn to go and make sure to get to Bethlehem 65 miles away to pay his taxes.
[03:28:21.476 --> 03:28:25.320]  That's how important it was that you had to do exactly what government said.
[03:28:26.468 --> 03:28:36.976]  This is important knowledge because we can go all the way back to time and say government has had a presence to oppress people and people are virtually pretty scared of government.
[03:28:36.976 --> 03:28:37.396]  Right?
[03:28:37.396 --> 03:28:38.857]  What they can do.
[03:28:38.857 --> 03:28:42.319]  They even ordered a decree to kill anyone under the age of two.
[03:28:42.319 --> 03:28:46.282]  Had Mary and Joseph been good global citizens, Christ wouldn't have survived.
[03:28:46.282 --> 03:28:50.145]  I'm going to come right back and I want to talk about where this is going with AI.
[03:28:50.145 --> 03:28:52.567]  Let's talk about the truth of what's actually going on right now.
[03:28:53.297 --> 03:28:54.859]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:28:54.859 --> 03:28:56.200]  You know, listeners call.
[03:28:56.200 --> 03:28:59.042]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action.
[03:28:59.042 --> 03:29:01.585]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[03:29:01.585 --> 03:29:10.974]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[03:29:11.614 --> 03:29:21.585]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[03:29:21.585 --> 03:29:28.353]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[03:29:28.353 --> 03:29:29.774]  But there is only two things to do.
[03:29:30.895 --> 03:29:34.037]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[03:29:34.037 --> 03:29:37.359]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[03:29:37.359 --> 03:29:42.742]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[03:29:42.742 --> 03:29:44.583]  And so, we must prepare.
[03:29:44.583 --> 03:29:57.411]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[03:29:57.411 --> 03:29:58.972]  What are champions made of?
[03:30:00.788 --> 03:30:01.948]  Here's a man who can show you.
[03:30:01.948 --> 03:30:02.288]  AAAA!
[03:30:02.288 --> 03:30:02.689]  AAAA!
[03:30:02.689 --> 03:30:02.849]  AAAA!
[03:30:02.849 --> 03:30:03.129]  AAAA!
[03:30:03.129 --> 03:30:03.509]  AAAA!
[03:30:03.509 --> 03:30:03.769]  AAAA!
[03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:05.189]  AAAA!
[03:30:05.189 --> 03:30:08.610]  AAAA!
[03:30:08.610 --> 03:30:08.870]  AAAA!

[03:30:25.655 --> 03:30:26.455]  That's InfoWars.
[03:30:55.629 --> 03:31:07.386]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[03:31:07.386 --> 03:31:11.052]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[03:31:11.292 --> 03:31:12.072]  We're good to go.
[03:31:34.940 --> 03:31:36.141]  Absolutely sad, brother.
[03:31:36.141 --> 03:31:38.243]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[03:31:55.336 --> 03:32:04.804]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[03:32:51.089 --> 03:32:57.475]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:57.475 --> 03:33:02.099]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:02.099 --> 03:33:03.380]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.111 --> 03:33:13.252]  All right, I'm Kate Dally.
[03:33:13.252 --> 03:33:14.092]  I'm back with you.
[03:33:14.092 --> 03:33:28.482]  I am your guest host for this hour and my show starts right when this ends and you can catch it live all over the country by going to katedallyradio.com and you can hit the listen live button and join in the conversation there as well.
[03:33:28.482 --> 03:33:39.228]  I just left the last segment talking about how if Mary and Joseph would have been good global citizens like we're supposed to be, they would have probably offered up the Christ child to be murdered.
[03:33:39.228 --> 03:33:39.829]  Would they not have?
[03:33:40.603 --> 03:33:41.843]  Of course they would have.
[03:33:41.843 --> 03:33:43.163]  But no, they didn't do that.
[03:33:43.163 --> 03:33:44.804]  Government has always been oppressive.
[03:33:44.804 --> 03:33:51.005]  Government has always had the evil leading edge because it had the power of oppression for people.
[03:33:51.005 --> 03:33:55.266]  If you study government for 10 years, that's probably the conclusion you'll come to, too.
[03:33:55.266 --> 03:34:00.487]  I've also had to recognize that along the way that it really is the study of evil.
[03:34:00.487 --> 03:34:02.127]  I've said this here before.
[03:34:02.127 --> 03:34:07.148]  It's the study of evil and people really need to recognize that we underestimate evil in this country.
[03:34:07.148 --> 03:34:07.348]  Why?
[03:34:07.828 --> 03:34:09.491]  Because we're not evil, that's why.
[03:34:09.491 --> 03:34:11.594]  It's hard for us to recognize something.
[03:34:11.594 --> 03:34:18.363]  It's hard for us to say how bad and how infiltrated and how swampy it really is, right?
[03:34:18.363 --> 03:34:23.130]  Well, in my study of government, all roads
[03:34:23.772 --> 03:34:23.852]  Yes.
[03:34:44.409 --> 03:34:46.152]  Um, all roads lead to money.
[03:34:46.152 --> 03:34:54.666]  So you could go back and you could go backwards and say, well, yes, I mean, this is probably where they're bought and sold by pharma and who pretty much has bought all of our governors.
[03:34:55.473 --> 03:34:57.434]  As well as the congressmen and senators.
[03:34:57.434 --> 03:34:59.815]  And so, of course, you go backwards.
[03:34:59.815 --> 03:35:02.416]  But really and truly, we need to go forwards.
[03:35:02.416 --> 03:35:06.458]  Because we all know by now that everything is about digital banking.
[03:35:06.458 --> 03:35:07.459]  It's not about health.
[03:35:07.459 --> 03:35:09.220]  It's about digital banking.
[03:35:09.220 --> 03:35:10.800]  It's about control, right?
[03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:13.922]  Getting control of the populace to get digital banking.
[03:35:13.922 --> 03:35:15.643]  It's always got to be about money.
[03:35:15.643 --> 03:35:16.623]  It has to be.
[03:35:16.623 --> 03:35:18.264]  Because it's the only thing that excites
[03:35:18.846 --> 03:35:20.749]  These, uh, these elitists.
[03:35:20.749 --> 03:35:26.397]  It's the only thing that gets them going is to know that there's going to be a bucket of money at the end of this, right?
[03:35:26.397 --> 03:35:27.479]  And we are expendable.
[03:35:28.248 --> 03:35:33.813]  And so you have to absolutely ignore, if you're a coincidence theorist, the new variant called moronic.
[03:35:33.813 --> 03:35:35.795]  You absolutely have to ignore this.
[03:35:35.795 --> 03:35:37.217]  And what are we looking at?
[03:35:37.217 --> 03:35:42.061]  In two weeks, they had one guy, two weeks ago, in the Netherlands, right?
[03:35:42.061 --> 03:35:46.646]  In the Netherlands, have two symptoms, fatigue and muscle fatigue, right?
[03:35:46.646 --> 03:35:49.709]  And of course, instead of calling it flu, because we're actually in flu season,
[03:35:50.626 --> 03:35:59.968]  They of course called it this new variant, and they're going to have a new variant probably every three months, which is going to make the last shot you got obsolete because you have to pony up for the new shot.
[03:35:59.968 --> 03:36:09.471]  This is why the 80 Republicans went all in with the little traitorous Democrats to vote immunization trackers, so they can all keep track of how many shots we're actually getting.
[03:36:09.471 --> 03:36:09.611]  See?
[03:36:10.411 --> 03:36:21.665]  So, you also have to ignore, you have to ignore, that the fact that the court ordered the FDA to comply with the file request and release information on the Pfizer vaccine.
[03:36:21.665 --> 03:36:26.550]  The first batch of documents shows over 1,200 vaccine deaths within the first 90 days.
[03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:27.732]  You have to ignore that too.
[03:36:28.232 --> 03:36:33.014]  You also have to ignore that the Delta variant has never had a single test.
[03:36:33.014 --> 03:36:35.616]  That COVID testers have never been quarantined.
[03:36:35.616 --> 03:36:36.476]  Why is that?
[03:36:36.476 --> 03:36:41.018]  Gosh, they're around people all day long, right?
[03:36:41.018 --> 03:36:43.600]  COVID testing, but they're never ever quarantined.
[03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:44.180]  That's a problem.
[03:36:44.947 --> 03:36:48.490]  You have to ignore that 99% of our country is just fine.
[03:36:48.490 --> 03:36:50.832]  You absolutely have to ignore that.
[03:36:50.832 --> 03:36:59.740]  And you have to ignore that all the world-renowned scientists, doctors, whistleblowers, financial experts are all telling you the exact same thing.
[03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:01.361]  What's coming?
[03:37:01.361 --> 03:37:03.483]  So I read an article back in 2012 and this was by
[03:37:08.161 --> 03:37:08.861]  Oh, what is the name?
[03:37:08.861 --> 03:37:10.922]  Bionisomp.
[03:37:10.922 --> 03:37:13.042]  And he was talking about bees.
[03:37:13.042 --> 03:37:24.744]  And I found this to be very interesting because in correlation with this, Louis Rosenberg, who's given many TED Talks, is talking often about bees and what these bees represent to him.
[03:37:24.744 --> 03:37:28.544]  He studies bees as if he's studying humans.
[03:37:28.544 --> 03:37:35.106]  Keep that in mind when you're listening to him explain in this clip, in this TED Talk, about the hive mentality.
[03:37:35.106 --> 03:37:36.826]  This is very crucial to our future.
[03:37:39.137 --> 03:37:46.620]  I like to think about it this way.
[03:37:46.620 --> 03:37:53.263]  A brain is a system of neurons so deeply connected that an intelligence forms.
[03:37:53.263 --> 03:37:59.265]  A swarm is a system of brains so deeply connected that a super intelligence forms.
[03:37:59.265 --> 03:38:05.348]  Simply put, a swarm is a brain of brains and it can be smarter than any individual member.
[03:38:07.142 --> 03:38:08.642]  Let me give you an example.
[03:38:08.642 --> 03:38:10.323]  Honeybees.
[03:38:10.323 --> 03:38:12.564]  This is about 10,000 bees.
[03:38:12.564 --> 03:38:15.064]  And they have a very important problem to solve.
[03:38:15.064 --> 03:38:18.225]  They need to find a new home to move into.
[03:38:18.225 --> 03:38:26.628]  That new home could be a hollow log, or the hole in the side of a building, or if you're unlucky like I was, a crawlspace in your garage.
[03:38:26.628 --> 03:38:32.430]  Now, this sounds simple, but this is a life-or-death decision that could impact the survival of the colony for generations.
[03:38:34.073 --> 03:38:43.780]  To solve this problem, the bees send out hundreds of scout bees that search a 30 square mile area and find dozens of candidate sites.
[03:38:43.780 --> 03:38:45.461]  That's the easy part.
[03:38:45.461 --> 03:38:53.006]  The hard part is that they then need to pick the best possible solution from all the options that they've discovered.
[03:38:53.006 --> 03:38:54.347]  Now here's the rub.
[03:38:54.347 --> 03:38:56.888]  A honeybee has a tiny brain.
[03:38:56.888 --> 03:39:00.131]  It's smaller than a grain of sand and has less than a million neurons.
[03:39:00.970 --> 03:39:09.458]  You have 85 billion neurons, so however smart you think you are, divide that by 85,000, and that's a honeybee.
[03:39:09.458 --> 03:39:13.102]  You probably wouldn't want a honeybee picking a new home for you.
[03:39:13.102 --> 03:39:17.386]  And yet honeybees are very discriminating house hunters.
[03:39:17.386 --> 03:39:25.254]  They need to find a new home that's big enough to store the honey they need for the winter, that's ventilated well enough to stay cool in the summer,
[03:39:26.101 --> 03:39:29.762]  That's insulated well enough to stay warm on cold nights.
[03:39:29.762 --> 03:39:32.402]  That's protected from the rain.
[03:39:32.402 --> 03:39:35.343]  But also near good sources of clean water.
[03:39:35.343 --> 03:39:40.364]  And of course, it needs to be well located near good sources of pollen.
[03:39:40.364 --> 03:39:43.704]  This is a complex, multivariable problem.
[03:39:43.704 --> 03:39:50.546]  And to maximize survival, the bees need to find the best possible solution across all of these competing constraints.
[03:39:50.546 --> 03:39:52.026]  And remarkably, they do it.
[03:39:53.646 --> 03:40:01.852]  Biologists have shown that honeybees pick the best possible solution over 80% of the time.
[03:40:01.852 --> 03:40:10.818]  If you were a human CEO trying to find the perfect location for a new factory, you'd face a similarly complex problem, and it would be very difficult to find the optimal solution.
[03:40:10.818 --> 03:40:13.079]  And yet, honeybees can do it.
[03:40:13.079 --> 03:40:13.840]  Let's think about that.
[03:40:14.938 --> 03:40:19.660]  A single bee has a brain so tiny it can't even conceive of the problem.
[03:40:19.660 --> 03:40:28.445]  But when they think together as a system, they can solve it so accurately that a human brain would be hard-pressed to match them.
[03:40:28.445 --> 03:40:29.325]  So how do they do this?
[03:40:29.325 --> 03:40:31.587]  By forming a swarm intelligence.
[03:40:31.587 --> 03:40:39.811]  A brain of brains that combines the knowledge and wisdom and insight and intuition of the group and converges on a single unified decision.
[03:40:41.755 --> 03:40:42.575]  I know what you're thinking.
[03:40:42.575 --> 03:40:42.935]  Really?
[03:40:42.935 --> 03:40:44.236]  These are honey bees.
[03:40:44.236 --> 03:40:46.056]  How do they express opinions?
[03:40:46.056 --> 03:40:48.757]  How do they converge on solutions?
[03:40:48.757 --> 03:40:52.918]  Remarkably, they do it by vibrating their bodies.
[03:40:52.918 --> 03:40:57.479]  Biologists call this a waggle dance, because to us it looks like the bees are dancing.
[03:40:57.479 --> 03:41:03.200]  But really, they're generating signals that represent their support for the various home sites under consideration.
[03:41:04.363 --> 03:41:14.490]  By combining these signals, the bees engage in a multi-directional tug-of-war, pushing and pulling on the decision, until they converge on the one solution that they can best agree upon.
[03:41:14.490 --> 03:41:17.552]  And it's usually the optimal solution.
[03:41:17.552 --> 03:41:26.639]  And unlike us humans, the bees don't entrench, they don't fall into gridlock, they don't settle for a bad solution that nobody's happy with.
[03:41:26.639 --> 03:41:29.261]  They find the solution that's best for the group as a whole.
[03:41:30.666 --> 03:41:39.153]  I point this out because the phrase hive mind often gets a bad rap, implying a group of mindless drones who can't think for themselves.
[03:41:39.153 --> 03:41:42.516]  That's certainly how science fiction portrays it.
[03:41:42.516 --> 03:41:43.817]  But honestly, it's just not true.
[03:41:43.817 --> 03:41:53.044]  A hive mind is nature's way of aggregating the diverse perspectives of a population and maximizing their collective wisdom.
[03:41:53.044 --> 03:41:59.930]  And let's be honest, we humans are pretty smart as individuals, but in groups, we're not always that wise.
[03:42:01.513 --> 03:42:06.016]  That's because groups don't do a great job of combining their diverse perspectives.
[03:42:06.016 --> 03:42:08.717]  We use votes and polls and surveys.
[03:42:08.717 --> 03:42:11.919]  The problem is, polls are polarizing.
[03:42:11.919 --> 03:42:19.544]  They drive us to entrench, exposing and reinforcing our differences, but doing nothing to help us find common ground.
[03:42:19.544 --> 03:42:21.145]  A swarm is the opposite.
[03:42:21.145 --> 03:42:25.808]  It's flexible and dynamic, revealing where we agree most.
[03:42:25.808 --> 03:42:30.891]  In other words, swarming doesn't just make a species smarter, it makes a species
[03:42:33.334 --> 03:42:34.635]  It's collectivism.
[03:42:34.635 --> 03:42:36.276]  It's you as an individual.
[03:42:36.276 --> 03:42:40.298]  We don't really like you as an individual with individual thoughts, your individual mind.
[03:42:40.298 --> 03:42:42.279]  We really love collectivism.
[03:42:42.279 --> 03:42:45.921]  Louis Rosenberg also was one of the creators of Metaverse.
[03:42:45.921 --> 03:42:47.863]  I'll talk about this more when I come back.
[03:42:47.863 --> 03:42:53.406]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host, and I really want to dive into why he studies bees.
[03:42:53.406 --> 03:42:54.326]  There's a reason for this.
[03:42:55.467 --> 03:43:04.892]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[03:43:04.892 --> 03:43:16.698]  So, right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning, and it's only going to run until the end of the month, and that's now only six, seven days.
[03:43:16.698 --> 03:43:20.640]  InfoWars store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[03:43:21.460 --> 03:43:23.081]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[03:43:23.081 --> 03:43:24.301]  It's our best seller.
[03:43:24.301 --> 03:43:26.022]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:43:26.022 --> 03:43:32.125]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the key amino acids, everything you need for your immune system and your body.
[03:43:32.125 --> 03:43:33.525]  And it tastes great.
[03:43:33.525 --> 03:43:35.346]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[03:43:35.346 --> 03:43:40.268]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double Patreon points.
[03:43:40.268 --> 03:43:42.909]  And so much more at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:43:42.909 --> 03:43:46.410]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[03:43:47.711 --> 03:43:51.214]  Bet on freedom, bet on InfoWars, bet on yourself and get great products.
[03:43:51.214 --> 03:43:55.617]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:55.617 --> 03:44:05.365]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[03:44:05.905 --> 03:44:18.967]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words, they admit that once they've gotten you with that system, then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do.
[03:44:18.967 --> 03:44:23.808]  And publicly, they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[03:44:23.808 --> 03:44:32.550]  And MasterCard and all the other big companies are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:36.633]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:36.633 --> 03:44:40.056]  This is the takeover, and humanity better wake up and say no.
[03:44:40.056 --> 03:44:41.778]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[03:44:41.778 --> 03:44:45.241]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and others will leave the charts, along with Infowars.
[03:44:45.241 --> 03:44:46.081]  But it's not enough.
[03:44:46.081 --> 03:44:51.186]  Every individual has to not comply, and we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[03:44:51.186 --> 03:44:54.489]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them, legally and lawfully.
[03:44:55.728 --> 03:44:57.050]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[03:44:57.050 --> 03:44:59.272]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[03:44:59.272 --> 03:44:59.693]  Welcome.
[03:44:59.693 --> 03:45:00.494]  Hello, Alex.
[03:45:00.494 --> 03:45:01.115]  Yes, Malcolm.
[03:45:01.115 --> 03:45:05.620]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[03:45:05.620 --> 03:45:09.865]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schroyer.
[03:45:09.865 --> 03:45:12.869]  Super male vitality and brain force plus.
[03:45:12.869 --> 03:45:15.512]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[03:45:15.752 --> 03:45:17.554]  Supramel Vitality really, really works.
[03:45:17.554 --> 03:45:22.439]  It's cold-pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[03:45:22.439 --> 03:45:29.225]  And so, it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[03:45:29.225 --> 03:45:31.067]  This is like a very fine wine.
[03:45:31.067 --> 03:45:33.209]  In fact, each batch is different.
[03:45:33.209 --> 03:45:35.651]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[03:45:35.651 --> 03:45:38.914]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[03:45:38.914 --> 03:45:39.855]  That's just how it is.
[03:45:39.855 --> 03:45:40.516]  It's how it works.
[03:45:41.498 --> 03:45:45.247]  So, it's always good, it's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[03:45:45.247 --> 03:45:49.036]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[03:45:57.699 --> 03:45:59.381]  This is a great sponsor.
[03:45:59.381 --> 03:46:04.786]  We have one of the best deals you're gonna find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[03:46:04.786 --> 03:46:09.450]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it'll work anywhere in the world where you can see the sky.
[03:46:09.450 --> 03:46:13.815]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for in your car, in your house, that also are on the site.
[03:46:13.815 --> 03:46:15.716]  Infowarsphone.com.
[03:46:15.716 --> 03:46:17.218]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[03:46:17.218 --> 03:46:18.419]  They supply the border patrol, everybody.
[03:46:18.439 --> 03:46:18.779]  I don't know.
[03:46:40.526 --> 03:46:44.169]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:47:13.126 --> 03:47:13.707]  Back with you.
[03:47:13.707 --> 03:47:15.989]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host in this hour.
[03:47:15.989 --> 03:47:21.594]  And just, you know, after looking at my 10 years in radio, let me just tell you something that's happened.
[03:47:21.594 --> 03:47:28.801]  And that is the ability to analyze what these sick people do and where it's going to lead us.
[03:47:28.801 --> 03:47:35.708]  You know, we as Americans had a knack early on for understanding where government was going to go.
[03:47:35.708 --> 03:47:37.630]  This is why we had the revolution.
[03:47:38.453 --> 03:47:41.154]  We weren't so enslaved that we couldn't fight.
[03:47:41.154 --> 03:47:47.717]  We were at that point where we could recognize where government was headed and we knew that it looked very bad for us.
[03:47:47.717 --> 03:47:50.919]  And we knew that they were only going in the way of more oppression.
[03:47:50.919 --> 03:47:55.761]  And so we fought a revolution to basically start this country.
[03:47:55.761 --> 03:48:02.645]  And that's important to realize because we as Americans are usually, we give ourselves credit for being able to look ahead.
[03:48:02.645 --> 03:48:05.406]  Right now, if you look ahead, you're a little more demonized, aren't you?
[03:48:06.147 --> 03:48:11.891]  Because you're not following along with the lion scumbags in the mainstream media narrative, right?
[03:48:11.891 --> 03:48:14.213]  The narrative controlled by the Pentagon.
[03:48:14.213 --> 03:48:21.338]  So the reason I brought up this hive mind, this swarm intelligence, Louis Rosenberg is at the head of AI.
[03:48:21.338 --> 03:48:25.241]  He's also, the company is a unanimous AI, okay?
[03:48:25.241 --> 03:48:26.561]  Unanimous, I'm sorry.
[03:48:26.561 --> 03:48:28.263]  Unanimous AI.
[03:48:28.263 --> 03:48:32.766]  He's also a prolific inventor, technologist, yadda yadda yadda scientist, okay?
[03:48:33.593 --> 03:48:36.835]  And also one of the creators of Metaverse.
[03:48:36.835 --> 03:48:38.116]  You've heard of Metaverse, right?
[03:48:38.116 --> 03:48:39.417]  The new Facebook.
[03:48:39.417 --> 03:48:42.018]  So he studies bees a lot.
[03:48:42.018 --> 03:48:54.405]  And the reason I tell you this is because this is important information when you're trying to analyze where somebody's headed and they don't want to give you all the pieces at once because it can seem a little, oh, I don't know, terrifying.
[03:48:54.405 --> 03:48:57.167]  What they do is they kind of leak it out piece by piece.
[03:48:57.167 --> 03:48:58.948]  They're really proud of their work.
[03:48:58.948 --> 03:49:00.969]  They're really proud of it.
[03:49:00.969 --> 03:49:01.870]  But at the same time,
[03:49:02.805 --> 03:49:08.890]  They also don't want to give you too much, because too much can be therefore terrifying and then you would want to stop it.
[03:49:08.890 --> 03:49:11.011]  But they're very proud of what they do.
[03:49:11.011 --> 03:49:18.397]  As you study bees, really what you're studying, just as Russian scientists have also studied, the vibrations of DNA.
[03:49:19.412 --> 03:49:21.974]  He was studying the vibrations for a reason.
[03:49:21.974 --> 03:49:39.424]  He was also saying, really, at the same time, look, you as an individual are not very important, but when I get you guys together, you collectively agree on things, and you don't have an individual voice, then you come to the conclusions of the collective that we want you to come to.
[03:49:39.924 --> 03:49:48.267]  So you're going to come to a decision that is more of a sheep-like decision because you're amongst the crowd.
[03:49:48.267 --> 03:49:49.507]  And this is what we want.
[03:49:49.507 --> 03:49:54.028]  We're going to say it's a much wiser decision, but really it's groupthink.
[03:49:54.028 --> 03:49:55.609]  It's groupthink on steroids.
[03:49:55.609 --> 03:49:58.970]  But how would they get us to do that and lose our individuality?
[03:49:58.970 --> 03:49:59.610]  How would they do it?
[03:50:00.825 --> 03:50:20.005]  And the shots, the drip system and the shots as it's destroying our immune system and as we beg and beg and beg like Dr. David Martin says for a solution which would be maybe AI enhanced parts, AI enhanced just everything inside the body, AI enhanced, right?
[03:50:21.039 --> 03:50:31.665]  So I said to you that I was reading a 2012 article and this article was really interesting because this person actually was a beekeeper and studied bees himself.
[03:50:31.665 --> 03:50:35.087]  And he said there are some really interesting facts about bee frequencies.
[03:50:35.087 --> 03:50:46.794]  For example, high frequencies that the queen creates are also used, and he said this in 2012, are also used in genetic engineering to splice DNA together.
[03:50:48.337 --> 03:51:00.927]  We have many documents from inside the government, from the NIH itself, on B-frequencies, on vibrational frequencies, on how we interact with each other inside these frequencies.
[03:51:00.927 --> 03:51:03.308]  And what was Louis Rosenberg talking about?
[03:51:03.308 --> 03:51:13.096]  He was talking about how people would send signals to each other and those signals would result in a communication form, okay?
[03:51:14.012 --> 03:51:22.619]  They didn't have to do much because they're little tiny brains, but when they would shake, they would shake a response to each other.
[03:51:22.619 --> 03:51:24.960]  He was really, really interested in that.
[03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:27.963]  He's also very interested in splicing DNA together.
[03:51:27.963 --> 03:51:30.244]  He's given talks about DNA.
[03:51:30.244 --> 03:51:33.787]  Very interested, a little too interested if you talk to me.
[03:51:33.787 --> 03:51:41.753]  So, in the bee colony, there's three types of bees, a drone, a worker, and a queen bee, and each have their own individual frequencies.
[03:51:41.753 --> 03:51:43.054]  A lot of people don't realize this.
[03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:47.403]  So each one works on its own frequency to communicate.
[03:51:47.403 --> 03:51:49.992]  For some reason, Louie is just really into this.
[03:51:50.868 --> 03:51:55.950]  And electronic bees are carefully guided over a hive synthesizer interface, right?
[03:51:55.950 --> 03:51:57.511]  They've actually done this.
[03:51:57.511 --> 03:52:04.193]  And they've actually been able to bring the bees places, bees really kind of infiltrated, if you will.
[03:52:04.193 --> 03:52:06.534]  Why am I talking so much about bees?
[03:52:06.534 --> 03:52:09.696]  Because they study bees to study human behavior.
[03:52:09.696 --> 03:52:15.058]  And when they're studying human behavior, they're very, very interested in say, I don't
[03:52:15.951 --> 03:52:17.772]  Infiltrating our behavior.
[03:52:17.772 --> 03:52:19.512]  See, data is king, right?
[03:52:19.512 --> 03:52:23.034]  And if data is king, why are they so interested in data?
[03:52:23.034 --> 03:52:25.435]  Why do they want data so badly?
[03:52:25.435 --> 03:52:37.739]  In fact, there was just a 60 Minutes interview about this where they were interviewing the scientist and he said that's why they were buying WhatsApp and all of these interfaces that had all of our information because data is king.
[03:52:37.739 --> 03:52:39.320]  So what do they do with this data?
[03:52:39.320 --> 03:52:41.341]  What do they do with frequencies?
[03:52:41.341 --> 03:52:42.141]  What's in the shots?
[03:52:42.924 --> 03:52:50.147]  Well, if what's in the shot is graphene oxide, there's a very interesting component to what I've just been talking about with bees.
[03:52:50.147 --> 03:52:58.329]  Graphene oxide inside the body causes thrombi, and graphene oxide causes blood clotting, we know this.
[03:52:58.329 --> 03:53:06.252]  It also causes the body post-inflammatory systems and organ, multi-organ inflammation and all of these things.
[03:53:06.252 --> 03:53:08.733]  It also might have the ability then
[03:53:15.711 --> 03:53:28.063]  There's a reason that between us as people, so electronic vibrations, so there's a reason that graphene oxide then would be in that shot if it's in the shot.
[03:53:28.063 --> 03:53:35.491]  Graphene oxide also can be eliminated by levels of glutathione in the body and you need to know that because you need to be able to get rid of it.
[03:53:36.687 --> 03:53:45.673]  So, as we get older and as we age over the age of 65, then the glutathione becomes almost immeasurable because it's so low.
[03:53:45.673 --> 03:53:51.197]  And so, you increase those levels, you might be able to get rid of the graphene oxide in your system.
[03:53:51.197 --> 03:53:58.022]  Also, with low levels of vitamin D, it also enhances graphene oxide to stay put.
[03:53:58.022 --> 03:54:02.445]  So, you've got to up those levels of D and up those levels of glutathione as well.
[03:54:03.174 --> 03:54:10.299]  The reason I'm saying this is because when they were studying this, they were studying electronic absorption bands.
[03:54:10.299 --> 03:54:21.067]  They were talking about the electromagnetic phenomenon that they realized that graphene oxide has what is called an electronic absorption band.
[03:54:21.067 --> 03:54:28.893]  And this magnetic resonance is precisely the third bandwidth of the 5G technology.
[03:54:29.927 --> 03:54:44.544]  Why do they have to have 5G technology go up at the same time that they're studying bees, that they're studying how the hive mind works, that they want to oust you individually and maybe have you, the little worker bee, be of service to them?
[03:54:45.245 --> 03:54:50.371]  Because they only look at a portion of our population as truly being a producer.
[03:54:50.371 --> 03:54:53.795]  The rest of the population, ah, a bunch of bottom feeders, you know, they can hit it.
[03:54:53.795 --> 03:55:01.364]  But as far as the population that they want to succeed, they want to have a lot of worker bees, to tell you the truth.
[03:55:02.262 --> 03:55:07.385]  And graphene oxide correlates with that electronic absorption band.
[03:55:07.385 --> 03:55:13.648]  And that magnetic resonance, again, is precisely the third bandwidth of 5G technology.
[03:55:13.648 --> 03:55:16.269]  The one that's being tendered right now.
[03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:19.191]  And where did we first see COVID arrive?
[03:55:19.191 --> 03:55:22.152]  On a cruise ship that installed 5G.
[03:55:22.152 --> 03:55:23.093]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:55:23.093 --> 03:55:24.954]  And all of the people got sick.
[03:55:24.954 --> 03:55:25.654]  Why did that happen?
[03:55:27.302 --> 03:55:39.225]  So, we have a lot of different nets within 5G and we'll have to continue that conversation at some point because 5G, maybe next week, 5G is so important to this and how it all plays out.
[03:55:39.225 --> 03:55:44.466]  5G would then hold the amount of data in this country on people.
[03:55:44.466 --> 03:55:48.087]  They are a study of human behavior.
[03:55:48.087 --> 03:55:51.187]  They want to be able to control human behavior.
[03:55:51.187 --> 03:55:51.487]  Why?
[03:55:51.487 --> 03:55:53.588]  There's a big pile of money at the end of this.
[03:55:54.375 --> 03:55:56.157]  A big amount of profit.
[03:55:56.157 --> 03:56:01.502]  And a big amount of profit if we're not competing for resources but we're just worker bees.
[03:56:01.502 --> 03:56:05.986]  Mindless little worker bees that give everything to the Queen Bee.
[03:56:05.986 --> 03:56:08.988]  Who do you think the Queen Bee is in this analogy?
[03:56:08.988 --> 03:56:12.992]  Why do you think Louis Rosenberg went out to talk about the hive mind so much?
[03:56:12.992 --> 03:56:14.393]  He's given many talks about it.
[03:56:14.393 --> 03:56:16.035]  You ought to check out the transcripts.
[03:56:16.035 --> 03:56:17.016]  They're kind of terrifying.
[03:56:17.628 --> 03:56:21.330]  Because he looks at people the way he looks at bees.
[03:56:21.330 --> 03:56:26.073]  We are just conveyors of information to further what the queen bee wants.
[03:56:26.073 --> 03:56:26.854]  That's our role.
[03:56:26.854 --> 03:56:28.495]  That's our only role.
[03:56:28.495 --> 03:56:33.358]  And keep that in mind, because they want a lot of people at their behest.
[03:56:33.358 --> 03:56:36.720]  The drip system is there to ruin our immune system.
[03:56:36.720 --> 03:56:37.701]  We're grasping that, right?
[03:56:38.604 --> 03:56:39.384]  It's a drip system.
[03:56:39.384 --> 03:56:40.504]  It's coming every three months.
[03:56:40.504 --> 03:56:49.966]  Hospital administrators have been admitting in emails that every three months there'll be a new booster and a new Delta, new Lambda fraternity for morons.
[03:56:49.966 --> 03:56:51.547]  We're just going to keep it going.
[03:56:51.547 --> 03:56:56.748]  They even went as far as to do this one, which we call moronic because it is moronic.
[03:56:56.748 --> 03:56:59.989]  There's a reason for the madness, right?
[03:56:59.989 --> 03:57:01.689]  There's a reason for a system.
[03:57:02.765 --> 03:57:05.507]  And this system can only hurt us if we don't stand up.
[03:57:05.507 --> 03:57:11.152]  We still live in a free country where we can stand, where we do have media like this.
[03:57:11.152 --> 03:57:19.859]  So we do have some things to work with, and we need to understand that we need to utilize those to our full capacity right now to be able to save this country and save our liberty.
[03:57:19.859 --> 03:57:21.981]  We already fought a bloody revolution.
[03:57:21.981 --> 03:57:23.623]  We don't need to do that again.
[03:57:23.623 --> 03:57:26.265]  We can use the system, but we've got to help each other do it.
[03:57:26.829 --> 03:57:34.274]  Go to katedallyradio.com, catch my show as it starts in five minutes, catch that as I go live, and thank you.
[03:57:34.274 --> 03:57:37.556]  And really look into the transcripts on The Hive Mind.
[03:57:37.556 --> 03:57:41.258]  It's very fascinating and terrifying all at the same time.
[03:57:41.258 --> 03:57:41.558]  Thank you.
[03:57:44.764 --> 03:58:01.393]  In late August, InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[03:58:01.393 --> 03:58:05.054]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[03:58:05.054 --> 03:58:11.738]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[03:58:12.358 --> 03:58:16.440]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now.
[03:58:16.440 --> 03:58:19.182]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.

[03:58:23.224 --> 03:58:30.588]  Because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[03:58:30.588 --> 03:58:34.510]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war.
[03:58:34.810 --> 03:58:35.231]  That's right.
[03:58:45.037 --> 03:58:49.379]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[03:58:49.379 --> 03:58:59.983]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[03:58:59.983 --> 03:59:06.165]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:06.165 --> 03:59:14.268]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[03:59:14.708 --> 03:59:24.795]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[03:59:24.795 --> 03:59:32.420]  It uses a unique, quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
