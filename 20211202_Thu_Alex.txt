[00:00.000 --> 00:17.440]  In for Wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:57.900]  My friends, we are live, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, December 2nd,
[00:57.900 --> 01:05.260]  broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones. We are going to be live here for the next four hours.
[01:05.260 --> 01:17.100]  Well, we are truly living south of heaven now. Just yesterday, we broke down the propaganda
[01:17.100 --> 01:22.460]  around the Western world from Australia to the United States, from Germany to England,
[01:22.460 --> 01:29.460]  from Scotland to Spain. With all the paid pundits saying, the time for forced injections
[01:29.460 --> 01:33.340]  has come, we are going to come to your house and forcibly inject you, and if you resist
[01:33.340 --> 01:45.740]  us, the army will kill you. Everybody from Howard Stern to Kramer on CNBC, and of course
[01:45.740 --> 01:53.220]  that was lockstep with the unelected president of the European Union Commission that actually
[01:53.220 --> 02:02.820]  runs the EU, set up in 1956 in the Treaty of Rome. Look it up. The entire group running
[02:02.820 --> 02:08.260]  it are literally Austrian-Hungarian Empire royalty, but they, of course, have gotten
[02:08.260 --> 02:13.940]  rid of their titles. The last head of it was in the family, the new head of it is connected
[02:13.940 --> 02:22.740]  to that, and literal royal Germans are announcing that they have taken over the European Union
[02:22.740 --> 02:28.980]  and that forced injections are about to begin. I told you to expect Germany within a week
[02:28.980 --> 02:33.780]  to announce forced inoculations door to door with the military. This will be shown all
[02:33.780 --> 02:39.460]  over the news worldwide like it is normal, so it can then be brought here and sure as
[02:39.460 --> 02:47.300]  hell. The dictator Merkel, who has staged elections, the communist globalist Merkel
[02:47.300 --> 02:54.060]  has handed power over the new puppet government, and they have announced February 1st door
[02:54.060 --> 02:59.780]  to door forced injections to begin. A civil war will break out. Even 1% of the Germans
[02:59.780 --> 03:04.580]  that are not injected fight back. It will be catastrophic, but they have no other choice
[03:04.580 --> 03:10.740]  now. If Hitler would have just said there was a disease and he had a vaccine and he
[03:10.740 --> 03:17.820]  was invading countries to save them, he probably would have won World War II. The globalists
[03:17.820 --> 03:23.980]  have bought up the media, the globalists have bought up the academia, the globalists have
[03:23.980 --> 03:29.860]  set up big tech to censor and control, and now they are making their move, and it's
[03:29.860 --> 03:36.740]  being reported by Fox News, by Peter Ducey, who's a Ducey of a reporter, he's amazing,
[03:36.740 --> 03:42.420]  there's more than all the other corporate media in the field together. Biden is set
[03:42.420 --> 03:47.620]  to announce in a few hours draconian controls and threaten the public that anyone that is
[03:47.620 --> 03:53.580]  not vaccinated will be locked in their houses in blue cities. So everything you see in Germany,
[03:53.580 --> 03:58.900]  everything you see in Australia, everything you see in Spain is coming here if you put
[03:58.900 --> 04:06.540]  up with it. Thomas Jefferson was once asked in a letter, what is the level of tyranny
[04:06.540 --> 04:13.340]  in which humans will accept? To which mankind will accept and live? And he said it is the
[04:13.340 --> 04:20.260]  exact level that you will accept. Whatever level you will accommodate. That's really
[04:20.260 --> 04:26.940]  true. You see, there's not a vacuum in nature. So when you don't stand up for your freedoms
[04:26.940 --> 04:29.940]  and you don't care about your freedoms, bad people will come in and fill the vacuum and
[04:29.940 --> 04:34.740]  you will end up a slave. And maybe the first managers, you know, aren't that bad, but they
[04:34.740 --> 04:39.700]  always get replaced by worse people. And finally, you end up with pure evil. People that want
[04:39.700 --> 04:46.060]  to roast your children on a spit and eat them in front of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's
[04:46.060 --> 04:52.700]  on. Global corporate extremist operation using COVID-19 as the pretext to establish
[04:52.700 --> 04:59.580]  total martial law and the killings just getting started.
[04:59.580 --> 05:05.820]  Info wars. We have launched the most important sale of the year because now we've got a bunch
[05:05.820 --> 05:09.820]  of great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[05:56.940 --> 06:16.500]  is not taking action at infowarstore.com big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:16.500 --> 06:23.460]  You want answers? Well, so does he live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's
[06:23.460 --> 06:29.860]  Alex Jones. Germany for over 20 months has been under
[06:29.860 --> 06:39.260]  martial law lockdown. Germany runs the European Union. The European Union was a project of
[06:39.260 --> 06:49.700]  a man you may have heard of, Adolf Alois Hitler of Austria. That's on record. He also invented
[06:49.700 --> 06:55.740]  the Volkswagen and the modern highways and so many other things that the left doesn't
[06:55.740 --> 07:03.020]  want you to know about because the Nazis were a leftist movement. Why do I raise that point,
[07:03.020 --> 07:08.180]  ladies and gentlemen? Well, the head of the European Union, the unelected president of
[07:08.180 --> 07:15.460]  the commission that's been operating since 1956 under treaty. Oh, yeah, people thought
[07:15.460 --> 07:20.460]  they were just signing a treaty back in 56. No, that was putting this commission over
[07:20.460 --> 07:26.420]  their governments. She announced that they need to prepare for forced inoculation EU-wide.
[07:26.420 --> 07:31.700]  I said, within a week, you will see Merkel announced forced inoculations, forced injections
[07:31.700 --> 07:40.460]  of the GMO Franken plot shot, death shot. Well, she did it quicker than that. This morning,
[07:40.460 --> 07:49.220]  in German time, about 10 hours ago, they announced, ladies and gentlemen, that forced injections
[07:49.220 --> 07:56.860]  will begin in February. Door to door with the police. That puts you into a database.
[07:56.860 --> 08:02.300]  It's total control. And obviously, the shot is linked to massive cardiac problems and
[08:02.300 --> 08:07.100]  cancer and turns off your DNA so that you rapidly age and die. Bare minimum, probably
[08:07.100 --> 08:13.580]  a cancer, depending on the case. That's in mainline studies. So this is their depopulation
[08:13.580 --> 08:23.060]  weapon and the police of Germany, when they follow these orders, are now walking the exact
[08:23.060 --> 08:31.100]  steps of where the Germans went 70 plus years ago. And remember the Nuremberg trials, just
[08:31.100 --> 08:36.220]  saying following orders did not cut it. Now, a lot of police have joined and military have
[08:36.220 --> 08:40.900]  joined the protesters by the millions. And so the majority of them don't like what's
[08:40.900 --> 08:45.340]  happening. So they're now bringing in special thugs and deputizing them. They're not having
[08:45.340 --> 08:50.220]  wearing badges who will then go out and try to intimidate the public. But this is the
[08:50.220 --> 08:54.020]  cover for martial law. I mean, if they can put in your body an experimental GMO shot
[08:54.020 --> 08:57.740]  that makes you sick and kills you, if they can censor everybody that's against it, if
[08:57.740 --> 09:01.820]  they can shut down all the businesses that they say are non-essential, that will collapse
[09:01.820 --> 09:08.980]  civilization into their control. And so what you see happening in Germany and Australia
[09:08.980 --> 09:14.300]  and everywhere is coming here. And Biden is set to announce more draconian controls today.
[09:14.300 --> 09:19.820]  In fact, let's get that clip ready and we'll play it here in just a moment. Alert. Fox's
[09:19.820 --> 09:25.980]  Peter Ducey says that today the White House plans to announce some of the strictest COVID
[09:25.980 --> 09:33.340]  restrictions on Americans yet, but they're not COVID restrictions. They are the cover
[09:33.340 --> 09:39.300]  the training wheels for martial law. And now as you can see, the training wheels are coming
[09:39.300 --> 09:44.740]  off. Forced injection in your homes, no matter how many times the media says, oh, it used
[09:44.740 --> 09:49.660]  to happen in the past. That's not true. A few areas in the South tried it on black people
[09:49.660 --> 09:54.820]  in the 20s at the height of eugenics. And that later was outlawed in those areas. So
[09:54.820 --> 09:58.340]  yeah, bad things have been done before. Doesn't mean that because bad things are done before,
[09:58.340 --> 10:03.020]  they can do it again. They already tried this before, ladies and gentlemen. And again, it
[10:03.020 --> 10:06.940]  has nothing to do with protecting you. It's all about power and control over your body.
[10:06.940 --> 10:10.900]  You can argue that real vaccines can actually help people. And when they're not tainted
[10:10.900 --> 10:16.300]  and not toxic, they have 100% efficacy in many cases. These are not vaccines. They erase
[10:16.300 --> 10:22.420]  your immunity. And I know this audience knows that, but the mere act and the power and the
[10:22.420 --> 10:28.300]  control of being able to roll something out that hurts people publicly, and they still
[10:28.300 --> 10:34.700]  get away with it, gives them total absolute dominance. And from there, they are going
[10:34.700 --> 10:40.020]  to bankrupt all the major private banks, all the private industry, and consolidate it under
[10:40.020 --> 10:49.020]  the great reset in their own words. Also, there is a standoff going on at the New York
[10:49.020 --> 10:57.860]  Police standoff. New York police standoff with armed man at United Nations HQ. We do have
[10:57.860 --> 11:02.340]  some sources in the SWAT team. I'll leave it at that. We've got some calls out. Heavily
[11:02.340 --> 11:07.020]  armed New York City police have surrounded the area outside the UN headquarters on East
[11:07.020 --> 11:11.100]  River and are reportedly negotiating with a person carrying a gun. The NYPD has issued
[11:11.100 --> 11:16.060]  a traffic alert for the intersection of 42nd Street and 1st Avenue right outside the UN
[11:16.060 --> 11:21.540]  HQ and said the public should expect emergency vehicles in the surrounding areas. So we'll
[11:21.540 --> 11:27.060]  continue to watch as it unfolds, but there's some of the footage of what's happening now
[11:27.060 --> 11:34.180]  that Newsmax happened to have a reporter on the ground. Literally 50 yards down from where
[11:34.180 --> 11:40.900]  you see those police up the road north there, they have big banners up saying, soon you
[11:40.900 --> 11:45.940]  will own nothing and have nothing, and soon you will not live in a city. You will live
[11:45.940 --> 11:52.340]  in a commune and then it shows like concrete bunkers that people live in. It just shows
[11:52.340 --> 11:59.620]  you something dystopian. It says this is good to normalize it. So here's the headlines.
[11:59.620 --> 12:04.900]  Germany imposes national lockdown on non-injected. Oh, but the other people that have their travel
[12:04.900 --> 12:11.500]  passes are good little slaves. They get to go outside. But the key is buried in that
[12:11.500 --> 12:16.340]  is Merkel, the outgoing dictator's comments, announces nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated
[12:16.340 --> 12:21.260]  total discrimination. Germany on Thursday announced a nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated
[12:21.260 --> 12:27.700]  as its leaders backed plans for mandatory vaccinations in the coming months. Unvaccinated
[12:27.700 --> 12:32.620]  people will be banned from accessing all but the most essential businesses such as supermarkets
[12:32.620 --> 12:38.260]  and pharmacies. To curb the spread of coronavirus, oh yes, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel
[12:38.260 --> 12:45.060]  with her successor Olaf Schultz announced Thursday following crisis talks with regional
[12:45.060 --> 12:49.700]  leaders. Oh, they've got way more deaths and way more illnesses they say from COVID than
[12:49.700 --> 12:55.260]  they did last year and their hospitals are now actually full. And the German statistics
[12:55.260 --> 12:59.500]  out of their own government say the majority are the vaccinated and they're twice as likely
[12:59.500 --> 13:04.940]  to die of COVID or other illnesses if you're quote double-vaxxed. And now Germany says
[13:04.940 --> 13:09.860]  you got to take a third or a fourth. You're like, well, that's the death of logic. Even
[13:09.860 --> 13:14.980]  if this stuff work, you shouldn't make us take it. But you see, they want that power
[13:14.980 --> 13:21.380]  and just to drive you into total and complete submission now. So let's put up the show
[13:21.380 --> 13:29.660]  headline for everybody because what's incredible is every time they roll out more controls,
[13:29.660 --> 13:34.900]  they always bury their real aim in the article. The big story is not lockdown to being here
[13:34.900 --> 13:38.340]  that I've been telling you that's coming for a long time. You can tell it was was putting
[13:38.340 --> 13:44.380]  the anti-terrorism legislation and the anti-terrorism executive orders that Biden signed in June
[13:44.380 --> 13:50.380]  saying the main threat is people protesting lockdowns. Gee, what do you think's coming?
[13:50.380 --> 14:00.460]  The Fourth Reich is here. Germany announces new lockdowns, forced injections to start
[14:00.460 --> 14:09.780]  February 1st. Germany has now taken full control of the European Union and has announced plans
[14:09.780 --> 14:20.540]  to force COVID injections on the public. Again, Germany has now taken full control of the European
[14:20.540 --> 14:29.140]  Union and has announced plans for forced COVID injections to begin continent-wide. Today
[14:29.140 --> 14:37.260]  Deutschland, tomorrow the world. Meanwhile, the U.S. Biden is set to follow suit by launching
[14:37.260 --> 14:44.460]  New Draconian restrictions today. Tune in. Spread the link. It's an exact program. It's
[14:44.460 --> 14:48.780]  an exact operation. They squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
[14:48.780 --> 14:52.860]  Then say, oh, just take the shots, take the digital ID, take the vaccine passport, take
[14:52.860 --> 14:58.140]  the social credit, and you'll be free. And then those that comply are given a little
[14:58.140 --> 15:01.980]  bit of room, but then they clamp back down even more. And then those that don't submit
[15:01.980 --> 15:08.420]  are totally locked up and taken to camps. The CDC's own website has the shielding operation
[15:08.420 --> 15:11.980]  where they say they're going to lock down every town, every city, and have armed block
[15:11.980 --> 15:16.060]  captains that control where you can go and what you can do. We are literally going to
[15:16.060 --> 15:21.980]  have communists running around pointing weapons at us. And most of your gun owners, when they
[15:21.980 --> 15:26.700]  do it, will actually give them the guns and say, would you like to have my children?
[15:26.700 --> 15:35.540]  I mean, that's who America's become. But not everyone has become this, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:35.540 --> 15:40.940]  Not everyone has bound down to all of this, but they are taking microchips in Europe under
[15:40.940 --> 15:46.380]  government auspices in Sweden and other countries. There's footage on screen. If you really want
[15:46.380 --> 15:50.500]  to be cool and trendy, you get your vaccine pass right in your hand. There's just so many
[15:50.500 --> 15:56.020]  injections, so many violations, so much rape. They want control over our bodies to force
[15:56.020 --> 16:00.060]  us into the metaverse. If you're concerned about the power grid and
[16:00.060 --> 16:05.700]  We have launched the most important sale of the year, because now we've got a bunch of
[16:05.700 --> 16:09.580]  great products that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.

[16:56.700 --> 17:02.340]  is not taking action at infowarstore.com. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost
[17:02.340 --> 17:07.780]  28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the
[17:07.780 --> 17:13.700]  world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational, but we failed. Yes,
[17:13.700 --> 17:18.260]  a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going
[17:18.260 --> 17:24.300]  ahead with their full operational deindustrialization, great reset. And that's why it's more important
[17:24.300 --> 17:29.060]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show because
[17:29.060 --> 17:33.380]  people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare
[17:33.380 --> 17:37.100]  of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared.
[17:37.100 --> 17:40.340]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the
[17:40.340 --> 17:45.380]  best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's
[17:45.380 --> 17:49.700]  a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right
[17:49.700 --> 17:54.740]  now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and
[17:54.740 --> 18:24.700]  waits because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[18:24.740 --> 18:49.700]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[18:49.700 --> 19:05.420]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've ever had in
[19:05.420 --> 19:11.900]  my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has. And it's
[19:11.900 --> 19:22.500]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[19:22.500 --> 19:29.500]  sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public in
[19:29.500 --> 19:35.700]  a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled trance.
[19:35.700 --> 19:42.380]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad. But
[19:42.380 --> 19:48.780]  this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[19:48.780 --> 19:53.980]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalists are actively
[19:53.980 --> 19:58.500]  trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[19:58.500 --> 20:01.900]  species as we know it.
[20:01.900 --> 20:08.900]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:08.900 --> 20:25.660]  Here we are on planet Earth staring into infinity. I'm your host Alex Jones, very honored to
[20:25.660 --> 20:29.940]  be here. All right, I reached out to our sources that are on the ground in New York and they
[20:29.940 --> 20:34.260]  said that it appears to be somebody trying to be suicided by cop. They don't know what's
[20:34.260 --> 20:40.420]  in the bag, but he probably looks what has to be a gun and the police are just trying
[20:40.420 --> 20:43.620]  to get him to put it down so they don't kill him doesn't look like it's some type of terror
[20:43.620 --> 20:48.900]  attack on the terrorist compound that is the United Nations. We don't want any violence
[20:48.900 --> 20:54.940]  against them because then that turns the UN into the victim. We want to politically
[20:54.940 --> 21:07.300]  expose them. Okay, here's what's going on. We have a really interesting lady joining
[21:07.300 --> 21:12.300]  us in the second hour. I had a chance to meet her in person in San Antonio a few weeks ago,
[21:12.300 --> 21:19.460]  General Flynn, Melissa Tate, and I think that she's one of the smartest young women out
[21:19.460 --> 21:26.140]  there fighting the globalist. She also grew up in a African country that was a paradise
[21:26.140 --> 21:31.740]  until the authoritarian communists took over to describe what that was like coming up next
[21:31.740 --> 21:36.660]  hour. Then I'm going to open the phones up in the third hour, the entire third hour,
[21:36.660 --> 21:46.340]  and then the Kate Daly dally takes over in the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schreuer today.
[21:46.340 --> 21:54.780]  The time that we're in is so insanely important that I think it's very, very central to be
[21:54.780 --> 21:59.740]  calm about this and really let things sink in. Now when I give you that advice, I'm giving
[21:59.740 --> 22:06.140]  myself that, you saw me get really angry yesterday and get upset and that was very real and that
[22:06.140 --> 22:10.700]  was me passionately trying to fight these people as much as I can with the truth and
[22:10.700 --> 22:14.340]  with the information and with the oratory skills, and it certainly has its place in
[22:14.340 --> 22:19.420]  motivating people, but we need to just set back and really decide what we're going to
[22:19.420 --> 22:26.140]  do and then start taking action because the images of Obama and Fauci going to public
[22:26.140 --> 22:30.900]  schools with big lines of elementary students looking scared, staring up at the monsters
[22:30.900 --> 22:38.860]  while they helped the quote nurses, the executioners, the medical workers, inject them with the
[22:38.860 --> 22:44.660]  evil GMO garbage. So I was already upset seeing that in the morning and then I read
[22:44.660 --> 22:48.340]  about how they're announcing forced inoculations and dictatorship in Europe and how that's
[22:48.340 --> 22:58.180]  the same crew running the whole planet and witnessing then people escaping camps and
[22:58.180 --> 23:07.340]  checkpoints in Australia and then the first 30 pages of 500 a month order to be released
[23:07.340 --> 23:14.580]  by a federal judge of Pfizer and the FDA and the first 30 pages say thousands of deaths,
[23:14.580 --> 23:19.740]  massive increases in miscarriages, thousands of miscarriages, blood clots, heart attacks
[23:19.740 --> 23:24.620]  and they tried to suppress that. We already knew that, we could see it happening, but
[23:24.620 --> 23:29.820]  to know that they know and then they knew this in February because they're only releasing
[23:29.820 --> 23:34.900]  stuff from the second half of January, remember the shot started mid-January. So they released
[23:34.900 --> 23:43.660]  two weeks of data of adverse reactions or adverse events, AEs and I should just only
[23:43.660 --> 23:48.020]  be covering that here today, again, but oh they just hope we glaze over it and then that's
[23:48.020 --> 23:54.820]  it. No, these are murderers, these are criminals and when you watch the children scared in
[23:54.820 --> 24:00.100]  the videos of Obama and Fauci and their parents clutching them and holding them, it's like
[24:00.100 --> 24:04.340]  watching a crocodile walk over and grab a kid at Disney and drag it into the pond and
[24:04.340 --> 24:15.740]  eat it, but it's gonna be done in slow motion. So this just tears my guts out and we're gonna
[24:15.740 --> 24:19.660]  be breaking it down today, but let me do this, this is a shorter segment, a longer segment
[24:19.660 --> 24:25.540]  is about to come up. I'm gonna talk about something when we come back that if you do
[24:25.540 --> 24:33.940]  it and if I do it, we're gonna win very quickly and Tucker Carlson understands this and that's
[24:33.940 --> 24:43.420]  why he's a leader. Tucker Carlson did not go on TV last night and endorse me because
[24:43.420 --> 24:50.900]  he wanted to just fawn over Alex Jones. He signed his John Hancock on the Declaration
[24:50.900 --> 25:00.260]  of Independence 2.0 and the way you do that is say Alex Jones was right. That's the revolutionary
[25:00.260 --> 25:04.780]  I am Spartacus. When they came to find Spartacus to kill him, you know, the gladiator slave
[25:04.780 --> 25:10.460]  revolt leader, he'd already been killed. They didn't know what the Romans were killing thousands
[25:10.460 --> 25:14.260]  of people saying tell us where he is and they kept saying I'm Spartacus. I'm Spartacus.
[25:14.260 --> 25:22.380]  I'm Spartacus. It's not Alex Jones he's talking about. It's all of us. It's populism and so
[25:22.380 --> 25:27.060]  they ridicule me. They lie about me. They sue me. They demonize me. They attack my family.
[25:27.060 --> 25:32.060]  I understood that and I believe that other men and women would see what was happening
[25:32.060 --> 25:40.100]  and stand up and I could be an example to others of perseverance and so Tucker is better
[25:40.100 --> 25:46.980]  spoken than I and more focused than I and he does a wonderful, fabulous, very populist,
[25:46.980 --> 25:55.260]  very liberal show, classical liberal, not modern leftist and he understands that just
[25:55.260 --> 25:59.620]  like Joe Rogan went on there to go and said Alex Jones is always right. Well, I'm really
[25:59.620 --> 26:06.260]  right most of the time, but it's a saying just to say in the general main, I'm dead
[26:06.260 --> 26:15.340]  on and when people adopt my perspective, it's not my view or what or what I said was going
[26:15.340 --> 26:20.340]  on. So it magically popped out when people actually look at things from the angle I'm
[26:20.340 --> 26:25.220]  looking at and go, oh my God, they're going to see everything. And I'm going to show you
[26:25.220 --> 26:29.020]  some footage when we come back before I play the Tucker Carlson to really illustrate this
[26:29.020 --> 26:33.980]  and if you're a radio listener, I really want you to go to band.video or in full wars.com
[26:33.980 --> 26:38.620]  sports live show to the Alex Jones section and get the live feed so you can see this
[26:38.620 --> 26:47.460]  for yourself because this is an allegory and a parallel that really explains everything.
[26:47.460 --> 26:52.580]  There's something we're going to show you in the Florida Everglades that is a perfect
[26:52.580 --> 26:57.860]  analogy and it ties into Tucker Carlson and everything that's happening. If you do this
[26:57.860 --> 27:01.700]  mind trick with yourself, you can get control of your mind like Elon Musk has been talking
[27:01.700 --> 27:06.540]  about by removing their software and then operating on the software God originally
[27:06.540 --> 27:13.180]  gave you. Also, I want to thank the listeners for your support when you buy books and films
[27:13.180 --> 27:18.220]  and water filters and air filters and short way radios and other survival gear at infowarstore.com.
[27:18.220 --> 27:22.900]  You are funding the very tip of the spear and changing the world. So the success I've
[27:22.900 --> 27:30.700]  had is your success. We are a family. This is a wonderful time despite its pain because
[27:30.700 --> 27:35.020]  it's really showing us who's good and who's bad. It was the best of times. It was the
[27:35.020 --> 27:40.580]  worst of times. A tale of two cities. But now with all the things the globalists are
[27:40.580 --> 27:44.540]  doing and all the things they're up to, it's time to boost your immune system and fund
[27:44.540 --> 27:49.860]  the info war, a 360 win all at the same time, bottom mineral fusion, back in stock, free
[27:49.860 --> 27:58.660]  shipping, double patriot points, 40% off. Store-wide free shipping at infowarstore.com
[27:58.660 --> 28:04.260]  or by calling toll three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, triple
[28:04.260 --> 28:11.220]  eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine or infowarstore.com. And I hope we back
[28:11.220 --> 28:15.420]  the globalist off and things get better. But as bad as things are, work and start with
[28:15.420 --> 28:20.260]  Russia or China any day. We could be off the air any minute. That could be it. No more
[28:20.260 --> 28:23.100]  communications. You never see me again. I never talk to you again. I never see you
[28:23.100 --> 28:29.540]  again. So take every day as potentially our last email to communicate. I'd get those
[28:29.540 --> 28:34.020]  info wars t-shirts now. I'd get those films. I'd get those books. I'd get that information.
[28:34.020 --> 28:38.500]  I'd save the shows. I'd download them and put them on thumb drives. Because in the future,
[28:38.500 --> 28:42.620]  if the enemy gets to the next level and we don't back them off, this information will
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.740]  be like platinum. It will not be allowed anywhere. You'll be sent to a FEMA camp if you haven't.
[28:47.740 --> 28:51.340]  But out of the information we cover here, we will beat these people. We don't have a choice.
[28:51.340 --> 28:54.820]  They're coming to kill us anyways. They are coming to kill you and your family. Know that
[28:54.820 --> 29:00.660]  their plan is to murder you and your family. Hey, everybody, let's go ahead and take another
[29:00.660 --> 29:05.220]  call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right.
[29:05.220 --> 29:09.700]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line. Alex,
[29:09.700 --> 29:15.380]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer. Supermell Vitality
[29:15.380 --> 29:20.660]  and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank. Supermell Vitality
[29:20.660 --> 29:25.580]  really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[29:25.580 --> 29:31.460]  heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work
[29:31.460 --> 29:36.540]  quite well that just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch
[29:36.540 --> 29:39.980]  is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[29:39.980 --> 29:42.940]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's
[29:42.940 --> 29:48.060]  just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like
[29:48.060 --> 29:59.540]  super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[29:59.540 --> 30:06.300]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[30:06.300 --> 30:11.780]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[30:11.780 --> 30:17.260]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has
[30:17.260 --> 30:20.740]  always been something that's important to have. It's a checkbox that everybody needs
[30:20.740 --> 30:25.700]  to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self defense and a relationship
[30:25.700 --> 30:30.900]  with God. But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in. Now,
[30:30.900 --> 30:34.740]  we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very,
[30:34.740 --> 30:39.860]  very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see more food
[30:39.860 --> 30:44.140]  supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking
[30:44.140 --> 30:51.300]  place. So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[30:51.300 --> 30:55.180]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and not under their
[30:55.180 --> 31:02.500]  control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com. The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[31:02.500 --> 31:08.300]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[31:08.300 --> 31:12.980]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an
[31:12.980 --> 31:18.380]  invisible asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[31:18.380 --> 31:23.720]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in
[31:23.720 --> 31:28.380]  less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is
[31:28.380 --> 31:33.220]  all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But there is only two things
[31:33.220 --> 31:38.820]  to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game. If enough people awaken
[31:38.820 --> 31:44.180]  from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will, the days
[31:44.180 --> 31:49.260]  of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare. Get up to a years worth
[31:49.260 --> 31:56.220]  of storeable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life saving
[31:56.220 --> 32:03.580]  knowledge at infowarstore.com. It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to
[32:03.580 --> 32:08.740]  grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers,
[32:08.740 --> 32:14.060]  corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a
[32:14.060 --> 32:19.140]  database of where you go and what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[32:19.140 --> 32:24.620]  they can shut you down. Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your
[32:24.620 --> 32:29.380]  bank accounts, protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[32:29.380 --> 32:35.700]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com. We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant
[32:35.700 --> 32:42.620]  made in America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible. It's a 360 win.
[32:42.620 --> 32:47.500]  Protect your privacy and shop at info wars to support the overall info war against the
[32:47.500 --> 32:53.500]  globalists. A true 360 win. Get your Faraday cages at infowarstore.com. Check out the new
[32:53.500 --> 33:01.300]  line. It's amazing.
[33:01.300 --> 33:08.300]  Creating a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:08.300 --> 33:36.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide. Okay. Let me play a little bit
[33:36.860 --> 33:42.420]  of Carlson's defense of free speech and defensive journalism last night. Why would he come out
[33:42.420 --> 33:47.460]  knowing he's going to be attacked and say Alex Jones is a better journalist than mainstream
[33:47.460 --> 33:56.380]  media that ABC, CBS, CNN? Well, because it's true. They lie to you on purpose. They're
[33:56.380 --> 34:04.420]  bought and paid for. They promote the ongoing tyranny of the COVID lockdowns. They prop
[34:04.420 --> 34:10.500]  up Joe Biden. And so all these Republicans and all these establishment types who aren't
[34:10.500 --> 34:16.300]  really globalist go along with the system because they're scared of the dying, dead
[34:16.300 --> 34:24.700]  dinosaur media, the zombie media, because it's been dead a long time. Tiny viewerships.
[34:24.700 --> 34:30.380]  Local AM radio shows that are number one in their town have up to 50 to 100,000 people
[34:30.380 --> 34:35.300]  listening to them in big cities. CNN doesn't have 100,000 viewers on their average show
[34:35.300 --> 34:43.460]  system wide. They have to pay to be in the airports. And so he is basically saying, hey,
[34:43.460 --> 34:50.460]  I don't go along with the system. I'm not scared of ridicule by them. I like Alex Jones.
[34:50.460 --> 34:54.380]  Not because he's trying to prop up Alex Jones, not because he's trying to earn brownie points
[34:54.380 --> 35:00.340]  with me, because Tucker Carlson knows that I'm a good person that's trying to tell the
[35:00.340 --> 35:03.980]  truth, and that it's really on to the new world order and understands what's happening
[35:03.980 --> 35:09.980]  and that we better break with the system or it's all over. Because when you're going along
[35:09.980 --> 35:18.500]  with the surface propaganda, you don't see the forest for the trees. You don't see when
[35:18.500 --> 35:24.620]  your feet are dangling over the side of the culvert, when your feet are dangling over the
[35:24.620 --> 35:30.460]  side of the creek, that while you're looking at that little bass swimming up to your lure,
[35:30.460 --> 35:34.740]  you didn't see an alligator swimming right up underneath your feet about to attack you.
[35:34.740 --> 35:39.100]  I'm going to show some of that footage in a minute of a family, and they're there on
[35:39.100 --> 35:45.700]  the side of the road with a culvert. And they're trying to catch some bass in Florida, and they
[35:45.700 --> 35:50.100]  don't see, because they're busy looking at the little bass in the reeds, that a big old
[35:50.100 --> 35:56.860]  15-foot alligator is coming up to eat the little girl. But as soon as you see the alligator,
[35:56.860 --> 36:00.740]  once they see it and jump up and point it out, you can't unsee it. But when you're looking
[36:00.740 --> 36:08.340]  at the bass and looking at the lure, you can't help as a hunter, as a human, who is designed
[36:08.340 --> 36:12.900]  to focus on your goal and what you're looking at, that while you're looking at the magician's
[36:12.900 --> 36:18.820]  beautiful assistant, he's getting the next trick ready, and putting the rabbit in the
[36:18.820 --> 36:23.540]  compartment under the hat. So while they're looking at the fish and the lure, right here
[36:23.540 --> 36:31.300]  is an alligator about to eat the little girl, and then finally they stand up and look and
[36:31.300 --> 36:37.580]  see it last minute and don't die. You see, that's the Alex Jones moment. When you pull
[36:37.580 --> 36:42.220]  back and go, wait, they want me to see this and that, let me pull back, whoa, there's
[36:42.220 --> 36:47.820]  the new world order alligator, the crocodile, about to eat you right there. That's my allegory
[36:47.820 --> 36:53.380]  of this show. Tucker has the understanding that we're not going to get out of this tyranny
[36:53.380 --> 36:59.260]  unless we break with the system and get out of their mind control and expand our awareness.
[36:59.260 --> 37:04.980]  We need the 35,000-foot view and we need the one-inch view. Instead, we're only focused
[37:04.980 --> 37:10.780]  on one little tiny corner of something instead of the big picture. So here's Tucker last
[37:10.780 --> 37:15.540]  night, really picking a fight with the establishment and throwing down the gauntlet. And this is
[37:15.540 --> 37:19.660]  what everybody else needs to do is stop being scared of info wars, stop being scared of
[37:19.660 --> 37:24.940]  talking about the new world order or the globalist or all these real things. The New York Times
[37:24.940 --> 37:28.780]  will call you names if you talk about globalists and say it doesn't exist. They have globalist
[37:28.780 --> 37:34.980]  conferences calling themselves globalists. Stop letting them bully you. Embrace liberty
[37:34.980 --> 37:39.540]  and freedom. Alex Jones was right. Is the maximum. They're scared of it. Here's Tucker
[37:39.540 --> 37:42.660]  Wilson. The January 6th committee has been an exercise
[37:42.660 --> 37:48.380]  in armed political intimidation. How did it start? You may have forgotten. Congress formed
[37:48.380 --> 37:52.500]  the committee after several members of the U.S. Capitol Police, the same people responsible
[37:52.500 --> 37:57.980]  for protecting members of Congress, anonymously commanded them to do it. So effectively, it
[37:57.980 --> 38:01.820]  was a ransom note. Prosecute our political opponents. That's an order from your bodyguards.
[38:01.820 --> 38:07.660]  Amazingly, they did it. So from the very first day, the January 6th committee was never
[38:07.660 --> 38:14.320]  about gathering information. Obviously, Congress already has the information. Nancy Pelosi knows
[38:14.320 --> 38:19.380]  exactly how many federal agents were in the crowd that day. She won't tell us. Pelosi could
[38:19.380 --> 38:25.100]  release thousands of hours of videotape evidence from January 6th. She refuses to do that.
[38:25.100 --> 38:30.100]  So whatever else this is, don't let them lie to you. This is not a fact-finding effort.
[38:30.100 --> 38:34.740]  This is a highly obvious attempt to punish critics of the Democratic Party. And for months,
[38:34.740 --> 38:39.100]  that's exactly what the committee has been doing. Using the pretext of January 6th, the
[38:39.100 --> 38:44.180]  Biden's Justice Department has indicted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. What? What was
[38:44.180 --> 38:48.700]  his crime exactly? Oh, talking about election fraud on a radio show. You know what we're
[38:48.700 --> 38:49.700]  going to do?
[38:49.700 --> 38:50.860]  Pelosi's January 6th committee...
[38:50.860 --> 38:56.860]  I usually nail it, but I looked at the time on this video wrong. It's a little bit longer
[38:56.860 --> 38:59.940]  than I thought. So we're going to go to break in four or five minutes, come back and I'll
[38:59.940 --> 39:03.220]  play it from the start again and then give commentary. But let me just speak to what
[39:03.220 --> 39:09.180]  he was getting to right there. Steve Bannon is asking for their subpoenas to him to be
[39:09.180 --> 39:12.860]  public, which in almost every case they would. They're declaring a bunch of weird national
[39:12.860 --> 39:17.900]  security stuff and saying no. And now he's trying to subpoena the committee, which you're
[39:17.900 --> 39:24.180]  supposed to do in a criminal case and they're saying no. He's been indicted for contempt
[39:24.180 --> 39:28.860]  of Congress two counts. And it's the same thing with my civil cases that the Democrat
[39:28.860 --> 39:34.900]  party runs. We gave them everything they wanted that wasn't even related to defamation and
[39:34.900 --> 39:41.860]  they just lied and said we didn't. But they again overstepped with Owen Schreuer because
[39:41.860 --> 39:46.420]  they never subpoenaed him. They never deposed him. They never asked him for a single thing
[39:46.420 --> 39:53.660]  and they said he too is defaulted for not giving them information. They don't even care
[39:53.660 --> 39:57.980]  if the fraud is totally transparent anymore. They're going for broke. They believe they
[39:57.980 --> 40:02.700]  control the military and the Justice Department and the media, but they don't control the
[40:02.700 --> 40:06.300]  military. The military hates the new world order. They don't control the public's mind.
[40:06.300 --> 40:10.580]  We hate the mainstream media. What you stole the election. So that means you're legitimate.
[40:10.580 --> 40:15.420]  Everybody hates Joe Biden. So as long as we're aware of that, understand their tricks, they're
[40:15.420 --> 40:23.100]  going to fail. Their problems are more lockdowns, more fear, more division, telling the vaccinated,
[40:23.100 --> 40:31.820]  oh, you're sick because of the unvaccinated, which is a total fraud on his face. And moving
[40:31.820 --> 40:38.940]  against us. And then so they can be the victims attacking their own facilities. Bombing Pfizer,
[40:38.940 --> 40:45.820]  bombing Moderna, bombing Bill Gates' facility in Washington state. That's the kind of stuff
[40:45.820 --> 40:52.580]  that's in their quiver. That's their arrows. Do not do it. Do not be violent. Do not engage
[40:52.580 --> 40:57.540]  in anything that would turn these people into victims. Expose the science. Expose how they're
[40:57.540 --> 41:02.060]  killing us. Expose their eugenics backgrounds. Expose how they lied about the shots working
[41:02.060 --> 41:06.140]  when they actually do work to make the sick and racial immune system and continue to hammer
[41:06.140 --> 41:12.180]  them and hammer them and hammer them. Let me go ahead and show the crocodile footage
[41:12.180 --> 41:16.940]  now and we'll come back and play the Tucker Carlson footage. This is Florida Everglades.
[41:16.940 --> 41:27.420]  Ever fails to amuse and terrify. And you can find it there on Kate Coral Jade's channel.
[41:27.420 --> 41:31.940]  And here's the family at the culvert fishing. And they don't see the alligator right there
[41:31.940 --> 41:38.620]  about to eat their daughter who's sitting on the edge of the culvert on the pipe on
[41:38.620 --> 41:42.580]  the road. So water can flow to the other side of the stream because they're too busy looking
[41:42.580 --> 41:49.580]  at the lure and the little fishies in the water. Here it is.
[41:49.580 --> 42:17.860]  Gators? Where'd he go? He said, that's plastic. The Gator car was sniffing. Oh my God. Holy
[42:17.860 --> 42:30.020]  God. Guys, I'm not kidding. Stop right there. We're going to come back with the rest of
[42:30.020 --> 42:34.580]  it next time. But the point is the little girl sees the Gator. She's toddling her feet,
[42:34.580 --> 42:39.340]  the little six year old, right above it. It's about to kill her. About to grab her. And
[42:39.340 --> 42:42.100]  she's like, oh, look, the Gator thought I was slipping. That's because he's coming up
[42:42.100 --> 42:45.740]  to get her. And then they're not listening to the child and finally go, whoa, my gosh,
[42:45.740 --> 42:49.420]  see, I'm like a little kid. I'm just dangling. I think, oh, no, there's the Gator. People
[42:49.420 --> 42:54.180]  don't see it yet. Once you see it, well, then you're all Alex Jones, but the global
[42:54.180 --> 43:01.860]  entrepreneur is coming to kill you for a fraction of the car. We have launched the most important
[43:01.860 --> 43:06.940]  sale of the year because now we've got a bunch of great products that have been sold out

[43:55.100 --> 44:01.180]  great products. The only way you fail is not taking action at infowarstore.com. The CEO
[44:01.180 --> 44:06.380]  of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are working
[44:06.380 --> 44:14.740]  for quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups
[44:14.740 --> 44:20.740]  are. They know that all over the world, their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[44:20.740 --> 44:25.900]  and Madonna's in trouble as well. They know that the people are starting to get wise this
[44:25.900 --> 44:30.980]  depopulation agenda. In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be
[44:30.980 --> 44:36.900]  soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front. And so
[44:36.900 --> 44:44.340]  people are waking up. The weapons work a little too good. They're supposed to be silent weapons
[44:44.340 --> 44:49.220]  for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise. But it's too late for
[44:49.220 --> 44:54.100]  return back now. They're coming after our children. So it's up to us to protect our
[44:54.100 --> 45:01.180]  little children or God will not look favorably on us. Remember, God is watching. The globalist
[45:01.180 --> 45:07.300]  are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals
[45:07.300 --> 45:11.620]  added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[45:11.620 --> 45:17.020]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful. And the social
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.220]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that
[45:22.220 --> 45:29.900]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary
[45:29.900 --> 45:35.620]  if the situation was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[45:35.620 --> 45:42.340]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong. And they know in
[45:42.340 --> 45:47.100]  the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important
[45:47.100 --> 45:50.540]  that everybody keep them for wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't
[45:50.540 --> 45:56.540]  believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing
[45:56.540 --> 46:00.540]  the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced. I've been fighting
[46:00.540 --> 46:06.660]  as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda.
[46:06.660 --> 46:12.380]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[46:12.380 --> 46:16.980]  But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[46:16.980 --> 46:22.980]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset.
[46:22.980 --> 46:27.300]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[46:27.300 --> 46:31.900]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[46:31.900 --> 46:35.220]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've
[46:35.220 --> 46:39.020]  also got to get personally prepared. And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[46:39.020 --> 46:44.740]  storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[46:44.740 --> 46:48.740]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[46:48.740 --> 46:54.100]  to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long
[46:54.100 --> 47:01.860]  lines and waits. Because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[47:01.860 --> 47:17.980]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:17.980 --> 47:47.820]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Very honored and thankful to be here.
[47:47.820 --> 47:53.780]  And if you're a radio listener, you hear me describing it, a family, a mother, a father,
[47:53.780 --> 47:57.100]  several of their children, their younger daughter, has their feet hanging over the side of a
[47:57.100 --> 48:02.460]  culvert at the Everglades and they're catching bass. And you see little fish about to hit
[48:02.460 --> 48:08.820]  their lure. And the little girl's going, oh, look, the gator's over here, the gator.
[48:08.820 --> 48:12.860]  They're not listening. They're busy watching the dad and the bass run into the water, not
[48:12.860 --> 48:16.740]  knowing that the gator is coming up to the little girl. And she's like, oh, he thought
[48:16.740 --> 48:23.300]  I was going to slip in because she sees him coming in her. She's thinking, oh, he thinks
[48:23.300 --> 48:26.740]  I'm jumping in with him. She's not even thinking he's about to kill her. But she would drag
[48:26.740 --> 48:33.540]  her under, drown her, and then put her under a sunken log until she got, became rotten
[48:33.540 --> 48:38.860]  so he could, you know, eat her. That's how they do it. They age your meat. It's a matter
[48:38.860 --> 48:42.740]  of you're at Disney World, your child's playing in the backyard at the condo you rent and
[48:42.740 --> 48:48.500]  they didn't clean out alligators, your child's going to get eaten too. But the point is,
[48:48.500 --> 48:56.220]  once you see that alligator, you can't unsee the alligator, ladies and gentlemen. Once
[48:56.220 --> 49:02.580]  you see the tiger in the bush or the lion about the ear of the wolf or the predator,
[49:02.580 --> 49:09.540]  the Fauci, you can't unsee it. But imagine people that don't see it. They're there, oh,
[49:09.540 --> 49:14.980]  Fauci and Obama are here to help us at the, at the elementary school, aren't they nice?
[49:14.980 --> 49:18.620]  They care so much about the children. Meanwhile, we have all the documents, the facts, they
[49:18.620 --> 49:22.580]  knew, they suppressed it. It's going to ruin their immune systems. So they have so many
[49:22.580 --> 49:28.540]  of them heart problems. And God knows what else kills almost all the rodents they did
[49:28.540 --> 49:35.540]  studies on it with. But people can't get their mind around, it's a predator. They just can't
[49:35.540 --> 49:40.500]  believe it. Because they're busy. Oh, the school plays coming up. Oh, my cell phone. Oh, my
[49:40.500 --> 49:43.940]  in-laws are coming down. Oh, we're going to go see a movie tonight. And you're distracted
[49:43.940 --> 49:49.660]  with a little fishing lure, the globalists have put in front of you, of Netflix, while
[49:49.660 --> 49:55.940]  you're already basically in the alligator's belly. So that's where we are. So Tucker Carlson
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.620]  understands that. He understands that in full wars is the most accurate overall operation
[50:00.620 --> 50:03.940]  out there. He can do his own research and everything we talk about. He can see it's
[50:03.940 --> 50:08.700]  there. And it's being adopted. I mean, Joe Rogan sounds more and more like Alex Jones
[50:08.700 --> 50:13.180]  every day. It's not that Joe even listens to me. He now gets the perspective he sees
[50:13.180 --> 50:20.100]  the alligator. He sees the elephant in the room. It's just like subliminal enemas just
[50:20.100 --> 50:23.420]  you see an image on a wall, you can't tell what it is. But as soon as somebody points
[50:23.420 --> 50:31.460]  it out, you can't unsee it. That's really what reset wars is all about. And it drops
[50:31.460 --> 50:38.460]  at reset wars.com on December 7. Hard to believe just five days from now. And you'll learn
[50:38.460 --> 50:44.860]  all about it then. Biggest thing we've done yet. So I am extremely blessed and honored
[50:44.860 --> 50:50.180]  to be in the zeitgeist. And you put me there. You kept us here. This is all of our victory.
[50:50.180 --> 50:54.460]  As bad as things are, at least we're the tip of the spear. And humanity's got a fighting
[50:54.460 --> 51:00.860]  chance and the globalists admit their programs of control are not going so well. People are
[51:00.860 --> 51:06.860]  ready to hear the truth now. And the red pill is info wars. Info wars is the symbol. Alex
[51:06.860 --> 51:14.980]  Jones was right. Is the maximum. And I said that just yesterday. And then you saw what
[51:14.980 --> 51:19.460]  Tucker Carlson said at night. He agrees. I'm going to leave it at that. I'm not talking
[51:19.460 --> 51:24.660]  about our private conversations. But he understands we need a chain reaction of leaders and of
[51:24.660 --> 51:30.700]  men and women to recognize the truth and say no to the globalist. We're not going to get
[51:30.700 --> 51:36.700]  out of this if we don't do it. The New World Order is very serious. The New World Order
[51:36.700 --> 51:42.900]  is very, very dangerous. The New World Order means business. And we're here now. We're
[51:42.900 --> 51:48.060]  not, oh, New World Order is coming. We're not, oh, you better listen. This is going to happen.
[51:48.060 --> 51:51.460]  We now know basically exactly what they're going to do. It's just the timeframe is a
[51:51.460 --> 51:57.500]  little fluid. But the good news is we know so we can make preparation for it and be who
[51:57.500 --> 52:02.620]  we were designed by God to be. This is the big test. Here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[52:02.620 --> 52:07.500]  The January 6th committee has been an exercise in armed political intimidation. How did it
[52:07.500 --> 52:12.660]  start? You may have forgotten. Congress formed the committee after several members of the
[52:12.660 --> 52:17.740]  U.S. Capitol Police, the same people responsible for protecting members of Congress, anonymously
[52:17.740 --> 52:21.940]  commanded them to do it. So effectively it was a ransom note. Prosecute our political
[52:21.940 --> 52:26.980]  opponents. That's an order from your bodyguards. Amazingly, they did it. So from the very first
[52:26.980 --> 52:33.220]  day, the January 6th committee was never about gathering information. Obviously, Congress
[52:33.220 --> 52:38.540]  already has the information. Nancy Pelosi knows exactly how many federal agents were
[52:38.540 --> 52:43.060]  in the crowd that day. She won't tell us. Pelosi could release thousands of hours of
[52:43.060 --> 52:48.500]  videotape evidence from January 6th. She refuses to do that. So whatever else this is, don't
[52:48.500 --> 52:53.980]  let them lie to you. This is not a fact finding effort. This is a highly obvious attempt to
[52:53.980 --> 52:57.980]  punish critics of the Democratic Party. And for months, that's exactly what the committee
[52:57.980 --> 53:03.020]  has been doing. Using the pretext of January 6th, the Biden's Justice Department has indicted
[53:03.020 --> 53:08.700]  former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. What? What was his crime exactly? Oh, talking about election
[53:08.700 --> 53:14.840]  fraud on a radio show. That's illegal now. Pelosi's January 6th committee had him arrested.
[53:14.840 --> 53:20.100]  Liz Cheney, by the way, who is being used as a Republican cover for all of this, stood
[53:20.100 --> 53:23.960]  back and watched it happen. Liz Cheney should be ashamed, but she's become far too degraded
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.300]  for shame, unfortunately. And Bannon, by the way, is not the only prominent Republican
[53:28.300 --> 53:32.500]  who might go to jail. The committee has now subpoenaed several former Trump advisers as
[53:32.500 --> 53:37.980]  well as the fiance of another. They've even subpoenaed Roger Stone yet again. Where was
[53:37.980 --> 53:42.420]  Stone on January 6th? He was in a hotel room as the Capitol was being breached. He had
[53:42.420 --> 53:47.460]  literally nothing to do with it, but it doesn't matter. He's criticized Joe Biden. He could
[53:47.460 --> 53:52.220]  be going to jail again. Now the committees decide to shut down one of the most popular
[53:52.220 --> 53:57.060]  journalists on the right, Alex Jones. Yes, journalist. Jones is often mocked for his
[53:57.060 --> 54:02.300]  flamboyance, but the truth is he has been a far better guide to reality in recent years.
[54:02.300 --> 54:07.100]  In other words, a far better journalist than, say, NBC News national security correspondent
[54:07.100 --> 54:13.500]  Ken Delanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for
[54:13.500 --> 54:18.260]  a second. And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just
[54:18.260 --> 54:22.980]  as journalists are supposed to do. He wouldn't just slobber all over him. But Alex Jones
[54:22.980 --> 54:28.020]  makes fun of Joe Biden, so the January 6th committee is threatening him with prison.
[54:28.020 --> 54:32.300]  Now the irony here, and there are many layers of irony here, but the main one is that Alex
[54:32.300 --> 54:38.620]  Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th. Alex Jones actively worked
[54:38.620 --> 54:44.380]  to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th. We're not running interference for Alex
[54:44.380 --> 54:48.140]  Jones, and we're not guessing about it. We happen to know this for a fact, because we
[54:48.140 --> 54:52.460]  looked into it in some detail for Patriot Purge. It's our three-part documentary series
[54:52.460 --> 54:54.380]  on Fox Nation. Here are the facts.
[54:54.380 --> 55:05.940]  So, the Republican Party, I just want them to hear this message. Look at this crowd.
[55:05.940 --> 55:08.940]  We are the people that you must represent for real.
[55:08.940 --> 55:12.700]  January the 6th was all about. It was just about making sure that if you called yourself
[55:12.700 --> 55:18.860]  a conservative that you stood with the conservative movement. And unfortunately, it spiraled
[55:18.860 --> 55:24.340]  out of control. We coordinated with the U.S. Capitol Police nearly every day. A lot of
[55:24.340 --> 55:28.900]  people don't know that Stop the Steel actually had a permit on the Capitol grounds, so not
[55:28.900 --> 55:34.420]  the Capitol itself and not the Capitol Plaza. The Capitol grounds law 8, we had a permit.
[55:34.420 --> 55:41.180]  So let's just imagine this. 20,000 to 50,000 people inside the president's park. We're
[55:41.180 --> 55:45.820]  sitting there at the very front. I'm dead center of the president, front row. A Trump
[55:45.820 --> 55:49.420]  campaign staffer walks up to me and says, you know, I'll leave. There are people leaving
[55:49.420 --> 55:55.740]  the overflow, and there are already tens of thousands of people at the U.S. Capitol.
[55:55.740 --> 56:00.900]  With your presence and the presence of Alex Jones, why don't you guys walk down Pennsylvania,
[56:00.900 --> 56:08.140]  gather people together, and then position them for your rally on lot 8. I wasn't at
[56:08.140 --> 56:14.500]  the Capitol when it descended into chaos. And that's only by God's grace because I
[56:14.500 --> 56:18.180]  was scheduled to be there. Secret Service let us out at a point where we would have
[56:18.180 --> 56:25.580]  been there when the first punch was thrown. And that's strange. The only reason that we
[56:25.580 --> 56:36.860]  weren't there is because we stopped and gave an impromptu speech. I get a text from the
[56:36.860 --> 56:46.340]  campaign that you should get there and de-escalate because things are not going well. So we started
[56:46.340 --> 56:51.740]  to approach the side of the Capitol where no protest had happened in November, no protest
[56:51.740 --> 56:56.380]  had happened in December. All I thought was, I need to get them to the other side, and
[56:56.380 --> 57:06.740]  I need to get them to lot 8. And all we are equipped with are our megaphones. Maybe if
[57:06.740 --> 57:15.260]  1,000 people are listening to us, and 75 to 100,000 people there in front of us, and
[57:15.260 --> 57:29.460]  it was a very helpless feeling. So the trail of that documentary got a lot
[57:29.460 --> 57:33.180]  of attention. If you haven't seen the documentary itself, we think that you should. It's called
[57:33.180 --> 57:37.740]  Patriot Purge. We think it is the most comprehensive, the most honest, the most fact-based account
[57:37.740 --> 57:42.140]  of what actually happened on January 6th and what has happened on the basis of January
[57:42.140 --> 57:46.740]  6th that has been made. We're really proud of it. You can start streaming Fox Nation,
[57:46.740 --> 57:50.740]  by the way, by going to Tucker Carlson.com. There are so many. Let's go ahead and take
[57:50.740 --> 57:55.540]  another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right.
[57:55.540 --> 57:59.940]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patriots can get on the line. Alex,
[57:59.940 --> 58:05.660]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer. Supermell Vitality
[58:05.660 --> 58:10.940]  and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank. Supermell Vitality
[58:10.940 --> 58:15.860]  really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[58:15.860 --> 58:21.700]  heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. They also work
[58:21.700 --> 58:26.780]  quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch
[58:26.780 --> 58:30.220]  is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[58:30.220 --> 58:33.220]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's
[58:33.220 --> 58:38.300]  just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like
[58:38.300 --> 58:43.260]  super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[58:43.260 --> 58:59.860]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[58:59.860 --> 59:04.260]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[59:04.260 --> 59:10.820]  in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will ever emerge.
[59:10.820 --> 59:16.260]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[59:16.260 --> 59:24.980]  faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute
[59:24.980 --> 59:32.700]  surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future
[59:32.700 --> 59:37.260]  destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable
[59:37.260 --> 59:42.740]  microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if
[59:42.740 --> 59:48.340]  we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance,
[59:48.340 --> 1:00:13.180]  noncompliance. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:21.780]  A woman who experienced a wonderful open free society described as a paradise. I'll just
[1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:26.620]  by her, but by people that experienced it and outsiders that wrote about it at the time
[1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:32.180]  in Africa, who then witnessed it overnight be destroyed into a authoritarian communist
[1:00:32.180 --> 1:00:38.420]  hell hole is going to be joining us, elicitate for 30 minutes, coming up at the start of
[1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:44.340]  the next segment. But I wanted to air this extremely powerful report again. That's at
[1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:53.180]  Bandot video in the Gregory's section. Fauci's dead baby's graves from the past only has
[1:00:53.180 --> 1:01:02.020]  183,000 views, folks, that he literally took children from their parents and murdered them.
[1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:06.500]  Murdered them. This will bring them down. The whole media is trying to prop up Fauci
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:17.540]  because he's the kingpan. Get the video and share it. Here it is.
[1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:24.300]  The reception of Robert Kennedy Jr.'s book, The Real Anthony Fauci is clear evidence of
[1:01:24.300 --> 1:01:33.380]  a mass awakening. The people are waking up to see Fauci for what he is, an absolute psychopath.
[1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:39.820]  We've learned of how he directed experiments at the NIAID in which beagles had their vocal
[1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:47.780]  cords removed and their heads enclosed in cages where sand fleas ate them alive. And
[1:01:47.780 --> 1:01:54.680]  we've learned of how he fraudulently used PCR tests to illegitimately push a known deadly
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:02.940]  drug upon tens of thousands of people. And many are now learning that in 1992, under
[1:02:02.940 --> 1:02:11.500]  the direction of Anthony Fauci, the NIAID funded drug trials on HIV positive children. Although
[1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:17.940]  many of the children were healthy and asymptomatic, they had merely tested positive via faulty
[1:02:17.940 --> 1:02:24.420]  PCR tests administered through New York's Child Welfare Department, who then handed
[1:02:24.420 --> 1:02:30.300]  them over to the deadly experiments. Most of the drugs being tested on the children
[1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:37.400]  were already known to cause deformities, organ failure, brain damage, and other lethal side
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:43.860]  effects. And yet the children were required to continue with the drugs regardless of negative
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:50.700]  side effects. Those administering the drugs were explicitly told that all adverse side
[1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:57.100]  effects they witnessed in the children were being caused by the HIV infection and not
[1:02:57.100 --> 1:03:04.300]  the drugs. When parents refused to consent to these barbaric trials, children's services
[1:03:04.300 --> 1:03:10.580]  took their kids and placed them with foster families or children's homes where participation
[1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:16.660]  in the trial would be assured. When the children resisted the deadly drugs, they were brought
[1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:22.500]  to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where plastic tubes were surgically inserted into
[1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:28.420]  their stomachs, and the deadly drugs they were trying to escape were pumped directly into
[1:03:28.420 --> 1:03:35.260]  their bodies. Once the children died, their bodies were added to a mass grave in Hawthorne,
[1:03:35.260 --> 1:03:42.300]  New York, a large pit with astroturf thrown over it. To get around the Nuremberg Code
[1:03:42.300 --> 1:03:48.780]  and other laws, the state of New York created a special review board comprised of the hospital
[1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:56.020]  stakeholders. One may wonder, other than torturing and killing innocent children, what were they
[1:03:56.020 --> 1:04:01.060]  trying to accomplish? They already knew of the negative side effects that these drugs
[1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:07.380]  were having on adults. But the more we learn about Anthony Fauci, the more we realize that
[1:04:07.380 --> 1:04:15.140]  he is an absolute psychopath. And it doesn't matter why psychopaths do what they do. Fauci
[1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:22.700]  and his criminal cohorts belong in cages, at the very least. Anthony Fauci is just one
[1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:28.860]  old crook in a mass of conspiracy that is aggressively pushing to inject everyone's
[1:04:28.860 --> 1:04:36.340]  children with the new deadly and debilitating mRNA experimental jabs. Whether you like it
[1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:45.100]  or not, going after Fauci is a drop in the bucket. But at least it's a start. For infowars.com,

[1:06:03.700 --> 1:06:15.860]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.860 --> 1:06:22.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Melissa Tate joins us. She's a Christian conservative author,
[1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:25.980]  activist, political commentator, and social media influencer born and raised in Africa
[1:06:25.980 --> 1:06:31.300]  in Zimbabwe. Melissa came to the United States the age of 19 to attend college, where she
[1:06:31.300 --> 1:06:34.420]  earned a degree in business administration for working for a large bank for three years.
[1:06:34.420 --> 1:06:38.940]  As an investment advisor, Melissa started her own business. By the age of 27, Tate had
[1:06:38.940 --> 1:06:42.620]  a thriving small business with several employees. In recent years, Melissa has been making
[1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:46.860]  a transition from business to political activism. She is married to her college sweetheart and
[1:06:46.860 --> 1:06:53.100]  is today a mother of three. RealMelissaTate.com and the right Melissa on Twitter. And she
[1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:56.660]  has a lot of courage and has pro free speech and has defended us when we've been under
[1:06:56.660 --> 1:07:00.300]  attack. We really appreciate her. And she's been on a few times before. She's only got
[1:07:00.300 --> 1:07:04.220]  two seconds. We wish she had longer. We know she's busy, hardworking lady. But I've heard
[1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:09.900]  you on other shows because I'm a fan. I follow you. I've heard you talk about Zimbabwe and
[1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:14.220]  your experience. And I've read about that. I've seen some of the film. It was like Hawaii,
[1:07:14.220 --> 1:07:21.260]  as I was described. Paradise, super low crime, happy people, folks getting highly educated.
[1:07:21.260 --> 1:07:25.660]  I mean, a real example, a real oasis, and then destroyed basically overnight by Robert
[1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:31.340]  Mugabe. And you draw parallels to that to hear what we saw in Venezuela. Also rich in
[1:07:31.340 --> 1:07:35.660]  the 60s, Venezuela had more money per capita than Americans. Now it's a hell. Same story
[1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:39.420]  over and over again. And it's what really concerns you because you love America so
[1:07:39.420 --> 1:07:44.060]  much. I'm putting words in your mouth, but I've heard you speak to this. Please recap
[1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:50.060]  that for folks that haven't heard your story because it's really informative. Yeah, absolutely.
[1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:56.780]  So I came to the United States when I was 19 years old and I came from Zimbabwe. And Zimbabwe
[1:07:56.780 --> 1:08:01.580]  growing up was a great country. It was actually known as the bread basket of Africa because
[1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:09.900]  we were exporting food to regions. The entire Southern African region depended on Zimbabwe
[1:08:09.900 --> 1:08:15.420]  for agricultural products and food and so forth. So Zimbabwe was nicknamed the bread
[1:08:15.420 --> 1:08:21.740]  basket of Africa and we used to supply flowers and all kinds of agricultural products even
[1:08:21.740 --> 1:08:27.980]  to Europe. We had flights leaving Zimbabwe every day to Europe just with flowers, for example.
[1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:33.260]  So Zimbabwe was just this beautiful country, cosmopolitan. I mean, when I went to school,
[1:08:33.260 --> 1:08:37.020]  I went to a private school and I went to a school with people from all over the world.
[1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:45.500]  I'm talking Sweden, Yugoslavia, Botswana, South Africa, people from all over the world, Australia.
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:51.580]  So a lot of people migrated to Zimbabwe and lived there because it was such a great country to live
[1:08:51.580 --> 1:08:58.460]  in. It was very peaceful. I used to walk miles to school even as a young child. Never had any
[1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:06.380]  issues. Very peaceful, very open-minded, very cosmopolitan, great weather. They say it has
[1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:12.540]  the best climate in the world, you know, till today. You know, we have 82-degree days pretty
[1:09:12.540 --> 1:09:18.780]  much every day and our winters are like 75 degrees. So it was just great growing up there. I could
[1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:25.260]  never have asked to live anywhere else but in Zimbabwe. And describe what you witnessed in
[1:09:25.260 --> 1:09:30.300]  the timeframe growing up of it, going from, I've heard it described as Westerners that live there
[1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:38.460]  as like Hawaii and just being this paradise and then now just destroyed. Well, it's actually a
[1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:44.700]  lot like South Florida is what I would describe it as. Actually, when I go to South Florida,
[1:09:44.700 --> 1:09:50.700]  it's so reminiscent of Harare, which is where I grew up, the capital city. You know, the palm trees,
[1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:57.180]  the bungalows, beautiful streets, you know, lined with palm trees and so forth. So, you know, it was
[1:09:57.180 --> 1:10:02.860]  a great country. Yeah, beautiful pictures you're showing over there, Jacaranda trees, purple trees
[1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:07.900]  and it was just an amazing place to grow up. And then gradually, I mean, this,
[1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:13.660]  it happened over a 20-year period. So when I look at what's going on right now in America,
[1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:18.140]  you know, you may not feel like this is something that is happening now, but it is something that
[1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:23.900]  is going to take some time. It may take five years, 10 years before you actually see a total
[1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:30.380]  collapse like we saw in Zimbabwe, because it started gradually, probably in the early 90s,
[1:10:30.380 --> 1:10:35.340]  now looking back in retrospect, because I was young, but now looking back in retrospect,
[1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:41.580]  I started realizing how, you know, the IMF, you know, had come in and they had this economic
[1:10:41.580 --> 1:10:47.420]  structural redevelopment plan that they instituted in Zimbabwe, where they basically were encouraging
[1:10:47.420 --> 1:10:53.260]  Zimbabwe to devalue their currency, you know, in exchange for all this funding that they were
[1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:59.100]  going to give Zimbabwe. So already in the 90s, I started to hear, you know, family, older family
[1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:07.900]  members complaining about inflation and so forth, but it wasn't so bad until it hit probably 2002,
[1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:13.820]  is when we started to see real hyperinflation. I mean, I remember when I was first coming to
[1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:20.540]  Zimbabwe, because in the earlier, earlier on, like maybe in the early 90s, the Zimbabwe dollar was
[1:11:20.540 --> 1:11:25.820]  so strong, I mean, it was even stronger than the US dollar, because it was one is to one
[1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:30.780]  with the British pound, probably in the 80s. In the 90s, you know, people were complaining,
[1:11:30.780 --> 1:11:36.540]  because it was like one is to 10, which, you know, that was a big jump. And then by the time
[1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:42.540]  I was coming to the United States, it was now one dollar was about 30, I mean, one US dollar was
[1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:47.340]  now about 35 US dollars, and people were totally freaking out, because we were not used to that,
[1:11:47.340 --> 1:11:54.380]  you know, 35 dollars for every Zimbabwe, for every US dollar. And then now you fast forward from
[1:11:54.380 --> 1:12:00.460]  that point, when I started leaving for Zimbabwe, it was really hard for my mother to even get US
[1:12:00.460 --> 1:12:06.540]  dollars from the bank. So people had to go to the black market. So the bank rate would be 35
[1:12:06.540 --> 1:12:11.980]  dollars for one US dollar, but then on the black market, it would be like 150, which is ridiculous,
[1:12:11.980 --> 1:12:18.940]  150 of your own money to get one US dollar. And that was a lot of money back then. And then you
[1:12:18.940 --> 1:12:25.980]  fast forward within like two years, it went to like, from one US dollars, one is 35 dollars to
[1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:33.580]  like one US dollars, now $1,000, you know, and then, and so on and so on, until it became like,
[1:12:33.580 --> 1:12:39.420]  you're showing that hundred trillion dollar note to where one US dollar, you needed to have something
[1:12:39.420 --> 1:12:48.140]  like 500 million Zimbabwe dollars. And that's how quickly the currency just devalued. It was almost
[1:12:48.140 --> 1:12:54.460]  like it happened overnight. I mean, I remember being in the store with my mom, and we are putting
[1:12:55.260 --> 1:13:02.540]  groceries in the cart. And by the time we get to the checkout, the checkout lady tells us that
[1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:07.820]  the price has changed, it's gone up. And that's how quickly the prices were changing. You're
[1:13:07.820 --> 1:13:14.060]  literally shopping in the supermarket. When you get to checkout, the price has to be readjusted,
[1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:19.180]  because that's how quickly the inflation was. So I looked at the percentage before I came on,
[1:13:19.180 --> 1:13:24.540]  and I see different percentages that were estimated of percentage of inflation. One of
[1:13:24.540 --> 1:13:32.620]  the ones that I saw was something like 750 million percent inflation. So as you can imagine, people
[1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:37.900]  were losing everything. I mean, I remember even my mother, she had investments like in, you know,
[1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:43.660]  she had stocks, she had life insurance, she had all these types of, you know, things that she had
[1:13:43.660 --> 1:13:50.220]  saved for in her lifetime, her retirement account, it all came to nothing literally like you could
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:55.820]  literally go buy a bag of groceries with your life savings. So when you hear, when you hear Biden
[1:13:55.820 --> 1:14:00.460]  and the private central bank, the Federal Reserve and all of them saying inflation is actually good,
[1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:05.020]  but historically it never is. And what happened in Weimar, Germany, where people would pay for
[1:14:05.020 --> 1:14:09.100]  their dinner at the beginning of dinner, because it might be 20, 30, 40 percent more. And just a
[1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:15.740]  few hours, you experienced what Weimar, Germany, which we know what that brought in. You experienced
[1:14:15.740 --> 1:14:20.620]  that yourself. What is it like now to be a successful American, an American dream, exactly
[1:14:20.620 --> 1:14:26.060]  the type of immigrant we want, amazing person to see now another country you love being destroyed?
[1:14:26.060 --> 1:14:32.700]  Well, Alex, this is what makes me speak up, because I don't want to see what happened to Zimbabwe
[1:14:32.700 --> 1:14:38.140]  happen in the United States. And sadly, I'm starting to see the parallels. You know, just listening
[1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:44.140]  to Biden and the Democrats is literally like deja vu taking place, because I hear them talking
[1:14:44.140 --> 1:14:48.940]  about printing all this money. And that's exactly what was happening leading up to the economic
[1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:56.300]  collapse that we had in Zimbabwe, is the spending, reckless spending, printing of money
[1:14:57.100 --> 1:15:05.580]  out of a zoo. So it's just, it's just really hard to watch, because it's it, I'm seeing so many
[1:15:05.580 --> 1:15:11.820]  parallels from what was happening leading up to what happened in Zimbabwe. And I just, I just
[1:15:11.820 --> 1:15:17.420]  want to warn Americans, you know, because one of the things that I learned from that situation
[1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:23.340]  was that having tangible assets is what really is going to save you from this. Because the one
[1:15:23.340 --> 1:15:29.580]  thing that survived from my mom's life savings was the one little property that she had, you know,
[1:15:29.580 --> 1:15:36.460]  and that never went away until today, you know, she still has it. And when you think about all
[1:15:36.460 --> 1:15:43.660]  the other investments that she had, they came to nothing, you know, so that that that's a learning
[1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:47.660]  experience. That was a learning experience. Absolutely. Well, we're learning through your
[1:15:47.660 --> 1:15:51.500]  experience. But listen, take one more segment with you, and we'll talk about what's currently
[1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:54.780]  happening in the world and your ideas to get us out of it straight ahead. Stay with us.
[1:15:58.540 --> 1:16:03.100]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex.
[1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:07.340]  Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get
[1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:13.660]  on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your cohosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[1:16:13.660 --> 1:16:19.340]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank. SuperMail
[1:16:19.340 --> 1:16:24.940]  Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:31.260]  heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions. They also work quite well,
[1:16:31.260 --> 1:16:35.980]  but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. It's it's it's like each batch is
[1:16:35.980 --> 1:16:39.900]  different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just OK. People are like, why are you selling
[1:16:39.900 --> 1:16:43.820]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:49.660]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the
[1:16:49.660 --> 1:17:01.660]  Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it. In late August, in full Warsaw, an explosion
[1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:09.020]  of orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by
[1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:15.580]  design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and
[1:17:15.580 --> 1:17:19.580]  gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have. It's a checkbox that
[1:17:19.580 --> 1:17:25.100]  everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration, self defense and a relationship

[1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:44.220]  and you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[1:17:44.220 --> 1:17:50.460]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at info or store.com.
[1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:55.180]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and not under their control.
[1:17:55.180 --> 1:18:02.780]  So get prepared now at info or store.com. I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball
[1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:08.300]  games. I like going to concerts. I like going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the
[1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:14.540]  metropolitan life. I like everything that comes with this. But see, I have the survival instinct
[1:18:14.540 --> 1:18:20.460]  that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:25.340]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to
[1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:28.860]  the woods? Just trying to go get a piece of property in the woods and just get off grid,
[1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:33.020]  just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the survival instinct. But
[1:18:33.020 --> 1:18:37.740]  see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:41.580]  stay in the city. The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever
[1:18:41.580 --> 1:18:46.940]  notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal struggle that my guess is
[1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:52.700]  a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can at least have some comfort
[1:18:52.700 --> 1:18:56.860]  if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:58.860 --> 1:18:59.740]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[1:20:02.860 --> 1:20:19.740]  of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Melissa Tate is
[1:20:19.740 --> 1:20:23.820]  riding shotgun with us till 45 after. Then I'm going to hit all the other world news
[1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:27.580]  and information that's breaking. There's a lot of it at infowars.com.
[1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:33.100]  I put the headline up this morning. The 4th Reich is here. Germany announces new lockdowns,
[1:20:33.100 --> 1:20:38.220]  forced injections to start February 1st. That is so huge. Paul Watson put a new video out at
[1:20:38.220 --> 1:20:42.860]  Bandai Video just minutes ago titled Germany Has Fallen. We're going to air that after Tate leaves
[1:20:42.860 --> 1:20:47.660]  us. But this is really big historic stuff. And people will go, oh, well, it's just third world
[1:20:47.660 --> 1:20:52.700]  countries like Venezuela or Mexico or Zimbabwe that have this. No, the same central banks,
[1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:57.820]  the same globalist forces go in. They get leaders that will do this. And then for the first few
[1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:02.380]  years, and you heard her took 20 for it really to get, you tore it ended, where it took a trillion
[1:21:02.380 --> 1:21:08.140]  bucks for a loaf of bread or whatever, they would buy up real things with the money they
[1:21:08.140 --> 1:21:14.460]  printed to take control. Then they leave you with all the inflation, the devaluation, and it destroys
[1:21:14.460 --> 1:21:20.140]  poor people in the middle class. So what she's saying isn't just a warning. It's the same globalist
[1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:24.700]  groups now doing it to us that they know they're destroying our countries. They know they're
[1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:29.260]  destroying our futures. This is the great reset. Melissa, your view on the great reset and what's
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:33.180]  currently happening in America and the culture wars and how they're all trying to make us fight
[1:21:33.180 --> 1:21:37.180]  with each other. Isn't that just the British Empire divide and conquer strategy over and over again?
[1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:44.540]  Absolutely, it is. And the thing is, what's happening here is the exact same thing that
[1:21:44.540 --> 1:21:50.300]  happened in Zimbabwe that divide and conquer narrative. Like I go into the race issue with what
[1:21:50.300 --> 1:21:55.980]  happened in Zimbabwe is there's a strong parallel to what's going on right now. You see the demonization
[1:21:55.980 --> 1:22:00.700]  of white people is the exact same thing that happened in Zimbabwe leading up to the collapse.
[1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:07.020]  And really the collapse was triggered by that demonization of the white farmers in Zimbabwe.
[1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:11.820]  And those were the people that were producers. They were the producers of the agricultural
[1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:17.180]  industry. So when that completely fell apart, when they were scapegoated for all the problems
[1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:21.420]  that were happening in the country, because basically, I mean, you had corrupt government
[1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:26.940]  that was taking people's pension funds, taking people's money. And when people started to wake
[1:22:26.940 --> 1:22:32.380]  up to it and start living in poverty, they started to question it and started going after the government.
[1:22:32.380 --> 1:22:37.980]  And instead of taking ownership of their own failed policies, they just shifted the attention
[1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:43.500]  over to the white farmers and scapegoated them and said, well, your problem is not us.
[1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:48.620]  Your problem is the white farmers. They took all your land. So that's when that rhetoric
[1:22:48.620 --> 1:22:58.300]  started coming. And that rhetoric didn't exist prior to that. Because when Mugabe came into power,
[1:22:58.300 --> 1:23:04.700]  he was very welcoming to the white community. And so when I grew up in Zimbabwe, there was
[1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:13.900]  really no racial contention or the attitude was, we're going to move forward from colonization
[1:23:13.900 --> 1:23:17.340]  in all these colonial years that we've been through. But we're going to look forward. We're
[1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:22.540]  going to look to the future. And that was the narrative for the longest time that I was growing
[1:23:22.540 --> 1:23:27.260]  up there. And then all of a sudden, there's a shift. Oh, it's the white people. They're the
[1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:31.420]  problem. They're the reason why the country's falling apart. And then everybody turns the
[1:23:31.420 --> 1:23:37.580]  attention to the white farmers as the root of all the problems in Zimbabwe. And it simply wasn't
[1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:41.820]  simply wasn't true. And then for those that don't know, there was an ethnic cleansing that took
[1:23:41.820 --> 1:23:46.860]  place in the very same communist international forces have now done that in South Africa.
[1:23:46.860 --> 1:23:51.420]  And they're now trying to run those same ideas in Europe and here. It's the most powerful banks
[1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:55.740]  and families. Again, they're going to loot everybody and then make it a racial issue.
[1:23:55.740 --> 1:24:01.180]  This is a tried and trusted game. Do you think they'll be able to replay this yet again?
[1:24:01.180 --> 1:24:08.460]  And do it again? Well, I see it happening right now in the United States. They've basically
[1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:14.380]  instituted critical race theory in every sphere of American culture. When you're looking at every
[1:24:14.380 --> 1:24:22.540]  sphere of influence, you're talking education, media, entertainment, sports, you know, education,
[1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:27.660]  everything, every sphere of influence right now is now riddled with critical race theory.
[1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:33.180]  And it seems like that is the operating system that they're using to take down America.
[1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:38.060]  Because everything that you see happening is being filtered through this critical race theory
[1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:42.300]  narrative, that it's the white people that are bad. It's the reason why everything is,
[1:24:42.940 --> 1:24:47.260]  you know, falling apart. It's white people. It's white people. It's white people. And you see
[1:24:47.260 --> 1:24:52.540]  that it's a tactic that, you know, Marxists have always used so they exploit whatever
[1:24:52.540 --> 1:24:57.420]  division they can exploit in any country. Exactly. And that's what we'll be clear about.
[1:24:57.420 --> 1:25:03.420]  The Marxists don't want groups working together and people promoting prosperity because then
[1:25:03.420 --> 1:25:08.220]  they can't control you. And so it wasn't, quote, mainly white people that were owning things or
[1:25:08.220 --> 1:25:12.380]  running things in Venezuela, but it was still the landowners, the wealthy people. They were
[1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:16.300]  really just the upper middle class and the folks that lived there and cared and managed things
[1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:20.540]  and built things. And then over a few decades, they took it all away and now it's all destroyed
[1:25:20.540 --> 1:25:26.220]  and collapsed. So this is communist ideology. It's done over and over and over again. They're
[1:25:26.220 --> 1:25:32.140]  running the exact same play here in America today. And we were just showing footage in ASU
[1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:35.420]  where they're saying they don't want Carl Rittenhouse to go to Arizona State University,
[1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:39.580]  even though he's already been unenrolled there months ago. And they're communists saying,
[1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:44.460]  Carl Rittenhouse killed brown people. We don't want to murder. We didn't kill brown people.
[1:25:44.460 --> 1:25:49.820]  And then they go on to chant death to America. I mean, my God, these people are the plague.
[1:25:49.820 --> 1:25:57.340]  They are cancer. It's pure communism, Alex. That's what it is. I mean, now I just started
[1:25:57.340 --> 1:26:01.420]  to connect all the dots when I started to see it happening here in the United States.
[1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:06.540]  Because when I came to the United States 18 years ago, the race issue was never even an
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:12.460]  issue at all. Like you would never turn on the TV and start to hear about racism and all this
[1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:17.900]  stuff. This is something that started to creep in. And probably in the second term of Obama
[1:26:17.900 --> 1:26:24.220]  is when I started to notice it. And towards, I mean, and then the left just took it into overdrive
[1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:29.420]  during Trump. And that's when I started to connect the dots. I'm like, okay, this is the exact same
[1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:35.340]  playbook that was played in Zimbabwe that is now being played over here. It's just the divide and
[1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:39.900]  conquer narrative. I mean, if you look at it in Russia, you know, they couldn't exploit race because
[1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:45.580]  everybody uses the same color. But in any country where there is a, you know, different races,
[1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:50.300]  they exploit the racial issue. Exactly. And that's what the CIA is trained to do. Since it's been
[1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:55.500]  controlled by leftists, basically, since its founding is using sociology. But in Russia,
[1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:59.900]  they would play Orthodox off against Catholics. Same thing, Ukraine, they'll take any difference
[1:26:59.900 --> 1:27:07.740]  they can to create that control. Absolutely. Yeah. And what we need to do is to transcend
[1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:11.900]  that. And that's, that's what I speak about. That's the one, one of the things that I try to speak
[1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:17.740]  about and really zone in on is the race issue. Because I say that, you know, we need to come
[1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:22.460]  together as humanity and realize that we have a common enemy. No matter what color you are,
[1:27:22.460 --> 1:27:27.020]  whether you're black, whether you're brown, whether you're white, whatever color you are,
[1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:32.940]  really, we have a common enemy. And it is the people that are trying to destroy prosperity and
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:37.740]  freedom, people that are trying to destroy the renaissance that we live in right now. Because
[1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:42.380]  when you look at this as a historical context, you look and you see that before America,
[1:27:42.380 --> 1:27:47.180]  we lived under a feudal system. Humanity has always lived under a feudal system where you had
[1:27:47.180 --> 1:27:52.940]  a tiny group of elites that controlled everything. And then the masses were just poor and lived at
[1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:59.260]  the behest and at the service of the tiny, rich elite. And then now we live in an enlightened
[1:27:59.260 --> 1:28:05.100]  period, but we've always lived in it. So we just take it for granted. And the thing is the education
[1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:10.780]  system has been so dumbed down to where people don't have this historical context that we're
[1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:16.780]  literally living through the best time in history for humanity, where we have liberty and freedom
[1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:23.340]  and have the power to make something of ourselves where we have a power to go from a poor class
[1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:29.980]  to make and become successful, something that I did. I came to the United States at 19 with
[1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:35.900]  literally $300 in my pocket and a suitcase full of clothes. Within less than a decade, I had a
[1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:42.700]  business that was doing seven figures in revenue. I had multiple employees. I graduated with a
[1:28:42.700 --> 1:28:48.700]  business degree. You know, I had a good life. And that is something that is very unique to the
[1:28:48.700 --> 1:28:53.020]  United States. And absolutely, it's a place where you can shine and shine. You do. One more
[1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:59.340]  segment with Melissa Tade. Please stay with us. So many people say we have launched the most

[1:29:54.540 --> 1:30:00.380]  is not taking action at infowarstore.com. Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to
[1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:04.860]  Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right. I will make this quick and
[1:30:04.860 --> 1:30:10.140]  real short where the other Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one
[1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:16.380]  of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail Vitality and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together.
[1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:21.740]  You're an unstoppable tank. SuperMail Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs
[1:30:21.740 --> 1:30:28.220]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[1:30:28.220 --> 1:30:32.860]  powdered versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:37.820]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:30:37.820 --> 1:30:41.100]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:30:41.100 --> 1:30:47.020]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super
[1:30:47.020 --> 1:30:55.340]  strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:30:59.420 --> 1:31:07.500]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you will
[1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:17.500]  take a special injection so that you will be safe, but the injection is not ready yet. And so I need
[1:31:17.500 --> 1:31:27.420]  all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can. I also need you to wear masks,
[1:31:27.420 --> 1:31:35.740]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate control
[1:31:35.740 --> 1:31:44.860]  and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable. You will then be my
[1:31:44.860 --> 1:31:52.620]  slaves. Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra. It will remove your immune
[1:31:52.620 --> 1:31:56.860]  system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.

[1:32:56.300 --> 1:33:05.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:05.740 --> 1:33:33.900]  Well, I know a leader when I see one and man, is she smart? Is she on target? Is she wonderful?
[1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:41.580]  Melissa Tate, RealMelissaTate.com and on Twitter, The Real, The Right Melissa at The Right Melissa.
[1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:44.780]  And of course, her book is somewhere around the office, but I've got a print out here.
[1:33:45.740 --> 1:33:55.260]  Choice. White's checked out there and it says privilege. Choice, privilege. So tell us about
[1:33:55.260 --> 1:34:00.620]  your book. Tell us about your worldview on where all this is going. And then you were making those
[1:34:00.620 --> 1:34:04.860]  great points about transcending the divide and conquer strategy. But first, tell folks about
[1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:11.020]  your book and where people get it. Okay, so my book is choice privilege. It's a play on the words
[1:34:11.020 --> 1:34:16.460]  white privilege, but I crop it where it says white and I put in choice. So I basically make the argument
[1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:21.340]  that it is the choices that you make in life that really determine your destiny and the quality of
[1:34:21.340 --> 1:34:26.060]  your life and not the color of your skin. And that's what I was taught as a child. And basically,
[1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:29.980]  my mom told me that if you make good choices, you're going to have a good life. If you make
[1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:35.260]  bad choices, you're going to have a bad life. And that's the philosophy that I've always lived by.
[1:34:35.820 --> 1:34:41.100]  So this idea that, you know, in America, if you're white, that that's what gives you privilege. No,
[1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:47.500]  it doesn't. My husband is white and he grew up poorer than I did, you know, as a black person
[1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:52.860]  in growing up in Zimbabwe. So that idea is completely false. But you know, the book, I
[1:34:52.860 --> 1:34:59.020]  actually, it's actually very well cited. So it's not just, I talk a little bit about myself and my
[1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:06.460]  history in Zimbabwe, but I actually dig deep into critical race theory and debunk it, you know, so
[1:35:06.460 --> 1:35:12.620]  using data and facts and well cited information as far as, you know, the narrative that is out there
[1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:17.340]  that, you know, police are out there gunning down black people and all this stuff that the left
[1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:23.900]  puts out there, really to create racial division. So the book is very well cited. It's a great book
[1:35:23.900 --> 1:35:29.820]  to give to your family members who, you know, might buy into this Black Lives Matter ideals,
[1:35:30.380 --> 1:35:35.100]  you know, Black Lives Matter stuff. You know, I've had people give it to nieces and nephews and
[1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:38.780]  they read it, you know, and some people are like, well, I don't want to read it. I'm like, well,
[1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:42.860]  you tell your niece that she's racist if she's not going to read a black woman's book. So
[1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:49.420]  so it's a good way to wake people up. So I always tell people, you know, grab a few copies,
[1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:55.020]  hand it to people because it will wake them up because I talk about the parallels with what
[1:35:55.020 --> 1:35:59.900]  happened in Zimbabwe because it's the same playbook that they're playing, that they play in every
[1:35:59.900 --> 1:36:04.460]  country. It's really just race, divide and conquer, divide and conquer. And that's what's
[1:36:04.460 --> 1:36:09.900]  frustrating is white people that are left just use it because it gives them power and control and
[1:36:09.900 --> 1:36:14.380]  it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the documents, we know they do it. And it's mainly weirdo white
[1:36:14.380 --> 1:36:18.700]  academics, but some Asians, some Hispanics, some Black, but mainly white people using race for
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:23.740]  control. Well, no matter how you do it, it truly is racist. It truly is off of just what color
[1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:29.020]  somebody is. And it's a fraud. And the opposite of what Martin Luther King Jr. talked about,
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:33.820]  that we all embrace as its common sense and make sense at a spiritual and cellular level.
[1:36:33.820 --> 1:36:37.500]  You don't judge somebody off of what they look like, you judge off what they produce,
[1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:40.940]  what they do. I mean, I go to a restaurant, I don't care what color the people are cooking,
[1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:44.780]  and if the food's good, I'm not asking what color is the cook or if I'm listening to music,
[1:36:44.780 --> 1:36:48.940]  I'm not saying why am I listening to Jimmy Hendrix? He's Black. I love Jimmy Hendrix. So it's, it's
[1:36:48.940 --> 1:36:54.860]  or Beethoven, he's German. I'm like, what color is this guy? Everybody instinctively gets that.
[1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:58.780]  And the left is openly promoting the opposite, saying everything is about what
[1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:04.380]  color you are. And now they're dividing us on, vaxed, unvaxed. And so that's the next big divide
[1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:10.940]  in Congress. Absolutely. And it's not only, it's not only races, but it's also very patronized.
[1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:17.180]  It's very patronizing. You know, it's very condescending to, to a lot of Black people like
[1:37:17.180 --> 1:37:24.620]  myself, you know, this idea that because I'm Black, I'm oppressed. You know, I don't, I don't
[1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:28.620]  buy into that. You know, I read. You don't look too oppressed to me. You look like you're thriving
[1:37:28.620 --> 1:37:35.420]  and kicking ass. Exactly. So it's like, you know, the left and this whole thing is really driven
[1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:40.940]  by a lot of white liberals who, you know, they, they look at Black people as a pet project. As,
[1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:44.860]  you know, they look at Black people as pets that they need to save and all. And there's this whole
[1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:50.940]  white savior complex that they have. And it's very patronizing. So I do talk about it. Listen,
[1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:56.300]  I'm not a white saver. I want you to save me. I think you, I could see a leader when I see one.
[1:37:56.300 --> 1:37:59.580]  I'm counting on you to go out there and wake these people up before we have a race for her.
[1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:07.260]  So will you save me, please? Seriously? I will. Good. I know you will. That's what I'm saying
[1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:11.740]  is exactly we're all victims. We don't know. We have power. You have power and we have even
[1:38:11.740 --> 1:38:17.580]  more power together. How about we save each other together? Absolutely. Absolutely, Alex.
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:24.300]  I'm ranting here. It's just so much going on. I want to play you another amazing lady. This is
[1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:29.740]  Laura Logan getting hardcore major journalist CIA all the way around her husband, but breaking
[1:38:29.740 --> 1:38:35.020]  with the system and saying, this is Joseph Mengele. This is tyranny. Here it is. Judge,
[1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:39.580]  if they keep testing for different strains of coronavirus, we're going to be locked down for
[1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:45.900]  the rest of our existence. I am, you know, I had cancer. My oncologist is a specialist in bone
[1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:51.580]  cancer. And he, you know, every oncologist who deals with bone cancer identifies hundreds of
[1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:58.300]  coronaviruses inside of our bones. They've created a problem that can never actually be solved so
[1:38:58.300 --> 1:39:04.380]  they can justify whatever it is they want to do. And if you look around you, everything is falling
[1:39:04.380 --> 1:39:10.860]  apart. Even the vote audits are going ahead. Durham is moving ahead. Over time, people can see that
[1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:15.740]  the vaccines have nothing to do with Trump or left or right. Many black people don't want to get
[1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:22.140]  vaccinated. You cannot justify losing three to 5,000 border patrol agents, 12,000 pilots,
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:26.460]  you know, for something that has the death rate of flu. And even if this is lethal,
[1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:32.140]  Americans have the right under the constitution to their civil liberties. And they can only be
[1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:39.660]  suspended temporarily for it to be lawful. This is not lawful. And she goes on to calling Joseph
[1:39:39.660 --> 1:39:43.740]  Mengele. I got attacked for that. Trying to make people take experimental garbage, violates an
[1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:50.620]  urban code. It's the definition of Joseph Mengele. My goodness, she's absolutely right. And I actually
[1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:56.620]  met her in San Antonio that same day I ran into you. She's a, she's a great lady. Oh, wow. She was
[1:39:56.620 --> 1:40:03.740]  there and I missed her. That's just pure torture. I was great to meet you. Wow. So she's really
[1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:09.180]  awake now. She spoke. She got up there and spoke and she had a very powerful speech. You should
[1:40:09.180 --> 1:40:14.540]  go back and watch it. I mean, she's absolutely right. I mean, what we're seeing is absolutely
[1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:20.860]  devastating. I cannot believe what's happening. I mean, I used to watch you, Alex, and I used to
[1:40:20.860 --> 1:40:24.940]  think, ah, you know, I used to watch you and I used to enjoy all your content. But at some point,
[1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:29.980]  I was like, you know what, maybe he's going a little bit too far. And now I think you didn't go
[1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:38.860]  far enough because witnessing is unbelievable. Unbelievable what we're seeing. When you see them
[1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:46.620]  forcing a vaccine that we now know is killing a lot of people, causing all these health issues.
[1:40:47.260 --> 1:40:51.580]  And then they just gloss over it like it's not even happening. It's like we're living in
[1:40:51.580 --> 1:40:58.380]  twilight zone. It's absolutely amazing to see what is happening. Choice privilege. It's totally
[1:40:58.380 --> 1:41:03.820]  true. The choices you make is your privilege. And it's who you associate with. It's who you're
[1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:07.660]  around. And my experience in life is unless you're going about globalists who are really evil and
[1:41:07.660 --> 1:41:12.220]  they're very small percentage of people is folks want to be around winners and happy people and
[1:41:12.220 --> 1:41:16.860]  folks that want to work hard and play hard. They don't give a damn what color you are. And people
[1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:22.060]  are just looking for other nice people. And they want us all to only judge each other off our race
[1:41:22.060 --> 1:41:25.900]  so that we get in fights with each other so they can control us. It's totally transparent.
[1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:30.300]  And I see them pushing all this division as a sign of their weakness. I think
[1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:34.380]  when we beat this, we're going to see an amazing coming together of humanity. What are you thinking
[1:41:34.380 --> 1:41:42.220]  closing? Yeah, absolutely. I believe that what we're seeing right now is just a cornered animal
[1:41:42.220 --> 1:41:47.260]  because I feel like there is a great awakening that's happening. And I actually look back and say
[1:41:47.260 --> 1:41:51.820]  what happened with the stolen election was actually providential because I feel like it's
[1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:57.420]  actually what has awakened people and caused people to start being involved on a local level.
[1:41:57.420 --> 1:42:03.100]  And actually people starting to not just watch content online and ring their hands about what's
[1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:07.500]  going on, but actually start getting involved. And that's what we need to do. So in closing,
[1:42:07.500 --> 1:42:12.460]  I'd like to say that everybody needs to figure out what they need to be doing in this fight.
[1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:19.260]  This is no longer a spectator sport. We can't just watch and listen and see what's happening
[1:42:19.260 --> 1:42:24.220]  and do nothing about it. And it's encouraging to see that a lot of people are now starting to stand
[1:42:24.220 --> 1:42:28.860]  up because you see a lot of mothers going to school boards. You see people are running on a
[1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:34.780]  local level. Right now, the left is panicking because the precinct level positions are being
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:40.300]  filled by MAGA people. So we need more of that. And that's how we're going to solve this issue is
[1:42:40.300 --> 1:42:44.780]  we can't just wait for politicians. We have to start being involved in education,
[1:42:44.780 --> 1:42:50.140]  in media, in entertainment, in all these spheres of influence that we have allowed the left to
[1:42:50.140 --> 1:42:55.900]  completely take over because this is. I totally agree. Amazing job. The book choice privilege.
[1:42:55.900 --> 1:43:02.060]  God bless you for a fresh. The purpose of fear is to call us into action. And there is plenty to
[1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:08.140]  be afraid of today. Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[1:43:08.140 --> 1:43:13.660]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:43:13.660 --> 1:43:19.180]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[1:43:19.180 --> 1:43:25.180]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have awoken
[1:43:25.180 --> 1:43:30.540]  from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see. But
[1:43:30.540 --> 1:43:36.060]  there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:42.140]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win and we eventually will,
[1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:47.660]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth
[1:43:47.660 --> 1:43:54.620]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and lifesaving
[1:43:54.620 --> 1:44:01.340]  knowledge at infoorstore.com. InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[1:44:01.340 --> 1:44:05.420]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:10.940]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and
[1:44:10.940 --> 1:44:18.300]  sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:23.740]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:44:23.740 --> 1:44:29.420]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have
[1:44:29.420 --> 1:44:34.620]  the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:40.860]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[1:44:40.860 --> 1:44:45.420]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[1:44:45.420 --> 1:44:50.060]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:55.660]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[1:44:55.660 --> 1:45:02.300]  of our pollen block chewable tablets. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[1:45:02.300 --> 1:45:08.060]  deep in my soul. I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss, like
[1:45:08.060 --> 1:45:18.460]  everybody else has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought
[1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:27.180]  and died and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general
[1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:32.300]  public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:39.580]  tranche. And I know we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:47.020]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then deteriorating,
[1:45:47.020 --> 1:45:52.620]  collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalists are actively trying to
[1:45:52.620 --> 1:45:57.660]  steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:46:00.060 --> 1:46:04.620]  It's a great sponsor. We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high

[1:46:47.980 --> 1:46:56.300]  phones don't work. They work infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[1:46:56.300 --> 1:47:12.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:41.100]  Let me tell you something. They've done studies that quote conservatives and Christians are
[1:47:41.100 --> 1:47:45.500]  better looking than communists and devil worshipers. I got a great example of that here
[1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.980]  for you just in a moment. We're going to play a Paul Joseph Watson reporter in this clip.
[1:47:49.980 --> 1:47:56.140]  Commie teacher brags she's indoctrinating students to turn leftists and it's not even the shapes of
[1:47:56.140 --> 1:48:03.340]  their bodies. The ugliness shines out of communists and devil worshipers. I didn't know that Laura
[1:48:03.340 --> 1:48:08.940]  Logan was at that event that I was at with General Flynn because I just popped in and out for about
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:17.100]  five hours. It looks like I'm going to the next event next week in Dallas, not this week
[1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:24.860]  in but the week after. They've asked me to go speak there. But women that are awake and that care,
[1:48:24.860 --> 1:48:29.900]  I mean, they're just like ten times more beautiful. I mean, it's just shining Laura Logan and
[1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:34.380]  Melissa Tate that we just had on. And that's not me coming onto these women. It's like looking
[1:48:34.380 --> 1:48:40.860]  like a beautiful sunset or something. It's like, wow, it's radiating. And then you just see the
[1:48:40.860 --> 1:48:46.300]  people promoting evil. They look like demons. Even if they physically have a nice look, it's just
[1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:53.980]  there's something about them. Now, it makes me feel good to talk to somebody like Melissa Tate
[1:48:53.980 --> 1:49:03.260]  who's so loving and smart and it gives me hope. Because there's something so good about
[1:49:04.700 --> 1:49:09.820]  loving smart women like my daughters. They're the whole future. They just give you hope. They're
[1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:15.340]  the goddess. And it's what the system is attacking. It claims all day it cares about women. It can't
[1:49:15.340 --> 1:49:20.700]  stand them. The big biomedical labs want to take over women. They want humans grown in tanks.
[1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:24.620]  They hate women. Their whole system is against women.
[1:49:26.300 --> 1:49:30.460]  Well, somebody else claimed he was for women. His name was Hitler. He absolutely hated women as well.
[1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:43.980]  And when you talk about Germany, my mom's dad was super smart, my grandfather. And he was German,
[1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:47.580]  you know, immigrant families of Texas. But that's how the family was very German.
[1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:57.580]  And growing up in Dallas, and he was that family was wealthy and was in with the rich German community
[1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:01.340]  there in Hyde Park and other areas up in Dallas.
[1:50:04.460 --> 1:50:08.060]  And he just told me everything. I was a little kid. I didn't roll my eyes.
[1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:13.820]  But he told me there'll be a European Union and Germany will take over the European Union
[1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:17.980]  and then out of the European Union, they're going to take over. And it wasn't the Germans that are
[1:50:17.980 --> 1:50:23.500]  going to do it. It's that empire, those elite families, the same ones. The House of Windsor
[1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:28.940]  is that German family. So when you think of the UK and the British empire, and then you think of
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:34.700]  Germany, it's the same thing. That was just cousins fighting with each other in World War
[1:50:34.700 --> 1:50:41.420]  One and World War Two. The Russian Tsars were first cousins with the German Saxo Bergothas
[1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:48.620]  and the King of England. In fact, type in the last czar with the British King.
[1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:54.540]  There's photos of them in 1910, 1915. You can't tell the two men apart. They were like a breed
[1:50:54.540 --> 1:51:00.060]  of dogs so inbred that they look identical. They couldn't be told apart if they weren't wearing
[1:51:00.060 --> 1:51:05.900]  different uniforms. The King of England and the czar. Type in photos of the last czar
[1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:12.780]  with the King of England. You'll see the photos. And the reason I raise that is when you see the
[1:51:12.780 --> 1:51:17.820]  European Union, that's a Nazi project. I mean, that's who created that. And when you see what
[1:51:17.820 --> 1:51:22.540]  they're doing, it's not, oh, Nazis want to kill the Jews. Yeah, there's a great example.
[1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:33.180]  Oh, for TV viewers. That's just a little side issue for them. They want control over everything
[1:51:33.180 --> 1:51:38.940]  and they don't think white people deserve to live either. They are super out of control elitists.
[1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:42.940]  Look at how they're always trying to kill their other cousins. Their cousins ran Russia,
[1:51:42.940 --> 1:51:48.460]  their cousins ran Europe, their cut, and then one of the big group that had gotten control of England
[1:51:52.380 --> 1:52:00.860]  in the 1700s. We were fighting King George III in 1776. He was the third German king of England.
[1:52:00.860 --> 1:52:07.340]  He was not British. But that part doesn't matter. What I'm getting at is this is the group. You
[1:52:07.340 --> 1:52:11.420]  want to know who runs the New World Order? Put them back on screen. King of England with the czar.
[1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:17.660]  That's who runs things. You want to know who's in charge? Those guys. Right there. They run it all.
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:23.420]  And when you look at Prince Charles saying he wants to kill everybody in world government,
[1:52:23.420 --> 1:52:32.540]  that's where he comes from, folks. And they cannot help it. They want power over everybody.
[1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:39.260]  And they do not like big crowds of people. They want to kill. And I guess their instincts have
[1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:43.580]  got them where they are. I mean, they're in charge of the planet. But notice they killed
[1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:47.020]  their own people. Think about once the globalists get full control, they're just going to keep
[1:52:47.020 --> 1:52:50.620]  killing each other forever. They're never going to stop. They admit that in their own literature.
[1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:56.860]  They say there'll only be one of them left at the end. Why would you let people like this run things?
[1:52:59.020 --> 1:53:05.260]  So Paul Watson did a video. It's on infowars.com and band.video. It's Germany has fallen.
[1:53:05.260 --> 1:53:09.580]  You're living in historic times. This is a globalist takeover. This is real.
[1:53:11.900 --> 1:53:16.300]  And everything you're seeing with the UN and the EU and the New World Order and all of this
[1:53:16.300 --> 1:53:23.900]  is their takeover of the planet to depopulate you. Hitler was just a research project. He was
[1:53:23.900 --> 1:53:30.220]  the beta test. This is the big one. Here it is. Germany has today become the next domino to fall.
[1:53:30.220 --> 1:53:35.980]  The unvaccinated will be banned from shops and every other area of society besides essential
[1:53:35.980 --> 1:53:41.660]  services. That means that the government is graciously still allowing them to buy food,
[1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:46.620]  at least for now. And that's basically it. So long as they properly segregate themselves from
[1:53:46.620 --> 1:53:51.660]  other vaxxed shoppers. Yeah, that's an actual supermarket in Germany, but they are banned from
[1:53:51.660 --> 1:53:57.980]  bars, restaurants, cinemas, all lifestyle, all culture, basically everything else. They've even
[1:53:57.980 --> 1:54:04.540]  told the unjabbed they're only allowed a maximum of two people inside their own homes over Christmas.
[1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:10.140]  No jab, no life. And pretty soon no jab, no job as authorities announced they'd make the vaccine
[1:54:10.140 --> 1:54:15.020]  mandatory by February. And for those who still refuse, well, it'll probably be the same as in
[1:54:15.020 --> 1:54:19.420]  Austria. But don't worry, they're not going to forcibly drag you off to a vaccination centre.
[1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:24.700]  They're just going to forcibly drag you off to a detention centre until you get vaccinated to
[1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:29.820]  their nice reasonable people. Before the vaxx was available, Germany was already incarcerating
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:34.940]  rule breakers in detention camps. Such facilities are really going to come in handy. Germany using
[1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:41.420]  emergency powers to segregate, stigmatise, persecute and ultimately imprison an oppressed minority.
[1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:46.300]  What could possibly go wrong? Think I remember reading about something similar happening at some
[1:54:46.300 --> 1:54:51.420]  point in history. Caught for the life of me remember when Germany and authoritarianism,
[1:54:51.420 --> 1:54:56.620]  name a more iconic duo, the upcoming compulsory vaccination is the biggest political breach
[1:54:56.620 --> 1:55:02.220]  of promise in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, says the former editor and chief of
[1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:08.220]  build. This is Angela Merkel's parting gift to her countrymen. Thanks, Angela. Life in Germany
[1:55:08.220 --> 1:55:13.740]  is already almost intolerable, even for the fully vaxxed. Getting a haircut in Germany is now worse
[1:55:13.740 --> 1:55:37.740]  than going through airport security.
[1:55:37.740 --> 1:55:49.980]  States in Germany have of course been imposing similar 2G powers for months and it's been such
[1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:55.500]  a rip roaring success that Germany just reported its highest Corona death toll in nine months.
[1:55:55.500 --> 1:55:59.660]  Virtually every other country currently experiencing a COVID wave in Europe is also
[1:55:59.660 --> 1:56:13.020]  in full report at infowars.com. My grandparents moved to Austin. They lived in Hyde Park when I
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:20.140]  was a kid. They lived in Highland Park when he was growing up in Dallas. But my point is that
[1:56:20.140 --> 1:56:25.420]  this is just what he was told by all these people at the time. There were a lot of rich Germans living
[1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:31.260]  in Dallas at that time and we're just talking about all these plans. Pre-Hitler, ladies and
[1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:34.620]  gentlemen. But it doesn't matter what my grandfather told me when I was 10 years old.
[1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:45.100]  You're now seeing it all happen right now in front of you. You're now witnessing every damn
[1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:50.460]  bit of it. We're going to go to break. We're going to come back and we're going to open the phones

[1:58:48.540 --> 1:58:54.620]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like
[1:58:54.620 --> 1:59:00.220]  going to play golf. I like going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything
[1:59:00.220 --> 1:59:06.860]  that comes with this but see I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat
[1:59:06.860 --> 1:59:12.300]  run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's
[1:59:12.300 --> 1:59:16.700]  all crashing down. Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of
[1:59:16.700 --> 1:59:20.780]  property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[1:59:20.780 --> 1:59:25.020]  land? That's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the
[1:59:25.020 --> 1:59:30.380]  majority part of me says no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says get the hell
[1:59:30.380 --> 1:59:34.940]  out of anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the internal
[1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:41.100]  struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least
[1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:45.980]  have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at infowar
[1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:55.820]  store.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:04.140 --> 2:00:13.420]  in the councils of government we must guard against the undue access of power and the consolidation
[2:00:13.420 --> 2:00:22.060]  of power of the military industrial complex there does exist and will continue to exist
[2:00:23.180 --> 2:00:28.540]  and he goes on to talk about the corporate takeover through the scientific dictatorship in 1961
[2:00:30.540 --> 2:00:38.060]  and here we are ladies and gentlemen 877-789 alex 877-789 2-5-19 to start one of your phone calls
[2:00:38.060 --> 2:00:49.980]  next next segment and I'll just say this I feel guilty that I can't cover all this stuff I mean
[2:00:49.980 --> 2:00:57.260]  I read it I looked at it I just each one of these is so nightmarish that this is what a war is
[2:00:57.260 --> 2:01:03.180]  though we're just totally overwhelmed and all we can do I guess at the end of the day is resist
[2:01:03.180 --> 2:01:11.660]  this and just know everything they do is pure evil and out to get us I mean I see even the senators
[2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:14.860]  being lied to and being attacked by the system and being censored by big tag
[2:01:17.020 --> 2:01:21.980]  and they still address the power structure like it just doesn't know what it's doing
[2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:26.940]  like I saw harris and smith this morning he's a really smart guy I love the show
[2:01:26.940 --> 2:01:33.820]  was watching he's like I just don't know why the media keeps saying ivermectin doesn't help you
[2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:38.060]  when it does I mean why would they want everybody to die and I know it's a rhetorical question by him
[2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:41.260]  but that's the whole point these are ruthless murderers
[2:01:45.820 --> 2:01:50.700]  so just cut to the chase and you know I get it it's impolite at thanksgiving while everybody's
[2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:59.980]  giving each other champagne toast like at my house and I just couldn't help but I just you know I said
[2:01:59.980 --> 2:02:03.980]  at the table I said well this might be the last thanksgiving because they're going to bring new
[2:02:03.980 --> 2:02:08.140]  lockdowns in enforced populations in Europe and there'll be a world financial collapse they're
[2:02:08.140 --> 2:02:12.220]  going to bring in a world ID so I want all you to get ready when you go back to where you live and
[2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:19.180]  different parts of the country everybody's like oh well I know Alex I hear you and I'm like hey
[2:02:19.180 --> 2:02:23.100]  listen I'm not trying to grandstand at this thanksgiving where we stuff ourselves with turkey
[2:02:23.100 --> 2:02:29.660]  and ham and brisket we had all three I'm just telling you that what created this bounty has
[2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:34.460]  been flushed down the toilet and they're coming for our children with these poisonous shots right now
[2:02:35.820 --> 2:02:40.300]  oh we agree we know you're right hey I don't want you to tell me I'm right this ain't about Alex Jones
[2:02:40.300 --> 2:02:44.940]  putting his testicles on the table didn't say that part and oh I'm the big man I'm King Kong
[2:02:44.940 --> 2:02:51.100]  you need to salute me right away I don't give a damn about that we're under attack and I feel guilty
[2:02:51.100 --> 2:02:55.420]  that I'm not doing enough now I haven't figured out what it is I'm supposed to do I'm on air
[2:02:55.420 --> 2:02:59.340]  I'm warning people I'm trying to influence folks I'm behind the scenes doing stuff that may even
[2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:06.460]  be more important than I do publicly but it's my public war that got me the respect with all these
[2:03:06.460 --> 2:03:12.940]  people so they listen to me but I know how to beat these people and I know you know how as well
[2:03:12.940 --> 2:03:19.100]  but you gotta stop worrying about being perfect in your execution of a resistance and you gotta
[2:03:19.100 --> 2:03:23.580]  just start doing it now I don't want you to go to Fauci's house and shove a gun in his mouth and
[2:03:23.580 --> 2:03:27.580]  blow his little head off because that'll turn him into a victim that's the last thing I want
[2:03:27.580 --> 2:03:35.020]  I want you to politically non-violently line him up like a firing squad of truth and fire
[2:03:35.020 --> 2:03:40.460]  trillions of bullets of information into him non-violently and politically without he's a
[2:03:40.460 --> 2:03:45.580]  murderer and now he did secret medical tests on little black children and killed them on purpose
[2:03:45.580 --> 2:03:51.020]  and now he's a murderous ghoul and now he's your enemy and now he created the bio weapons and how
[2:03:51.020 --> 2:03:57.180]  he must fail and the whole system's trying to prop him up but I can tell you he's folding right now
[2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:05.740]  we're becoming stronger he's becoming weaker and I want you to pray for God to bring judgment upon
[2:04:05.740 --> 2:04:12.380]  him in the Lord's will and the Lord's grace please God in the name of your Son and our
[2:04:12.380 --> 2:04:18.780]  Savior Jesus Christ deliver us from Anthony Fauci deliver us from Bill Gates and Claus Schwab
[2:04:19.340 --> 2:04:28.460]  and it is your will then we pray in your heavenly name oh king of all the hosts to bring judgment
[2:04:28.460 --> 2:04:40.460]  upon this plague and upon these devils in the name of Jesus Christ amen stand up and be counted
[2:04:41.340 --> 2:04:47.660]  for what you are about to receive we are the dealers we'll give you everything you need
[2:04:47.660 --> 2:04:59.500]  ladies and gentlemen stay with us there are so many crap let's go ahead take another call
[2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:04.700]  let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee welcome hello Alex yes Malcolm all right I will make this quick
[2:05:04.700 --> 2:05:09.740]  and real short where the other patrons can get on the line uh Alex I have to promote one thing
[2:05:09.740 --> 2:05:15.900]  from one of your co-host Owen shroyer super male volatility and brain force plus mix those two
[2:05:15.900 --> 2:05:21.100]  together you're an unstoppable tank super male volatility really really works it's cold pressed
[2:05:21.100 --> 2:05:27.900]  herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared
[2:05:27.900 --> 2:05:33.340]  to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine
[2:05:33.340 --> 2:05:37.500]  it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just
[2:05:37.500 --> 2:05:41.180]  okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[2:05:41.180 --> 2:05:46.700]  that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like
[2:05:46.700 --> 2:05:57.100]  super strong but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:05:57.100 --> 2:06:07.100]  okay
[2:06:07.660 --> 2:06:17.260]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones well the spirit is
[2:06:17.260 --> 2:06:23.500]  strong now because they are injecting children and maiming and killing children all over the
[2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:28.220]  western world right now and Fauci says in the new year they're coming for newborn babies with the
[2:06:28.220 --> 2:06:36.220]  deadly shots and so all that discernment all that energy all that power you're feeling right now
[2:06:36.220 --> 2:06:42.620]  as a person that loves god that's god consciousness as dr. Zalinko would say the transcends Judaism
[2:06:42.620 --> 2:06:47.900]  christian christianity all of it it is the christian god it is the today god it is the one god but
[2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:57.500]  it is god not what men call it god is shining through you to resist and say no to this and defend
[2:06:57.500 --> 2:07:02.620]  children so i'm telling my listeners and i'm going to do it this weekend despite the fact that i've
[2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:08.140]  got being deposed by the democratic party and the sandy hook operation this saturday for eight hours
[2:07:08.140 --> 2:07:15.020]  despite the fact i got all the stuff i'm doing i will be out this weekend at poison shot injection
[2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:21.100]  centers protesting i will be in the field i will be taking action
[2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:28.220]  you've got my absolute commitment that i'm going to be doing that
[2:07:31.180 --> 2:07:34.460]  because we have to operate in the third dimension we have to take action
[2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:43.180]  that's why we've been given the spirit of victory not to sit there and talk about how christian we
[2:07:43.180 --> 2:07:49.340]  are all day and how good we are and how we don't sin let me tell you what god hates is god hates cowards
[2:07:52.460 --> 2:07:57.260]  the real sin right now that god will slam the door on you for eternity is not standing up for these
[2:07:57.260 --> 2:08:07.740]  children i could feel god's rage right now the only way to survive that rage is to comport myself
[2:08:07.740 --> 2:08:13.500]  into it as an instrument or a weapon against these people you should not even worry about what your
[2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:18.220]  neighbors or people think you shouldn't worry about prison you shouldn't worry about death you should
[2:08:18.220 --> 2:08:31.340]  only worry that god is angry i can feel it i know you can too but we have to be as wise as
[2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:41.420]  serpents and as peaceful as doves and we have to savage these people with our speech
[2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:45.020]  and with our knowledge and with our truth and with our prayer and with our action
[2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:51.020]  and with our giving and our financial resistance that's a form of sacrifice of your work and your
[2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:59.900]  labor and if you won't do it you will be destroyed and you will be alone in a spiritual dungeon
[2:08:59.900 --> 2:09:05.820]  begging for god to help you and god's gonna say i did help you i gave you the power i gave you the
[2:09:05.820 --> 2:09:17.660]  birthright i gave you everything and you did nothing i came knocking over and over until
[2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:24.620]  my hand was bloody begging you to help me and you wouldn't do anything so don't come to my door i
[2:09:24.620 --> 2:09:31.100]  don't know who you are i wanted to know you i wanted to be with you forever and you wouldn't
[2:09:31.100 --> 2:09:37.500]  be with me you slam the door on me that's what god said you think i want to damn you to hell
[2:09:38.220 --> 2:09:40.860]  you think i want to cut you off when i made you
[2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:51.740]  no but you cut yourself off because you would stand up against these snakes
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:10:01.340]  we're not snakes my friends we're as wise as serpents we have the knowledge of their operation
[2:10:04.140 --> 2:10:10.220]  and those of us that are as wise as serpents have to start using that knowledge
[2:10:11.500 --> 2:10:16.700]  to not just make money in business not just to pick up women not just to be cool not just
[2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:23.180]  everybody to think you're the boss you're given that information to fight the evil ones the knowledge
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:29.900]  of evil is not some information for you that's a curiosity it is given to you to know the enemy's
[2:10:29.900 --> 2:10:38.220]  plans to defeat them i have not been given the knowledge of the enemy to become a new enemy
[2:10:39.020 --> 2:10:44.380]  we've not been given the ring of doom or the knowledge of how it operates to join with satan
[2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:46.700]  but to be at opposition with satan
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:53.180]  all right look you want to see satan
[2:10:55.980 --> 2:11:04.060]  let's compare melissa tate we just had on with this woman that's on info wars.com there's a
[2:11:04.060 --> 2:11:08.940]  bunch of videos everyone's gonna play one bragging that she's a leftist and bragging that she's
[2:11:08.940 --> 2:11:16.060]  got your children imagine the galactic spiritual crime of you pay taxes you send your children to
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:22.780]  learn reading writing and arithmetic and some satanic blob with a gargoyle on her chest says
[2:11:22.780 --> 2:11:29.580]  i'm the teacher you're scared of i'm corrupting your children and of course she's an ugly
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:40.620]  disgusting sack of filth but let me tell you who's worse than her people that let their children
[2:11:40.620 --> 2:11:46.060]  be in the countenance with her let me tell you something you can't sit there when these demon
[2:11:46.060 --> 2:11:52.140]  blobs come from your children and then just say well you know that's what i did or whatever i says
[2:11:52.140 --> 2:12:03.260]  it's such very simple protect your children from these people or god is going to damn you to hell
[2:12:03.260 --> 2:12:08.700]  and let me tell you what hell is hell is eternity with that thing i mean it's separation from god
[2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:15.660]  ladies and gentlemen you imagine me and locked up with that creature for eternity no she just
[2:12:15.660 --> 2:12:22.300]  wants to drag your children into the mouth of hell with her let's hear from this piece of
[2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:28.300]  filth here she is why every conversation in class devolves into me ranting about capitalism
[2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:34.700]  it's because i'm the teacher that your parents warned you about i'm the professor that's going
[2:12:34.700 --> 2:12:41.740]  to turn your kids leftist welcome yep and you're the person that's going to make them take forced
[2:12:41.740 --> 2:12:44.940]  injections and you're the person that's going to ruin their immune system and you're the person
[2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:51.180]  that's got all this power to make a submit to you because you don't have power which
[2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:59.260]  the only power is jumping into the current of god and turning loose the only power is submission
[2:12:59.260 --> 2:13:04.700]  to jesus christ the only power is turning loose your little devilish ego you little monster
[2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:12.060]  but the thing in her thinks that she can destroy innocence and take soul's weather
[2:13:12.060 --> 2:13:19.580]  her look at the arrogance look at that look look at that face she's already in her own
[2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:26.060]  private disgusting hell the female version of brian looks like a you know what stelter

[2:21:58.380 --> 2:22:04.140]  couldn't play it now we can't take calls but i've always noticed is problems cascade you know here
[2:22:04.140 --> 2:22:11.500]  in the great reset and that's what they want you imagine all this complex technology uh if it
[2:22:11.500 --> 2:22:15.820]  actually starts breaking down you know i forgot i was supposed to play this
[2:22:18.380 --> 2:22:21.980]  we already tried earlier we're going to try it again now this is our big day this is the big
[2:22:21.980 --> 2:22:29.340]  moment this is the big thing british health secretary coaxes double jab reporter into getting third shot
[2:22:29.340 --> 2:22:33.260]  bizarre footage out of the uk shows british health secretary
[2:22:36.060 --> 2:22:43.660]  sajid javid pressuring a vaccinated reporter to get the third covet jab despite the fact that it
[2:22:43.660 --> 2:22:49.180]  erases your immunity the third shot israeli studies accelerates that gives you no protection
[2:22:49.180 --> 2:22:53.020]  he's just there saying take it take it take it because if you'll take the third you'll take the
[2:22:53.020 --> 2:22:57.420]  fourth you'll take the fifth you'll take the sixth you'll take the 20th you'll take the 87 millionth
[2:22:58.140 --> 2:23:04.620]  i mean this is just crazy here it is have you got boosted yet no i'm 64 and i'm still not happy
[2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:09.500]  you have why not well partly because i got covid at the heartly for the by-election
[2:23:10.300 --> 2:23:16.380]  it should be okay now and so i didn't have my second till the 14th of june so under the six
[2:23:16.380 --> 2:23:21.020]  month rule that takes the 14th of june under the new rule you'll be okay yeah exactly come back here
[2:23:21.020 --> 2:23:26.700]  later this week yeah what time they open here uh they open till eight i think in fact they might
[2:23:26.700 --> 2:23:31.660]  give it to you now if you walk in you think so yeah yeah yeah i'm talking about your work there
[2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:37.180]  no just do it can you make me a promise sorry make me a promise just go do it now i'll see i'll

[2:23:45.820 --> 2:23:51.180]  and get my job come on i'll walk with you come on that's it gosh you ready yeah i'm coming
[2:23:56.380 --> 2:24:02.620]  this is a total cult wanting to rape your body wanting to get everybody under peer pressure
[2:24:02.620 --> 2:24:05.980]  because they've learned psychologically the average person will not admit they're wrong
[2:24:05.980 --> 2:24:12.860]  when they're conned now we have a horrible horrible announcement some terrible video to play
[2:24:12.860 --> 2:24:18.380]  but we knew it was coming we have several joe biden videos one he makes sick jokes about fousy and his
[2:24:18.380 --> 2:24:22.300]  wife at least it's not about his daughters or granddaughters
[2:24:25.660 --> 2:24:32.140]  and how fousy's really the president that clips at a moment but the first clip just came out just
[2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:39.340]  happened a few minutes ago it's on info wars dot com biden says he'll do everything in his
[2:24:39.340 --> 2:24:46.620]  his disease brain who doesn't read bills who doesn't read what he's signing we have that new video
[2:24:47.580 --> 2:24:53.260]  to make sure under fives get the shot even though statistically nobody died under five
[2:24:53.260 --> 2:24:57.980]  even if you believe the official story and there's all these hundred to one side effects for any
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:05.660]  benefits i mean just talk about doubling down he'll do everything in his power they've already
[2:25:05.660 --> 2:25:11.980]  fired the boards on the fda and cdc to do this he'll do everything in his power to get the fda
[2:25:11.980 --> 2:25:16.620]  to approve for children under five and then once they're approved they're mandatory and they try to
[2:25:16.620 --> 2:25:22.540]  make them take them at birth when your kid dies they just laugh at you it's all a big sick satanic
[2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:29.420]  ritual my god if we won't stand up for the children nobody will stand up for us here it is i have a
[2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:34.620]  three-year-old is there going to be a time that that can am i going to be okay is she going to be
[2:25:34.620 --> 2:25:39.980]  okay or he's going to be okay and let me say this i strongly support the independent scientific
[2:25:39.980 --> 2:25:46.380]  review of vaccine uses for children under five we can't take take shortcuts with that scientific
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:52.540]  work but i'll do everything in my power to support the fda to do this safely and quickly as possible
[2:25:52.540 --> 2:25:58.700]  when we get to that around that point what a creepy evil demonic oh the look i agree the safe
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:05.100]  independent outside independent review total opposite pharma revolving door with the very same
[2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:11.260]  people i mean this is a rape a bio weapon rape you're like why would they do that because they
[2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:16.540]  like to kill people because they're sick freaks they see resources and money and numbers and see a
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:21.180]  social services net that you've invested in well how about we just get rid of police let everybody
[2:26:21.180 --> 2:26:25.500]  killed in we got private security why don't we just cut off their social security and their
[2:26:25.500 --> 2:26:30.700]  medicaid and their medicare and their pensions why don't we just devalue all their currency
[2:26:30.700 --> 2:26:35.340]  you know we ran this Ponzi scheme to take over and it says we've all got billions on our bank
[2:26:35.340 --> 2:26:40.860]  accounts but if these people have their way we won't well let's just kill everyone that's the
[2:26:40.860 --> 2:26:51.100]  oldest trick in the book and of course they're always reordering reordering remember last year
[2:26:51.100 --> 2:27:02.540]  they reordered until 2000 and 27 in in in canada and i said watch they're gonna announce force
[2:27:02.540 --> 2:27:11.180]  booster shots because they already freaking ordered it all it's all preordained they admitted is it's
[2:27:11.180 --> 2:27:17.340]  all a sick plan and then it collapses civilization with all the sick people they fire everybody else
[2:27:17.340 --> 2:27:21.740]  that won't take it then that breaks things down and they get what they want because we won't take
[2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:26.060]  the poison shot i'm not saying take the poison shot but you get the real effect is a third of the
[2:27:26.060 --> 2:27:33.100]  workforce gets fired or quits now stuff really collapses which was their goal and who do they
[2:27:33.100 --> 2:27:37.420]  blame for the collapse the unvaccinated when they're the ones that ordered the system that did it
[2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:43.420]  the key is exposing that they are behind it and it's their plan and having a revelation of this
[2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:48.300]  understanding and then they get hung at nuremberg too and we restart civilization and go to the next
[2:27:48.300 --> 2:27:54.620]  level or we all die in center like idiots and if you are lazy and if you don't care about others
[2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:58.860]  and you don't think of yourself as big you deserve a dime they will kill you as for me and mine
[2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:07.180]  we're fighting here it is i've seen more a dr fouchy that i have my wife we kid each other but
[2:28:07.180 --> 2:28:14.540]  uh they look who's president fouchy um but all kidding aside i sincerely mean it
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:20.780]  all kidding aside i sincerely mean it i'll give my wife sexually
[2:28:20.780 --> 2:28:24.140]  who like gangbang with all these people these satanic orgies that's nothing
[2:28:24.140 --> 2:28:28.620]  then i have sex with my children my grandchildren i mean it's all on record he screws his grandchildren
[2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:34.460]  i mean that that's who the president is is a puppet that rapes children it's total hell on earth i mean
[2:28:34.460 --> 2:28:39.500]  who do you think would inject people with deadly poison and say i really want to give it to three
[2:28:39.500 --> 2:28:46.620]  year olds he wants to stick his metal needle of rape of genetic rape and murder the dna not just
[2:28:46.620 --> 2:28:52.140]  rape the child he wants to murder them he wants to murder your children he's a murderer
[2:28:54.940 --> 2:28:59.420]  if you're concerned about the power grid and let's go ahead take another call let's talk to
[2:28:59.420 --> 2:29:04.300]  malcom in tennessee welcome hello alex yes malcom all right i'll make this quick and real
[2:29:04.300 --> 2:29:09.340]  short for the other patreons can get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of
[2:29:09.340 --> 2:29:15.340]  your co-host oan shroyer supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together
[2:29:15.340 --> 2:29:20.700]  you're an unstoppable tank supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs
[2:29:20.700 --> 2:29:27.180]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:29:27.180 --> 2:29:32.220]  powdered versions they also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:36.380]  it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just
[2:29:36.380 --> 2:29:40.140]  okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[2:29:40.140 --> 2:29:45.980]  that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super
[2:29:45.980 --> 2:29:50.380]  strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:29:57.020 --> 2:30:01.980]  so when i first started taking survival skill basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[2:30:01.980 --> 2:30:06.940]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[2:30:06.940 --> 2:30:11.100]  dr group on their show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[2:30:11.100 --> 2:30:15.660]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew
[2:30:15.660 --> 2:30:19.180]  you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took
[2:30:19.180 --> 2:30:25.740]  it and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened
[2:30:25.740 --> 2:30:30.940]  you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[2:30:30.940 --> 2:30:35.740]  couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're
[2:30:35.740 --> 2:30:40.700]  all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you
[2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:45.420]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[2:30:45.420 --> 2:30:49.900]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[2:30:49.900 --> 2:30:55.100]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[2:30:55.100 --> 2:31:02.780]  the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today half
[2:31:02.780 --> 2:31:08.380]  the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:31:08.380 --> 2:31:13.980]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[2:31:13.980 --> 2:31:19.820]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80 of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[2:31:19.820 --> 2:31:25.820]  hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all
[2:31:25.820 --> 2:31:32.460]  really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue
[2:31:32.460 --> 2:31:37.580]  sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we
[2:31:37.580 --> 2:31:43.660]  win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end
[2:31:43.660 --> 2:31:50.540]  and so we must prepare get up to a years worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear
[2:31:50.540 --> 2:31:56.300]  seeds shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge at info or store dot com
[2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:09.740]  if you only knew the power of the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat humanity
[2:32:09.740 --> 2:32:19.900]  then our gods will reward us with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the globalists
[2:32:21.420 --> 2:32:27.260]  they must first play god they must first prove that they are the fittest in their
[2:32:27.260 --> 2:32:33.100]  social Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dump us down
[2:32:33.100 --> 2:32:38.380]  and poison us and destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open
[2:32:38.380 --> 2:32:46.700]  we really deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[2:32:46.700 --> 2:32:53.020]  new order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the
[2:32:53.020 --> 2:33:10.300]  fight is info wars dot com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:10.540 --> 2:33:18.460]  the idea of a lockdown just two years ago was unthinkable i told you that
[2:33:18.460 --> 2:33:26.620]  the plan the alex jones show because there is a war on
[2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:32.460]  i said by the winter of 2021 it will be the unvaccinated
[2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:39.020]  that they will lock down then the forced inoculations the roundups and then the terror
[2:33:39.020 --> 2:33:45.900]  attacks against police against military against fizer against maderno that they themselves will
[2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:53.420]  stage to blame us and start the full persecution and the arm conflict which will bring down europe
[2:33:53.420 --> 2:33:58.620]  and bring down the united states in a fiery war australia and they believe the bankers will sit
[2:33:58.620 --> 2:34:03.980]  offshore we kill each other five ten years while china takes over the planet
[2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:12.620]  and then out of that they'll finally come with the big banks and if everybody's done
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:16.140]  starving the death and save you just turn your guns in and pledge allegiance to us
[2:34:16.140 --> 2:34:20.860]  we will give you the new global social credit score and that's where we're going to go that's
[2:34:20.860 --> 2:34:26.380]  what's going to happen every one of you don't care if you're a firefighter a school teacher
[2:34:26.380 --> 2:34:34.700]  an fbi agent a astronomer a factory worker a farmer a rancher a psychologist a somebody that works
[2:34:34.700 --> 2:34:47.580]  at mcdonald's you are about to go through this hell and the german military is going to march out
[2:34:47.580 --> 2:34:52.700]  in force of the injector they say every two months with a new shot until you die and everybody will
[2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:57.900]  stock them syndrome out and be part of it and just we agree and just hope they don't die that's where
[2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:07.500]  we are so i don't want the truck bombings of the fiser facility they're going to do it themselves
[2:35:07.500 --> 2:35:14.540]  themselves i don't want any of this and hey we got joe rogan awake saying no we got tucker carlson
[2:35:14.540 --> 2:35:18.860]  awake saying no we got so many others we need congress and governors to just come out and say
[2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:23.580]  this is the world government new order takeover it's globalism address it head on and say no
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:28.140]  and just tell the public in a press conference governor abit governor de santis if you're really
[2:35:28.140 --> 2:35:33.100]  with us about what's going down and what's happening and then everybody will rally behind you and
[2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:38.460]  we'll stop it but only admitting you're in a war with the u.m. and the global corporations doing
[2:35:38.460 --> 2:35:49.340]  this do we have a chance to beat it but if we have the leadership to say no to all this it'll be easily
[2:35:49.340 --> 2:35:54.620]  defeated and i can tell you and i want to go to your calls now i'll go 15 minutes the next hour
[2:35:54.620 --> 2:36:00.780]  guest host can push over they understand so i promise you all these calls i promise you
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:06.620]  that it's going to be better to stand up to this than to submit to it you don't need me to tell you
[2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:14.540]  that you already know it but i promise you more importantly that their program is not going well
[2:36:14.540 --> 2:36:21.420]  here's the problem they don't give up and so as it falls apart they're going to double down this
[2:36:21.420 --> 2:36:29.580]  is going to be extremely explosive do not kill anybody offensively but guard yourself now for
[2:36:29.580 --> 2:36:37.260]  real this is it because i mean killing military and police the globalists that's their main target
[2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:43.340]  they want to use them in an attack against us to knock them out and it's the same way they
[2:36:43.340 --> 2:36:47.660]  get the companies to fire all their key employees to break the civilization down this is globalist
[2:36:47.660 --> 2:36:52.060]  war by finance banks that are sitting back waiting for the collapse to then come in and take over
[2:36:52.060 --> 2:36:56.780]  that's in the imf world bank documents came out in 2002 where i told you the next plan is to
[2:36:56.780 --> 2:37:00.700]  implode our economies in the first world like they've already done in the third world because
[2:37:00.700 --> 2:37:04.940]  that was in the documents and greg palis the bbc got those secret documents that released them
[2:37:06.460 --> 2:37:12.780]  what was the hundred point plan of the imf world bank we have the plans to the freaking death star
[2:37:12.780 --> 2:37:19.260]  we know how to beat them i mean let me tell you something unless you're worth 20 million dollars
[2:37:19.260 --> 2:37:23.980]  and got an armored underground fortress in new zealand you're not protected from this
[2:37:25.740 --> 2:37:29.020]  these are nihilists that want to commit suicide but want to take us with them
[2:37:32.060 --> 2:37:37.820]  so people tell me jones you got courage taking them on i for courage this is the opposite of
[2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:44.700]  courage i am not a coward but i don't want to die and that my children died i don't want them to
[2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:49.740]  win this is self-preservation so it looks like i have all this courage to fight these people and
[2:37:49.740 --> 2:37:57.180]  i'm not worried about we're all dead if they win what are you talking about there's been a few
[2:37:57.180 --> 2:38:02.940]  famous cases movies made about it documented cases i forget the names were a pretty good-sized
[2:38:02.940 --> 2:38:08.380]  ocean liner a ship turns over and there's a bunch of people stuck in it it's sinking in the next
[2:38:08.380 --> 2:38:15.340]  few hours and somebody's got to swim a hundred yards 200 yards in the dark through a ship to get
[2:38:15.340 --> 2:38:20.460]  out they hope through a bulkhead to then get to the surface and turn the pumps on and save the ship
[2:38:22.140 --> 2:38:26.940]  but we saw a real example that was at tailand or whatever when the cave came in and there was a big
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:35.740]  big big flood and they sent the army divers in some died some of the kids died they had to go in
[2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:40.460]  through you know a half mile through tiny openings to try to get children and bring them back out
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:50.540]  but they did it those guys had courage because they didn't have to go into the flooded cave where
[2:38:50.540 --> 2:38:57.260]  the kids were on the school field trip and save them but they did it because they were men
[2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:07.420]  so so i'm not the guys in the flooded cave going and doing that i'm the child in the cave
[2:39:08.380 --> 2:39:12.460]  literally with a radio transmitter and everybody else saying save us save us we're under attack
[2:39:12.460 --> 2:39:16.380]  god the new world owners really bad they're really evil we better do something right now god they
[2:39:16.380 --> 2:39:21.500]  want to kill everybody i mean i mean like oh jones you've really got courage to warn people
[2:39:21.500 --> 2:39:25.980]  you're like on the air warning people about the new world order and man you've got the justice
[2:39:25.980 --> 2:39:29.820]  department's coming after you and you know they're attacking you in the media you're being deposed
[2:39:29.820 --> 2:39:36.940]  in sandy hook i mean you know my goodness aren't you scared i'm like that's like a fly landing on
[2:39:36.940 --> 2:39:44.460]  my shoulder while my house is burning down i want you to get out of this mindset that you're doing
[2:39:44.460 --> 2:39:49.980]  this because you're a hero or you're doing this because you're something special we are all children
[2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:58.460]  in the cave with the water raising about to die and we got a call on god to save us and then that's
[2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:04.060]  what's going to happen so no i'm not the scuba divers that went and did that i'm not them i'm
[2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:08.540]  like the child in the cave with the water rising and i'm at least saying we need to get out of here
[2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:13.420]  this isn't good this is a problem oh you're so you got this courage to say it because people
[2:40:13.420 --> 2:40:20.860]  can't admit they're under attack i'm already the last segment of the hour who knows the phone
[2:40:20.860 --> 2:40:26.780]  system works what we're going to try right now clown car rob george kate let's go to let's go to
[2:40:26.780 --> 2:40:33.500]  kate kate and fee female region seven and if the lines don't work we'll just won't do calls today
[2:40:33.500 --> 2:40:39.340]  kate you're on the air go ahead kate hey alex do you are spot on when you talk about critical
[2:40:39.340 --> 2:40:45.180]  thinking skills and they are lacking sorely and they have been replaced by learned helplessness
[2:40:45.180 --> 2:40:51.260]  and i say learned helplessness people have learned this it's fake it's not real we are not helpless
[2:40:51.260 --> 2:40:58.620]  and these totalitarian regime plans cannot be carried out unless they have minions to execute
[2:40:58.620 --> 2:41:05.340]  them those minions are nurses doctors pharmacists who are sticking those needles in the arms of our
[2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:11.980]  family our friends our children even babies right now we need to expose them we need to
[2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:18.300]  reach them on a human level before these jabs get taken over by robots because i predict that's coming
[2:41:18.860 --> 2:41:25.580]  humans need to defend humanity and we need to wake up humanity and one of the ways we do it is to
[2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:30.860]  start thinking critically i applaud you that you've got that training planned we need to get out of
[2:41:30.860 --> 2:41:36.780]  this learned helplessness and we need to fight back with our minds because this is a war for our
[2:41:36.780 --> 2:41:43.980]  minds it's on that level it's mind control don't be controlled think critically think for yourself
[2:41:43.980 --> 2:41:50.140]  connect with god first of all because that will give you the real battle plan we are on god's side
[2:41:50.140 --> 2:41:56.060]  if god be for us no one can be against us and we need to be strong courageous we need to fight for
[2:41:56.060 --> 2:42:01.900]  our family our friends for all of humanity and stand up and wake these minions up cvs wall
[2:42:01.900 --> 2:42:06.940]  greens all of these places that are complicit with this they're making a killing literally
[2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:12.380]  sticking this poison in in our fellow humans we need to put an end to that we need to have
[2:42:12.380 --> 2:42:18.220]  civil disobedience carry signs in front of those places right to their leaders i've been in the
[2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:24.940]  belly of the beast and i know how it works and it's very ugly it's a sordid industry so we need

[2:46:59.980 --> 2:47:14.540]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:47:17.980 --> 2:47:25.500]  in constant sorrow all right cake medical whistleblower female region seven we want to
[2:47:25.500 --> 2:47:30.780]  get you on as a guest sometime you're really well-spoken lady give us a few more minutes of
[2:47:30.780 --> 2:47:38.780]  data that people should know. Sure alex well these globalist globalist controlled insurance
[2:47:38.780 --> 2:47:45.420]  companies healthcare insurance companies so-called are all about money they're about power you can
[2:47:45.420 --> 2:47:53.740]  look on the cms website right now centers for medicare and medicaid and get some idea of what
[2:47:53.740 --> 2:48:00.700]  what measures are being tracked by these insurance companies many of them relate to vaccinations there
[2:48:00.700 --> 2:48:08.460]  was just a bulletin put out today on counseling children for covid vaccination and incentivizing
[2:48:08.460 --> 2:48:17.580]  financially these companies to do this this is absolutely a demonic industry i am i am very proud
[2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:24.380]  to say i took a stand and have lost my position uh recently with one of them and i would do it all
[2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:31.020]  over again but i know a lot of things that i would like to share um that would probably curl most
[2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:35.020]  people's hair about these well hey if you want to get in touch with robert kennedy jr i can get you
[2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:42.780]  in touch with him and i'm i'm helping folks fall suit with the whistleblower uh tomorrow so absolutely
[2:48:42.780 --> 2:48:47.820]  i i but listen i'd love to get you on as a guest want to say your name or anything but that's just
[2:48:47.820 --> 2:48:52.460]  par for the course but we need to get more amazing people like you to stand up and tell the truth of
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:58.700]  this system will go down absolutely we have to tell the truth and god will take care of us alex
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:03.980]  i'm not worried about it i had family and friends telling me oh you need to be careful what you're
[2:49:03.980 --> 2:49:08.220]  going to lose your job what's going to happen to you i said god's in control i'm doing the right
[2:49:08.220 --> 2:49:12.780]  thing if you do the right thing god takes care of you that's been proven throughout my life many times
[2:49:12.780 --> 2:49:18.620]  so well katie i totally agree but i mean now going after five-year-olds and now babies next month
[2:49:19.180 --> 2:49:24.380]  or in a month and a half i mean this is so obvious i mean this is not even hard now
[2:49:25.420 --> 2:49:33.980]  no it's it's um a concerted effort to kill the human race and i guarantee you this is my prediction
[2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:39.420]  i haven't seen it anywhere else but um you heard it here first then the robots will be the ones
[2:49:39.420 --> 2:49:45.820]  to inject us going forward or bill gates has this nice little auto immunization system where you
[2:49:45.820 --> 2:49:52.700]  just stick a snake like tooth set up into your skin you know you can vaccinate yourself that's
[2:49:52.700 --> 2:49:58.620]  been talked about before so all of this is coming if people don't wake up and learn to think critically
[2:49:58.620 --> 2:50:03.500]  and i think your program's going to be great to help them with that if they don't get that information
[2:50:03.500 --> 2:50:08.060]  and they just continue in this state of learned helplessness where they do whatever they're told
[2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:11.740]  then they're going to be injecting themselves they're going to stick out their arms for robots
[2:50:11.740 --> 2:50:15.660]  they're going to stick their hands in a machine and let it stick a needle in them or chip remember
[2:50:15.660 --> 2:50:21.420]  walmart tried to roll out with those robots that would give you a diagnostic and just like uh the
[2:50:21.420 --> 2:50:27.180]  whole system that came out with the blood testing that was a fraud it was a fraud as well beautifully
[2:50:27.180 --> 2:50:31.820]  said kate if you want to talk to us katie give us your name and number because i'm going to be starting
[2:50:31.820 --> 2:50:42.300]  in the new year three nights a week a three hour show commercial free just for listeners to call in
[2:50:42.300 --> 2:50:48.060]  and special guests and so and people like god that's a lot jones you're already i gotta do it
[2:50:49.340 --> 2:50:53.340]  and we don't do the podcast thing we're because we're on a bunch of radio stations we do the radio
[2:50:53.340 --> 2:50:59.660]  format that has 14 minutes of ads an hour which is fine that's a standard deal but it's going to be
[2:50:59.660 --> 2:51:03.580]  three hours and when you play a video report or something is the break there's not going to be
[2:51:03.580 --> 2:51:08.940]  breaks and it's it's it's a whole and there's so much more behind it i can't tell you about it yet
[2:51:09.660 --> 2:51:13.500]  but just let me tell you our best work is happening now and it's the holy spirit doing it all
[2:51:14.220 --> 2:51:20.220]  and i'm working with really great people with a real social network you know trump can't launch
[2:51:20.220 --> 2:51:25.340]  when he doesn't know how this is beyond a social network this is everything that all the systems
[2:51:25.340 --> 2:51:32.460]  have in one and you'll see what i do is new and then it's just one part of it and then it
[2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:39.580]  explodes it's like a bomb and a peaceful type of bomb but i mean i can tell you you think we've
[2:51:39.580 --> 2:51:45.900]  delivered so far it's all god gets the glory you think you think alex jones has kicked some globalist

[2:57:56.780 --> 2:58:03.420]  promote one thing from one of your co-host owin shroyer supermail volatility and brain force plus
[2:58:03.420 --> 2:58:08.380]  mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank supermail volatility really really works it's
[2:58:08.380 --> 2:58:15.340]  cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic
[2:58:15.340 --> 2:58:20.300]  effect compared to powdered versions they also work quite well they just aren't as strong this is like
[2:58:20.300 --> 2:58:25.420]  a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes
[2:58:25.420 --> 2:58:29.100]  it's just okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch is
[2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:34.460]  in a strong that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes
[2:58:34.460 --> 2:58:46.060]  it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:58:46.060 --> 2:58:52.140]  i've been fighting as hard as i can for almost 28 years against the globalist i wanted to stop
[2:58:52.140 --> 2:58:57.580]  their agenda i wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[2:58:57.580 --> 2:59:03.100]  operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake yes we're not getting caught flatfooted
[2:59:03.100 --> 2:59:09.740]  but they are going ahead with their full operational deindustrialization great reset and that's why
[2:59:09.740 --> 2:59:14.620]  it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the
[2:59:14.620 --> 2:59:19.260]  show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth so we've got an information
[2:59:19.260 --> 2:59:23.660]  warfare the enemy and try to stop their agenda we've also got to get personally prepared and
[2:59:23.660 --> 2:59:27.100]  one of the number one things to do is high quality storeable food we've got the best food

[3:00:25.740 --> 3:00:32.300]  let's go to Jason in Texas he asks when will the next phase kick off specifically of the globalist
[3:00:32.300 --> 3:00:37.340]  takeover I think we're in the next phase right now what do you think I of course I agree with you
[3:00:37.340 --> 3:00:42.300]  I've been listening to you for about 17 years called the multiple times we're usually right about
[3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:49.020]  everything we talk about um remember when the reporter asked Joe Biden when you know what are
[3:00:49.020 --> 3:00:53.740]  you going to do about the people who refuse the vaccine he said oh we'll deal with them so I'm
[3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:59.500]  kind of what does that mean where is he going with that and lockdowns absolutely total look the
[3:00:59.500 --> 3:01:04.140]  globalists run the plan so whatever you see in Germany or Australia or the UK that's coming here
[3:01:04.140 --> 3:01:08.860]  next Canada the same deal everything you see is what they want they just know Americans
[3:01:08.860 --> 3:01:12.300]  have such a history I wanted to say this to start the show day and I forgot to say it
[3:01:13.820 --> 3:01:19.420]  everybody bashes America all day and says oh we're not that free of a country and I agree
[3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:25.420]  we're the best house in a bad neighborhood but now you're seeing how good America is
[3:01:25.420 --> 3:01:30.380]  and how good conservative Christian states are because we're some of the only countries
[3:01:30.380 --> 3:01:34.300]  and only areas in the world because states are countries we're confederation countries
[3:01:35.020 --> 3:01:40.780]  that have any freedom brother go ahead and then like in Australia how they're you know locking the
[3:01:40.780 --> 3:01:46.300]  people up and putting them in these camps where do you think here will they start doing that will
[3:01:46.300 --> 3:01:50.700]  they start using like football stadiums they're all the closed wall they're going to do it in blue
[3:01:50.700 --> 3:01:56.940]  cities and states by collapsing the economy by firing all the un-injected then they'll say oh
[3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:01.340]  there's so many homeless they're in the murder zone and yeah somewhere had quarantined oh some
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:08.380]  escaped oh my god they've got the news you know z cron or mobby bob cron or boo boo cron or
[3:02:08.380 --> 3:02:15.020]  claus swab cron whatever thing they've got and yeah just hysteria and a normalization of martial law
[3:02:15.020 --> 3:02:22.540]  and got to have an iphone or a tracker chip to go outside that's all this is exactly all the good
[3:02:22.540 --> 3:02:30.300]  news is that uh liberal nazi swab teacher she'll be dead soon from all her poison shots and boosters
[3:02:30.300 --> 3:02:36.860]  and all that and the only place she'll be teaching is in hell i agree brother i mean we have aborigines
[3:02:36.860 --> 3:02:43.020]  in australia doing s s's they're taking them to camps this is all a cover for evil activity
[3:02:43.020 --> 3:02:48.380]  with evil globalists giving orders to police and military to see if they follow the orders
[3:02:48.380 --> 3:02:56.140]  we have to be moral and say this is wrong and say no that's it damn right god bless you brother
[3:02:57.020 --> 3:03:02.620]  i mean what's crazy is because of america's republic and because of the second amendment

[3:05:50.540 --> 3:05:59.340]  check out the new line it's amazing
[3:05:59.340 --> 3:06:16.780]  Dr. Fauci as you advise the president about the possibility of new testing requirements for
[3:06:16.780 --> 3:06:24.860]  people coming into this country does that include everybody the answer is yes because you know that
[3:06:24.860 --> 3:06:31.420]  the new the new regulation if you want to call it that is that anybody and everybody who's coming
[3:06:31.420 --> 3:06:37.180]  into the country needs to get a test within 24 hours of getting on the plane to come here but
[3:06:37.180 --> 3:06:41.740]  what about people who don't take a plane and just these border crossers coming in in huge numbers
[3:06:42.300 --> 3:06:46.380]  that's a different issue for example when you talk about we still have title 42 with regard to
[3:06:46.380 --> 3:06:51.340]  protection at the border so there are protections at the border that you don't have the capability
[3:06:51.340 --> 3:06:56.460]  as you know if somebody getting on a plane getting checked looking at a passport we don't have that
[3:06:56.460 --> 3:07:00.300]  there but we can get some degree of mitigation
[3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:15.820]  so you guys are since here at where are we at DCTC
[3:07:15.820 --> 3:07:21.900]  going technical power they didn't get told they couldn't attend today until 3 30 this morning they
[3:07:21.900 --> 3:07:27.740]  got an email so they also said that some of their friends were here and there were buses of students
[3:07:27.740 --> 3:07:34.460]  coming from the cities that are all paid actors and the few actual students were allowed in here
[3:07:34.460 --> 3:07:40.460]  it's just so typical the biden administration we got fake students we got a fake president
[3:07:40.460 --> 3:07:47.740]  we got a fake white house tv set and the real people they're locked out wow freaking wow
[3:07:50.540 --> 3:07:56.140]  so you guys are told not to go to school today is that correct yes we cannot we're not on the
[3:07:56.140 --> 3:08:00.860]  campus today there's going to be strict security due to Joe Biden's visit and that will have an
[3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:06.700]  assignment digitally and we didn't hear about this until about 3 3 a.m. today yeah and it's
[3:08:06.700 --> 3:08:12.780]  november 30th 2021 people that they brought in fake students that do not go to DCTC that are paid
[3:08:13.500 --> 3:08:17.420]  to pretend like they are students here because obviously they're not like any students that's
[3:08:17.420 --> 3:08:23.180]  right yeah that is unbelievable this was one of the most conservative schools in the state
[3:08:23.180 --> 3:08:29.660]  and that you know i see so they don't want all the promotion they want to show the narrative that
[3:08:29.660 --> 3:08:37.340]  they want to show them very interesting thank you guys so much stand up and fight and take this country
[3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:45.980]  back they don't even deny that they shut down colleges when he comes and they just bring actors
[3:08:45.980 --> 3:08:51.900]  there and then he goes on tv yesterday and says i don't read the bills i don't even want to know
[3:08:51.900 --> 3:08:56.460]  what this is i just sign whatever they say that's the part about having a senile person in there
[3:08:56.460 --> 3:09:01.580]  because the globalist can blame him later once he has dementia so bad he can't even wipe his own
[3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:13.660]  ass here's a clip of him talking about it all right here we go mental well i'm not going to

[3:09:45.100 --> 3:09:51.340]  14th because i didn't turn in a religious exemption i'm not getting vaccinated and i just want to ask
[3:09:51.340 --> 3:09:56.620]  you you ever heard of the uh hundredth monkey effect i have heard of the hundredth monkey effect
[3:09:56.620 --> 3:10:02.460]  it just happened with elon musk uh when he went on joe rogan years ago he basically two months after
[3:10:02.460 --> 3:10:07.180]  i said it repeated it but said more about the interdimensional stuff and then he just came out
[3:10:07.180 --> 3:10:12.780]  and said we've got to remove the false software they placed on our minds and connect to the universe
[3:10:12.780 --> 3:10:17.900]  that god gave us and that's exactly what's in reset wars so that's the hundred monthly effect
[3:10:17.900 --> 3:10:23.500]  why don't you tell people about the hundredth monkey effect well i think that uh we're going
[3:10:23.500 --> 3:10:29.100]  to see something like that kind of coming up soon i just think about all these i mean i was just
[3:10:29.100 --> 3:10:34.700]  listening to the ad that came on before of the people getting interviewed or whatever they're
[3:10:34.700 --> 3:10:41.420]  talking about how there was no students there all paid actors and just every little thing that happens
[3:10:41.420 --> 3:10:47.100]  like that even if it's just 10 or 20 people who get a whiff of like uh something's not right here
[3:10:47.100 --> 3:10:53.180]  you know what i mean that i totally agree and that's why they're suing me all over is they don't
[3:10:53.180 --> 3:11:00.700]  want anybody questioning public events like jesse smallen or so many others because so many times
[3:11:00.700 --> 3:11:05.260]  they've got hired actors and provocateurs there and that's a fact they want to just accept their
[3:11:05.260 --> 3:11:12.300]  bs guess what we're not sue sue away ha ha ha all right if i tell you a little story real fast
[3:11:12.300 --> 3:11:20.060]  yes sir um all right so before 9 11 happened my dad's a tattoo artist and this this guy is this
[3:11:20.060 --> 3:11:28.140]  is in like a year or two before 9 11 happened 2000 uh this guy won the tattoo of trenton
[3:11:28.140 --> 3:11:34.620]  he's from trenton he won the trenton skyline just on fire and my dad said there's no really
[3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:40.700]  building in trenton that's notable you know what i mean so we should do the twin towers being burnt
[3:11:40.700 --> 3:11:46.060]  and then next thing you know this guy has a tattoo and he looks at it and it's literally a picture of
[3:11:46.060 --> 3:11:51.660]  the twin towers being burnt and that's for like a couple a couple months after that people were
[3:11:51.660 --> 3:11:56.540]  just coming to my dad like oh it tattooed me i don't even know what i want just just put it on me
[3:11:56.540 --> 3:12:02.380]  i think yeah like your father was an oracle looking in the future i think we're all oracles
[3:12:02.380 --> 3:12:06.300]  at the end of the day have we given to god's will thank you ian all right let's take another

[3:12:37.500 --> 3:12:44.140]  and killed by alex balvin but didn't get shot by alex balvin exactly definitely the deep state
[3:12:44.140 --> 3:12:48.940]  is blackmailing each other over ebstein there's an internal war going on there's what we need to
[3:12:48.940 --> 3:12:53.340]  do alex a weekly wrap-up like you were talking about have the callers just call in and throw
[3:12:53.340 --> 3:12:57.420]  stuff on the wall and let's go through what sticks we need to have a round table weekly

[3:13:05.900 --> 3:13:12.700]  we're thinking monday wednesday thursday or we're still gauging it we're gonna do a three-hour
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:17.500]  commercial free show because it's just gonna be all callers and guests i totally agree with you
[3:13:17.500 --> 3:13:20.060]  it's it's happening it's done i'm getting the crew set up it's all happening
[3:13:20.060 --> 3:13:24.220]  all right and i also bet my friend that he would say clown car is right just like i said alex
[3:13:24.220 --> 3:13:30.060]  jones is right also alex i i want to yes clown car is always right thank you my brother listen
[3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:34.700]  i broke down a code you know sometimes you get the downloads i get the weird downloads i got this
[3:13:34.700 --> 3:13:39.420]  weird one when i saw the executive order going into play i started looking at the numbers weird
[3:13:39.420 --> 3:13:45.500]  it was put in fourth on november 26th it doesn't take effect till december 26th and then is over
[3:13:45.500 --> 3:13:52.860]  on january 15th which leads the middle of that all to be exactly from effectiveness date to the end
[3:13:52.860 --> 3:13:58.060]  of the date january excuse me new year's day january first so i have a weird feeling about january
[3:13:58.060 --> 3:14:02.860]  first i wanted to bring it up to you guys and somebody brother i hear you i got a weird feeling
[3:14:02.860 --> 3:14:09.260]  about it all the globalist are at war with humanity people are under attack don't be victims be champions
[3:14:09.260 --> 3:14:14.780]  but admit you're under attack and do something about it okay let's talk to jr in new york jr
[3:14:14.780 --> 3:14:21.260]  take us out of the segment go ahead jr alex i love you we pray for you every night thank you um
[3:14:22.060 --> 3:14:26.940]  yeah man uh so i just wanted to talk about your grief your recent wars i can't wait to see it i
[3:14:26.940 --> 3:14:33.820]  had some information that might be good you know that um we are light we are electricity and magnetism
[3:14:33.820 --> 3:14:39.420]  we are yes sir and we are we are beings of light that's right they don't want us to know that that's
[3:14:39.420 --> 3:14:43.900]  why they remove specific books out of the bible like the gospel of thomas the gospel of philip
[3:14:43.900 --> 3:14:48.860]  in the gospel of thomas in the gospel of philip they really go into ways to access our consciousness
[3:14:48.860 --> 3:14:54.620]  um one of the ways is and this is why the the evil ones the globalists they know about sex magic
[3:14:54.620 --> 3:14:59.340]  but in the in the negative way in the gospel of philip no no no no no moment women coming together
[3:14:59.340 --> 3:15:04.620]  is the big ritual that's superpower exactly exactly so but the thing is is that even
[3:15:04.620 --> 3:15:09.660]  even as single this is why they put out pornography is because every time that we have
[3:15:09.660 --> 3:15:16.060]  uh uh an orgasm basically we discharge our electricity that's why when a boxer or any
[3:15:16.060 --> 3:15:20.780]  one in martial arts they know not to do that before a fight that's our spiritual storehouse
[3:15:20.780 --> 3:15:26.380]  that is the holy spirit that's why it says in the bible god the uh the holy spirit is the logos
[3:15:26.380 --> 3:15:31.100]  the logos is the seed our seed and that's definitely that's definitely what the whole
[3:15:31.100 --> 3:15:36.300]  allister crally group knows and they're doing their own operations big guest host coming up
[3:15:36.300 --> 3:15:42.460]  after the break stay with us ladies and gentlemen then oh and shroyer is live ladies and gentlemen
[3:15:42.460 --> 3:15:49.020]  at 3 p.m central standard time thank you so much for everybody we really appreciate you stay with us
[3:15:54.380 --> 3:16:00.380]  what if you could cut your it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can
[3:16:00.380 --> 3:16:05.740]  decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies
[3:16:05.740 --> 3:16:10.780]  reports about my nasa and other governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really
[3:16:10.780 --> 3:16:17.180]  happening with the climate the only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant
[3:16:17.740 --> 3:16:23.020]  so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:26.940]  70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted
[3:16:26.940 --> 3:16:33.180]  to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man made climate change is a real thing
[3:16:33.180 --> 3:16:38.380]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the
[3:16:38.380 --> 3:16:44.620]  un they have weather control trees from 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a
[3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:50.060]  very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different
[3:16:50.060 --> 3:16:54.540]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man made climate change is real
[3:16:55.740 --> 3:17:02.060]  i am a worldly person meaning i like going to ball games i like going to concerts i like going
[3:17:02.060 --> 3:17:07.580]  to play golf i like going out to dinner i like the metropolitan life i like everything that
[3:17:07.580 --> 3:17:14.060]  comes with this but see i have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat
[3:17:14.060 --> 3:17:19.500]  run cities get the hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's
[3:17:19.500 --> 3:17:24.300]  all crashing down is it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get a piece of property
[3:17:24.300 --> 3:17:28.380]  in the woods just get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land
[3:17:28.380 --> 3:17:32.620]  that's the survival instinct but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority
[3:17:32.620 --> 3:17:37.820]  part of me says no no no no stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of
[3:17:37.820 --> 3:17:42.140]  anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the internal
[3:17:42.140 --> 3:17:48.300]  struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least
[3:17:48.300 --> 3:17:52.860]  have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at
[3:17:52.860 --> 3:18:03.660]  infowarsstore.com the covid-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery
[3:18:03.660 --> 3:18:09.900]  a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations
[3:18:09.900 --> 3:18:17.500]  has put in place it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is
[3:18:17.500 --> 3:18:23.180]  the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from
[3:18:23.180 --> 3:18:32.300]  the light of the sun it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil
[3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:40.220]  ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon
[3:18:40.220 --> 3:18:44.700]  us claus schwaub and the eunid mitt they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the
[3:18:44.700 --> 3:18:51.180]  world id and carbon taxes things only get worse from here if we submit they only get better if we
[3:18:51.180 --> 3:18:57.660]  resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance non-compliance eun run contact tracers aren't
[3:18:57.660 --> 3:19:02.780]  coming they're here all over the world from australia to the united states from canada to
[3:19:02.780 --> 3:19:07.420]  germany these tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go then coming to your house
[3:19:07.420 --> 3:19:13.740]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities
[3:19:13.740 --> 3:19:19.020]  and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take quote
[3:19:19.020 --> 3:19:23.660]  healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety this is nothing less than marshal
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:28.780]  law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality faraday cages many of which
[3:19:28.780 --> 3:19:34.060]  are made here in america and are very compliant meaning us government military grade at info

[3:20:13.660 --> 3:20:19.180]  i am cake dally your guest host for this hour so appreciate alex and what a show it's always
[3:20:19.180 --> 3:20:25.500]  what a show right um i just uh i just got to my 10 year anniversary mark on the radio i know it
[3:20:25.500 --> 3:20:31.660]  seems like a crazy decade i never thought i would be in radio and when i started out i was only hired
[3:20:31.660 --> 3:20:38.380]  because i watched fox news can you believe it at the time that was that was literally the reason
[3:20:38.380 --> 3:20:43.180]  i was hired i think probably many people like me were hired because of that uh because yeah do you
[3:20:43.180 --> 3:20:48.780]  know anything about politics well i watched fox news while you're hired um so it was an interesting
[3:20:48.780 --> 3:20:56.140]  beginning as a neocon turning into this sort of uh quest for research and wanting to know more and
[3:20:56.140 --> 3:21:01.500]  more because i knew the world did not add up i knew that what i was being told on the tv set just
[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:07.900]  was not was not going on the way that i was viewing this world and so it brought me to some really
[3:21:07.900 --> 3:21:11.980]  obvious conclusions and i want to share some things with you and i also want to share with you
[3:21:11.980 --> 3:21:16.940]  what's coming because there is some interesting technology if you really follow these people
[3:21:16.940 --> 3:21:21.820]  and what they're all about and how evil they are you really get an idea of why they do what
[3:21:21.820 --> 3:21:28.140]  they do and where we're headed in ai so before we get there i've had over 28 thousand hours of
[3:21:28.140 --> 3:21:34.220]  research now that's a lot of research that's a lot of research and you know what i always wish
[3:21:34.220 --> 3:21:38.860]  that people would ask me so what have you learned you know what happened what did what did you come
[3:21:38.860 --> 3:21:44.460]  across um i don't get that isn't that interesting you know what i get i get well does it align with
[3:21:44.460 --> 3:21:50.940]  what i've learned from the mainstream media line scumbags just what is what you say different than
[3:21:50.940 --> 3:21:56.940]  what they say ooh then i might not like what you have to say because truth is a tough thing to listen
[3:21:56.940 --> 3:22:03.580]  to and when i when i uh last christmas i remember calling out i i kept seeing these memes for peace
[3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:08.860]  on earth can we just have peace on earth and i remember thinking no we don't need peace on earth
[3:22:08.860 --> 3:22:16.300]  you know what we need we need truth on earth that would actually bring peace a lot of truth on earth
[3:22:17.180 --> 3:22:22.140]  and i appreciate what info wars has done because info wars is bringing truth to the forefront
[3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:28.140]  and this is what i have been in a quest to do see people can call me a conspiracy theorist
[3:22:28.140 --> 3:22:32.140]  because i get down to the facts that actually make sense and i don't put my head in the sand
[3:22:32.140 --> 3:22:38.060]  when you put your head in the sand and you have to artfully do this enough to become what i call a
[3:22:38.060 --> 3:22:43.420]  coincidence theorist a coincidence theorist is everything's a coincidence oh my gosh you mean
[3:22:43.420 --> 3:22:49.660]  the elite pretty much fondle each other and feel each other up and love each other to death oh
[3:22:49.660 --> 3:22:54.140]  they're all in the same circles you mean they're all marrying each other and all of their kids hang
[3:22:54.140 --> 3:23:00.140]  out and there's pictures together like is glade maxwell and good ol boris and all of these people
[3:23:00.140 --> 3:23:05.660]  yeah yeah that's what i'm talking about i'm talking about the fact that these people it's not a
[3:23:05.660 --> 3:23:12.220]  coincidence that they hang out every five seconds together and remedy some of their plans together
[3:23:12.220 --> 3:23:16.860]  in fact there's just so many things that happen that i can't ignore let me give you just a little
[3:23:16.860 --> 3:23:23.180]  tiny list from what happened over the last decade of me myself being in radio right the planes
[3:23:23.180 --> 3:23:29.260]  didn't make the towers fall neither did a plane full of soddies many of the school shootings
[3:23:29.260 --> 3:23:35.180]  have been false flags i'm sorry but they have been too many things didn't add up too many strange
[3:23:35.180 --> 3:23:41.900]  things i were at fault right too many strange things we don't have any adults over the age of 50
[3:23:42.700 --> 3:23:47.580]  or at least one in 40 that has autism there's a definite problem there that we need to you know
[3:23:47.580 --> 3:23:54.940]  that we need to research right and we have trust me education was taken over in 1907 by two groups
[3:23:54.940 --> 3:24:02.700]  that were considering themselves nonprofits who are still going strong today and uh that's a fact
[3:24:02.700 --> 3:24:07.420]  they actually colluded to do that and they did it successfully it took over education
[3:24:08.060 --> 3:24:14.140]  kennedy was taken out i'm sorry but he was feminism didn't just occur it was planned
[3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:19.740]  women didn't just get angry all in one decade and resent their lives no it was artfully planned
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:26.940]  and executed a lot of people on the scene to encourage women to get very angry and unfulfilled
[3:24:26.940 --> 3:24:34.060]  right people don't realize that the cia has done nothing but install presidencies worldwide
[3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:40.700]  disrupt this planet and destroy the family culture media truth and elections sorry but that's just
[3:24:40.700 --> 3:24:48.620]  the fact fauci is our version of mengala i just call him fengala it's easier it's honestly it's
[3:24:48.620 --> 3:24:53.180]  what he's about he's been doing this for 30 years he holds all the patents it's a joke that we don't
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:58.460]  realize this little hitler man has been out in the press saying the things he's been saying
[3:24:58.460 --> 3:25:05.260]  it's absurd he's a disgrace he's evil let's recognize it for seven decades you have not
[3:25:05.260 --> 3:25:09.980]  actually been affected by climate change have you of course not and we didn't die at the end of every
[3:25:09.980 --> 3:25:17.980]  decade and you know when people uh kind of stop recognizing god what happens they start hating
[3:25:17.980 --> 3:25:23.340]  other people for existing bill gates has a wonderful little clip in which he diagnoses
[3:25:23.340 --> 3:25:28.700]  the problem of the universe the problem is us it's competition for resources he doesn't want
[3:25:28.700 --> 3:25:36.620]  us around he's an avowed atheist right back in george magazine in 1998 george magazine named
[3:25:36.620 --> 3:25:43.260]  for george bush by the way senior bush anyway total trader uh the interview uh happened with bill
[3:25:43.260 --> 3:25:49.260]  gates in 1998 and this is what he said keep keep a close tab on this he said my own views this was
[3:25:49.260 --> 3:25:52.940]  at the end of the interview my own views are those you'd expect from somebody who feels
[3:25:52.940 --> 3:25:59.580]  like he's been very very lucky and the resources under his command are really society's resources
[3:25:59.580 --> 3:26:06.140]  and i have to be clever about how i'm going to funnel those back in i fund education products
[3:26:06.140 --> 3:26:13.900]  i fund population control and i'm very big in the united way um yeah the united way
[3:26:14.460 --> 3:26:18.540]  we'll have to have a talk about that sometime i've done a lot of research on the united way
[3:26:19.420 --> 3:26:26.940]  so that happened back in 1998 he's been very very proud of of his ability to entrench himself
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:31.180]  into population control very proud of it he loves it they usually are
[3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:38.060]  are covid is a label i'm sorry but it is it's a label for 98 symptoms 98 symptoms that pretty
[3:26:38.060 --> 3:26:42.860]  much fill in the blank for any illness in any disease you could possibly have that's the truth
[3:26:44.540 --> 3:26:51.100]  honestly they're using medicinide medicine centralized medicine to execute people it's
[3:26:51.100 --> 3:26:58.060]  the truth there are no laws on the books and mandates are not a thing but osha concocted
[3:26:58.060 --> 3:27:04.460]  a regulation not based on any u.s. code or law to give themselves power to say to companies all
[3:27:04.460 --> 3:27:10.620]  over the country that they must mandate uh you know a vaccine right although they had to step
[3:27:10.620 --> 3:27:17.500]  down because they knew that it was all smoke and mirrors it's all smoke and mirrors it's always
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:24.780]  smoke and mirrors truth is very oh i don't know straightforward and lies always require smoke and
[3:27:24.780 --> 3:27:29.260]  mirrors and king fraud a lot and hormola i like to call her hormola she slept her way to the top
[3:27:29.260 --> 3:27:34.540]  and she's proud of it you know what no one wanted that little poop your pants idiot in office nobody
[3:27:35.820 --> 3:27:40.940]  name one person who did nobody did right he couldn't even get 16 percent of his own party
[3:27:40.940 --> 3:27:48.300]  to vote for him and uh we have to realize that the elites run this little circus in all of these
[3:27:48.300 --> 3:27:53.660]  relationships they have with each other in order to ignore all of those things that i just said
[3:27:53.660 --> 3:27:57.500]  you have to make sure that you realize that everything is a coincidence right you have to
[3:27:57.500 --> 3:28:03.820]  believe that everything is a coincidence well it's not in fact government is very very powerful
[3:28:03.820 --> 3:28:08.540]  and we know this where do you think uh joseph was headed with mary when they were about to give
[3:28:08.540 --> 3:28:14.140]  birth to the christ child here we are at christmas time right he was going to pay his taxes he risked
[3:28:14.140 --> 3:28:20.300]  the life of his uh of his newborn to go and make sure to get to bethlehem 65 miles away to pay his
[3:28:20.300 --> 3:28:27.500]  taxes that's how important it was that you had to do exactly what government said this is important
[3:28:27.500 --> 3:28:33.020]  knowledge because we can go all the way back to time and say government has had a presence
[3:28:33.020 --> 3:28:37.900]  to oppress people and people are virtually pretty scared of government right what they can do
[3:28:38.620 --> 3:28:43.340]  they even uh ordered a decree to kill anyone under the age of two had mary and joseph been good
[3:28:43.340 --> 3:28:47.740]  global citizens christ wouldn't have survived i'm going to come right back and i want to talk
[3:28:47.740 --> 3:28:52.540]  about where this is going with ai let's talk about the truth of what's actually going on right now
[3:28:53.100 --> 3:28:58.860]  i'm k dally your guest host you know listeners call the purpose of fear is to call us into action
[3:28:58.860 --> 3:29:04.460]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[3:29:04.460 --> 3:29:09.660]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[3:29:09.660 --> 3:29:15.580]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent
[3:29:15.580 --> 3:29:21.420]  of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[3:29:21.420 --> 3:29:26.060]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:32.380]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[3:29:32.380 --> 3:29:37.580]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even
[3:29:37.580 --> 3:29:43.180]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so
[3:29:43.180 --> 3:29:49.420]  we must prepare get up to a year's worth of storable foods water filtration survival gear

[3:30:54.900 --> 3:30:57.900]  So, when I first started taking survival skills,
[3:30:57.900 --> 3:30:59.900]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:30:59.900 --> 3:31:02.900]  I had brain fog, like you wouldn't believe.
[3:31:02.900 --> 3:31:04.900]  I was barely holding onto a job,
[3:31:04.900 --> 3:31:06.900]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it.
[3:31:06.900 --> 3:31:09.900]  So, the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[3:31:09.900 --> 3:31:11.900]  And it worked pretty good.
[3:31:11.900 --> 3:31:13.900]  And then, shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[3:31:13.900 --> 3:31:15.900]  You had, you know, with a deep-burnt source, you know,
[3:31:15.900 --> 3:31:17.900]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:31:17.900 --> 3:31:20.900]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[3:31:20.900 --> 3:31:23.900]  to, like, literally, like, my brain was enlightened.
[3:31:23.900 --> 3:31:25.900]  You know, I could think again.
[3:31:25.900 --> 3:31:27.900]  I could connect with people again.
[3:31:27.900 --> 3:31:29.900]  For the course of the next couple of years,
[3:31:29.900 --> 3:31:31.900]  I got my health back, and I religiously take,
[3:31:31.900 --> 3:31:33.900]  basically, all of your supplements.
[3:31:33.900 --> 3:31:35.900]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:31:35.900 --> 3:31:37.900]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[3:31:37.900 --> 3:31:39.900]  It literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:31:39.900 --> 3:31:41.900]  It's amazing. It works.
[3:31:41.900 --> 3:31:43.900]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:31:43.900 --> 3:31:45.900]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[3:31:45.900 --> 3:31:48.900]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health
[3:31:48.900 --> 3:31:50.900]  into our own hands.
[3:31:50.900 --> 3:31:51.900]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:31:51.900 --> 3:31:54.900]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.

[3:33:11.900 --> 3:33:13.900]  All right, I'm Kate Daly. I'm back with you.
[3:33:13.900 --> 3:33:15.900]  I am your guest host for this hour,
[3:33:15.900 --> 3:33:18.900]  and my show starts right when this ends,

[3:33:24.900 --> 3:33:26.900]  and join in the conversation there as well.
[3:33:26.900 --> 3:33:29.900]  I just left the last segment
[3:33:29.900 --> 3:33:31.900]  talking about how if Mary and Joseph
[3:33:31.900 --> 3:33:33.900]  would have been good global citizens
[3:33:33.900 --> 3:33:35.900]  like we're supposed to be,
[3:33:35.900 --> 3:33:37.900]  they would have probably offered up the Christ child
[3:33:37.900 --> 3:33:39.900]  to be murdered. Would they not have?
[3:33:39.900 --> 3:33:41.900]  Of course they would have, but no, they didn't do that.
[3:33:41.900 --> 3:33:43.900]  Government has always been oppressive.
[3:33:43.900 --> 3:33:46.900]  Government has always had the evil leading edge
[3:33:46.900 --> 3:33:49.900]  because it had the power of oppression for people.
[3:33:49.900 --> 3:33:51.900]  If you study government for 10 years,
[3:33:51.900 --> 3:33:54.900]  that's probably the conclusion you'll come to, too.
[3:33:54.900 --> 3:33:57.900]  I've also, I had to recognize that along the way
[3:33:57.900 --> 3:33:59.900]  that it really is the study of evil.
[3:33:59.900 --> 3:34:02.900]  I've said this here before. It's a study of evil,
[3:34:02.900 --> 3:34:04.900]  and people really need to recognize
[3:34:04.900 --> 3:34:06.900]  that we underestimate evil in this country.
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:08.900]  Why? Because we're not evil. That's why.
[3:34:08.900 --> 3:34:10.900]  It's hard for us to recognize something.
[3:34:10.900 --> 3:34:13.900]  It's hard for us to say how bad and how infiltrated
[3:34:13.900 --> 3:34:17.900]  and how swampy it really is, right?
[3:34:17.900 --> 3:34:21.900]  Well, in my study of government,
[3:34:21.900 --> 3:34:24.900]  all roads lead to money, right?
[3:34:24.900 --> 3:34:26.900]  And so usually when somebody does something
[3:34:26.900 --> 3:34:28.900]  like all the bought and sold politicians,
[3:34:28.900 --> 3:34:31.900]  the 80 Republicans that are supposed to be on our side
[3:34:31.900 --> 3:34:35.900]  that sold out our privacy for immunization trackers,
[3:34:35.900 --> 3:34:37.900]  okay, that just happened,
[3:34:37.900 --> 3:34:39.900]  when we're seeing this happen
[3:34:39.900 --> 3:34:41.900]  and we notice the traders involved in government,
[3:34:41.900 --> 3:34:43.900]  we notice how they work,
[3:34:43.900 --> 3:34:45.900]  all roads lead to money.
[3:34:45.900 --> 3:34:47.900]  So you could go back and you could go backwards
[3:34:47.900 --> 3:34:49.900]  and say, well, yes, I mean, this is probably
[3:34:49.900 --> 3:34:51.900]  where they're bought and sold by pharma
[3:34:51.900 --> 3:34:54.900]  and who pretty much has bought all of our governors,
[3:34:54.900 --> 3:34:56.900]  as well as the congressmen and senators.
[3:34:56.900 --> 3:34:58.900]  And so, of course, you go backwards.
[3:34:58.900 --> 3:35:01.900]  But really and truly, we need to go forwards
[3:35:01.900 --> 3:35:03.900]  because we all know by now
[3:35:03.900 --> 3:35:05.900]  that everything is about digital banking.
[3:35:05.900 --> 3:35:08.900]  It's not about health. It's about digital banking.
[3:35:08.900 --> 3:35:10.900]  It's about control, right?
[3:35:10.900 --> 3:35:13.900]  Getting control of the populace to get digital banking.
[3:35:13.900 --> 3:35:15.900]  It's always got to be about money.
[3:35:15.900 --> 3:35:17.900]  It has to be because it's the only thing
[3:35:17.900 --> 3:35:20.900]  that excites these elitists.
[3:35:20.900 --> 3:35:22.900]  It's the only thing that gets them going
[3:35:22.900 --> 3:35:24.900]  is to know that there's going to be a bucket of money
[3:35:24.900 --> 3:35:26.900]  at the end of this, right?
[3:35:26.900 --> 3:35:28.900]  And we are expendable.
[3:35:28.900 --> 3:35:30.900]  And so you have to absolutely ignore,
[3:35:30.900 --> 3:35:32.900]  if you're a coincidence theorist,
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:34.900]  the new variant called moronic.
[3:35:34.900 --> 3:35:36.900]  You absolutely have to ignore this.
[3:35:36.900 --> 3:35:38.900]  And what are we looking at? In two weeks,
[3:35:38.900 --> 3:35:41.900]  one guy two weeks ago in the Netherlands, right?
[3:35:41.900 --> 3:35:43.900]  In the Netherlands have two symptoms,
[3:35:43.900 --> 3:35:45.900]  fatigue and muscle fatigue, right?
[3:35:45.900 --> 3:35:47.900]  And, of course, instead of calling it flu,
[3:35:47.900 --> 3:35:49.900]  because we're actually in flu season,
[3:35:49.900 --> 3:35:51.900]  they, of course, called it this new variant.
[3:35:51.900 --> 3:35:53.900]  And they're going to have a new variant
[3:35:53.900 --> 3:35:55.900]  probably every three months,
[3:35:55.900 --> 3:35:57.900]  which is going to make the last shot you got obsolete
[3:35:57.900 --> 3:35:59.900]  because you have to pony up for the new shot.
[3:35:59.900 --> 3:36:01.900]  This is why the 80 Republicans went all in
[3:36:01.900 --> 3:36:03.900]  with the little traders, Democrats,
[3:36:03.900 --> 3:36:05.900]  to vote immunization trackers
[3:36:05.900 --> 3:36:07.900]  so they can all keep track of how many shots
[3:36:07.900 --> 3:36:09.900]  were actually getting, see?
[3:36:09.900 --> 3:36:11.900]  So you also have to ignore,
[3:36:11.900 --> 3:36:14.900]  you have to ignore that the fact that the,
[3:36:14.900 --> 3:36:17.900]  that the court ordered the FDA to comply
[3:36:17.900 --> 3:36:19.900]  with the file request and release information
[3:36:19.900 --> 3:36:22.900]  on the Pfizer vaccine, the first batch of documents
[3:36:22.900 --> 3:36:24.900]  shows over 1200 vaccine deaths
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:26.900]  within the first 90 days.
[3:36:26.900 --> 3:36:28.900]  You have to ignore that too.
[3:36:28.900 --> 3:36:30.900]  You also have to ignore that the Delta variant
[3:36:30.900 --> 3:36:32.900]  has never had a single test,
[3:36:32.900 --> 3:36:34.900]  that COVID testers have never been quarantined.
[3:36:34.900 --> 3:36:36.900]  Why is that?
[3:36:36.900 --> 3:36:39.900]  They're around people all day long, right?
[3:36:39.900 --> 3:36:42.900]  COVID testing, but they're never, ever quarantined.
[3:36:42.900 --> 3:36:44.900]  That's a problem.
[3:36:44.900 --> 3:36:47.900]  You have to ignore that 99% of our country is just fine.
[3:36:47.900 --> 3:36:49.900]  You absolutely have to ignore that.
[3:36:49.900 --> 3:36:52.900]  And you have to ignore that all the world-renowned
[3:36:52.900 --> 3:36:54.900]  scientists, doctors, whistleblowers,
[3:36:54.900 --> 3:36:58.900]  financial experts are all telling you the exact same thing.
[3:36:58.900 --> 3:37:00.900]  What's coming?
[3:37:00.900 --> 3:37:03.900]  So I read an article back in 2012,
[3:37:03.900 --> 3:37:06.900]  and this was, this was by,
[3:37:06.900 --> 3:37:08.900]  oh, what is the name?
[3:37:08.900 --> 3:37:10.900]  Bayani Samp.
[3:37:10.900 --> 3:37:12.900]  And he was talking about bees.
[3:37:12.900 --> 3:37:14.900]  And I found this to be very interesting
[3:37:14.900 --> 3:37:16.900]  because in correlation with this,
[3:37:16.900 --> 3:37:18.900]  Louis Rosenberg, who's given many TED Talks,
[3:37:18.900 --> 3:37:21.900]  is talking often about bees
[3:37:21.900 --> 3:37:24.900]  and what these bees represent to him.
[3:37:24.900 --> 3:37:27.900]  He studies bees as if he's studying humans.
[3:37:27.900 --> 3:37:30.900]  Keep that in mind when you're listening to him
[3:37:30.900 --> 3:37:32.900]  explain in this clip and this TED Talk
[3:37:32.900 --> 3:37:34.900]  about the hive mentality.
[3:37:34.900 --> 3:37:36.900]  This is very crucial to our future.
[3:37:36.900 --> 3:37:38.900]  Listen up.
[3:37:38.900 --> 3:37:40.900]  Swarm intelligence, and it's a natural step
[3:37:40.900 --> 3:37:44.900]  in the evolution of most social species.
[3:37:44.900 --> 3:37:46.900]  I like to think about it this way.
[3:37:46.900 --> 3:37:48.900]  A brain is a system of neurons
[3:37:48.900 --> 3:37:52.900]  so deeply connected that an intelligence forms.
[3:37:52.900 --> 3:37:54.900]  A swarm is a system of brains
[3:37:54.900 --> 3:37:58.900]  so deeply connected that a superintelligence forms.
[3:37:58.900 --> 3:38:01.900]  Simply put, a swarm is a brain of brains.
[3:38:01.900 --> 3:38:05.900]  And it can be smarter than any individual member.
[3:38:05.900 --> 3:38:07.900]  Let me give you an example.
[3:38:07.900 --> 3:38:09.900]  Honey bees.
[3:38:09.900 --> 3:38:11.900]  This is about 10,000 bees.
[3:38:11.900 --> 3:38:14.900]  And they have a very important problem to solve.
[3:38:14.900 --> 3:38:17.900]  They need to find a new home to move into.
[3:38:17.900 --> 3:38:19.900]  That new home could be a hollow log
[3:38:19.900 --> 3:38:21.900]  or the hole in the side of a building
[3:38:21.900 --> 3:38:23.900]  or if you're unlucky like I was,
[3:38:23.900 --> 3:38:25.900]  a crawl space in your garage.
[3:38:25.900 --> 3:38:27.900]  Now this sounds simple,
[3:38:27.900 --> 3:38:29.900]  but this is a life or death decision
[3:38:29.900 --> 3:38:33.900]  to protect the survival of the colony for generations.
[3:38:33.900 --> 3:38:35.900]  To solve this problem,
[3:38:35.900 --> 3:38:38.900]  the bees send out hundreds of scout bees
[3:38:38.900 --> 3:38:40.900]  that search a 30-square-mile area
[3:38:40.900 --> 3:38:43.900]  and find dozens of candidate sites.
[3:38:43.900 --> 3:38:45.900]  That's the easy part.
[3:38:45.900 --> 3:38:47.900]  The hard part is that they then need to pick
[3:38:47.900 --> 3:38:50.900]  the best possible solution from all the options
[3:38:50.900 --> 3:38:52.900]  that they've discovered.
[3:38:52.900 --> 3:38:54.900]  Now here's the rub.
[3:38:54.900 --> 3:38:56.900]  A honey bee has a tiny brain.
[3:38:56.900 --> 3:39:00.900]  It's smaller than a grain of sand and has less than a million neurons.
[3:39:00.900 --> 3:39:02.900]  You have 85 billion neurons,
[3:39:02.900 --> 3:39:04.900]  so however smart you think you are,
[3:39:04.900 --> 3:39:08.900]  divide that by 85,000 and that's a honey bee.
[3:39:08.900 --> 3:39:10.900]  You probably wouldn't want a honey bee
[3:39:10.900 --> 3:39:12.900]  picking a new home for you.
[3:39:12.900 --> 3:39:16.900]  And yet honey bees are very discriminating house hunters.
[3:39:16.900 --> 3:39:18.900]  They need to find a new home
[3:39:18.900 --> 3:39:21.900]  that's big enough to store the honey they need for the winter,
[3:39:21.900 --> 3:39:25.900]  that's ventilated well enough to stay cool in the summer,
[3:39:25.900 --> 3:39:28.900]  that's insulated well enough to stay warm on cold nights,
[3:39:28.900 --> 3:39:31.900]  that's protected from the rain,
[3:39:31.900 --> 3:39:34.900]  but also near good sources of clean water.
[3:39:34.900 --> 3:39:37.900]  And of course, it needs to be well located
[3:39:37.900 --> 3:39:39.900]  near good sources of pollen.
[3:39:39.900 --> 3:39:42.900]  This is a complex, multi-variable problem.
[3:39:42.900 --> 3:39:44.900]  And to maximize survival,
[3:39:44.900 --> 3:39:46.900]  the bees need to find the best possible solution
[3:39:46.900 --> 3:39:49.900]  across all of these competing constraints.
[3:39:49.900 --> 3:39:52.900]  And remarkably, they do it.
[3:39:52.900 --> 3:39:55.900]  Biologists have shown that honey bees
[3:39:55.900 --> 3:40:00.900]  pick the best possible solution over 80% of the time.
[3:40:00.900 --> 3:40:02.900]  If you were a human CEO
[3:40:02.900 --> 3:40:05.900]  trying to find the perfect location for a new factory,
[3:40:05.900 --> 3:40:07.900]  you'd face a similarly complex problem
[3:40:07.900 --> 3:40:10.900]  and it would be very difficult to find the optimal solution,
[3:40:10.900 --> 3:40:12.900]  and yet honey bees can do it.
[3:40:12.900 --> 3:40:14.900]  Let's think about that.
[3:40:14.900 --> 3:40:16.900]  A single bee has a brain so tiny,
[3:40:16.900 --> 3:40:18.900]  it can't even conceive of the problem,
[3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:21.900]  but when they think together as a system,
[3:40:21.900 --> 3:40:23.900]  they can solve it so accurately
[3:40:23.900 --> 3:40:27.900]  that a human brain would be hard-pressed to match them.
[3:40:27.900 --> 3:40:29.900]  So how do they do this?
[3:40:29.900 --> 3:40:31.900]  By forming a swarm intelligence,
[3:40:31.900 --> 3:40:34.900]  a brain of brains that combines the knowledge and wisdom
[3:40:34.900 --> 3:40:36.900]  and insight and intuition of the group
[3:40:36.900 --> 3:40:40.900]  and converges on a single unified decision.
[3:40:40.900 --> 3:40:42.900]  I know what you're thinking.
[3:40:42.900 --> 3:40:44.900]  Really, these are honey bees.
[3:40:44.900 --> 3:40:46.900]  How do they express opinions?
[3:40:46.900 --> 3:40:48.900]  How do they converge on solutions?
[3:40:48.900 --> 3:40:52.900]  Markably, they do it by vibrating their bodies.
[3:40:52.900 --> 3:40:54.900]  Biologists call this a waggle dance
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:40:56.900]  because to us it looks like the bees are dancing,
[3:40:56.900 --> 3:40:58.900]  but really they're generating signals
[3:40:58.900 --> 3:41:00.900]  that represent their support
[3:41:00.900 --> 3:41:03.900]  for the various home sites under consideration.
[3:41:03.900 --> 3:41:05.900]  By combining these signals,
[3:41:05.900 --> 3:41:07.900]  the bees engage in a multi-directional tug of war,
[3:41:07.900 --> 3:41:09.900]  pushing and pulling on the decision
[3:41:09.900 --> 3:41:11.900]  until they converge on the one solution
[3:41:11.900 --> 3:41:13.900]  that they can best agree upon,
[3:41:13.900 --> 3:41:16.900]  and it's usually the optimal solution.
[3:41:16.900 --> 3:41:18.900]  And unlike us humans,
[3:41:18.900 --> 3:41:20.900]  the bees don't entrench.
[3:41:20.900 --> 3:41:22.900]  They don't fall into gridlock.
[3:41:22.900 --> 3:41:24.900]  They don't settle for a bad solution
[3:41:24.900 --> 3:41:26.900]  that nobody's happy with.
[3:41:26.900 --> 3:41:29.900]  They find the solution that's best for the group as a whole.
[3:41:29.900 --> 3:41:32.900]  I point this out because the phrase hive mind
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:34.900]  often gets a bad rap,
[3:41:34.900 --> 3:41:36.900]  implying a group of mindless drones
[3:41:36.900 --> 3:41:38.900]  who can't think for themselves.
[3:41:38.900 --> 3:41:41.900]  That's certainly how science fiction portrays it.
[3:41:41.900 --> 3:41:43.900]  But honestly, it's just not true.
[3:41:43.900 --> 3:41:46.900]  A hive mind is nature's way of aggregating
[3:41:46.900 --> 3:41:48.900]  the diverse perspectives of a population
[3:41:48.900 --> 3:41:51.900]  and maximizing their collective wisdom.
[3:41:51.900 --> 3:41:53.900]  And let's be honest,
[3:41:53.900 --> 3:41:56.900]  we humans are pretty smart as individuals,
[3:41:56.900 --> 3:41:59.900]  but in groups we're not always that wise.
[3:41:59.900 --> 3:42:02.900]  That's because groups don't do a great job
[3:42:02.900 --> 3:42:05.900]  of combining their diverse perspectives.
[3:42:05.900 --> 3:42:07.900]  We use votes and polls and surveys.
[3:42:07.900 --> 3:42:10.900]  The problem is polls are polarizing.
[3:42:10.900 --> 3:42:13.900]  They drive us to entrench,
[3:42:13.900 --> 3:42:15.900]  exposing and reinforcing our differences,
[3:42:15.900 --> 3:42:18.900]  but doing nothing to help us find common ground.
[3:42:18.900 --> 3:42:20.900]  A swarm is the opposite.
[3:42:20.900 --> 3:42:23.900]  It's flexible and dynamic, revealing where we agree most.
[3:42:23.900 --> 3:42:25.900]  In other words,
[3:42:25.900 --> 3:42:28.900]  swarming doesn't just make a species smarter.
[3:42:28.900 --> 3:42:31.900]  It makes a species worse.
[3:42:31.900 --> 3:42:33.900]  It's collectivism.
[3:42:33.900 --> 3:42:35.900]  It's you as an individual.
[3:42:35.900 --> 3:42:37.900]  We don't really like you as an individual
[3:42:37.900 --> 3:42:39.900]  with individual thoughts, your individual mind.
[3:42:39.900 --> 3:42:41.900]  We really love collectivism.
[3:42:41.900 --> 3:42:45.900]  Louis Rosenberg also was one of the creators of Metaverse.
[3:42:45.900 --> 3:42:47.900]  I'll talk about this more when I come back.
[3:42:47.900 --> 3:42:49.900]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host,
[3:42:49.900 --> 3:42:52.900]  and I really want to dive into why he studies bees.
[3:42:52.900 --> 3:42:54.900]  There's a reason for this.
[3:42:54.900 --> 3:42:58.900]  We have launched the most important sale of the year,
[3:42:58.900 --> 3:43:01.900]  because now we've got a bunch of great products
[3:43:01.900 --> 3:43:04.900]  that have been sold out for months and months and months back in stock.
[3:43:04.900 --> 3:43:09.900]  So, right now, the real Black Friday sale is beginning,
[3:43:09.900 --> 3:43:12.900]  and it's only going to run until the end of the month,
[3:43:12.900 --> 3:43:15.900]  and that's now only six, seven days.
[3:43:15.900 --> 3:43:20.900]  InfoWare Store official Black Friday special has arrived.
[3:43:20.900 --> 3:43:22.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, people love it.
[3:43:22.900 --> 3:43:23.900]  It's our best seller.
[3:43:23.900 --> 3:43:27.900]  Vitamin, mineral fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals,
[3:43:27.900 --> 3:43:30.900]  all the T-amino acids, everything you need for your immune system
[3:43:30.900 --> 3:43:32.900]  and your body, and it tastes great,
[3:43:32.900 --> 3:43:34.900]  and it funds the InfoWare.
[3:43:34.900 --> 3:43:39.900]  It is back in stock 40% off with free shipping and double-patria points,
[3:43:39.900 --> 3:43:42.900]  and so much more at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:43:42.900 --> 3:43:46.900]  It's only six, seven days left in the biggest sale of 2021.
[3:43:46.900 --> 3:43:48.900]  Bet on freedom, bet on InfoWare,
[3:43:48.900 --> 3:43:50.900]  bet on yourself, and get great products.
[3:43:50.900 --> 3:43:54.900]  The only way you fail is not taking action at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:43:54.900 --> 3:43:58.900]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad,
[3:43:58.900 --> 3:44:02.900]  then wait till they've got their world ID, and that's exactly what
[3:44:02.900 --> 3:44:05.900]  the COVID passports are all about.
[3:44:05.900 --> 3:44:09.900]  And CloudSwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders' own words,
[3:44:09.900 --> 3:44:13.900]  they admit that once they've gotten you with that system,
[3:44:13.900 --> 3:44:16.900]  then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere you go
[3:44:16.900 --> 3:44:20.900]  and track what you do, and publicly they're saying they're going to decide
[3:44:20.900 --> 3:44:23.900]  when you can travel and when you can't travel,
[3:44:23.900 --> 3:44:27.900]  and MasterCard and all the other big companies are currently announcing
[3:44:27.900 --> 3:44:29.900]  that they're going to track what you do and where you go
[3:44:29.900 --> 3:44:32.900]  and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[3:44:32.900 --> 3:44:35.900]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:44:35.900 --> 3:44:39.900]  This is the takeover, and humanity better wake up and say no.
[3:44:39.900 --> 3:44:41.900]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[3:44:41.900 --> 3:44:44.900]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others are leaving the charts along with InfoWareStore.
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:45.900]  But it's not enough.
[3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:48.900]  Every individual has to not comply,
[3:44:48.900 --> 3:44:50.900]  and we have to talk about bringing the globalists to justice.
[3:44:50.900 --> 3:44:54.900]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[3:44:54.900 --> 3:44:58.900]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:44:58.900 --> 3:44:59.900]  Welcome.
[3:44:59.900 --> 3:45:00.900]  Hello, Alex.
[3:45:00.900 --> 3:45:01.900]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:45:01.900 --> 3:45:03.900]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[3:45:03.900 --> 3:45:05.900]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[3:45:05.900 --> 3:45:09.900]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer.
[3:45:09.900 --> 3:45:12.900]  Supermell Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[3:45:12.900 --> 3:45:15.900]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[3:45:15.900 --> 3:45:17.900]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[3:45:17.900 --> 3:45:22.900]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up,
[3:45:22.900 --> 3:45:27.900]  so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:45:27.900 --> 3:45:28.900]  that just aren't as strong.
[3:45:28.900 --> 3:45:30.900]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:45:30.900 --> 3:45:32.900]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:45:32.900 --> 3:45:34.900]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:45:34.900 --> 3:45:38.900]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:45:38.900 --> 3:45:40.900]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[3:45:40.900 --> 3:45:42.900]  So it's always good.
[3:45:42.900 --> 3:45:44.900]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:45:44.900 --> 3:45:56.900]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:45:56.900 --> 3:45:58.900]  It's a great sponsor.
[3:45:58.900 --> 3:46:02.900]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality,
[3:46:02.900 --> 3:46:04.900]  high rated satellite phone.

[3:46:29.900 --> 3:46:30.900]  These aren't.
[3:46:30.900 --> 3:46:32.900]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:46:32.900 --> 3:46:36.900]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[3:46:36.900 --> 3:46:39.900]  So the calls you were free or it's like a regular cell phone.
[3:46:39.900 --> 3:46:40.900]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[3:46:40.900 --> 3:46:43.900]  And I keep on my car, I've given it to my parents as gifts
[3:46:43.900 --> 3:46:45.900]  way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work.
[3:46:45.900 --> 3:46:46.900]  They work.
[3:46:46.900 --> 3:47:12.900]  They work.
[3:47:12.900 --> 3:47:16.900]  Back with you, I'm Kay Dally, your guest host in this hour.
[3:47:16.900 --> 3:47:19.900]  And just, you know, after looking at my 10 years in radio,
[3:47:19.900 --> 3:47:21.900]  let me just tell you something that's happened.
[3:47:21.900 --> 3:47:25.900]  And that is the ability to analyze what these sick people do
[3:47:25.900 --> 3:47:28.900]  and where it's going to lead us.
[3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:32.900]  You know, we as Americans had a knack early on
[3:47:32.900 --> 3:47:35.900]  for understanding where government was going to go.
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:38.900]  This is why we had the revolution.
[3:47:38.900 --> 3:47:41.900]  We weren't so enslaved that we couldn't fight.
[3:47:41.900 --> 3:47:44.900]  At that point where we could recognize where government was headed
[3:47:44.900 --> 3:47:46.900]  and we knew that it looked very bad for us
[3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:50.900]  and we knew that they were only going in the way of more oppression.
[3:47:50.900 --> 3:47:54.900]  And so we fought a revolution to basically start this country.
[3:47:54.900 --> 3:47:57.900]  And that's important to realize because we as Americans are,
[3:47:57.900 --> 3:48:01.900]  usually, we give ourselves credit for being able to look ahead.
[3:48:01.900 --> 3:48:05.900]  Right now, if you look ahead, you're a little more demonized, aren't you?
[3:48:05.900 --> 3:48:08.900]  Because you're not following along with the line scumbags
[3:48:08.900 --> 3:48:11.900]  in the mainstream media narrative, right?
[3:48:11.900 --> 3:48:13.900]  The narrative controlled by the Pentagon.
[3:48:13.900 --> 3:48:17.900]  So the reason I brought up this hive mind, this swarm intelligence,
[3:48:17.900 --> 3:48:20.900]  Louis Rosenberg is at the head of AI.
[3:48:20.900 --> 3:48:24.900]  He's also, the company is an unanimous AI, okay?
[3:48:24.900 --> 3:48:27.900]  Unanimous, I'm sorry, unanimous AI.
[3:48:27.900 --> 3:48:32.900]  He's also a prolific inventor, technologist, yada yada yada scientist, okay?
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:35.900]  And also one of the creators of Metaverse.
[3:48:35.900 --> 3:48:38.900]  You've heard of Metaverse, right? The new Facebook.
[3:48:38.900 --> 3:48:41.900]  So he studies bees a lot.
[3:48:41.900 --> 3:48:44.900]  And the reason I tell you this is because this is important information
[3:48:44.900 --> 3:48:47.900]  when you're trying to analyze where somebody's headed
[3:48:47.900 --> 3:48:50.900]  and they don't want to give you all the pieces at once
[3:48:50.900 --> 3:48:53.900]  because it can seem a little, oh, I don't know, terrifying.
[3:48:53.900 --> 3:48:56.900]  What they do is they kind of leak it out piece by piece.
[3:48:56.900 --> 3:48:59.900]  They're really proud of their work. They're really proud of it.
[3:48:59.900 --> 3:49:04.900]  But at the same time, they also don't want to give you too much
[3:49:04.900 --> 3:49:06.900]  because too much can be therefore terrifying
[3:49:06.900 --> 3:49:08.900]  and then you wouldn't want to stop it.
[3:49:08.900 --> 3:49:10.900]  But they're very proud of what they do.
[3:49:10.900 --> 3:49:13.900]  As you study bees, really what you're studying,
[3:49:13.900 --> 3:49:18.900]  just as Russian scientists have also studied the vibrations of DNA.
[3:49:18.900 --> 3:49:21.900]  He was studying the vibrations for a reason.
[3:49:21.900 --> 3:49:24.900]  He was also saying, really, at the same time,
[3:49:24.900 --> 3:49:27.900]  look, you as an individual are not very important,
[3:49:27.900 --> 3:49:31.900]  but when I get you guys together, you collectively agree on things
[3:49:31.900 --> 3:49:34.900]  and you don't have an individual voice,
[3:49:34.900 --> 3:49:38.900]  then you come to the conclusions of the collective that we want you to come to.
[3:49:38.900 --> 3:49:45.900]  So you're going to come to a decision that is more of a sheep-like decision
[3:49:45.900 --> 3:49:48.900]  because you're amongst the crowd and this is what we want.
[3:49:48.900 --> 3:49:51.900]  We're going to say it's a much wiser decision,
[3:49:51.900 --> 3:49:54.900]  but really it's groupthink. It's groupthink on steroids.
[3:49:54.900 --> 3:49:57.900]  But how would they get us to do that and lose our individuality?
[3:49:57.900 --> 3:49:59.900]  How would they do it?
[3:49:59.900 --> 3:50:04.900]  And the shots, the drip system and the shots as it's destroying our immune system
[3:50:04.900 --> 3:50:08.900]  and as we beg and beg and beg, like Dr. David Martin says,
[3:50:08.900 --> 3:50:13.900]  for a solution which would be maybe AI-enhanced parts,
[3:50:13.900 --> 3:50:19.900]  AI-enhanced just everything inside the body, AI-enhanced.
[3:50:19.900 --> 3:50:24.900]  So I said to you that I was reading a 2012 article
[3:50:24.900 --> 3:50:26.900]  and this article was really interesting
[3:50:26.900 --> 3:50:30.900]  because this person actually was a beekeeper and studied bees himself.
[3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:34.900]  And he said there are some really interesting facts about bee frequencies.
[3:50:34.900 --> 3:50:39.900]  For example, high frequencies that the queen creates are also used,
[3:50:39.900 --> 3:50:41.900]  and he said this in 2012,
[3:50:41.900 --> 3:50:47.900]  are also used in genetic engineering to splice DNA together.
[3:50:47.900 --> 3:50:52.900]  We have many documents from inside the government from the NIH itself
[3:50:52.900 --> 3:50:56.900]  on bee frequencies, on vibrational frequencies,
[3:50:56.900 --> 3:51:00.900]  on how we interact with each other inside these frequencies.
[3:51:00.900 --> 3:51:02.900]  And what was Louis Rosenberg talking about?
[3:51:02.900 --> 3:51:06.900]  He was talking about how people would send signals to each other
[3:51:06.900 --> 3:51:12.900]  and those signals would result in a communication form.
[3:51:12.900 --> 3:51:16.900]  They didn't have to do much because they're little tiny brains,
[3:51:16.900 --> 3:51:21.900]  but when they would shake, right, they would shake a response to each other.
[3:51:21.900 --> 3:51:23.900]  He was really, really interested in that.
[3:51:23.900 --> 3:51:27.900]  He's also very interested in splicing DNA together.
[3:51:27.900 --> 3:51:29.900]  He's given talks about DNA.
[3:51:29.900 --> 3:51:30.900]  Very interested.
[3:51:30.900 --> 3:51:32.900]  A little too interested if you talk to me.
[3:51:32.900 --> 3:51:35.900]  So in the bee colony, there's three types of bees.
[3:51:35.900 --> 3:51:38.900]  A drone, a worker, and a queen bee.
[3:51:38.900 --> 3:51:40.900]  And each have their own individual frequencies.
[3:51:40.900 --> 3:51:42.900]  A lot of people don't realize this.
[3:51:42.900 --> 3:51:46.900]  So each one works on its own frequency to communicate.
[3:51:46.900 --> 3:51:49.900]  For some reason, Louis is just really into this.
[3:51:49.900 --> 3:51:55.900]  And electronic bees are carefully guided over a hive synthesizer interface, right?
[3:51:55.900 --> 3:51:56.900]  They've actually done this.
[3:51:56.900 --> 3:51:59.900]  And they've actually been able to bring the bees places,
[3:51:59.900 --> 3:52:03.900]  bees really kind of infiltrated, if you will.
[3:52:03.900 --> 3:52:05.900]  Why am I talking so much about bees?
[3:52:05.900 --> 3:52:08.900]  Because they study bees to study human behavior.
[3:52:08.900 --> 3:52:10.900]  And when they're studying human behavior,
[3:52:10.900 --> 3:52:14.900]  they're very, very interested in, say, I don't know,
[3:52:14.900 --> 3:52:16.900]  infiltrating our behavior.
[3:52:16.900 --> 3:52:18.900]  See, data is king, right?
[3:52:18.900 --> 3:52:22.900]  And if data is king, why are they so interested in data?
[3:52:22.900 --> 3:52:24.900]  Why do they want data so badly?
[3:52:24.900 --> 3:52:27.900]  In fact, there was just a 60 minutes interview about this,
[3:52:27.900 --> 3:52:29.900]  where they were interviewing the scientist and he said,
[3:52:29.900 --> 3:52:31.900]  he said, that's why they were buying WhatsApp
[3:52:31.900 --> 3:52:35.900]  and all of these interfaces that had all of our information,
[3:52:35.900 --> 3:52:36.900]  because data is king.
[3:52:36.900 --> 3:52:38.900]  So what do they do with this data?
[3:52:38.900 --> 3:52:40.900]  What do they do with frequencies?
[3:52:40.900 --> 3:52:42.900]  What's in the shots?
[3:52:42.900 --> 3:52:45.900]  Well, if what's in the shot is graphene oxide,
[3:52:45.900 --> 3:52:49.900]  there's a very interesting component to what I've just been talking about with bees.
[3:52:49.900 --> 3:52:53.900]  Graphene oxide inside the body causes thrombi.
[3:52:53.900 --> 3:52:57.900]  And a graphene oxide causes blood clotting, we know this.
[3:52:57.900 --> 3:53:01.900]  It also causes the body post-inflammatory systems
[3:53:01.900 --> 3:53:05.900]  and organ, multi-organ inflammation and all of these things.
[3:53:05.900 --> 3:53:08.900]  It also might have the ability, then,
[3:53:08.900 --> 3:53:14.900]  to also be able to have something to do with the vibrations going on.
[3:53:14.900 --> 3:53:18.900]  There's a reason that, between us as people,
[3:53:18.900 --> 3:53:20.900]  so electronic vibrations.
[3:53:20.900 --> 3:53:25.900]  So there's a reason that graphene oxide then would be in that shot,
[3:53:25.900 --> 3:53:27.900]  if it's in the shot.
[3:53:27.900 --> 3:53:32.900]  Graphene oxide also can be eliminated by levels of glutathione in the body,
[3:53:32.900 --> 3:53:35.900]  and you need to know that because you need to be able to get rid of it.
[3:53:35.900 --> 3:53:39.900]  So as we get older and as we age over the age of 65,
[3:53:39.900 --> 3:53:42.900]  then the glutathione becomes almost immeasurable
[3:53:42.900 --> 3:53:44.900]  because it's so low.
[3:53:44.900 --> 3:53:46.900]  And so you increase those levels,
[3:53:46.900 --> 3:53:50.900]  you might be able to get rid of the graphene oxide in your system.
[3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:52.900]  Also, with low levels of vitamin D,
[3:53:52.900 --> 3:53:57.900]  it also enhances graphene oxide to stay put.
[3:53:57.900 --> 3:53:59.900]  So you've got up those levels of D
[3:53:59.900 --> 3:54:02.900]  and up those levels of glutathione as well.
[3:54:02.900 --> 3:54:05.900]  The reason I'm saying this is because when they were studying this,
[3:54:05.900 --> 3:54:09.900]  they were studying electronic absorption bands.
[3:54:09.900 --> 3:54:14.900]  They were talking about the electromagnetic phenomenon
[3:54:14.900 --> 3:54:20.900]  that they realized that graphene oxide has what it's called an electronic absorption band.
[3:54:20.900 --> 3:54:29.900]  And this magnetic resonance is precisely the third bandwidth of the 5G technology.
[3:54:29.900 --> 3:54:33.900]  Why do they have to have 5G technology go up at the same time,
[3:54:33.900 --> 3:54:37.900]  that they're studying bees, that they're studying how the hive mind works,
[3:54:37.900 --> 3:54:44.900]  that they want to oust you individually and maybe have the little worker bee be of service to them?
[3:54:44.900 --> 3:54:49.900]  Because they only look at a portion of our population as truly being a producer.
[3:54:49.900 --> 3:54:53.900]  The rest of the population, oh, a bunch of bottom feeders, they can hit it.
[3:54:53.900 --> 3:54:57.900]  But as far as the population that they want to succeed,
[3:54:57.900 --> 3:55:01.900]  they want to have a lot of worker bees to tell you the truth.
[3:55:01.900 --> 3:55:06.900]  And graphene oxide correlates with that electronic absorption band
[3:55:06.900 --> 3:55:12.900]  and that magnetic resonance, again, is precisely the third bandwidth of 5G technology,
[3:55:12.900 --> 3:55:15.900]  the one that's being tendered right now.
[3:55:15.900 --> 3:55:21.900]  And where did we first see COVID arrive on a cruise ship that installed 5G?
[3:55:21.900 --> 3:55:26.900]  Isn't that interesting? And all of the people got sick. Why did that happen?
[3:55:26.900 --> 3:55:32.900]  So we have a lot of different nets within 5G and we'll have to continue that conversation at some point
[3:55:32.900 --> 3:55:38.900]  because 5G, maybe next week, 5G is so important to this and how it all plays out.
[3:55:38.900 --> 3:55:43.900]  5G would then hold the amount of data in this country on people.
[3:55:43.900 --> 3:55:47.900]  They are studyers of human behavior.
[3:55:47.900 --> 3:55:50.900]  They want to be able to control human behavior.
[3:55:50.900 --> 3:55:53.900]  Why? There's a big pile of money at the end of this.
[3:55:53.900 --> 3:55:55.900]  A big amount of profit.
[3:55:55.900 --> 3:56:00.900]  And a big amount of profit if we're not competing for resources, but we're just worker bees.
[3:56:00.900 --> 3:56:05.900]  Mindless little worker bees that give everything to the queen bee.
[3:56:05.900 --> 3:56:08.900]  Who do you think the queen bee is in this analogy?
[3:56:08.900 --> 3:56:12.900]  Why do you think Louis Rosenberg went out to talk about the hive mind so much?
[3:56:12.900 --> 3:56:15.900]  He's given many talks about it. You ought to check out the transcripts.
[3:56:15.900 --> 3:56:20.900]  They're kind of terrifying because he looks at people the way he looks at bees.
[3:56:20.900 --> 3:56:25.900]  We are just conveyors of information to further what the queen bee wants.
[3:56:25.900 --> 3:56:32.900]  That's our role. That's our only role and keep that in mind because they want a lot of people at their behest.
[3:56:32.900 --> 3:56:37.900]  The drip system is there to ruin our immune system. We're grasping that, right?
[3:56:37.900 --> 3:56:40.900]  It's a drip system. It's coming every three months.
[3:56:40.900 --> 3:56:45.900]  Hospital administrators have been admitting in emails that every three months there'll be a new booster
[3:56:45.900 --> 3:56:49.900]  and a new Delta, new Lambda fraternity for morons.
[3:56:49.900 --> 3:56:51.900]  We're just going to keep it going.
[3:56:51.900 --> 3:56:56.900]  Everyone went as far as to do this one, which we call moronic because it is moronic.
[3:56:56.900 --> 3:57:02.900]  There's a reason for the madness, right? There's a reason for a system.
[3:57:02.900 --> 3:57:05.900]  And this system can only hurt us if we don't stand up.
[3:57:05.900 --> 3:57:10.900]  We still live in a free country where we can stand, where we do have media like this.
