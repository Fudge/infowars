[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.760]  Alex is still in London, as a matter of fact he was on the BBC this morning and we're going
[00:32.760 --> 00:36.220]  to be having clips from that footage out in the green room.
[00:36.220 --> 00:40.860]  He actually confronted the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Ed Balls on why he was in
[00:40.860 --> 00:44.460]  attendance at Bilderberg and so did Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:44.460 --> 00:48.480]  So we're going to have some clips of that as well as clips of the interview.
[00:48.480 --> 00:50.900]  And we've got a lot of breaking news today.
[00:50.900 --> 00:56.240]  If you remember it was the Guardian that first broke out the news about spying by the American
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.660]  government on the American people with Verizon and then subsequent to that we have seen information
[01:01.660 --> 01:06.860]  about how they are tapping everybody's data online on the cloud from various companies
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.640]  from Microsoft, from Google, from Facebook, you name it, they have access to it.
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.960]  And we saw the secret document that was leaked internally from the NSA showing when various
[01:17.960 --> 01:23.420]  companies had come online with the PRISM program and now today we've got some new breaking
[01:23.420 --> 01:28.380]  news from the Guardian again, the whistleblower who released that first bit of information
[01:28.380 --> 01:35.720]  about the illegal phone activity by the NSA spying on Americans under the Foreign Intelligence
[01:35.720 --> 01:37.300]  Security Act.
[01:37.300 --> 01:43.320]  They were spying on Americans which James Clapper, Director of NSA, lied to the Senate
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.440]  just as recently as March telling them no such thing was happening.
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.560]  Well we have a whistleblower who has now come out and is talking about why he did it and
[01:53.560 --> 01:56.800]  the implications for what the government is doing to people.
[01:56.800 --> 02:00.520]  An amazing interview and we're going to be talking about excerpts from that.
[02:00.520 --> 02:04.080]  But first I've got to say we're going to be playing the entire interview that Alex had
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.960]  with the BBC.
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.880]  It was pretty amazing to see how the BBC has handled itself.
[02:09.880 --> 02:13.960]  Now the irony is we've talked about before is that they would have one of the largest
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.680]  influence peddling scandals ever to affect the UK.
[02:17.680 --> 02:24.000]  They've had at least four members of parliament who have resigned just recently.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.140]  Now of course those were also from journalist stings.
[02:27.140 --> 02:31.800]  These were journalists who went in and just like we see happen here sometimes with Veritas
[02:31.800 --> 02:38.480]  project, they went in and offered illegal influence, pay off for illegal influence to
[02:38.480 --> 02:43.920]  these members of parliament and got them on tape accepting it and these guys have subsequently
[02:43.920 --> 02:47.640]  resigned but of course that wasn't the BBC that was involved in that.
[02:47.640 --> 02:49.280]  No, the BBC had nothing to do with that.
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.320]  That was another journalistic outpost.
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.160]  The BBC on the other hand is basically the lap dog of these guys.
[02:57.160 --> 03:04.120]  For 60 years they never covered Bilderberg even though BBC had leaked information that
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.600]  showed that in 1955 they were planning the Euro, the EU and many other things.
[03:08.600 --> 03:13.540]  BBC likes to pretend that not only did that not happen but Bilderberg itself did not exist.
[03:13.540 --> 03:16.040]  This year they could not ignore it.
[03:16.040 --> 03:21.160]  They looked foolish but you know the stages of progression that Mahatma Gandhi gave us
[03:21.160 --> 03:24.560]  he said first they ignore you then they ridicule you and that's the stage that we are right
[03:24.560 --> 03:25.560]  now.
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.000]  After the beginning this introduction when they had Alex there, the presenter had this
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.240]  little set piece that was amazingly smarmy, amazingly condescending and then they talk
[03:37.240 --> 03:41.640]  about what's going on there and try to backpedal and pretend that nothing of any interest is
[03:41.640 --> 03:43.520]  going on there.
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.840]  Isn't it amazing that the BBC did the same thing with the Jimmy Saville scandal?
[03:48.840 --> 03:54.360]  Here you've got a pedophile right amongst their midst for decades operating, hundreds
[03:54.360 --> 04:00.280]  of children, victims of this pedophile, this procurer of children for the elite.
[04:00.280 --> 04:05.780]  And the BBC not only did nothing about it but once one person in the BBC broke the story
[04:05.780 --> 04:07.440]  the BBC covered it up.
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.800]  It was a major scandal at the BBC that they covered up that scandal and they still haven't
[04:12.800 --> 04:17.960]  done much to report on that but we have a history of the BBC covering up not only what
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.680]  is happening with the abuse of Bilderberg of people all over the world but even amongst
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.520]  their midst the abuse of children.
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.400]  These are, I guess you could describe BBC journalism as see no evil, hear no evil, speak
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.400]  no evil.
[04:31.400 --> 04:35.440]  No matter how bad it is they have nothing to say about it so we're going to be talking
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.440]  about that.
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.640]  We're going to be talking about this leak of information from this whistleblower and
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.360]  what he has to say about why he did it and what our government is doing to us.
[04:46.360 --> 04:59.440]  Stay tuned we're going to have Alex join us at the bottom of the hour.
[04:59.440 --> 05:05.000]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms but if you don't have a home security system

[06:11.160 --> 06:12.640]  new world order.
[06:12.640 --> 06:19.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[06:19.000 --> 06:32.080]  I lost audio guys.
[06:32.080 --> 06:35.480]  Ladies and gentlemen this is Alex Jones.
[06:35.480 --> 06:51.800]  We are live on this Sunday.
[06:51.800 --> 06:53.800]  His audio is cutting in and out on us.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.040]  We're going to be right back with him.
[06:55.040 --> 06:57.400]  We're going to reestablish some contact.
[06:57.400 --> 06:59.000]  It's Sunday June 9th.
[06:59.000 --> 07:00.640]  Alex is in London covering Bilderberg.
[07:00.640 --> 07:03.160]  I'm David Knight here back at the home studio.
[07:03.160 --> 07:05.320]  A lot of information breaking today.
[07:05.320 --> 07:07.840]  We've got Alex storming the BBC.
[07:07.840 --> 07:11.240]  We've got Bill Mauer and liberals defending the NSA surveillance grid.
[07:11.240 --> 07:17.380]  You know when I look at Bill Mauer doing this I think about the fact that what a rabid atheist
[07:17.380 --> 07:21.880]  he is and whenever you deny the real God you're going to make men into gods and basically
[07:21.880 --> 07:22.880]  that's what he does.
[07:22.880 --> 07:27.800]  He's got his security surveillance state that he's making into a god there.
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.480]  We've got another phony jobs report from the government that lies about everything and
[07:31.480 --> 07:35.800]  that's an article up on Infowars from Paul Craig Roberts.
[07:35.800 --> 07:39.200]  He was the former Reagan assistant secretary of the Treasury.
[07:39.200 --> 07:40.440]  He knows what he's talking about.
[07:40.440 --> 07:47.200]  As a matter of fact there's a great book by author Vox day and he talks about exactly
[07:47.200 --> 07:51.360]  the mechanism of how they lie over and over again releasing one set of economic statistics
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.000]  and then revising them the next quarter into something that's a little bit closer to reality
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  but how they play games with the way they define jobs and the way they define the loss
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.040]  or gain of jobs.
[08:03.040 --> 08:09.400]  We also have an article up on Infowars talking about the NSA's boundless informant.
[08:09.400 --> 08:14.720]  That's the name of the program that the government gave it was boundless informant and that basically
[08:14.720 --> 08:16.680]  pretty much describes what it was.
[08:16.680 --> 08:20.000]  It's informing on the American people and it truly is boundless.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.460]  They collect three billion, three billion intelligence pieces from the networks in just
[08:25.460 --> 08:26.960]  one month.
[08:26.960 --> 08:31.360]  Using the math on that, that works out to a hundred million per day, a hundred million
[08:31.360 --> 08:38.240]  per day and as this article that's up on Infowars, it's originally from ZeroHedge.com, as I said
[08:38.240 --> 08:42.520]  this whole China is hacking us script may promptly fall apart.
[08:42.520 --> 08:43.960]  That's right folks.
[08:43.960 --> 08:48.640]  It's pretty ridiculous that they're trying to use, they're trying to scare people about
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.220]  cyber terrorism from other countries when we find out that the biggest cyber terrorist
[08:54.220 --> 08:59.600]  of them all is the United States government and has been for quite some time.
[08:59.600 --> 09:03.400]  We've been telling you about that, of course the BBC didn't cover that, the American news
[09:03.400 --> 09:07.060]  media didn't cover that, but we've had whistleblowers who have talked about that.
[09:07.060 --> 09:10.480]  We've had documents that have been exposed talking about that, even though the mainstream
[09:10.480 --> 09:11.800]  media hasn't covered it.
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.820]  It is a reality, it is not a conspiracy theory and hopefully now that people can see some
[09:17.820 --> 09:24.120]  of these documents and see the amazing reaction of the government to this, it is absolutely
[09:24.120 --> 09:25.280]  truly amazing.
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.800]  Let me just read one more excerpt from this Zero Hedge Fund about boundless informant.
[09:29.800 --> 09:38.920]  He says that James Clapper, that's the head of the NSA, announced earlier today that citizens
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.040]  falling under the NSA's espionage mandate of section 702 cannot be used to intentionally
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.600]  target any US citizen or any other US person or to intentionally target any person known
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.920]  to be in the United States.
[09:51.920 --> 09:58.120]  Well that's the law, that's the law that they passed, FISA, which in and of itself flew
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.080]  directly into the face of the Constitution and denied constitutional protections.
[10:04.080 --> 10:10.640]  But even that unconstitutional assertion of power, they have broken.
[10:10.640 --> 10:17.040]  They will not even stay in line with their overreaching Patriot Act and FISA.
[10:17.040 --> 10:19.800]  And look at the reaction, look at the reaction of these people.
[10:19.800 --> 10:23.720]  They say that they're gonna come after whoever did this.
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.120]  They're not repentant, they're not sorry about what they did, they're just sorry that they
[10:29.120 --> 10:31.320]  got caught like a real thief.
[10:31.320 --> 10:34.280]  Alex what do you have to say about this?
[10:34.280 --> 10:38.040]  Well I got stuck out here in the field reporting so I'm not back to our studio with good audio
[10:38.040 --> 10:42.400]  so I'm driving down the road right now via Skype but as soon as I get back to our home
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.040]  base and I come back to Austin tomorrow, I'm here in London, England, I will call them
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.280]  with a ton of inside breaking news.
[10:50.280 --> 10:57.160]  But absolutely it's a felony to have all the phone records of every Verizon customer handed
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.200]  over to the White House so they can target and harass libertarians, conservatives, others,
[11:01.200 --> 11:08.760]  go after pro-life groups, spy on charter.
[11:08.760 --> 11:09.760]  This is authoritarianism.
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.240]  Yeah, oh absolutely, absolutely, I think you're breaking up a little bit.
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.120]  Can you, Alex are you there?
[11:21.120 --> 11:22.120]  We lost him again.
[11:22.120 --> 11:25.680]  I am David, I'll just- Okay, we got you.
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.680]  I think we got you.
[11:26.680 --> 11:28.800]  No, I think we've lost you, okay.
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.560]  I was just gonna go over the, as Alex pointed out, this is a huge felony.
[11:33.560 --> 11:40.280]  Just remember that it was a handful of journalists, a handful of journalists that Nixon and Kissinger,
[11:40.280 --> 11:46.020]  who was pulling the strings on that, just a handful of journalists that they were accused
[11:46.020 --> 11:47.240]  of in Watergate.
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.000]  And that caused the resignation of a president because he was going to be impeached for that
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.120]  as well as other crimes.
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.620]  And we know that just spying on citizens isn't the only thing that Obama has done.
[11:56.620 --> 11:59.220]  But let's look at what this administration has done.
[11:59.220 --> 12:05.140]  Not only have we repeatedly seen members of the Obama administration lie under oath, lying
[12:05.140 --> 12:10.780]  about the tapping of citizens' phones, lying about the way they're using the IRS, lying
[12:10.780 --> 12:14.540]  about Fast and Furious, under oath repeatedly.
[12:14.540 --> 12:18.840]  But we also see them now openly asserting that they didn't do anything wrong, that they
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.800]  have the power to listen to all of our phone conversations.
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.380]  As a result, we've put up a new petition, InfoWars has.
[12:27.380 --> 12:31.600]  You might check this out on the whitehouse.com.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.040]  This is the wording of the petition.
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.800]  President Richard Nixon resigned after wiretapping a handful of journalists, sparing the nation
[12:37.800 --> 12:39.680]  the ordeal of impeachment.
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.480]  We call on Obama to do the same.
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.580]  His administration vetted the NSA's surveillance of millions of Americans and seriously violated
[12:46.580 --> 12:48.260]  the Fourth Amendment.
[12:48.260 --> 12:51.900]  He confiscated personal records of reporters, thus violating the First Amendment.
[12:51.900 --> 12:56.820]  And the IRS, under his watch, harassed political organizations opposed to his policies.
[12:56.820 --> 13:00.580]  Moreover, his administration has lied under oath to Congress.
[13:00.580 --> 13:04.660]  And in addition to violating Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution by invading Libya, his
[13:04.660 --> 13:09.540]  administration engaged in torture and conducted a covert drone war.
[13:09.540 --> 13:16.660]  Due to the severity of these crimes, we call for the immediate resignation of Barack Obama.
[13:16.660 --> 13:21.780]  That's a petition that InfoWars put up on, actually, I think it was Kurt Nemo put that
[13:21.780 --> 13:24.940]  up under his name on the White House.
[13:24.940 --> 13:28.400]  Feel free to go to the White House and sign that petition.
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.960]  I think we're at a juncture right now where if we don't stand up and do something about
[13:32.960 --> 13:37.000]  this criminal regime, it's going to be interpreted as acceptance.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.640]  We're going to make this the new normal.
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.340]  We already have Obama and James Clapper, the NSA chief, saying that the government is going
[13:45.340 --> 13:48.100]  to open a criminal probe into the NSA leaks.
[13:48.100 --> 13:51.820]  But of course, they got beat to it because the person who actually leaked this has now
[13:51.820 --> 13:54.020]  gone public in The Guardian.
[13:54.020 --> 13:58.620]  He's in Hong Kong and he talks about why he did it.
[13:58.620 --> 14:04.780]  Now, this is what they asked him, they said, why did you decide to become a whistleblower?
[14:04.780 --> 14:09.540]  The person's name is Edward Snowden, and he said, the NSA has built an infrastructure
[14:09.540 --> 14:12.700]  that allows it to intercept almost everything.
[14:12.700 --> 14:17.420]  With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested
[14:17.420 --> 14:18.920]  without targeting.
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.220]  If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts.
[14:22.220 --> 14:26.820]  I can get your emails, your passwords, your phone records, your credit cards.
[14:26.820 --> 14:28.860]  Now this is what he says, which is really key.
[14:28.860 --> 14:33.860]  I don't want to live in a society, and neither do I, that does these sorts of things.
[14:33.860 --> 14:37.940]  I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.
[14:37.940 --> 14:41.600]  That is not something I am willing to support or to live under.
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.780]  And then they play devil's advocate and they say, but isn't there a need for surveillance
[14:44.780 --> 14:48.260]  to try to reduce the chances of terrorist attacks like Boston?
[14:48.260 --> 14:52.900]  He said, we have to decide why terrorism is now a new threat.
[14:52.900 --> 14:55.420]  See, it is not a new threat.
[14:55.420 --> 14:58.380]  It is just police work that needs to be done.
[14:58.380 --> 15:03.000]  It's not an excuse for them to go in and start tapping everybody's phones and listening to
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.620]  everybody's conversation and recording everything and storing it, the Utah data center, so that
[15:08.620 --> 15:13.400]  they can in the future, when their software is better, go back and data mine that and
[15:13.400 --> 15:16.700]  use that to threaten to blackmail, to jail people.
[15:16.700 --> 15:20.620]  We already have more people jailed in the United States than any other country in terms
[15:20.620 --> 15:22.940]  of absolute numbers more than China.
[15:22.940 --> 15:27.940]  And China has a population that is many times the size of our population and a very authoritarian
[15:27.940 --> 15:28.940]  government.
[15:28.940 --> 15:31.540]  What does it say about our government that we have that sort of thing?
[15:31.540 --> 15:33.060]  We're going to be right back.
[15:33.060 --> 15:36.560]  We're going to get Alex Jones on the show joining us here from London.
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.020]  We've got a little bit of transmission problems, but he will be joining us shortly.
[15:40.020 --> 15:41.020]  I'm David Knight.
[15:41.020 --> 16:00.020]  Stay tuned.

[17:04.220 --> 17:05.220]  Tyranny is here.
[17:05.220 --> 17:08.820]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[17:08.820 --> 17:11.500]  It really says that the state is God.
[17:11.500 --> 17:16.060]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.280]  on earth.
[17:17.280 --> 17:22.100]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[17:22.100 --> 17:23.940]  expanded nationwide.
[17:23.940 --> 17:28.100]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all
[17:28.100 --> 17:30.060]  powerful shadow state.
[17:30.060 --> 17:34.060]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[17:40.220 --> 17:44.300]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[17:44.300 --> 17:47.820]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[17:47.820 --> 17:49.840]  The police state isn't coming.
[17:49.840 --> 17:50.840]  It's here.

[17:57.580 --> 18:03.180]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of e Foods Direct.
[18:03.180 --> 18:08.120]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble right smack dab
[18:08.120 --> 18:10.540]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[18:10.540 --> 18:15.180]  I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those
[18:15.180 --> 18:18.020]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.
[18:18.020 --> 18:20.180]  We can't stand idly by.
[18:20.180 --> 18:24.100]  Emergency is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[18:24.100 --> 18:28.300]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this
[18:28.300 --> 18:29.900]  desperate time of need.
[18:29.900 --> 18:35.300]  We've built a seven day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[18:35.300 --> 18:39.340]  a whole week for one adult valued at $60.
[18:39.340 --> 18:44.260]  Your $25 will ship this life saving supply directly to those in need.
[18:44.260 --> 18:54.660]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[18:54.660 --> 18:57.660]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost.
[18:57.660 --> 19:00.180]  Thank you.
[19:00.180 --> 19:04.380]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[19:04.380 --> 19:09.000]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.420]  silver based products.
[19:11.420 --> 19:17.260]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 oz. nano silver solutions.
[19:17.260 --> 19:23.500]  Our 2 oz. nano silver nasal applicators as well as our all natural silver soaps.
[19:23.500 --> 19:27.620]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[19:27.620 --> 19:32.260]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and
[19:32.260 --> 19:34.020]  leave the silver at the surface.
[19:34.020 --> 19:39.460]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[19:39.460 --> 19:40.460]  of aloe vera.
[19:40.460 --> 19:46.660]  To quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[19:53.500 --> 19:55.620]  are best for you.

[20:00.940 --> 20:11.500]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:11.500 --> 20:21.140]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:21.140 --> 20:36.380]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight filling in for Alex here in Austin
[20:36.380 --> 20:40.740]  and we have Alex on the road in London.
[20:40.740 --> 20:45.060]  He's there covering Bilderberg and he's had some interesting encounters earlier today
[20:45.060 --> 20:46.060]  at the BBC.
[20:46.060 --> 20:49.140]  Alex, are you there?
[20:49.140 --> 20:56.540]  Absolutely, David, again, once I get back into a better zone, back into my hotel, I
[20:56.540 --> 21:02.260]  should be with you in the second hour tonight, sorry about the technical problems, the wonders
[21:02.260 --> 21:07.540]  of audio Skype don't seem to work too well over here in London some of the time but am
[21:07.540 --> 21:08.900]  I coming through to you?
[21:08.900 --> 21:10.660]  Yeah, loud and clear all day.
[21:10.660 --> 21:13.500]  Okay, let me just lay out what's coming up tonight.
[21:13.500 --> 21:19.940]  Look, they've now broken in the news, it's in the British press, right now this just
[21:19.940 --> 21:26.340]  broke that the new NSA information with Verizon handing over millions of customers data on
[21:26.340 --> 21:32.140]  conservatives, libertarians, everybody and so they can harass the spy on us.
[21:32.140 --> 21:37.380]  The whistleblower was an NSA mid-level person and they've had to go to political asylum
[21:37.380 --> 21:44.620]  in Hong Kong and his name is now public and he went on to say that it's sad that America
[21:44.620 --> 21:48.900]  is thought of as free but I have to go to a country that's not known as being very free
[21:48.900 --> 21:51.380]  to even be able to get this free speech.
[21:51.380 --> 21:57.180]  It is illegal when the NSA randomly listens and grabs data but listen, none of this is
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.620]  a secret.
[21:58.620 --> 22:07.860]  Austinites remember me in 1996 on the air when it was in MIT magazine when it was in
[22:07.860 --> 22:14.460]  the congressional record when all the tech publications were reporting $9 billion of
[22:14.460 --> 22:27.620]  taxpayer money to upgrade the NSA snooping systems that are built into all the telecommunications
[22:27.620 --> 22:28.620]  hubs.
[22:28.620 --> 22:33.260]  This is an absolute fact, all of our listeners have heard me break down the telecommunications
[22:33.260 --> 22:36.340]  act of 96, anyone can go read it.
[22:36.340 --> 22:41.220]  It's said that by 2001 all cell phones had to have tracker systems hardwired into them
[22:41.220 --> 22:45.300]  to track everywhere you are and turn your phone on and listen to it even when it's off
[22:45.300 --> 22:46.820]  so you can't know.
[22:46.820 --> 22:54.440]  I went on and on and on, we broke every bit of this down and just like the IRS is persecuting
[22:54.440 --> 23:00.500]  pro-lifers and gun rights organizations and libertarian and conservative groups and veterans
[23:00.500 --> 23:07.740]  groups and Jewish groups, they are using all of this not to catch us in doing bad things
[23:07.740 --> 23:10.700]  but to know what we're doing.
[23:10.700 --> 23:18.720]  Google was set up by the NSA 14 years ago on record with CIA funding from NQTEL.
[23:18.720 --> 23:20.180]  That's what's so frustrating.
[23:20.180 --> 23:25.160]  This is all public and they just tell you no one's listening to you.
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.860]  That's a crazy man, Alex Jones and there's no secret death camps and there's no FEMA
[23:29.860 --> 23:34.940]  camps and there's no torture and fluoride is good for you and the vaccines are good
[23:34.940 --> 23:37.860]  for you and it's all on record, it's killing us.
[23:37.860 --> 23:42.980]  Harvard studies the fluoride is killing us, mainline studies the vaccines are killing
[23:42.980 --> 23:43.980]  us.
[23:43.980 --> 23:47.120]  Thousands of studies on fluoride alone, hundreds on GMO.
[23:47.120 --> 23:52.000]  This is a program and it's just like they would say Bilderberg doesn't exist, Bilderberg
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.240]  doesn't exist, Bilderberg doesn't exist, over and over and over again.
[23:58.240 --> 24:01.360]  There are no secret groups, there's no lobbying groups.
[24:01.360 --> 24:05.800]  Also some royalty and robber barons and the Rockefellers are meeting with government heads
[24:05.800 --> 24:07.040]  in secret.
[24:07.040 --> 24:08.040]  It doesn't exist.
[24:08.040 --> 24:10.180]  Okay, it exists but don't worry about it.
[24:10.180 --> 24:12.420]  So what if it violates British law?
[24:12.420 --> 24:15.200]  So what if it violates federal law, the Logan Act?
[24:15.200 --> 24:21.520]  We have all those laws by the way listed on infoawards.com in a red linked article and
[24:21.520 --> 24:27.600]  today I went and was on the biggest Sunday news show in the United Kingdom, in Ireland,
[24:27.600 --> 24:30.480]  Scotland and England.
[24:30.480 --> 24:37.240]  I was on the biggest show, the Sunday politics show and I went in there and they wouldn't
[24:37.240 --> 24:38.860]  let me get the information out.
[24:38.860 --> 24:44.120]  They made jokes about Bilderberg, they made jokes right before I came on about he claims
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.260]  they're putting poison in the water and had a Bilderberg group member, one of the top
[24:48.260 --> 24:51.320]  ministers in the government, laugh at everybody.
[24:51.320 --> 24:55.120]  And so I came out and gave it to them with both barrels and we're gonna play that coming
[24:55.120 --> 24:57.920]  up in the next segment.
[24:57.920 --> 25:03.560]  We'll come in, it'll basically fill the whole segment, David Knight can introduce it briefly
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.980]  and then we'll come back after that segment and play some of the excerpts of my speech
[25:07.980 --> 25:16.900]  yesterday to 2,000 people on a grassy knoll right across from the Grove Estates and Hotel
[25:16.900 --> 25:21.320]  where 150 world leaders, including the head of Google, the Prime Minister of England,
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.080]  the Queen of the Netherlands, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Bill Gates, all of them
[25:26.080 --> 25:27.280]  were meeting.
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.560]  And let me tell you what happened after I gave this 45 minute speech and they had to
[25:31.560 --> 25:34.600]  turn away 1,000 people cuz they couldn't even fit.
[25:34.600 --> 25:40.440]  When I gave this speech, the police came over, the head police, the deputy police chief,
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.700]  and said, I wanna hug, you're right and hug me and the police lined up and were demanding
[25:45.700 --> 25:49.840]  to hug me and had tears on their eyes and said, we know it's basically true.
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.520]  I mean, that is the level of awakening that we are seeing happening because they've lied
[25:55.520 --> 25:59.560]  about all this corruption, they've lied about all this tyranny, they've lied about all this
[25:59.560 --> 26:01.080]  fraud for so long.
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.880]  They've got in everybody's face for so long, saying none of this exists, that now it's
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.880]  being admitted that it exists, the tyranny, the spying, the torture, the government funding
[26:09.880 --> 26:15.260]  Al-Qaeda, running all these tyrannical groups, being totally ruthless.
[26:15.260 --> 26:19.360]  Of course they are, we gave them all this incredible power.
[26:19.360 --> 26:27.800]  We gave them all of this free reign and of course they took advantage of it.
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.200]  That's why we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution, because our forebears have gone through this,
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.440]  all our ancestors, no matter where you come from in the world, Asia, Africa, Latin America,
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.680]  Europe, it doesn't matter.
[26:39.680 --> 26:41.140]  Everybody goes through this.
[26:41.140 --> 26:43.120]  That's why we keep tyrants in check.
[26:43.120 --> 26:45.640]  That's why we are jealous of our freedom.
[26:45.640 --> 26:52.120]  That's why it's important that people be aware and be involved and understand what's happening.
[26:52.120 --> 26:54.600]  And so many historical things are happening.
[26:54.600 --> 27:00.080]  When I go into the green room, about to go on the biggest show, it's like Meet the Press.
[27:00.080 --> 27:03.880]  Here in the UK, in fact, it's basically their Meet the Press show.
[27:03.880 --> 27:09.520]  Meet the Press is modeled after it, and they have the prime minister on it last week, and
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.960]  this week they had the head of the exchequer on, and that's their treasury.
[27:13.960 --> 27:18.000]  And the head of the treasury, because they have a parliament, so they have two heads
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.880]  of it, so the out of power party is the Labour.
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.840]  The shadow exchequer of their treasury is in there right before me, and I'm in studio
[27:26.840 --> 27:32.440]  with him, and when they go to break to play a promo that I'm coming up, I walk over and
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.920]  confront him, and I go, you're a Bilderberg group member.
[27:34.920 --> 27:37.680]  You were in there, and he says, I can't talk about it.
[27:37.680 --> 27:39.760]  That video's on Infowars.com.
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.800]  Then he walks out, I go on TV.
[27:41.800 --> 27:48.880]  Paul Watson of Infowars.com, my reporter confronts him and says, you're breaking the federal
[27:48.880 --> 27:49.880]  law in the UK.
[27:49.880 --> 27:53.920]  We're gonna play that clip towards the end of the hour, and no government minister can
[27:53.920 --> 27:55.760]  be in a secret policy meeting.
[27:55.760 --> 27:58.320]  It has to be recorded, there has to be minutes.
[27:58.320 --> 28:01.800]  That's federal law here in the UK, and he says, I'm not a government minister when he's
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.000]  a sitting member of parliament, and also the head of the treasury for Labour.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.440]  Again, it's the Tories that are in power right now, but they have power sharing, so it's
[28:09.440 --> 28:13.640]  like a multi-faceted, like two heads of it, the first, he's like the vice president of
[28:13.640 --> 28:14.640]  the treasury.
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.240]  All of this was going on.
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.280]  They had the head of the treasury, the vice president of the treasury.
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.040]  The prime minister, all these leaders of the UK in there, and they've been caught lobbying.
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.640]  There's a huge lobbying scandal going on right now inside the United Kingdom with people
[28:29.640 --> 28:35.040]  resigning and all this corruption on fake wind farms and people getting paid off and
[28:35.040 --> 28:36.040]  all this stuff.
[28:36.040 --> 28:37.400]  And that's the tip of the iceberg.
[28:37.400 --> 28:41.880]  Lockheed Martin got paid, paying off Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, all this, it's
[28:41.880 --> 28:43.000]  all coming up.
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.800]  But first, this big confrontation where I get into BBC's face and wake the people of
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.960]  the UK up is coming up, and then more, part of my speech, and David Knight riding shotgun
[28:53.960 --> 28:55.280]  as traffic cop.
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.280]  Stay with us.
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.360]  It's the Infowar from England.
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.100]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with Supernatural Silver, a non-toxic
[29:06.100 --> 29:10.440]  disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally.
[29:10.440 --> 29:16.320]  It helps the immune system by killing the bacteria, viruses, and mold that cause disease.

[29:20.480 --> 29:24.960]  the immune system to refocus its energy and recharge.

[33:01.360 --> 33:04.800]  Arctic Coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.800 --> 33:12.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:12.840 --> 33:20.920]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:20.920 --> 33:29.480]  Every year, usually the very first occasion to discuss, well, who knows, because as you've
[33:29.480 --> 33:31.680]  seen, it's all very hush-hush.
[33:31.680 --> 33:36.160]  Guests include the likes of Henry Kissinger, the head of the IMF, and our very own prime
[33:36.160 --> 33:37.860]  minister as well as Mr Bowles.
[33:37.860 --> 33:43.440]  The PM joined them for this year's top secret tete-a-tete, which was being held this weekend
[33:43.440 --> 33:45.960]  in the doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, Watford.
[33:45.960 --> 33:47.600]  Sonny Watford.
[33:47.600 --> 33:49.440]  It's where world domination begins.
[33:49.440 --> 34:01.480]  It's like Christmas for conspiracy theorists, including our Adam.
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.720]  The Masters of the Universe and their critics have spent the weekend at Watford's posh Grove
[34:06.720 --> 34:09.440]  Hotel for the annual Bilderberg meeting.
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.600]  Could that be the prime minister?
[34:11.600 --> 34:14.320]  Did George Osborne and Ed Balls share a ride?
[34:14.320 --> 34:17.420]  Is that the boss of Amazon or of Google?
[34:17.420 --> 34:23.160]  Probably top, top secret, this year the organizers have released a list of the roughly 150 people
[34:23.160 --> 34:35.480]  in there and the topics they've been discussing, including growth, big data, and current affairs.
[34:35.480 --> 34:40.480]  The protesters outside accuse this group of everything, from climate change to coups,
[34:40.480 --> 34:44.800]  but they're mainly annoyed about the lack of transparency.
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.840]  The man in the middle of the crowd is Alex Jones, king of the conspiracy theorists.
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.320]  Are there any conspiracy theories out there that you think are just too nuts and are just
[34:53.320 --> 34:54.320]  too extreme?
[34:54.320 --> 34:56.240]  How about these guys?
[34:56.240 --> 35:00.880]  Yeah, I don't personally think they're extraterrestrials or anything like some people say.
[35:00.880 --> 35:06.200]  Scary stuff, but this protest seems more like a slightly weird party.
[35:06.200 --> 35:11.520]  It's just corporate mega-death, so we're here to destroy them all.
[35:11.520 --> 35:15.520]  Does something not feel right about this today?
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.800]  It's surrounded by a ring of steel and a big, but fairly relaxed, police presence, which
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.360]  Bilderberg veterans say is a big change.
[35:23.360 --> 35:30.840]  Well, I had a baptism of fire in 2009 just outside Athens, so I went along and tried
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.960]  to cover it and spent a week being arrested, arrested, rearrested.
[35:35.960 --> 35:39.760]  While for residents of Watford, it's a bit so what?
[35:39.760 --> 35:46.120]  What I heard it was a secret shadow government meetings, hasn't been held in England for
[35:46.120 --> 35:47.120]  a long, long while.
[35:47.120 --> 35:48.600]  What do you think of that?
[35:48.600 --> 35:49.600]  What?
[35:49.600 --> 35:50.600]  Secret shadow government.
[35:50.600 --> 35:51.600]  What's that?
[35:51.600 --> 35:57.440]  Back at base, very few of the 22 invitees from the UK wanted to talk.
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.960]  Well, I just managed to speak to a very senior Bilderberger on the phone.
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.120]  I asked him why all the secrecy, and he said until the 1990s, they used to hold press conferences
[36:07.120 --> 36:11.640]  after every meeting, but no journalists turned up, so they stopped doing them.
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.880]  Then, as if by magic, a member of the organisation's influential steering committee turned up in
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.880]  the BBC's offices.
[36:18.880 --> 36:24.800]  What goes with Bilderberg is an informal discussion about politics and the world's problems with
[36:24.800 --> 36:27.520]  a lot of politicians and businessmen.
[36:27.520 --> 36:33.640]  We always produce lists of who's there, it's not secret, but we don't have a mass audience
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.880]  listening to our discussions, so it's a good informal weekend where we get together.
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.920]  The internet is full of nutty theories about how we're ruling the world, we're going to
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.760]  invade America, we're poisoning the water courses, all this kind of thing.
[36:46.760 --> 36:48.840]  It's very much duller than that, I can assure you.
[36:48.840 --> 36:52.240]  Oh, I'm actually slightly disappointed.
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.920]  Maybe not so sinister after all, but luckily I'm told there's a Bilderberg splinter group
[36:56.920 --> 37:04.840]  called the Trilateral, which includes the Chinese, and you know how open they are.
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.520]  That was Adam Fleming reporting from Watford, we've not seen him since.
[37:08.520 --> 37:10.240]  So if you see him, point him back here.
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.340]  We're joined by Alec Jones, an American shock jock, he's been campaigning for more openness
[37:14.340 --> 37:15.440]  at the Bilderberg conference.
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.880]  David Aronovich, who's a old sniffy about conspiracy theories, he's a columnist for
[37:19.880 --> 37:20.880]  the Times.
[37:20.880 --> 37:24.160]  Alex Jones, you've been covering Bilderberg for a long time, what have you ever found
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.160]  out about it?
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.360]  The piece you just played, there's nothing in the water, hydrofluorosolicic acid in major
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.760]  Harvard studies has been causing a sevenfold increase in bone cancer.
[37:32.760 --> 37:34.160]  What's that going to do with Bilderberg?
[37:34.160 --> 37:35.280]  What have I discovered about Bilderberg?
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.760]  The BBC was able to get the documents decades ago that they helped found the euro, which
[37:39.760 --> 37:44.600]  was actually a Nazi German plan to take over countries economically, you know, that's on
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.600]  record.
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.640]  And I've interviewed members of the EU parliament on the subject who are out there at the event,
[37:49.640 --> 37:56.160]  3,000 people, they turned a thousand, Bilderberg is heavily involved in the EU plan and helped
[37:56.160 --> 37:57.160]  hatch it.
[37:57.160 --> 37:58.420]  And it is a Nazi plan.
[37:58.420 --> 38:03.120]  They had Lockheed scandals, just like the big lobbying scales right now in the seventies.
[38:03.120 --> 38:07.000]  That's why the SS officer, Prince Bernard, the founder had to step down.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.400]  It is the ultimate lobbying meeting.
[38:09.400 --> 38:14.200]  While you guys have this huge scandal going on, your prime minister's going there.
[38:14.200 --> 38:16.840]  Balls was just here, Bilderberg group member.
[38:16.840 --> 38:23.080]  We have forced them from cover to admit that there are puppeteers above the major parties.
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.040]  So now we know, now we know that Bilderberg has given us the euro.
[38:28.040 --> 38:29.040]  Uh, yes.
[38:29.040 --> 38:32.320]  I mean, if you talk to Alex for any length of time, you discover all kinds of things
[38:32.320 --> 38:33.680]  that you didn't know about the world.
[38:33.680 --> 38:34.680]  We've blown it wide open.
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.620]  Um, you have, you have absolutely blown it wide open, but it leaves me with a huge question
[38:38.620 --> 38:39.620]  for you, Alex.
[38:39.620 --> 38:43.680]  And it's really, you have uncovered the new world order, which is deadly.
[38:43.680 --> 38:45.600]  It's full of what you call people who are criminals.
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.920]  Well, this is what I'm coming to is full of criminals, et cetera, who seek to run the
[38:49.920 --> 38:52.440]  world and will kill anybody who gets in their way.
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.360]  And you are almost a, have been a lone crusader powering against them.
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.480]  So how come, how are you still alive?
[39:00.480 --> 39:01.480]  Which is yes.
[39:01.480 --> 39:07.160]  Listen, which is the explanation one, they don't exist or two, you're part of the, no,
[39:07.160 --> 39:08.160]  let me tell you a story.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.160]  Let me tell you a story.
[39:09.160 --> 39:14.600]  I say the five years ago when Obama and Hillary, five years ago when Hillary and Obama were
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.640]  at Bilderberg and the secret service was there and helicopters, the New York times came out
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.840]  and said, I was crazy.
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.640]  There was no Bilderberg group meeting.
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.160]  And my wife got phone calls and so did I threatening to kill us.
[39:25.160 --> 39:28.800]  And the people said, and you better take it serious because you were just talking to your
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.240]  dad that was in the hospital, but you better shut your mouth or we're going to cut your
[39:32.240 --> 39:33.240]  head off.
[39:33.240 --> 39:38.200]  Now that, no, that's the, they listened to everybody's phone lines.
[39:38.200 --> 39:43.440]  They call up and harass people that expose them and tell them and tell them what they
[39:43.440 --> 39:44.760]  were just talking about.
[39:44.760 --> 39:46.720]  There's no spine.
[39:46.720 --> 39:48.680]  It's like not Germany.
[39:48.680 --> 39:51.080]  The only spy on the bad guys, huh?
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.080]  You let him speak.
[39:52.080 --> 40:00.160]  I saw one of your ministers say this though, I'm here to testify that your head was not
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.160]  cut off.
[40:01.160 --> 40:03.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, they kill me.
[40:03.360 --> 40:05.880]  It turns me into a martyr.
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.320]  It puts big exclamation points on the end of what I've said and I have put out a lot
[40:10.320 --> 40:11.320]  of information.
[40:11.320 --> 40:15.480]  There's millions of others that are exposing it and the, look, we have mega banks that
[40:15.480 --> 40:18.760]  are getting $85 million a month of us taxpayer money.
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.560]  Most of it goes to Europe and England, British taxpayers, EU taxpayers have to pay to these
[40:23.560 --> 40:24.800]  mega bankers.
[40:24.800 --> 40:26.180]  They're in there setting this up.
[40:26.180 --> 40:27.240]  It's come out.
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.280]  And then the media distracts you with, Oh, look at a guy that talked to a lobbyist, right?
[40:31.280 --> 40:34.040]  When the real lobbyists are going on, you're not going to dominate this.
[40:34.040 --> 40:37.360]  He gets to speak to, it's not your own radio show.
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.820]  Should we be worried about build a group at all?
[40:39.820 --> 40:43.520]  It's a kind of, it's mildly interesting to build a group and it feels, doesn't it?
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.920]  When you were talking about it and the film slightly kind of out of date as belonging
[40:46.920 --> 40:49.280]  to the era when you couldn't, yeah.
[40:49.280 --> 40:52.800]  When you couldn't even admit in parliament that there was a success, you know, when we
[40:52.800 --> 40:56.560]  called the head of MI5M or whatever it was that we called them and we couldn't admit
[40:56.560 --> 40:57.560]  to these things.
[40:57.560 --> 41:01.760]  And so to the extent that it seems ready to be spied on yet.
[41:01.760 --> 41:02.760]  What was that a fact?
[41:02.760 --> 41:03.760]  People haven't been acclimated yet.
[41:03.760 --> 41:04.760]  Did you let them finish?
[41:04.760 --> 41:05.760]  We're in a police state.
[41:05.760 --> 41:06.760]  It's 1984.
[41:06.760 --> 41:08.200]  You guys just want to normalize it.
[41:08.200 --> 41:10.160]  How come you're here?
[41:10.160 --> 41:11.160]  If we're in a police state?
[41:11.160 --> 41:14.840]  They actually turned back some of my reporters, but they didn't turn me back and I was told
[41:14.840 --> 41:16.320]  this because they don't want to make a stink.
[41:16.320 --> 41:18.440]  Do you think the BBC is part of the build a group?
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.040]  Well, you know, Winston Smith did work here.
[41:21.040 --> 41:23.440]  I mean, come on, Eric Blair worked here and that's what he said it was.
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.780]  Why do you think we've let you on then?
[41:26.780 --> 41:30.160]  Because you guys think that you can manage the whole thing and now our information's
[41:30.160 --> 41:31.160]  gotten too big.
[41:31.160 --> 41:33.580]  I have 3 million radio listeners a day.
[41:33.580 --> 41:34.580]  That's a low number.
[41:34.580 --> 41:35.580]  3 million.
[41:35.580 --> 41:38.600]  I have about 50 million YouTube views a month.
[41:38.600 --> 41:39.720]  That's a very conservative number.
[41:39.720 --> 41:41.920]  I make films, put them online for free.
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.260]  They can watch 40 million times like the Obama deception and that's why.
[41:46.260 --> 41:49.080]  Because the establishment doesn't know what to do.
[41:49.080 --> 41:51.580]  Alex has this point and it's an important one.
[41:51.580 --> 41:55.160]  I would have, say, 10 years ago said, listen to all this stuff.
[41:55.160 --> 42:01.680]  He believes that people put cancer virus in vaccine in order to create a eugenics program.
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.680]  That's what he believes.
[42:02.680 --> 42:03.840]  We talk about medical discoveries.
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.200]  We would have said and I would have said, hey, that's kind of mad and so on.
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.120]  And it's an interesting psychological phenomenon.
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.120]  Dismissing.
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.600]  The problem is that conspiracy theories like this are believed, are believed in.
[42:15.600 --> 42:17.340]  Hey, listen, I'm here to warn people.
[42:17.340 --> 42:18.960]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[42:18.960 --> 42:20.640]  This isn't a game, OK?
[42:20.640 --> 42:22.920]  Our government, the U.S. is building FEMA camps.
[42:22.920 --> 42:25.440]  We have an NDAA where they disappear people now.
[42:25.440 --> 42:28.820]  You have this arrest for public safety life in prison.
[42:28.820 --> 42:30.800]  You are the worst person I've interviewed.
[42:30.800 --> 42:33.320]  No, no, it's basically off with their heads disappearing.
[42:33.320 --> 42:35.320]  David, thank you for being with us.
[42:35.320 --> 42:37.320]  It's been half past eleven.

[43:59.800 --> 44:03.800]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why,
[44:03.800 --> 44:06.800]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[44:06.800 --> 44:11.800]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[44:11.800 --> 44:14.800]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[44:14.800 --> 44:19.800]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.800]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[44:24.800 --> 44:28.800]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[44:28.800 --> 44:30.800]  and discovered Younggevity.

[46:01.800 --> 46:06.800]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[46:06.800 --> 46:11.800]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out
[46:11.800 --> 46:14.800]  until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.800]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.

[46:58.800 --> 47:02.800]  Coast to Coast. Direct from Austin.
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:06.800 --> 47:21.800]  On the GCN radio network.
[47:21.800 --> 47:25.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex here in Austin.
[47:25.800 --> 47:29.800]  Alex is here with the show.
[47:29.800 --> 47:36.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight filling in for Alex here in Austin.
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.240]  Alex is still in London finishing up Bilderberg coverage. And as you just heard in the last
[47:41.240 --> 47:47.600]  segment, he was on this morning on the BBC News's main news program and interview there.
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.720]  That was pretty amazing to watch how smarmy and condescending they were. But it's been
[47:53.720 --> 47:57.600]  interesting to see that two contacts that Alex has had with the BBC. The first one,
[47:57.600 --> 48:04.180]  the reporter was coming back with nonsensical replies to everything he was saying and non
[48:04.180 --> 48:10.320]  sequiturs and just trying to provoke Alex, as she said later on, into getting upset.
[48:10.320 --> 48:15.520]  And he was laying out a very clear presentation of what Bilderberg was about and about how
[48:15.520 --> 48:19.120]  it had been ignored by the mainstream media. And as he's talking about how it was ignored
[48:19.120 --> 48:23.040]  by the mainstream media, she's ignoring everything that he's saying and saying, you're just making
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.760]  this up, aren't you? What we've seen here, especially in this last interview segment,
[48:26.760 --> 48:32.800]  is how the BBC has moved from the ignoring segment into the ridicule segment. That's
[48:32.800 --> 48:36.280]  the progression of events, as Mahatma Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they ridicule
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.960]  you, then they fight you, then you win. And we are actually in the fight right now. They
[48:40.960 --> 48:44.880]  may be on the ridicule stage, we're in the fight stage. It's very easy to try to demagogue
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.640]  these issues because there's something that the mainstream media is not presenting. When
[48:49.640 --> 48:55.200]  you come in and say the government is listening to everything that you're saying on any electronic
[48:55.200 --> 48:59.160]  communication, they're reading your emails, they're tapping your phones. When you start
[48:59.160 --> 49:04.000]  saying that, it may sound paranoid to people who haven't heard this. Alex has been saying
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.800]  this for 17 years because this has a very long history. Now people are seeing that that
[49:08.800 --> 49:13.720]  is truly in fact what they are doing. Just as he's been talking about the Bilderberg
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.520]  meetings and how they meet in secret in violation of transparency laws and accountability laws
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.160]  in most of the countries in violation of the Logan Act that we have here in this country.
[49:24.160 --> 49:28.760]  These people are meeting and it's massive influence peddling and we have notes from
[49:28.760 --> 49:35.760]  their minutes that show what they are doing globally. And yet, when you put that out there,
[49:35.760 --> 49:41.320]  it's a very different, very radically different paradigm. And as you saw, Alex was basically
[49:41.320 --> 49:45.740]  getting in their face because that's one way to wake people up because they're so used
[49:45.740 --> 49:51.280]  to this very quiet speech, especially on the BBC. It's a great way to wake people up to
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.760]  shout at them. But if people really want to know what's going on, put it to the test.
[49:55.760 --> 49:59.560]  Go to Infowars.com. Take a look at the articles there. Yeah, it's hard to believe that the
[49:59.560 --> 50:04.520]  DHS, the Department of Homeland Security is buying billions of bullets, billions of bullets.
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.600]  It's pretty hard to believe that, isn't it? But when you go to our articles, we've got
[50:08.600 --> 50:14.720]  links to the RFPs. We have links to the documents from Bilderberg. We document what we do. We
[50:14.720 --> 50:19.320]  have to do it more than the BBC because unlike the BBC, people aren't going to accept what
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.920]  we say just on faith. We have to show them the actual evidence. Now, Alex was doing a
[50:24.920 --> 50:31.880]  lot of this throughout Bilderberg and he had a great speech at the Bilderberg meeting yesterday.
[50:31.880 --> 50:36.960]  We had the Fringe Festival. Basically, it was thousands of people that was kind of wrapping
[50:36.960 --> 50:42.320]  up the protests and they had David Icke speaking and Alex spoke yesterday. And here's an excerpt
[50:42.320 --> 50:57.680]  from that speech.
[50:57.680 --> 51:26.080]  You
[51:26.080 --> 51:31.080]  talk about real grass roots. Nowhere do you have to actually climb on the stage. I love
[51:31.080 --> 51:39.720]  it. And that's how you can just see the incredible humanity that is here. And I want to salute
[51:39.720 --> 51:45.280]  every single man, woman and child that have traveled here from all over jolly old England
[51:45.280 --> 51:54.080]  and the rest of the world. I salute you. This is so historic what is happening right now.
[51:54.080 --> 51:58.680]  And I want to start getting into that here in just a moment. But first off, I want to
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.160]  point out there are thousands of people in here right now, but they are turning away
[52:03.160 --> 52:09.080]  thousands of others who couldn't get parking and who they're not letting in. So let it
[52:09.080 --> 52:17.880]  be known that the BBC will probably report there were five people here. But that's why
[52:17.880 --> 52:23.120]  they're discredited. That's why the power structure is falling apart. I actually had
[52:23.120 --> 52:29.260]  the BBC of like six interviews I've done with them. One of the ladies said, so you say there's
[52:29.260 --> 52:34.640]  a meeting going on here. So you claim there's something called the Bilderberg group. Are
[52:34.640 --> 52:41.880]  you insane? That's how stupid they think their viewers are. But the truth is they're losing
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.240]  all their viewers because people are awake to the globalist and they're lying propaganda
[52:47.240 --> 52:55.960]  organs. They're arrogant. They are so used to a population that will buy anything they're
[52:55.960 --> 53:05.600]  told that they are destroying their own credibility more and more. There is no doubt that trillions
[53:05.600 --> 53:13.400]  of dollars a month worldwide are stolen from the people of the West to finance the globalist
[53:13.400 --> 53:20.040]  takeover of the planet. And what's so dangerous about it is the globalist have all written
[53:20.040 --> 53:27.200]  books, all made statements about what their plan is for the new world order. Their plan
[53:27.200 --> 53:34.440]  is worldwide poverty and forced population reduction. They want to bankrupt every family
[53:34.440 --> 53:41.760]  in the world except for a few dozen families so they can control you with their fiat currency
[53:41.760 --> 53:50.640]  and bring in total technocratic world slavery. And the reason there are so many people here
[53:50.640 --> 53:57.180]  today and millions watching in the real free press across the world is because humanity
[53:57.180 --> 54:03.480]  has figured out that we're in deep trouble and that these dangerous parasites have ill
[54:03.480 --> 54:13.400]  will towards us. It's not that they don't care about us, they care about killing us.
[54:13.400 --> 54:18.200]  They want the world for themselves. They've stolen the governments, they've stolen the
[54:18.200 --> 54:24.280]  money, they've stolen the cultures, they've stolen almost everything and now they want
[54:24.280 --> 54:29.960]  us out of the way so they can move forward into the future with all the technology that
[54:29.960 --> 54:36.700]  humankind developed. They take the ideas and the energy of you, the creative and they use
[54:36.700 --> 54:42.360]  it against you. And I'm here to tell you how to stop them, fight them with information,
[54:42.360 --> 54:52.200]  fight them with truth, fight them with art and never give up and realize that we are
[54:52.200 --> 54:56.380]  and realize that we are in a war.
[54:56.380 --> 55:00.680]  That they are attacking us, that they are attacking our families, that they are attacking
[55:00.680 --> 55:06.440]  our nations, that they are attacking our cultures. They want us absolutely neutralized so they
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.860]  can take over this planet and I'm going to break that down today. But first off, I want
[55:10.860 --> 55:18.400]  to say this, the globalist absolutely are angry today to know the shadow government,
[55:18.400 --> 55:26.600]  the shadow government and the periscope of their subterranean world tyranny that has
[55:26.600 --> 55:31.080]  popped up just a few hundred yards away from us, the Bilderberg group.
[55:31.080 --> 55:37.000]  They have fought for 60 years to maintain their secrecy and they have threatened their
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.460]  reporters and their media institutions all over the world that they would be fired if
[55:42.460 --> 55:49.120]  they ever even wrote the words Bilderberg. And now all of us together and the real media
[55:49.120 --> 55:55.040]  have forced this out in the open and I'm here to tell you without a shadow of a doubt, today
[55:55.040 --> 56:05.120]  is the true begetting of the fall of the Bilderberg group, today, today.
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.920]  That's pretty amazing. You know, the BBC's credibility couldn't fall any farther. First
[56:10.920 --> 56:15.960]  they announced to the fall of building 7, 20 minutes before it happened with the building
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.780]  still standing in the background of the reporter. You have to ask what was up with that and
[56:20.780 --> 56:26.200]  many people have. And then they do this hit piece basically at finally admitting that
[56:26.200 --> 56:31.620]  Bilderberg actually exists just as they've been forced to admit that the child predation
[56:31.620 --> 56:37.200]  of Jimmy Saville celebrated celebrity amongst their mitts that they covered up and then
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.680]  covered up after the fact, after it became public knowledge, they did their best to penalize
[56:41.680 --> 56:46.560]  the reporters, the real reporters of the BBC who brought that out. But I think it's interesting
[56:46.560 --> 56:52.840]  to look at how the silly ways that they cover this. They actually had a clown and a ventriloquist.
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.160]  So you know who the real clowns and the real ventriloquist dummies are? It's the presenters
[56:58.160 --> 57:04.560]  who are the shills for the politicians and the corporations that are at Bilderberg. These
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.560]  people have lost all credibility. It's just amazing. But the information is getting out
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.940]  there. Alex is putting it out there and we're going to be talking more to Alex live from
[57:12.940 --> 57:35.320]  London right after this break. Stay tuned.

[59:51.160 --> 01:00:01.880]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:08.440]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:17.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Alex Jones is going to be joining us briefly
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.360]  and I'm David Knight here at Austin. It's Sunday June the 9th and Alex is covering Bilderberg.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.080]  It's the last day he's going to be there. Earlier today he was on the BBC. We had a clip from that.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.680]  We also had clips of the festival where he addressed thousands of people yesterday telling
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.720]  them exactly what's going on. Of course those people were there they knew about Bilderberg
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.760]  and that's the key. The information is getting out there. They cannot suppress this anymore.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:51.320]  We just heard that BBC piece that they had in the last segment. They were incredibly saying that
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.680]  the Bilderberg people used to hold press conferences through the 90s but nobody came.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:03.160]  Yeah right. Anybody can look at the history of this. They can look at how people were laughed at
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.640]  and ridiculed if they even talked about the existence of Bilderberg. There were no press
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.920]  conferences. You heard Charlie Skelton from the Guardian talking about how in 2009 he went to
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.040]  cover Bilderberg in Greece and he was getting arrested over and over and over again. Well
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.480]  what's going on in Greece now? Well in Greece now they're seeing the fruits of the Bilderberg
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.840]  plans. They're seeing the austerity programs. They're being imposed upon them by Goldman Sachs,
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.120]  former Goldman Sachs bankers, technocrats as they like to call them who have deposed
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.480]  duly elected democratic representative government and come in with their bankers
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:46.360]  fiats. Of course they get the countries to assume the losses from their ridiculous derivative
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.520]  schemes, their speculative schemes and assume those as national losses and then they come
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.400]  back and say well now you're bankrupt so we're going to dictate to you the terms. Just amazing
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:03.560]  but that's what you get when you allow the most powerful bankers and corporations to meet secretly
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:11.080]  and privately with politicians and use them as puppets and ventriloquist dummies over decades,
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:16.600]  60 years this has been going on. Not quite as long as the Jimmy, well the Jimmy Saville
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.720]  scandals went on almost that long. He didn't live quite that long but yeah Bilderberg is even
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.600]  longer than the Jimmy Saville scandals that the BBC has covered up. Also breaking today is
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:33.000]  information, new information about who was the whistleblower and the Verizon leaks. We now know
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:43.880]  that this person was a 29 year old Edward Snowden who worked for the NSA as a capacity he's worked
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.680]  for them just a couple of years and the Guardian which originally broke that story had an
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.800]  interesting interview with him a question answer. He is now in Hong Kong and he doesn't expect that
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.600]  he'll ever see America again because he knows that if he comes back into this country somebody
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:05.320]  who exposes the illegal and criminal acts of the American government is going to be treated the way
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.120]  Bradley Manning was treated. We need to do something about that. We need to make sure that
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.760]  isn't happening. We need to make sure that the real criminals are going to go to jail. The real
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:22.120]  criminals like Bush and like Obama. I am sick and tired of seeing the left right paradigm being
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:29.160]  used to excuse both of these guys. Every time you see something done by Bush the excuse is well
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.160]  Clinton did that or did something worse than that or the equivalent of that and you see the same
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:39.560]  thing going on now with Obama. You see people on the left who opposed George Bush's encroachments
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:45.400]  and violations of our civil liberties now excusing it for Obama saying George Bush did it. Why say
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.960]  put them both in jail? We need to at least get Obama out of office even if we're not going to
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:55.080]  put him and George Bush in jail. Let's say that this is going to end here and now because if we
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.640]  accept this there is no end to this and that's what they want. They want us to just acquiesce
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:08.920]  to this massive usurpation of power this denial of our basic fundamental human rights. They asked him
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.880]  in this interview from the Guardian they asked Edward Snowden who leaked this information. They
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.320]  said do you think what you've done is a crime and he said we've seen enough criminality on the part
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.600]  of government. It is hypocritical to make this allegation against me. They have narrowed the
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:31.640]  public sphere of influence. In other words they have created a secretive tyranny. They also asked
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.800]  him what do these leaked documents reveal and he says that the NSA routinely lies in response to
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.720]  congressional inquiries about the scope of surveillance in America. That was a basis for
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.480]  getting rid of Richard Nixon. Why don't we use that to get rid of Obama? Stay tuned we'll be
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.480]  right back with more of Alex Jones. We'll have Alex live from London. Stay tuned.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:05.080]  Hi I'm Steve Shank founder of e Foods Direct. Right now we have a huge number of Americans
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:10.120]  that are in serious trouble right smack dab in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.840]  I know that thousands of you like us are frustrated with not being able to help those
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:20.760]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain. We can't stand idly by. Food is the best way to
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.720]  help the victims and support the relief effort. We have a plan for any of you who would like to
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.400]  partner with us in providing food in this desperate time of need. We've built a seven-day emergency
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:37.400]  food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for a whole week for one adult valued at
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:47.320]  $60. Your $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need. Call 800-409-5633 or
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:55.400]  efoodsdirect.com. That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com. The food is contributed
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:07.160]  at considerably less than cost. Thank you. We now take you live to the
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:13.880]  Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm David Knight and we've got Alex who's going to join us
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.600]  right now live from London. Alex, how you doing? Absolutely. We're out here going from spot to
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:37.240]  spot doing special reports. We've still got a little bit of spotty reception there though. We're
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.080]  breaking up a little bit. We're going to come right back to Alex as we work on that. We were
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:47.400]  just talking about this breaking news of the person who leaked the Verizon information has
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:54.360]  now come public. He is taking asylum in Hong Kong and he was being interviewed by the Guardian that
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:59.160]  was released today as to why he did it and what his concerns are, why he would release this,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.760]  why he would put himself at jeopardy because we know as James Clapper, head of the NSA, has said
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.680]  he is not apologizing for violating blatant violation of the law. James Clapper is not
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:16.120]  apologizing for lying to the Senate. Instead he's saying he's going to go after whoever it was that
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:24.360]  leaked this stuff. So this young 29-year-old man leaked this stuff out there and hats off to him
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.560]  for doing this. He has our gratitude for telling people what's going on, what he's seen on the
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.520]  inside. They asked him from the Guardian, they said, what do the leaked documents reveal? And
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.160]  he said, the NSA is routinely lying in response to congressional inquiries about the scope of
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.040]  surveillance in America. That was back in March 12th, I believe it was, James Clapper lied to
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.400]  the Senate. He says, I believe that when Senator Wyden and Senator Mark Udall asked about the
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.480]  scale of this, the NSA said that it did not have the tools to provide an answer. We do have the
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.000]  tools and I have maps showing where people have been scrutinized the most. Now remember this is
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.360]  being done under the Foreign Intelligence Securities Act, which in itself, in my opinion,
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:13.400]  is a clear violation of the Constitution and their constitutional authority. But it was supposedly
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.840]  okay because the rights of people outside of America don't make any difference, right?
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.680]  Those are the people outside of America that we can just drop bombs on and invade at will. It
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.680]  doesn't really matter because if you're not an American, you're not a real person, they can just
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.640]  kill you at will or listen to you or spy on you. That's not true and when we allow that, when we
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:39.000]  allow them to do that to other people, to other human beings in other countries, basically these
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.800]  are people who do not respect human rights. And if they don't respect human rights, they're not
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:49.960]  going to respect American rights either. He goes on to say, we collect more digital communications
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.080]  from America than we do from the Russians. You see, that's how this FISA is working out.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:59.160]  Supposedly, they were only collecting information from foreign people and yet he's telling us,
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.400]  having worked there, that they're collecting more information from Americans than they are from
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.960]  Russians. Then they go on to ask him and say, is it possible to put security in place to protect
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:15.320]  against state surveillance? This is his answer. You are not even aware of what is possible.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.920]  See, we've been talking about this for a long time. Alex mentioned the fact that
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  even back in 1996 on public access television in Austin, he was talking about this because it was
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.680]  being leaked at that time. Even earlier than that, there was Project Echelon, which was going through
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.760]  combing the internet, which was at that time in its infancy, for the most part operating through
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.480]  bulletin boards and that sort of thing. They were still combing those messages for keywords.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.000]  And we used to send those keywords at the bottom of all of our messages. I think people ought to
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.920]  start thinking about that. I think we need to basically clutter with chatter the NSA sifting
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.400]  and combing through our messages by basically putting all the keywords that they're looking
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.480]  for at the bottom of our messages as a signature. That'd be one way to clog up the works. We need to
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:09.000]  throw a wrench in the gear somehow. He says you're not even aware of what's possible. This is the
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.800]  person who leaked this, who worked for the NSA. He said the extent of their capabilities is
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:20.120]  horrifying. Horrifying. We can plant bugs and machines. Once you go on the network,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.640]  I can identify your machine. You will never be safe, whatever protections you put in place.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:33.560]  We have to have some real criminal penalties for people like James Clapper, people like Obama who
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.760]  have nothing but contempt for not only the rule of law, but of basic human rights. If we tolerate
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:47.080]  this kind of illegal activity by those who are the most powerful, who have all of these tools
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:54.440]  in hand, we are headed to an Orwellian nightmare that is far beyond anything George Orwell ever
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:00.760]  imagined. We're already there. They already have that capability. We just have to get people awake
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:06.440]  to it and to care about it. You need to talk to your friends and neighbors and talk to them about
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:14.040]  why this is so horrific. It truly is amazing. And this fellow, Edward Snowden, was willing to
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:20.840]  basically become a refugee for the rest of his life, a man without a country. And he is now in
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.800]  Hong Kong. And I can tell you, Hong Kong is a much freer place than America. Many countries are now
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.360]  freer than America. We need to get rid of this complacency, thinking that we can never lose our
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.760]  freedoms in America because, hey, we're Americans, right? We can't lose our freedom. We're the most
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.640]  free people in the world. Well, that simply isn't true. It's become a mantra, and it could be
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.680]  nothing further from the truth. It's interesting to go back and take a look, for example, at an old
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.800]  series that Milton Friedman did called Free to Choose. He focused quite a bit on Hong Kong,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.880]  talking about how much freer Hong Kong is. Hong Kong is also economically freer as well as
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:04.520]  politically freer. It's interesting to see how that worked because in Hong Kong, and I've been
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.640]  there, and they don't have a central bank. Their currency is issued by private banks who then have
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.200]  to actually back up that currency. It's not simply a fiat currency, but they were able to get
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.480]  freer because they didn't have the thumb of a very oppressive government. The British basically left
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.040]  them alone, and I think we've got Alex on the line now. Alex, are you there? Can you hear me?
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.280]  Absolutely, I can. Listen, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come on during the next segment.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.480]  We'll get to some better internet area. I just think it's important that everybody understands
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:45.480]  that it's just this simple. It's very, very simple what's going on, and that's that this country and
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.680]  the whole world has become extremely naive and very powerful corporate interests have come in
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:59.800]  and basically taken over the government. Absolutely. And it's just really that simple,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:08.280]  and we've been so naive about it. This is just basically a globalist corporate takeover that
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:17.160]  is taking place, and I will call you right back during the next segment. But that's the bottom
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.240]  line. Just please continue on. Again, I'm reporting live here from London. And there's no
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.240]  place that we can better see that than at Bilderberg. One of the main themes this year,
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.120]  according to them, and I think it's the first time they ever released a supposed agenda, they have in
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.840]  the past released the names of attendees, but they've never released an agenda as far as I know
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.280]  this year, the agenda was big data. And of course, in attendance were representatives from Google
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:46.520]  and Amazon. We had David Petraeus there, who famously said about a year ago that they were
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.360]  going to be listening to everybody via our appliances. That's right, via our appliances.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.400]  Now we see how this is panning out. The Atlantic had an interesting article from Connor
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.560]  Friedersdorf. He said, all the infrastructure a tyrant would need, courtesy of Bush and Obama,
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:09.240]  and I would include Bilderberg in that because that's what they said they're working on is big
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.280]  data. This is an interesting take he has. Let's assume he said that George Bush, Dick Cheney,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.960]  Barack Obama, Joe Biden, their staffers, every member of Congress for the last dozen years has
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:23.160]  acted with pure motives in the realm of national security. Let's say they've used the power they've
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.160]  claimed, the technology they developed, and the precedents they've established to exclusively
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.880]  fight Al Qaeda terrorists intent on killing us, and that they've succeeded in disrupting what
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.200]  would have been successful attacks, and that Americans are lucky to have had men and women
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:42.520]  so moral, so prudent, so incorruptible in charge. Few Americans believe this all to be so. That's
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.720]  true. And yet, and yet, this is what they use to this excuse to create this massive infrastructure.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.440]  As one of the founders, I don't remember if it was Jefferson who said it or someone else,
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:02.440]  but he said, basically, if we were angels, we would not need government. And because
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.880]  we are not angels, we cannot allow government to go unchecked, essentially. It's a very,
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:15.000]  very dangerous thing to allow this kind of trust in people. What he says is, let's assume that
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.560]  right now they are all angels, that they are super patriots, so they have no corruption in their
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.600]  midst. Let's just make that assumption. He said, in 2016, we don't know who's going to become
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:30.520]  president. That's why, again, the founders said, trust no man, but bind them down with the chains
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.040]  of the Constitution. This is a criminal organization that doesn't believe that they're
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.240]  responsible to any legal standard that is before them. They don't believe that they're responsible
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:47.720]  to the Constitution they swear an oath to. And if there are any senators or congressmen who are,
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.120]  in fact, still legitimate, then let them take these guys down with impeachment.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:16:18.200]  We'll be right back with more from Alex Jones.

[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:15.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.440]  in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin and we have on the phone live with
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.040]  us now Alex Jones. Alex, how you doing? That's right. Usually when I do stuff from the road,
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:38.680]  we have an incredible track record, but I guess my mobile systems and things aren't working too
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.600]  well on the road from the UK. But I'll tell you what just happened then. I said, that's it.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.760]  We've been going from report to report, from site to site, talking to our insiders, our witnesses
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:53.720]  about Bilderberg and meeting with people and things. And the internet is so intermittent
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.040]  that I said, let's just pull over off this highway into this rest stop area, a little
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:07.640]  tiny rest stop area. We pull in, I go live with you and all of a sudden the police pull up
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:12.840]  and there's nobody else there but another car is pulled up and I hear British voices yelling,
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:18.120]  yelling like it's a drug raid or something. I'm like, well, I guess we'll just say that
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.840]  it's private corporations about a corporate takeover and I'll be back on later cuz Richard
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:28.360]  gets out of the car to go see. I get out, the cops aren't looking at me. Some drunk driver was
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:34.760]  driving backwards down the highway and backed into the rest area right behind us. And then the
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.960]  cops were instantly on him, just screaming at him, what are you doing? Cuz it was like a highway
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.480]  with people going 80 miles an hour down it. I mean, it was like a Laurel and Hardy event.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.600]  I thought, man, the cops are really on you. We pull into the rest area, they're screaming at us
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.520]  in two minutes. But they weren't even looking at us, so I'm back. But listen, this whole thing
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:01.080]  has been incredible. For those that don't know, Bilderberg is the real mafia. And I've used this
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:07.000]  analogy 100 times, I'll use it again. Until about 1952, cuz they bought off the FBI and blackmailed
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.840]  them. They said on the news there's no such thing as organized crime. There's some gangsters and
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:19.960]  some gangs, but there's not big organized crime, running gambling, running prostitution, running
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.280]  all this stuff. And Jagger Hoover, who was paid millions of dollars obviously in payoffs,
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.960]  that's all come out and been released now. And they also were blackmailing him over some
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:33.800]  famous sexual stuff. Clint Eastwood just put a historical film out about that, he liked to
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:40.040]  dress like a woman. And nothing against whatever he's into, the point is that he used files,
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.560]  he used wiretapping, he used all these systems to basically suppress people.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:53.640]  But the reason I was getting off into the mafia is that the mafia is not just Italian. It's not just
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:01.480]  from Corsica, it's not just from Sicily, it's not just from Rome, Italy. Mafia is just organized
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.280]  gangs of powerful combines, and the best and easiest way to make money is just control
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.880]  government and control competition. And these people are the anti-free marketeers. And listen,
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:18.200]  I go on the BBC today on their biggest Sunday press news show with like 5 million viewers,
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:24.440]  they report. It's like meet the press, and I go on there. And I know for a fact that
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:28.360]  WikiLeaks has released Bilderberg documents. I know for a fact the National Archives
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.960]  has released them. I know for a fact that they want a post-industrial world, and they want to
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.960]  set up a world government. And they want to get rid of the family, and they want to impoverish
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.680]  people, and they want to deindustrialize the West. I mean, this is all fact. I've made films on,
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.160]  I've got all the facts. They didn't want to hear my facts. I tried to give the guest I was
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.000]  going to debate from the Times of London, who's always attacking me over here. I tried to give him
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.480]  facts. He said, it's a conspiracy theory. I said, our government runs Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.400]  It's a war crime to take our liberties, the aim of fighting Al-Qaeda, when meanwhile, our government
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:10.040]  created it and runs it. And he goes, you are insane. It does not exist. That is not true.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:18.280]  And the show before us had professors on saying, is it right to be funding Al-Qaeda in Syria,
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:24.040]  or is it wrong? And admitting they're committing atrocities and are 100 times worse than Assad,
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.400]  who didn't attack anybody. So this guy is basically telling me in the green room,
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:34.440]  before we go on, that is ridiculous. You are the most delusional man I have ever known.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.680]  Our government and no other government in NATO has not worked with Al-Qaeda. I even YouTubed
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.800]  some of this. I haven't put it up yet because I haven't had time to upload all the footage
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:49.240]  of me arguing with him in the green room. And just I'm like, look, the TV's on. They were just
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.760]  talking about it. Whatever, you claim whatever you want. So I go on there and they're laughing.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.720]  These guys just a few years ago were saying Bilderberg didn't exist.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.840]  And then right before I come on, they have two members of Bilderberg Group on. One of them on
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.280]  the steering committee, both government high level ministers in the British government,
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:14.360]  knowing these people claim we're putting stuff in the water. They're insane. Prince Bernard was an
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:20.360]  SS officer, part of Hitler's special guard, that was gonna be king of the Netherlands
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:27.000]  till that happened. He had to step back after World War II. He founded it. He was a eugenicist
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  with his cousin Prince Philip, married to the Queen of England. And these guys have openly
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.240]  talked about their eugenics views. Bill Gates says, this is what they're doing. These are the
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.640]  people we give hundreds of billions of tax money to every year to prop up their derivatives fraud.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.480]  And it's just I'm tired of playing along with some British caricature guy
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:57.400]  sitting there trying to demonize and attack me when the BBC is known for being involved
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.360]  in the first Bilderberg Group meetings in 54. And I interviewed a member of the European
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.160]  Union Parliament. You ought to interview that Batten, Gerard Batten, ten minute interview
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.000]  in the last segment today because it was so powerful. I know we heard it
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:18.360]  Friday, but it was just so powerful. And he didn't even knew the name of the German legend
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:23.000]  of the German legislation. He even laid it all out. This is historical
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.560]  that Hitler had a plan for an European Union to take over countries that they didn't militarily
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:35.080]  invade and to buy off their politicians and covertly take them over. It is a fact that
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:40.920]  Bilderberg was created by the globalists. It is a fact that they use it as a corporate
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:47.560]  global robber baron takeover. It is a fact that this global domination has now taken place and
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.680]  people are waking up under it. It is a fact that all this illegal garbage is going on.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.720]  And that's why I said, I said, if I go in there and they let me talk, I'll be nice. But if they
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.440]  go in there and make jokes and snicker like they always do, and they had Tony Gosling at
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:08.600]  Bilderberg.org, an incredible journalist who's worked in national TV stations, even BBC worked
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:14.120]  there nationally. Tony Gosling was on there last week with this guy on one of their weekday shows,
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:19.480]  and he eloquently laid out the documents and how they set up the euro and how they set up the
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.680]  Baker bailout implosion and how it's all planned. And he just said, you're a fool. You're an idiot.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.480]  You know what? I don't respect people that don't respect us. And that's why it's a victory.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.960]  Because just like when Piers Morgan happened, people at first were like, oh, that's shocking,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.280]  about half of them, because they're normalized to just put up with slavery. They're normalized to be
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.160]  calm and in a trance. It's about getting people out of their trance. But in the aftermath,
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.440]  everybody raves of how wonderful that was, because in the hindsight, they're not shocked.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.080]  It's almost like if a car's coming for you in the same lane and you say,
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:01.320]  watch out. At first it's shocking, but later it wakes you up. And then to be at Bilderberg,
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:08.520]  covering it with huge speakers blasting into the grounds, exposing them with 2,000 people
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.960]  on the ground, so the 1,000 or so that got turned away. It's just a historic event.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.000]  And to see the police, I'd say about 60% of them that I talked to, were coming over,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.360]  shaking my hand, telling me I was right, talking about how they saw my film on 77 and how they
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:31.560]  knew that the radical jihadis were globalists run. And the photos up on our Twitter at Real
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.880]  Alex Jones of the cops hugging me and stuff, they came over and wanted to hug us. They had
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:41.560]  ones saying they know and they appreciate what we're doing. Humanity is awakening.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.320]  And we'll come back and talk more about that on the other side. But I have breaking
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.920]  Bilderberg news I haven't even gotten to when we come back. I'm Alex Jones from London on the road,
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.400]  David Knight riding shotgun. Stay with us.

[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.320]  we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble right smack dab in the middle
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:15.000]  of the Oklahoma disasters. I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.600]  able to help those who have lost so much and are in so much pain. We can't stand idly by.

[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:30.840]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.520]  gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:40.200]  But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:46.520]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:08.040]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:19.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in Austin. We have Alex
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:31.000]  live in London. Our transmission there is going in and out right now. It is out,
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.560]  but stay tuned. He's going to be joining us shortly. Now Alex was talking in the previous
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:43.080]  segment about a UKIP member, Gerard Batten, who is a member of the EU Parliament. And Alex
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.840]  interviewed him at Bilderberg about the impact of Bilderberg and what it truly means and the
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.160]  history. Here's that interview. My name is Gerard Batten. I'm a member of the European Parliament
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:57.720]  for London for the UK Independence Party. And we're here today outside the Grove Hotel where
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.720]  they're having the Bilderberg meeting because I'm one of those many people from many different
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.440]  political points of view who are asking the question, what are these people meeting for?
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.760]  I think this year is very significant because it's the first year in 59 years that we've actually
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.560]  got members of the mainstream press and media turning up to actually interview people like me
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:19.880]  and Alex Jones who's here and filming me today and asking what's going on. That's a major
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:25.560]  breakthrough. And I think that the reason that people are very upset about this is because they
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:29.800]  don't know what the conclusions are of these meetings. Now they say they don't have any
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:36.440]  conclusions, but are we really supposed to believe that 130, 140 people of the most powerful,
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.680]  richest, influential people in the world give up their time, fly across the world to come here,
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.480]  and it doesn't have a significance? I don't believe that for a minute. If it isn't significant,
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.400]  why would they come? If it is significant, what does it all mean? And I think the reason
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.800]  that a party like mine, the UK Independence Party, is soaring ahead in the polls and getting votes
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:58.760]  is because people now feel that politics is something that's done to them and not
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:04.120]  something that's done for them. And this is the heart of the malaise. People feel that it doesn't
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.200]  matter what they think, it doesn't matter what they believe, they're going to have these policies
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.880]  that they don't want thrust down their throat anyway. And this is where my party's different,
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.720]  whether you agree with us or not, a lot of people feel that we're sincere and we actually stand for
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.560]  certain things and that's why they're voting for us. I heard you speaking with the London Telegraph
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.960]  just a few minutes ago and you've obviously done your research because it's been declassified.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:29.640]  CIA funded the creation of the European Union. UKIP's the fastest growing party, obviously,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.960]  now in the UK in the last elections because you guys talk about how you're losing your
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.360]  sovereignty and how you've got EU license plates and 80% of your laws or so are EU and you don't
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:44.840]  get a vote on it. But again, it's a corporate group that took over America, created the UN,
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:50.520]  created all this. It's not even really America, but it was the CIA, kind of this corporate body,
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.040]  that's anti-free market, kind of monopoly men, that did set up the EU to get rid of the sovereignty
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.120]  of Europe. I mean, if Hitler would have come up with a corporate plan to take over, we'd all be...
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:06.520]  He did, because in actual fact, in 1942, the German bank, German central bank on
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.680]  under Dr. Walter Funk, along with leading industrialists, said, how are we going to
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.880]  run the economy of Europe after we've won the war? Because at that time...
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.600]  You know your stuff, the EU is a Nazi plan.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.000]  Europyshavitshavka mineshaft, the European Economic Community, that's what they called it,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  and it had a common agricultural policy, a common this policy, a common that policy.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  And I haven't done enough research on this, but I'll be willing to bet that some of the
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.400]  civil servants that drew that plan up actually found jobs 10 to 15 years later.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.200]  Prince Bernhard was an SS officer and he was the founder.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.720]  And Queen Bernhard of the Netherlands is here, or the Queen of the Netherlands is here.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.920]  And her son is about to be king.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.280]  Yep, and she comes to every one of these.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.560]  OK, so specifically, though, talk about the 60s and that vote and the CIA funding the Europe.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.560]  Well, 1975 is the last time that we had a referendum in this country.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.720]  And it wasn't about joining the EU because they don't...
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.240]  Ted Heath had already taken us in with no mandate, no democratic mandate to do it.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.120]  Under a trade deal, just like in the US, we're under free trade.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:00.840]  That's what they told us.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.880]  But everybody who knew anything about it knew that wasn't the case anyway.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.840]  But anyway, we got in, Harold Wilson won an election saying,
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.360]  I'll give you a referendum on the EU.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.320]  And it was about whether we should accept his renegotiated terms, stay in or get out.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.640]  And about...
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:20.120]  We don't know the exact figures, but the CIA put money into the yes campaign.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.560]  The BBC had meetings every day to make sure that there was a yes vote delivered.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.440]  You know, major organs of the press were involved in that.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.240]  So the no vote were totally outspent and outclassed in terms of a campaign.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.760]  So is this not a corporate takeover via EU government?
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]  Well, that was the CIA.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.360]  So presumably they get their money from the government.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.800]  So I see this as an instrument of American foreign policy at the time,
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.400]  because as Henry Kissinger said,
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.720]  who do I talk to when I want to ring Europe?
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.680]  He doesn't want to ring 20-odd individual nation states
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.040]  and have to worry about dealing with them.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:55.960]  He wants to deal with one centralized authority, a United States of Europe.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:59.000]  So I see this as your corporate idea may well be very valid.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.720]  Well, sure, it's Bilderberg that gives the orders in the US, though.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:04.120]  It's the main contingent is Americans and Brits.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.880]  And in some EU, we've gotten their minutes, we've gotten their documents.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.000]  They say what you just said,
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.480]  Carl Quigley, who was allowed into their minutes in the 60s,
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.360]  wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:16.360]  And he said, autocratic thing run by central bankers into freedom,
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.200]  controlling both major parties in countries,
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.120]  Democrat, Republican, Labor, Tory, creating the illusion of choice.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.000]  The fact that you kept getting so popular,
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.360]  speaking out against the new world order,
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.320]  they criticize you guys then, but only makes you more popular.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.840]  Does that signify that people are awakening
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:36.360]  and people like Nigel Farage and yourself are kind of the Ron Polls of Europe?
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.640]  Well, you know, I don't claim any great any great status myself.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.800]  Basically, what we're doing, I think, is asking the questions
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.320]  and trying to come up with some answers.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.480]  And I think more and more people are aware
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.680]  that politics is not being run for their benefit.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.960]  And, you know, you talk about people talk about this being a capitalist system.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.000]  This isn't capitalism.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.040]  Capitalism is supposed to be fair and open with a free market.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.280]  And that's not what you're getting now in the in the modern world,
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.800]  where things are stitched up corporately, as you rightly point out.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.640]  So it isn't a crisis of capitalism.
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.920]  It's a crisis of democratic government and a fair economic system.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.320]  Sure. Last question.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.840]  This huge lobbying scandal, members of parliament resigning and things.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  Isn't this the big lobbying scandal right here?
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.000]  They've gotten in trouble for criminal lobbying before,
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.720]  back in the 70s with the Lockheed Martin scandal and Prince Bernard.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.800]  Well, I think that the George Osborne who's here,
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.800]  who's a minister of the government, hasn't been Kenny Clark,
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.320]  may well be in breach of the ministerial rules
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.160]  because that lays down that they're supposed to be open
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.720]  about who they're talking to, and particularly with members of the press.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.080]  They're supposed to log every meeting.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.120]  And you've got people here who own vast swathes of the media
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.240]  in one way or another.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:39.240]  So I think there may well be some questions asked,
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.160]  but I wouldn't hold out much hope of actually anything being done about it.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.520]  Is UKIP going to call for criminal investigations of this?
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.360]  Well, I think what we do when I get back to my office,
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.960]  I'm going to be looking at the rules in detail and writing to David Cameron
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.880]  and raising the issues that I think are relevant.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.160]  So we'll do our best.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:56.680]  But I've written many letters, Alex.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.600]  A lot of them get ignored and don't often actually result in much action.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.120]  But big things have small beginnings.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.680]  If you could speak for one minute to the Bilderberg attendees,
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:09.800]  the royalty, the people, the corporate barons,
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.960]  the government regulators, the EU bureaucrats
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.040]  that are arriving with people that they regulate,
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.160]  if you could say one minute of words to them
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.640]  as a member of the European Union Parliament,
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.920]  what would you say to them?
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.160]  I would say, if you were really here to talk about things in the public interest,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.520]  which is what they maintain,
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.000]  why do you think you can achieve it in secrecy?
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.720]  Why wouldn't you achieve more by being public?
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.960]  Okay, you could have a discussion about what the problems are
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.320]  and the solutions in private,
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.480]  but any decisions that you arrive at,
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.880]  any policy recommendations should be in public
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.600]  because you need to take the public with you.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.960]  And obviously they're not doing that
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.960]  because the public wouldn't want to go on the trip
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.160]  that they've got planned for them.
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.760]  But I'd ask them to do that.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.920]  If it's genuine, be open and honest about it
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.560]  because what people feel now is that, as I said earlier,
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.520]  politics is not something that's done for them, it's done to them.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.720]  You had a great point, though, about how if they don't have any power,
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.200]  why would they be traveling from all over the world
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.960]  in great expense and secrecy
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.000]  and paying for part of the millions of pounds they spend here
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.200]  if this didn't have any power?
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.800]  And we have so many of their minutes where they set up the euro.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.320]  They brag, they created the brain trust in 54
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.960]  with the trade agreements, Treaty of Rome, Treaty of London,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.720]  and then later the votes to hoodwink people
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:25.480]  into this undemocratic system where the EU bureaucrats are above the law.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.760]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.960]  I mean, Alex, even as prominent and important a person as you are,
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.080]  I'm sure you'd find it difficult to get 10 minutes in George Osborne's diary.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:33.720]  Absolutely.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:37.000]  But he can come here and spend two or three days away from his desk,
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.360]  away from his onerous responsibilities and spend it.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.880]  He wouldn't do that unless it was important
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.640]  and neither would any of these other people.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.640]  So it must be very important or they wouldn't do it.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.720]  I don't believe it's just a talking shop.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.240]  These people don't have time to waste.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  They will only do it if it's significant
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.720]  and there's a real reason for doing it.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.520]  This is the last question.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.400]  I know you've got to go.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.040]  It's just so amazing to talk to a member of the EU parliament
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.560]  who's exposing it from the inside.
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.600]  Looking at this whole event, every time the BBC or the London Telegraph
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.680]  or any of them come up and talk to me or they talk to you,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.920]  they say, are you a conspiracy theorist?
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.080]  For a long time they said this didn't even exist.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.760]  Now we force them to report it.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.960]  And then we're somehow bad that we're wanting to know
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.840]  what policy is being made in there by this shadowy group
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.760]  and we have WikiLeaks documents from Bilderberg.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.000]  They've confirmed a reel where Kissinger says,
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.880]  illegal we do immediately, unconstitutional takes longer.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.520]  I mean, this is a guy known for war crimes.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.160]  Yeah.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.840]  I'm sorry, I've forgotten what your question was there.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:31.240]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:36.280]  What do you say about them using that throwaway term of conspiracy theft?
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.360]  Well, I say, what's the definition of a conspiracy?
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.240]  It's two or more people meeting in secret to achieve an end
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.920]  which might be illegal or illegal.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.640]  So the strict use of the word is a conspiracy
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.640]  because we don't know what they're talking about
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.160]  unless they have no objective at all
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.760]  and it's just a friendly chat over a cup of tea
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.200]  which none of us believe.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.000]  And I think the bigger conspiracy in inverted commas
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.600]  has been the fact that the media haven't spoken about this for 59 years.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:05.640]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with Supernatural Silver,
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:10.680]  a non-toxic disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally.
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:13.720]  It helps the immune system by killing the bacteria,
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.520]  viruses and mold that cause disease.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.440]  This helps to reduce the workload of your already overworked immune system
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.600]  and allows the immune system to refocus its energy and recharge.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.680]  Supernatural Silver can help combat over 300 different conditions
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.920]  and it has the ability to kill over 143 types of bacteria, viruses, mold and yeast.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.800]  Supernatural Silver's patented technology includes advanced scientific research

[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:03.560]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoods Direct.
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.720]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.000]  right smack dab in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.320]  I know that thousands of you, like us,
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.080]  are frustrated with not being able to help those who have lost so much
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.440]  and are in so much pain.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440]  We can't stand idly by.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:24.520]  Food is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.560]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.280]  in providing food in this desperate time of need.

[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.680]  lunch and dinner for a whole week for one adult valued at $60.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.600]  Your $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need.

[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.960]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.460]  Thank you.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:03.480]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.720]  But if you don't have a home security system,
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.560]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.920]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.320]  The empire is on the run.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.320]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.680]  We have Alex now live on the line from London.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.280]  Just want to mention one last thing here,
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:41.080]  and that is the Pro Pure special for Bilderberg, 15% off.

[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.360]  but it funds our operation.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.640]  So absolutely last day to get 50% off the lowest price on Pro Pure at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.760]  But I'm on cell phone now.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.760]  We did great videos, guys, from Astudio here in London,
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:14.200]  but I never got back to our makeshift studio,
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.000]  so I apologize to listeners and affiliates for that.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.920]  But regardless, a lot of key info.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.040]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.480]  Why do we want to expose shadow government?
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:26.120]  Why do we want to expose shadowy corporate interests
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.720]  that are anti-free-market coming in and lobbying and taking over our governments?
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.400]  Because if we ever identify that fraud, which we've done,
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.160]  and expose that the corporate media, the globalist media,
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.680]  has lied to the public about this, it's game over.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.040]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:49.000]  I had the police, the senior police, women, men coming over saying,
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.960]  I want to hug you, with tears in their eyes saying,
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.520]  we've heard your speech, we know what's going on,
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:57.880]  we've been listening to you for years, we understand we're not bad,
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:48:59.160]  we don't like what's happening.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.720]  And it's like beef or vendetta in the final scene or something.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  Where, I mean, it's like what happened in Chilalescu, Romania.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.120]  That's why they want to go to robots and drones,
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.840]  because they will follow their robotic criminal democratic directive.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.000]  That's why Google's merging with Bilderberg.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.200]  And that's why they've been saying, there's no CFR,
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.560]  there's no New World Order, the Federal Reserve isn't private,
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.520]  fluoride's good for you, vaccines are good for you,
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.600]  the government loves you.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:32.040]  Yeah, their average low-level person in government is a nice person.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.160]  They're just dependent on the system like everybody else,
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.040]  but the people at the top have an evil agenda and they sugarcoat their interests.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.600]  It's a good sounding cover story, but if you just look at it from another angle,
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.480]  you see it all.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.760]  And now we learn the NSA is spying on conservative and libertarian groups.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.040]  Of course it is.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:57.720]  Of course the Democratic Party is a complete collectivist mafia.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.920]  They're authoritarian.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:01.480]  The Republicans are a bunch of power-hungry globalists as well,
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.600]  but the Democrats, worldwide, they've used so-called liberals to get their agendas through.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.840]  They're the tip of the spear and the takeout of it.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.440]  And we, the people, are waking up toward a dangerous crossroads
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.480]  because if all this comes down and then we don't put the pendulum back,
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.280]  it just sets the precedent that they get away with everything.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.960]  So here's what I want to say about Goldenberg.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.560]  I'll be able to collect my thoughts.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:24.520]  I'm very tired.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.080]  I was on Coast to Coast AM with John B. Wells last week.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.360]  I'm three hours late.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.040]  I've been on the BBC, everywhere else.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:30.920]  I'm very exhausted.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.960]  I'm not complaining.
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.320]  I'm just a little bit dingy here.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.040]  So is my incredible crew, Richard Reeves,
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.880]  of course, Paul Watson, the entire crew back there,
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.480]  the studio, everybody, Leanne McAdoo here with us, everybody.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:45.400]  And you, the listeners supporting us.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we told you last Wednesday
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:53.800]  that government sources told us Goldenberg was going to go public with statements.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:57.800]  Not one, but two of them went on TV trying to whitewash things.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.520]  The Treasury Secretary over here, the exchequer,
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:09.880]  the shadow secretary, and one other big one trying to whitewash it.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:15.560]  So that shows the kind of sources we had where we had police and MI5.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:16.440]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.720]  MI5 connected.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:19.080]  We'll just leave it at that.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.640]  We have sources inside the hotel.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.640]  We have sources in the parliament.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.200]  We have sources in the EU parliament.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:28.760]  People know now the EU plan.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.280]  Yes, it sounds crazy.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:31.240]  History's crazy.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:33.240]  A Nazi plan, the EU.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:33.960]  Don't look it up.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.920]  Treaty of Rome, Treaty of Britain after World War II.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.080]  They took that plan.
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:40.600]  They go, oh, this is going to work great.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.040]  It's like they took the Nazi plan for NASA, the Nazi plan for the CIA.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:49.000]  All of this stuff was an authoritarian dream of the globalist.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.800]  And this is so historical what's happening.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.480]  So pray for us because in closing,
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.360]  I'm going to let David close out the show with all the news, each guy.
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.240]  And then we're going to have tomorrow,
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.280]  we're going to have Mike Adams, and he does an incredible job as well,
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.600]  with David Diney, Ari Jackson coming in with this.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.120]  But I'm back Tuesday.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:07.960]  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.920]  I'm going to sleep a few hours ago on a plane early in the morning and fly in.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.560]  But here's the issue.
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.200]  They've had Bill O'Reilly on Fox.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.680]  They've had CNN with their people.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:21.160]  They've had MSNBC with Rachel Maddow.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.520]  And Glenn Mack and everybody the last two weeks come out and do stuff like play a clip of me
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:29.480]  yelling but not even saying what I'm saying and saying hate speech.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.120]  It needs to be shut down on Fox News.
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.640]  And then Beck did some weird thing.
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.720]  And I've already said I'm not going to attack that.
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.160]  I turned the other cheek.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:42.840]  He came out four days ago and said, Alex Jones's people are death threatening.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:45.560]  You can say the Dalai Lama's people are death threatening.
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:48.120]  I mean, anybody can send an email saying that.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:51.880]  And then how I'm evil and I'm bad and I'm dangerous and all.
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:58.280]  Joining with Rachel Maddow, they're scared, folks, because you'll never see
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.880]  Bilderberg in our media until now because you're fired if you cover.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.000]  OK, they want to have a managed left and right.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.840]  They want to take this country over.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.120]  They're anti free market.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.320]  They're anti human.
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:11.240]  I'm a libertarian constitutional.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:14.600]  And the left thinks big government's going to save them.
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.640]  And all they do is create a monster that's special under control.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:20.680]  The so-called right thinks all corporations are angels.
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:25.240]  When they're predatory corporations, Roman capitalists, they're the enemy.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.480]  America, the choice is down before you.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.920]  The government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:29.960]  They're spying on you.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.880]  They ship the narcotics in.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:34.040]  They do all this stuff on record.
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.640]  I mean, what happened when they got caught shipping the opium in five years ago?
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:41.960]  They just want Fox CNN, BBC and said, OK, we grow the opium and ship it in.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.560]  Now if you catch it with it, you're going to jail.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.440]  I mean, because the troops were going public.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:47.960]  They loaded almost never been hiding now.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:52.280]  C-130 land, everyone's distributed, major banks wanted the money.
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.360]  Comes out in the news, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:59.160]  Or they go, oh, you made 300 billion plus in Wachovia, Wells Fargo off.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:02.200]  You pay $111 million fine.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:06.120]  But if I robbed a bank for a million bucks, you know, taking $4,000 out of the bag as
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:07.320]  a tip for the cops.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.440]  Organized crime is out of control.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.080]  Major corporations, the Fortune 100 are organized crime by and large.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.760]  And if they're not organized crime, the globalists are trying to shut them down and take them
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:22.040]  over like a few privately held corporations in this country.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.400]  They don't control.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:25.880]  It's mafia, plain and simple.
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:28.680]  And I am here in defiance of them.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:31.240]  And yes, they ask on BBC, why aren't you dead?
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:31.960]  I've been attacked.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.840]  I've been death-threaded.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.360]  I've been everything but real death threats.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.680]  But they tell you they're listening to your phones and tell you what you were talking
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.160]  about.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.320]  But my children have no future if we don't turn this around.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.840]  None of us have any future.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.080]  So I salute everybody who loves freedom.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.440]  Does this mean I have all the answers?
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:46.920]  No.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.520]  But I have a good heart and I have good will towards people.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.120]  And I want a future for humanity.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:53.480]  And I love humanity.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:55:00.600]  And I love having a fair and level playing field and real equity for everybody and a
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.280]  future and due process.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.400]  I want justice.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.360]  I want America and the ideas of true liberty back.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:10.360]  And all of us working for that, instead of being cynical, can do it.
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:14.360]  So we officially closed out the big coverage of Bilderberg 2013.
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:19.240]  It's a devastating victory for humanity as we expose the shadow government.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.240]  Knowing the enemy, as G.I. Joe said, is half the battle.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.240]  Knowing the truth, that's why they keep you in the dark and treat you like they're
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.040]  morons.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.960]  But humanity's awakening.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.240]  That's this great time of threat.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.840]  David Dyer is the truth.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:33.400]  Great job.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.560]  Folks, continue to follow infoatwars.com, prisonplanet.com, the backup.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.240]  Call us on Twitter, Real Alex Jones, get to June Magazine before it spells out infoatwars.com.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:43.880]  Support us.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.680]  Wake others up.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:49.080]  Get prisonplanet.tv subscriptions.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.000]  One membership, five down in front of a month.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.280]  There's 11 memberships.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.680]  Operation Sleeping Giant.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:58.840]  We've got Operation Fall Revere, $100,000 contest about to be announced.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:55:59.720]  God bless you all.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.000]  David Knight, take us out.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.760]  That's right, Alex.
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.920]  What you said is we're at a very important juncture right now as we see all these different
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.360]  scandals being released.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:11.720]  First, we had one day, we had their leak of Verizon.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.960]  We found out that the government was tracking all Verizon customers.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.320]  Don't tell me that they've got reasonable cause to look at millions of subscribers.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.680]  And that's just one of the carriers.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:25.480]  We know now that they're doing many, many of those orders.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:30.280]  If you look at the number of that order, you know that they had at least 80 or 90 other
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:31.800]  orders already that year.
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.080]  And the question is, what are we going to do about it?
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.680]  After that happened, we also found out that they were looking at everybody's data.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:43.560]  Then we found out just recently that there is now a Justice Department is fighting the
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.840]  release of a secret court opinion that finds their own actions unconstitutional.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.840]  Now, this is in the midst of revelations that the government has conducted extensive top
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.680]  secret surveillance operations.
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:57:00.440]  We find out the Justice Department is trying to keep secret an 86 page court opinion that
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:04.040]  determined that the government had violated the spirit of federal surveillance laws engaged
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.080]  in unconstitutional spying.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:06.280]  Yeah, no doubt.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:09.160]  And the interesting thing is, like Alex said, what are we going to do about this?
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.640]  If we don't do anything about it at this critical juncture, then what it does is it normalizes
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.160]  these criminal practices.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.680]  We do see, as Politico is reporting, that there's mounting concern over NSA and Congress.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.680]  Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee is shopping around bills that would address portions of
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.240]  this.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.400]  But the question is, why would they obey this law?
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.440]  Where are the senators and congressmen who are going to lock these people up?
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.520]  Not just pass another law they're going to disobey.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.280]  They ignore the Constitution.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.200]  They ignore the FISA Act.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.160]  Why would they pay attention to any more restrictions on them?
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.320]  We need to take some of these people and as Rand Paul said, put them in jail where they
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.040]  belong.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.960]  And that may go to the highest level of government, should go to the highest level of government.
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:58:02.600]  Join us tomorrow.
