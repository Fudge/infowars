[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:24.160 --> 00:29.760]  all right Ted Anderson's with us another five minutes and Ted let me just have
[00:29.760 --> 00:37.880]  you back on let me just have you back on for the whole third hour if you can do
[00:37.880 --> 00:42.240]  it to actually get into monetary issues and not just sit here and pitch gold and
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.940]  silver and again we pitch things we believe in which then funds our
[00:45.940 --> 00:50.200]  operation but that's why I get so excited about all this because I believe in
[00:50.200 --> 00:55.280]  it I just called Ted last week and Ted you've been so busy I asked what you
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.800]  thought the best of the radio specials were you were gonna call me back it was
[00:57.800 --> 01:01.240]  gonna get a few gold coins and silver and Ted you didn't call me back so I
[01:01.240 --> 01:05.360]  need to call one of your brokers don't know yeah well no we'll get it done but
[01:05.360 --> 01:10.920]  I can tell you right now watching the charts yesterday silver and gold both it
[01:10.920 --> 01:15.600]  just it was just coming along and going and then all of a sudden a spike upward
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.400]  I mean to have a $46 increase in gold in one day and about $4.60 in silver in
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.240]  one day are you kidding me and that's just quantitative easing that's just the
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.560]  news breaking the FOMC Open Market Committee comes out and they decide
[01:31.560 --> 01:34.760]  that they're gonna get into this quantitative easing but like you say
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.120]  it's not called QE3 the reason why that is is because QE2 had an end date to it
[01:40.120 --> 01:43.840]  and a goal and this is how much we're gonna do this is open-ended quantitative
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.800]  easing they said that we're gonna continue to print more money and to get
[01:47.800 --> 01:51.320]  the printing presses rolling until they see the economic results that they're
[01:51.320 --> 01:56.120]  looking for and basically it's just an open-ended thing we're heading off
[01:56.120 --> 02:00.760]  of a cliff Alex and if people aren't smart enough to get out of paper I mean
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.360]  I don't care find you know buy buy storeable foods I don't care what you
[02:05.360 --> 02:10.240]  buy but get yourself get yourself out of the the you predicted this Porter
[02:10.240 --> 02:16.280]  Stansbury predicted it Gerald Salente predicted it they all predicted it we all
[02:16.280 --> 02:21.320]  predicted it and it means curtains in fact I have a clip of Ron Paul here this
[02:21.320 --> 02:26.760]  is Ron Paul last night saying we should be panicking over this and Ron Paul's
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.120]  never talked like that this means inflation and because it's not targeted
[02:33.120 --> 02:38.600]  as a real turning up the printing presses that at least helps the people
[02:38.600 --> 02:43.880]  on one level this is all pointed at the ultra rich it's gonna be a double whammy
[02:43.880 --> 02:48.160]  here's Ron Paul the one thing that Bernanke has not achieved that frustrates
[02:48.160 --> 02:52.360]  him I can tell is he gets no economic growth he doesn't do anything with the
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.560]  unemployment numbers and from my viewpoint I think the country should
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.240]  have panicked over the fact of what the Fed is saying that we've lost control the
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.080]  only thing we have left is massively creating new money out of thin air which
[03:06.080 --> 03:09.640]  hasn't worked before and it's not going to work this time you know Ted I'm gonna
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.520]  be honest you know me privately I'm very calm very intellectual very focused
[03:13.520 --> 03:17.320]  until I get on air and then I turn into the wild man because I get so angry
[03:17.320 --> 03:24.040]  about this stuff but I don't do it on purpose but intellectually this has been
[03:24.040 --> 03:30.480]  like a bomb being dropped on us and I'm so angry that I even sarcastically made
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.600]  fun of the fake UT bomb threat for the first 45 minutes of the show instead of
[03:35.600 --> 03:40.600]  really talking about the full magnitude of this unlimited QE I mean but but but
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.440]  as Ron Paul just said this means that this is all they've got and they're
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.320]  gonna use it to transfer wealth you know Ron Paul says they're trying to fix it
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.880]  look the globalist admit they've engineered this so it's time to stop
[03:53.880 --> 03:57.720]  saying they don't know what they're doing they're in control they run a global
[03:57.720 --> 04:01.560]  government they know exactly what they're doing Ted I'm not knocking Ron
[04:01.560 --> 04:04.280]  Paul here but you know he gives them this thing that they don't know what
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.120]  they're doing I've been saying for over a decade this was coming exactly as it
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.120]  has George Humphrey's been saying it for 14 years economist friend of mine this
[04:12.120 --> 04:15.640]  is an engineered collapse Ted I know you've been you've been talking about
[04:15.640 --> 04:21.320]  that and I've alluded to that as well the very system that set up creates debt
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.400]  you know money from debt is going to just mean more debt as the economy grows
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.280]  we're gonna get further into the whole they hold the debt listen can you do a
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.480]  full hour with this intake calls yeah we'll go ahead and do that on the third
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.320]  hour I'll see you back in 55 minutes Ted all right sounds good folks give
[04:36.320 --> 04:40.040]  minus resources a call ask them about radio specials that's where I get my
[04:40.040 --> 04:44.880]  gold and silver and again I bought gold at $260 an ounce I didn't sell it
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.600]  when it hit 2000 when it dropped down to 1650 I didn't sell sending with silver
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.560]  I bought silver at $5 an ounce when it got up to 40 45 50 bucks an ounce I
[04:54.560 --> 04:58.400]  didn't sell any of it when it went down I didn't sell it because I understand
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.760]  what's happened sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison

[08:41.120 --> 08:49.560]  a new world order well I tell you we are really excited to have this fellow on
[08:49.560 --> 08:57.600]  because last year or so he has exploded on the scene with Fox 19 television and
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.560]  he's also worked at other TV stations around the country and he just
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.680]  absolutely knocks it out of the park on pro-second amendment stuff on covering
[09:07.680 --> 09:11.760]  how Ron Paul the Liberty Movement were shafted by the Republican establishment
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.000]  he got an interview with with President Obama last week that we're gonna play a
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.480]  clip of later where he really nails him down on the NDAA and secret arrest of
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.960]  American citizens the byway of federal court two days ago did a permanent
[09:26.960 --> 09:29.600]  injunction of course we had Chris Hedges on the Pulitzer Prize winning
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.000]  journalist who was part of that suit now Obama is appealing to the Supreme Court
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.480]  he also has looked at some of the anomalies of the shootings there in
[09:41.480 --> 09:50.120]  Colorado so basically he's like a professional focused you know kind of
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.560]  new style Alex Jones which which which I love we need more people that have
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.080]  courage and I think this guy's going places let me tell you because he's got
[09:59.080 --> 10:04.200]  it all and it is so exciting to see reporters like this now I'll say this I
[10:04.200 --> 10:10.800]  remember Bill O'Reilly on Fox television 13 years ago interviewing people like
[10:10.800 --> 10:15.680]  Tony Brown about the Illuminati in the New World Order and I saw him on extra
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.720]  was it hard copy 20 something years ago we have the tape we played it exposing
[10:19.720 --> 10:26.600]  how the government and E Howard Hunt basically killed JFK so I hope that
[10:26.600 --> 10:31.320]  Ben Swan of you know ends up on national television doesn't turn over to the
[10:31.320 --> 10:35.840]  dark side like like Bill O'Reilly but but I got to tell you it's just great to
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.080]  have him on and know there's other people out there in fact if you're a radio
[10:39.080 --> 10:42.560]  listener if you could see him we bring him up on Skype you know who I'm talking
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.880]  about but in a few minutes I will play some clips and you'll know who we're
[10:46.880 --> 10:52.280]  talking about but Ben it is great to have you on with us here today Alex
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.000]  thanks for having me I appreciate it so tell us about your awakening I mean how
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.800]  they allow you in mainstream television to tell the truth you know a lot of
[11:02.800 --> 11:05.880]  people are asking that question and how we get to cover the things that we do
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.440]  and I just I'm really blessed I work at a TV station that is not owned by Fox
[11:10.440 --> 11:13.840]  we're a Fox affiliate and because of that a lot of people assume that we're
[11:13.840 --> 11:18.200]  owned by Fox we're not we're owned by Ray Kong media and and I work for guys
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.800]  who are just interested in getting out factual information and so we've had a
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.400]  tremendous response I think the response that we've gotten from people has
[11:25.400 --> 11:30.640]  been just beyond expectation far above and beyond expectation and people are
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.320]  really hungry for it they're hungry for someone who will look beyond you know
[11:34.320 --> 11:38.520]  the typical mainstream narrative and obviously I mean this is no surprise to
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.560]  you because clearly you know the the issue with alternative media is it is
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.240]  growing so fast right now versus what's happening with national media or
[11:47.240 --> 11:50.560]  mainstream media which is essentially dying right now and there's a reason for
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.400]  that I mean people have already heard all these same types of narratives before
[11:55.400 --> 11:57.880]  and they're tired of them and they're moving beyond them and so we're
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.440]  fortunate to be kind of a bridge I think between alternative media and
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.040]  mainstream media by the way I should add they give you leeway because you have
[12:06.040 --> 12:12.760]  won both the Edward R. Murrow award and two Emmys that you got I guess reporting
[12:12.760 --> 12:18.120]  from Texas so so I mean I mean you are quite the journalist and so you're
[12:18.120 --> 12:22.600]  actually really doing real research it's just it's amazing and again mainstream
[12:22.600 --> 12:28.280]  media would still be dominant if people like you were on the national scene how
[12:28.280 --> 12:32.080]  long have you been there in Cincinnati for about a year and a half just just a
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.040]  little over a year and a half and about two to three months after I came to the
[12:37.040 --> 12:41.040]  station we had this idea that we were gonna try something different because it
[12:41.040 --> 12:45.080]  was time to kind of rebrand ourselves a little bit we move towards a balanced
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.760]  news brand which again sounds very much like the Fox brand and so there are
[12:49.760 --> 12:52.840]  advantages to that but then there are some disadvantages because there are some
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.000]  people who go into it automatically thinking well you're just you know
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.440]  little mini Fox news and part of the call that balanced brand was to do this
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.280]  segment called reality check where we'd look beyond headlines and actually hold
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.280]  politicians accountable I'm not sure my boss has realized how accountable we were
[13:09.280 --> 13:12.880]  gonna hold them but so far they've been extremely supportive of it and we're
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.360]  doing our best to get out there and get to the facts how did you get the Obama
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.280]  interview and then give us some of the behind the scenes we're gonna play a
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.240]  clip of it in a moment but I mean pretty amazing out of a sea of journalists and
[13:25.240 --> 13:29.160]  so-called mainstream media no one will ever ask him a hard question we know now
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.440]  for the first time ever they're vetting the questions beforehand they're in the
[13:33.440 --> 13:39.320]  press briefing room and also when Obama goes out and gives official press
[13:39.320 --> 13:44.040]  conferences you obviously got off script there and actually did your job well
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.160]  you know with the Obama interview and it's pretty simple I mean he's been very
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.920]  good about doing these interviews with local media everywhere he goes and it's
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.040]  actually a very good strategy because but you wind up having our reporters who
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.800]  go out and ask a number of questions typically they're locally focused so in
[14:01.800 --> 14:05.240]  the case of Ohio they'll ask about the auto industry they're gonna ask about
[14:05.240 --> 14:08.680]  jobs in Ohio the economy which is actually doing better than a lot of
[14:08.680 --> 14:11.200]  places in the nation and so it's really a good place for him to do those
[14:11.200 --> 14:16.120]  interviews but he does them everywhere and we were just next on the list and as
[14:16.120 --> 14:19.280]  we went down the list and they gave us the call and said you know send somebody
[14:19.280 --> 14:23.720]  up and it was us I think one of the advantages that I had was the week before
[14:23.720 --> 14:29.000]  we had done a one-on-one with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan together and when we sat
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.600]  down with them you know we weren't easy on them and one of the questions we asked
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.080]  Romney about was how you know his campaign along with the RNC had worked
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.560]  to decrudential and essentially disenfranchise all of these Republican
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.400]  delegates from the state of Maine and so we were hard on Romney and I think that
[14:46.400 --> 14:49.680]  they suspected I don't know this but I think they suspected we would probably
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.640]  not be as hard on the president because as you know Alex I mean that's the way
[14:53.640 --> 14:57.120]  media works in this country you either support one side and then attack the
[14:57.120 --> 15:02.560]  other or vice versa so you know they allowed us to come in and do the interview
[15:02.560 --> 15:06.040]  they put no prerequisites on it just told us you have five minutes and when
[15:06.040 --> 15:10.400]  you're five minutes is up you know you're done and so we went from there
[15:10.400 --> 15:14.680]  incredible we're gonna play a clip of that right now in fact here it is from
[15:14.680 --> 15:19.000]  the intro of the news piece folks can go to Fox19.com and watch the whole thing
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.680]  and I should add other Fox affiliates around the country who are on YouTube
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.440]  are lucky to get a few thousand views even a big story your stories are
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.120]  getting hundreds of thousands and millions of views again showing that
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.080]  the future is real reporting real questions there's no debate the NDA is
[15:37.080 --> 15:40.640]  unconstitutional the courts have already ruled it there's no debate it's super
[15:40.640 --> 15:44.600]  scary right out of Nazi Germany so media though just acts like oh we're gonna
[15:44.600 --> 15:50.160]  be you know non-biased well I mean a ham sandwich is a ham sandwich a draconian
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.080]  piece of legislation is draconian and that's the end of it I mean you have to
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.080]  report the facts you've done that and the media can take a cue from this here
[15:59.080 --> 16:02.600]  it is. Mr. President first of all thank you for taking the time to talk with us.
[16:02.600 --> 16:06.640]  When you signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law you issued a
[16:06.640 --> 16:09.760]  signing statement at that time that said you would not use that power for
[16:09.760 --> 16:12.640]  indefinite detention on Americans you understood the concerns that people had
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.320]  a judge earlier this year issued that the administration couldn't use those
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.960]  powers because it's unconstitutional so why are the government's own lawyers
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.560]  fighting that judges order the injunction in particular. Well look the
[16:25.560 --> 16:29.200]  basic principle here is number one my first job is to keep the American people
[16:29.200 --> 16:35.000]  safe number two we've got to do it in a way that respects our values and our
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.920]  traditions of rule of law that's why I ban torture that's why I've argued that
[16:40.920 --> 16:45.480]  we should actually close Guantanamo but I've also said that you know we've got
[16:45.480 --> 16:52.000]  some bad guys who are down there who we may not be able to try in a traditional
[16:52.000 --> 16:58.200]  court but have pledged to try to hurt Americans and so that's something that
[16:58.200 --> 17:01.240]  we inherited that we're dealing with and it's complicated on the other hand what
[17:01.240 --> 17:06.440]  I also said was a US citizen can never be subject to that kind of detention
[17:06.440 --> 17:12.120]  Congress disagree with me and I didn't want us to not be able to finance our
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.120]  military and pay our soldiers and our troops so I signed the bill but what I
[17:16.120 --> 17:21.920]  also said was look that I'm never going to use this power and you know what I
[17:21.920 --> 17:27.440]  would suspect is that the courts are going to agree with us over the long term
[17:27.440 --> 17:30.720]  that that is not something that you can use when it comes to US citizens. Well let
[17:30.720 --> 17:33.840]  me ask you then also about the so-called presidential kill list that's gotten a
[17:33.840 --> 17:36.760]  lot of attention and this this list of folks who have been targeted for
[17:36.760 --> 17:40.240]  assassination and on that list have been US citizens who have not been afforded
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.000]  trial including Anwar Awa. Let's stop right there. How do you as president or
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.600]  any president for that matter? Yeah we've got Anwar Awaaki who dined secretly at
[17:48.600 --> 17:54.520]  the Pentagon we've got all that going on and we've got the fact that Obama it
[17:54.520 --> 17:59.800]  turns out demanded that it be added to the bill the indebted detention of
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.520]  Americans and he's got his Justice Department fighting to defend the
[18:04.520 --> 18:09.800]  legislation of the NDAA and his signing of it and then he just sat there Ben and
[18:09.800 --> 18:16.040]  told you that oh he knew that the courts would overturn it I mean that that makes
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.200]  Bill Clinton look like he's honest. Well you know look this story especially on
[18:22.200 --> 18:25.920]  the kill list has gotten so much attention nationally and to the point
[18:25.920 --> 18:29.400]  where it was picked up by the Atlantic and Huffington Post and a lot of liberal
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.480]  even the UK Guardian liberal publications ran that interview and it was
[18:33.480 --> 18:37.960]  really interesting to me to go through and to read the comment section not so
[18:37.960 --> 18:40.480]  much what they were writing but the comment section afterward there were a
[18:40.480 --> 18:43.360]  couple of things that were very interesting there because I think you
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.240]  alluded to a minute ago we're not really breaking ground here in terms of
[18:46.240 --> 18:51.240]  those questions and those questions are not conspiratorial they're not you know
[18:51.240 --> 18:55.080]  these kind of often the weeds questions this is stuff that's pretty much out
[18:55.080 --> 18:58.640]  there and they're it's pretty easy to find any reporter can find it the
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.840]  discussion on the NDAA or the kill list or the situation with our Lockheed the
[19:02.840 --> 19:07.080]  problem is I believe the problem it really stems from the fact that media
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.840]  won't talk about these things because it does require some real effort to dig
[19:11.840 --> 19:16.360]  into it I got a couple of interviews with reporters who asked me about why
[19:16.360 --> 19:19.280]  would you ask those questions and and how could you even ask that I mean how
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.480]  would you even have the background on it well because we've been covering it for
[19:22.480 --> 19:25.800]  a year we've covered all of these issues you mentioned about the Obama
[19:25.800 --> 19:29.480]  administration asking for it we've covered extensively that statement by Carl
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.200]  Levin all I'll say I'll tell you what stay there stay there we're gonna come
[19:34.200 --> 19:37.880]  right back after break and continue yeah the senator Carl Levin others came out
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.560]  and said hey don't blame us for this you asked for this and then they released
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.960]  the letter I mean the whole time Obama says I don't want it and then he says
[19:46.960 --> 19:53.480]  don't worry I'll veto it so opposition can't form and then he gets it past and
[19:53.480 --> 19:58.000]  then he says I won't sign it but then he does I mean this is incredible deception
[19:58.000 --> 20:04.160]  stay there Ben Swan hi there my name is Frank Bates what I'm about to tell you
[20:04.160 --> 20:08.360]  in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble I just created a free

[24:12.680 --> 24:19.160]  Ohio and every week makes national news because he covers hardcore issues and
[24:19.160 --> 24:22.640]  does his research I think you were alluding before he went to break their
[24:22.640 --> 24:27.400]  been that the media kind of comes to you and is like how do you know this how do
[24:27.400 --> 24:31.480]  you it's almost like you're reading a book that's weird I've had other media
[24:31.480 --> 24:35.160]  ask me questions like how do you know all this stuff I'm like well I'm into the
[24:35.160 --> 24:38.600]  news I'm into the information so elaborate on that and then yeah I
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.840]  continue on the point you were getting into with Obama saying well you know I
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.920]  knew courts would overthrow it when it turns out he was the one his White House
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.920]  demanding that the indefinite attention for citizens be in there you're right
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.480]  well absolutely and let me just comment on that second part first because you'll
[24:56.480 --> 24:59.000]  notice in the interview that we did with them you know you got five minutes so
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.920]  there's not a whole lot of time if you want to fight over one subject you're
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.160]  not gonna get much else in there and so what we choose to do because of the
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.200]  segment we do with reality check and the way it's built out you know really is
[25:08.200 --> 25:11.720]  perfect for going in you ask the question he gives the answer but we don't
[25:11.720 --> 25:14.880]  leave it at that and that's what so much national media does now it's that he
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.640]  said she said I asked the question you give the answer and we're done but we
[25:18.640 --> 25:21.480]  do it say okay I'll ask the question you give the answer and then we're gonna go
[25:21.480 --> 25:23.960]  back and fact check your answer and if you're wrong we're gonna say you were
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.960]  wrong if you're not being honest we're gonna say you're not being honest so
[25:27.960 --> 25:31.760]  what we saw in that case is he never he never directly addresses the second
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.920]  part of my question which was why are your own lawyers fighting that injunction
[25:36.920 --> 25:40.760]  which of course as you just mentioned that question is now dated because as of
[25:40.760 --> 25:45.360]  yesterday they're now fighting the overall striking down of the indefinite
[25:45.360 --> 25:49.760]  disengaging clause and they are appealing that ruling so if the president is
[25:49.760 --> 25:53.680]  honest when he says we always knew we struck down we believe that it would go
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.000]  to the courts we believe the courts would side with us show me how that's
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.040]  siding with you if you're the one fighting it regardless you know as you
[26:01.040 --> 26:04.360]  you mentioned a minute ago with media people keep asking well how do you know
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.040]  all this stuff and really there are two things number one is as you as you
[26:08.040 --> 26:11.160]  mentioned you just have to do a little bit of research and there's so much of
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.280]  this stuff out there and again it's because of the internet it's because of
[26:14.280 --> 26:19.080]  alternative media and also look listen I've got brilliant brilliant people who
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.840]  follow me on Facebook on Twitter I mean the people who I call themselves
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.840]  followers or fans that's the term that Facebook uses right I'm fans of theirs
[26:28.840 --> 26:32.600]  I'm a huge fan of theirs because they're so smart and they have so much
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.080]  information and they just constantly are feeding back into me a lot of
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.560]  information and and what's going on in the world and did you know this and did
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.360]  you know this and I feel like they've been helping me to gain an education
[26:42.360 --> 26:45.800]  because there's so much stuff out there and they're just not hoping to draw it
[26:45.800 --> 26:53.840]  well said man I tell you it is so refreshing being to see somebody
[26:53.840 --> 27:01.560]  professionally get up there and I told Chris Hedges this last week because I'm
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.280]  not liberal or conservative I'm just about truth and justice and freedom
[27:04.280 --> 27:07.880]  because I love my wife and my children I want a future it's refreshing to have
[27:07.880 --> 27:13.000]  somebody like Chris Hedges out there fighting the NDA with his lawsuit and
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.800]  winning and it's and it's refreshing to see somebody like you well spoken
[27:17.800 --> 27:22.360]  focused handsome getting the word out and reaching millions from one little TV
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.240]  station because it gives me hope that there are going to be other people out
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.520]  there that can do a better job than I can that's what I told Chris Hedges I
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.840]  mean we all have our own tools in the fight for liberty it's just it's great
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.880]  now I'm wondering who else is going to step up who else is going to take action
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.640]  because all that evil needs to flourish is that good men and women do nothing and
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.680]  so I salute what you're doing and the point you make about what your listeners
[27:49.680 --> 27:53.640]  and viewers are saying following the points they give you it's incredible data
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.920]  it's it's like the comments under the stories you were alluding to the
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.760]  amazing points they're making and you see everywhere whether it's a right-wing
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.040]  site or a left-wing site with those bias the comments more and more aren't left
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.920] -wing or right-wing they're like hey we see through this right right well that's
[28:10.920 --> 28:13.600]  absolutely true and and what was exciting about like for instance the
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.720]  Huffington Post is a good example on the on the Huffpo article if you read the
[28:17.720 --> 28:21.720]  comments it was it was so interesting to hear people who are so used to this
[28:21.720 --> 28:25.520]  left-right paradigm that they couldn't even begin to fathom the idea so their
[28:25.520 --> 28:28.480]  first complaint is well you're from a Fox station so what you're asking the
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.720]  president about you know this kill list can't possibly be true secondly it's the
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.920]  same people in many cases who wanted Bush tried as a war criminal who want
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.960]  Cheney tried as a war criminal who give Obama a pass on his kill list and so it
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.480]  was really interesting that dynamic was they were really struggling through it
[28:46.480 --> 28:51.120]  and then of course you know I posted it on my social networking pages so that
[28:51.120 --> 28:54.480]  people can see it there go there and comment and what was exciting to me was
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.200]  some of our people when I say our I mean you know Liberty minded people start
[28:59.200 --> 29:02.200]  writing on there and actually we're winning some arguments and I think you
[29:02.200 --> 29:05.920]  can winning over some people's minds saying look yet you have to break through
[29:05.920 --> 29:09.400]  and shatter through that paradigm that says it's left versus right Republican
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.280]  versus Democrat because it's not it's Liberty versus oppression that's what
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.480]  the real issue is and I think people are beginning to see that Wow we're gonna
[29:16.480 --> 29:19.760]  go to break in a long 18-minute segment coming up I want to get into your
[29:19.760 --> 29:23.240]  favorite reports and what you're working on now and then open the phones up for
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.600]  your fans all over the United States and worldwide that watch your reality
[29:28.600 --> 29:32.160]  check just as soon as it comes out I know we do and I remember seeing about a
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.000]  year and a half ago I'm like man this is something different and then the reports
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.560]  just keep coming and then in hindsight they're so accurate it a breath of

[34:02.000 --> 34:06.600]  people saying other shooters and all the rest of it I mean this is what we need
[34:06.600 --> 34:10.680]  to talk about these are the questions I've got to ask you this not to you know
[34:10.680 --> 34:14.320]  not to promote my show or anything I'm just flattered by it my producer was
[34:14.320 --> 34:17.000]  telling me when he asked have you ever heard the Alex Jones show that you
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  indeed have heard of the show and do listen sometimes now I know as a
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.440]  journalist I'm more of a journalist slash commentator you know rabble rouser I
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.880]  wear a lot of hats around here but I'm just curious how did you stumble across
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.560]  my broadcast and how did it affect the different perspectives that you're
[34:34.560 --> 34:38.800]  bringing to your own show well I would say that that I knew of you because I'm
[34:38.800 --> 34:42.840]  from Texas and I always say you're down in Texas so now I'm from further west
[34:42.840 --> 34:47.680]  than you are but we that was aware of you and it hurt your name and then most
[34:47.680 --> 34:50.920]  of it really was it was very conspiratorial and and the guys in that
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.360]  job and so I didn't really know much about you and then once I've gotten more
[34:55.360 --> 34:58.840]  into into what we've been covering the last few months I had a lot of people
[34:58.840 --> 35:02.080]  who have said you know Alex Jones has covered a lot of these things and
[35:02.080 --> 35:04.480]  obviously there are people who are weary because as you said you're more of a
[35:04.480 --> 35:10.160]  commentator so in your case certainly it's more of a there's more opinion
[35:10.160 --> 35:13.920]  infused into it more more perspective infused into it which is fine I mean
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.360]  clearly you're doing what you do so I think that but I do think there's
[35:18.360 --> 35:20.880]  something very important about alternative media and one of the things
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.400]  that I think is impressive regardless of how people feel about you one way or
[35:24.400 --> 35:27.080]  the other because obviously you have many many fans out there and you got
[35:27.080 --> 35:32.560]  people who don't feel strongly about you or dislike you you know and that's not
[35:32.560 --> 35:35.960]  necessarily a bad place to be look I always tell people I would rather people
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.520]  love me or hate me but don't feel nothing about me because as soon as you're the
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.600]  guy that people feel nothing about then you're not accomplishing anything you
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.000]  know at least challenge challenge the narrative and challenge what people are
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.320]  thinking and challenge their minds and so I think you do a great job of that
[35:50.320 --> 35:53.360]  night and take my hand off to you for that well I just wanted to get your
[35:53.360 --> 35:57.720]  perspective because I again admire your courage and what you're doing I mean
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.320]  obviously you're a talented guy and I hope that it doesn't you know count
[36:02.320 --> 36:05.240]  against you with the power structure that you're telling the truth have you
[36:05.240 --> 36:08.600]  gotten any big national offers yet in the last year and a half that you've been
[36:08.600 --> 36:14.280]  knocking out of the park nope no in fact very very little talk from anyone
[36:14.280 --> 36:19.040]  higher up which is fine with me you know one of the things I don't ever want to
[36:19.040 --> 36:22.480]  do is I never want to look beyond where I'm at right now as I mentioned at the
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.240]  beginning of this I'm incredibly blessed to be doing what I'm doing and and to
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.560]  have the platform that I have and I will say that in the last year and a half my
[36:30.560 --> 36:36.920]  view of what you know national media is has completely changed and certainly my
[36:36.920 --> 36:40.320]  view of what it means to be a national voice because we're sitting here in
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.760]  little Cincinnati Ohio and yet we have a global voice right now and people in
[36:44.760 --> 36:48.760]  30 different countries are watching what we do and it's this little five minute
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.760]  segment and you know we do it three times a week yeah if I was Glenn back
[36:52.760 --> 36:56.560]  launching his new TV network back on television I would hire somebody like
[36:56.560 --> 37:01.200]  you and I think that'd probably be a perfect fit I mean Glenn Beck actually
[37:01.200 --> 37:04.560]  is in competition with me he thinks I'm not in competition with him I want to
[37:04.560 --> 37:07.920]  defeat the globalist there's no future but but the reason I brought up my
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.160]  shelf was I wanted to get into your view of the world because I know as a
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.800]  journalist you don't want to put any of those views out because then they could
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.040]  say oh well that's his bias but come on I mean tyranny is tyranny I mean it
[37:20.040 --> 37:24.480]  wouldn't be oh you have a bias in 1860 because you were against slavery and oh
[37:24.480 --> 37:28.080]  that's your opinion obviously it's the right position to be against slavery I
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.600]  mean some of these things are so clear what is your view of QE3 what is your
[37:32.600 --> 37:37.760]  view of the TSA all of this stuff I mean is it that the world's getting crazier
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.560]  that that's brought you closer to say my views well I here's what I think you
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.920]  know you asked about QE3 we're actually doing a piece on it next week to explain
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.040]  to people exactly how it works and what the design is behind it my issue is
[37:50.040 --> 37:55.160]  less about like for instance obviously I had very strong opinions but I think
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.080]  most people do my issue is more about making sure that I'm not going to
[37:59.080 --> 38:03.040]  necessarily try to sway someone else's opinion I just want their opinion to be
[38:03.040 --> 38:08.000]  based on fact not on fairy tale and I think what we see too often in modern
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.560]  media is that we're allowing people to buy into fairy tales we don't challenge
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.200]  you John Stewart does a hilarious bit making fun of the way that CNN does
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.280]  their whole we'll leave it there I don't know if you've ever seen it but they
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.080]  have this phrase we'll leave it there and he made fun of that one time and the
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.160]  fact that they say we'll leave it there on major issues that should be left there
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.840]  because you're not allowing people to go through this process of critical
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.000]  thinking and to say well what does this actually mean for my life so but Ben
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.240]  Bernanke announces yeah we're gonna go ahead move on with QE3 and it'll help
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.640]  the economy I would be willing to bet you that only one tenth of the population
[38:41.640 --> 38:45.960]  if even that has any clue as to what he's talking about has any clue at all
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.000]  maybe even maybe even you know one percent of the population really
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.880]  understands what I agree with you because I've talked to so many bankers
[38:52.880 --> 38:56.960]  business people even folks that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars they
[38:56.960 --> 39:01.600]  don't who are in finance they don't understand what this means right oh
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.520]  absolutely absolutely because there's so many different components to it you
[39:05.520 --> 39:08.040]  know you mentioned that we've been talking a lot about the issue in Libya
[39:08.040 --> 39:11.560]  what's going on over there right now and one of the reasons we're able to do
[39:11.560 --> 39:15.240]  that is because if you go all the way back to when we first started doing
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.200]  these one of the very first reality check segments we ever put together was
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.080]  about the fact that the US was getting involved in Libya and it didn't make
[39:23.080 --> 39:26.520]  sense as to why we were doing it the fact that we were involving ourselves
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.120]  without the declaration of war and now we're starting to see kind of the
[39:30.120 --> 39:33.280]  ramifications of that foreign policy what's it really about one of the things
[39:33.280 --> 39:35.920]  we're gonna move into in the next few weeks and I think people will be pretty
[39:35.920 --> 39:40.680]  interested in it is we're gonna start taking a look at the situation with the
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.160]  petrodollar and and what China is doing right now in terms of these refineries
[39:45.160 --> 39:48.640]  they're attempting to build in Saudi Arabia and in Egypt and ultimately what
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.440]  it's gonna mean if the petrodollar disappears and there's a new currency
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.000]  in which oil was bought and traded if that happens it means a change in the way
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.840]  of life for every American that people don't even see coming because nobody's
[40:00.840 --> 40:04.080]  talking about it in national media alternative media you guys are talking
[40:04.080 --> 40:10.480]  about it thank you mr. Edward Armuro absolutely on target right there that is
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.960]  so exciting to hear someone in mainstream news understand that and and the
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.040]  power structure knows this but it's at a very high technocratic level they're
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.880]  engineering this while while moving their assets to China and other areas
[40:23.880 --> 40:28.840]  ahead of this seismic shift to bring in this global governance this world
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.160]  government run by the private banks how do I know that they wrote about it 30
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.280]  years ago they wrote about it 10 years ago they now brag about it here and there
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.520]  so more and more the mainstream media realizes their passé have you seen the
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.360]  CNBC clip where they admit hey we're all slaves the global government run by
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.880]  bankers no I haven't seen that one guys can we cue that up please the CNBC clip
[40:50.880 --> 40:55.680]  because in more and more publications they are admitting it but it's more in
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.040]  establishment publications or in trade publications they're admitting where
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.760]  we're going but this isn't just quantitative easing it's also been and
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.480]  I want your take on this going directly to the mega banks themselves as a kind
[41:09.480 --> 41:13.880]  of bailout I mean the 40 billion a month half of the 80 billion goes to buy
[41:13.880 --> 41:18.600]  these derivatives these mortgage derivatives I mean I mean that is it
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.680]  the taxpayers job to pay for that no absolutely not wings and they're doing
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.400]  exactly what you said but they're essentially doing to say look we're
[41:25.400 --> 41:28.080]  gonna go in we're gonna buy all these these mortgage-backed securities and
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.960]  derivatives and in doing so they are are creating a system where they're
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.760]  socializing the profit or excuse me they're privatizing the profit in that
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.080]  the banks are the ones who will profit from it but then they're socializing the
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.120]  risk of it they're buying up all these risky things with our dollars then
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.040]  turning around and saying well here the profits for that we don't share in the
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.560]  profits of it the other issue is that this is indefinite and people may not
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.800]  realize this but when you move into quantitative easing that has no into it
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.000]  it's simply indefinite and you're gonna buy all this up if you have a 401k if
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.880]  you have you know a mutual fund that you're invested into for your retirement
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.840]  all of those very safe ones that traditionally have done well those are
[42:11.840 --> 42:15.800]  all going to be bought up by the Fed the Fed's gonna have control about the
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.120]  government will control all of those safe bets which means if you have money
[42:19.120 --> 42:22.320]  you need to put aside for your own retirement they're actually going to
[42:22.320 --> 42:26.360]  force you to put it into riskier stocks there are no safe bets because they're
[42:26.360 --> 42:31.120]  gonna buy up all the ones that are safe so it really hurts everyone in this
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.800]  process it doesn't just help the banks but it actually puts you know the average
[42:34.800 --> 42:38.040]  investor in a position where everything they're invested into for their future
[42:38.040 --> 42:42.520]  that traditionally has been very safe is now going to be very risky they infect
[42:42.520 --> 42:47.440]  the whole system then holds you hostage and say we're too big to fail and then
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.640]  basically transfer all the wealth to themselves while destroying your wealth
[42:51.640 --> 42:55.440]  then they're the last group standing and they're able to buy everything up for
[42:55.440 --> 43:00.720]  pennies on the dollar that is the economic model of conquest that we're
[43:00.720 --> 43:05.040]  now facing as a society and as you just stated when they announce unlimited QE
[43:05.040 --> 43:11.760]  3 that leads one place it leads to Weimar Republic Germany type inflation it
[43:11.760 --> 43:18.240]  live it it leads to Zimbabwe style inflation that is the road that they've
[43:18.240 --> 43:24.400]  now put us on and like you said it's just a minor footnote all QE 3 no
[43:24.400 --> 43:31.320]  connection to gold exploding and other commodities like gasoline oil spiking
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.880]  and this is just with the announcement and here are the insiders now not not
[43:36.880 --> 43:42.760]  doing QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 unlimited open-ended QE 3 now they get to know the
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.120]  insiders when they're going to be doing it with these little adjustments the
[43:47.120 --> 43:51.960]  insider trading ramifications are stratospheric but what's interesting too
[43:51.960 --> 43:58.640]  is even the terms that are used QE 1 QE 2 QE 3 it sounds like it is the third
[43:58.640 --> 44:02.320]  time that the Fed has gone through this process in order to as most people would
[44:02.320 --> 44:06.520]  call it stimulate the economy the problem is QE 1 QE 2 and QE 3 are not
[44:06.520 --> 44:09.960]  the same thing at all they were completely different programs that were
[44:09.960 --> 44:15.000]  designed in order to to to affect the the markets and affect the system so it's
[44:15.000 --> 44:18.760]  not QE 3 is not round 3 and that's what most people think that is it's an
[44:18.760 --> 44:22.800]  entirely different setup again as you mentioned buying up all of these mortgage
[44:22.800 --> 44:27.840]  back derivatives and as a result of that I think most people have no idea they
[44:27.840 --> 44:32.800]  think I think they think QE 3 more stimulus that means the government's
[44:32.800 --> 44:36.400]  going to put more money into the system well that's good for everyone and again
[44:36.400 --> 44:41.000]  as you mentioned to most financial channels and most financial reporters
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.640]  aren't even talking about it in any term that people can understand but what you
[44:44.640 --> 44:48.680]  described right now about shifting all of this burden away from from the banks
[44:48.680 --> 44:55.800]  themselves putting the risk on to the taxpayer buying up the safe bets shifting
[44:55.800 --> 44:59.360]  their own money this is all stuff that while when you say it a lot of people
[44:59.360 --> 45:02.880]  would say oh it's Alex Jones it's all conspiratorial it's not a conspiracy at
[45:02.880 --> 45:06.680]  all in terms of being hidden it's a conspiracy that's happening right out
[45:06.680 --> 45:10.600]  in the open and anyone can find this information they're just not bothering to
[45:10.600 --> 45:13.960]  do so they're too busy worried about the fact that Jersey shores off at the end of
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.360]  the season well exactly a lot of times I get up here and and and rant and rave
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.840]  because I'm genuinely upset that tends to get people out of their trance to
[45:22.840 --> 45:26.440]  realize something's going on and I kind of make it safe to talk about these
[45:26.440 --> 45:30.160]  things and then others can start to cover it so I think everybody you know the
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.080]  Lord works in mysterious ways that's why I'm excited to see you and others out
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.720]  there you're exposing this in a really focused news style because that will
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.240]  reach people out there who've kind of heard about this but think it's a
[45:42.240 --> 45:46.000]  conspiracy theory and there you are with a whole news team behind you able to
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.800]  lay all this out and people can go again to fox19.com to find all your
[45:50.800 --> 45:55.440]  reports they're also on YouTube before we go to some phone calls here and talk
[45:55.440 --> 45:58.760]  about some of the other reports you're working on right now Ben Swan
[45:58.760 --> 46:05.200]  award-winning reporter joining us right now I wanted to ask you the question
[46:05.200 --> 46:10.040]  about your social media and thing some of your own private websites or things
[46:10.040 --> 46:12.960]  outside of the fox side of folks want to follow some of the things you're
[46:12.960 --> 46:16.840]  talking about off-air yeah I think you're over to Facebook we have a pretty
[46:16.840 --> 46:21.920]  strong Facebook page it's facebook.com slash Ben Swan reality check that's
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.000]  the easiest way to find it and it's one has two ends so if you're not familiar
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.720]  with me then you've got to put in be in SWA in in reality check and you can
[46:31.720 --> 46:36.280]  follow us on Twitter as well and it's at Fox 19 Ben Swan so we're doing work on
[46:36.280 --> 46:39.160]  both of those sides we don't really have much going on with Google plus the app
[46:39.160 --> 46:42.520]  we're working on creating some circles there create more discussion again
[46:42.520 --> 46:46.400]  because as I mentioned I mean I'm a huge fan of the people who follow me and and
[46:46.400 --> 46:52.280]  I just go like those are the folks so many of them are so smart and savvy and
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.840]  they know what's going on they're awake is the term I would use them and when
[46:55.840 --> 46:59.840]  you get around people who are awake it energizes you and that's what's
[46:59.840 --> 47:03.520]  happened well I've no I've seen your sites it's basically it's it's Liberty
[47:03.520 --> 47:06.560]  Lovers it's my listeners it's your listeners it's people that understand
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.200]  what's happening and who are breaking down the left-right paradigm and saying
[47:10.200 --> 47:14.160]  hey it's about Liberty now the Democrats just so happen to be you know
[47:14.160 --> 47:19.440]  absolute tyrants the Republicans shame ball of wax I tend to agree with
[47:19.440 --> 47:23.360]  Republicans more because on the surface they say they're pro-gun and things like
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.600]  that but again at the very top you see with somebody like Obama and Romney
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.280]  past the rhetoric there's almost no difference what's your take on that oh
[47:31.280 --> 47:37.840]  absolutely I think there is you have to strain to find a real substantive
[47:37.840 --> 47:41.600]  difference between President Obama and Mitt Romney and that's one reason why
[47:41.600 --> 47:44.440]  the two of them I think are going to really struggle when you get into this
[47:44.440 --> 47:48.320]  debate the conventions were fascinating for folks who were kind of political
[47:48.320 --> 47:51.920]  watchers the conventions were really interesting because the Republicans did
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.000]  such a poor job of shaping their message their message really wasn't about
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.560]  what they're going to change in the future it was about how Obama had failed
[47:59.560 --> 48:02.960]  and he hadn't done enough and they really pushed for this we built it kind of
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.840]  idea because they were using a play on words but there really wasn't a vision
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.320]  for what they would do differently the Democratic convention the same way
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.920]  there was no real vision for the future it was well if we go with that guy we're
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.240]  not gonna like it and so there was very little vision casting in either
[48:18.240 --> 48:21.880]  convention which was kind of fascinating to me and part of the reason I think for
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.560]  that is because if you really break down the direction the governor Romney
[48:25.560 --> 48:28.680]  wants to take the country and the direction President Obama does there
[48:28.680 --> 48:31.760]  are some differences in terms of how they want to deal with taxation how they
[48:31.760 --> 48:35.600]  want to deal certainly with with people who were in higher income brackets and
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.400]  taxation but if we're talking about for instance foreign policy tell me one
[48:39.400 --> 48:46.160]  thing governor Romney will do differently than what or TSA or NSA or the police
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.360]  state or any of these things that really matter it's like it's like map
[48:51.360 --> 48:56.880]  quest plotting two different ways to go to the same destination I mean there's
[48:56.880 --> 49:00.680]  some changes in the route but it goes the same place absolutely because
[49:00.680 --> 49:04.280]  ultimately their their view and even and even when we talk about you know you
[49:04.280 --> 49:07.720]  ask me about some of my own personal views look I'm a journalist I'm a
[49:07.720 --> 49:12.760]  constitutionalist my personal view is that Constitution rule of law is what
[49:12.760 --> 49:16.640]  our founders and framers designed they knew that that we should not be a
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.160]  democracy people say all the time we're a democracy it's one of my biggest
[49:20.160 --> 49:23.880]  pet peeves we're not a democracy we're a republic we're a republic absolutely and
[49:23.880 --> 49:28.680]  the difference is vast the republic is rule of law democracy is rule of mob
[49:28.680 --> 49:33.200]  and so all you need is a plus one in a democracy in order to push through any
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.880]  crazy laws or rule and rob the other 49% it's two wolves and a sheep voting on
[49:37.880 --> 49:41.160]  what's for dinner but again that's terrorist talk according to Homeland
[49:41.160 --> 49:44.320]  Security have you done a report yet on my act at Homeland Security reports
[49:44.320 --> 49:47.640]  saying veterans and gun owners and the terrorist you know what some people have
[49:47.640 --> 49:50.080]  been sending me some of that information and we are looking at doing
[49:50.080 --> 49:53.160]  something on that we're going to break it's like constitutional if you believe
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.200]  in the Constitution you're a terrorist exactly we're going to break as usual I've
[49:57.200 --> 50:00.280]  hogged the gas we got loaded phone lines for you but let me just add this here
[50:00.280 --> 50:05.840]  drudgereport.com it's also at info wars.com our story about the nuclear
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.280]  reactor also evacuated at the JJ Pickle Center here in Austin Texas it's top

[50:15.680 --> 50:19.280]  there and and I'm glad that our servers are still staying up that'll probably
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.200]  send us about 3 million readers or is the site still up info wars.com top
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.840]  linked there and they're now evacuating multiple campuses not just the
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.120]  University of Texas but up in North Dakota as well over the someone's
[50:34.120 --> 50:37.960]  basically staying there al-qaeda saying all these bombs are about to go off we've
[50:37.960 --> 50:41.560]  got reporters still downtown well now they've gone to the reactor so they'll
[50:41.560 --> 50:46.080]  be popping in during the during the next hour a little bit when we cover QE3
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.520]  or unlimited QE what that means and so much more but straight ahead final
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.040]  segment maybe I'll twist his arm for five more minutes into the next hours we
[50:54.040 --> 50:59.880]  can take six or seven calls with Ben Swan from Fox 19.com

[54:13.840 --> 54:18.280]  right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want
[54:18.280 --> 54:23.040]  to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.680]  world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.240]  downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.320]  and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[54:36.320 --> 54:41.480]  that there's a Bernanke putt and that we won't go any lower than say five
[54:41.480 --> 54:45.080]  percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic data
[54:45.080 --> 54:48.360]  there's nothing to get excited about in that and they go on for five minutes to
[54:48.360 --> 54:52.160]  all agree we're run by global government run by banks exactly what I said 17
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.880]  years ago was going to happen because I was reading the trilateral Commission
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.560]  public documents but the issue here is Bernanke said a year ago there'd be no
[54:59.560 --> 55:05.280]  QE3 well now it's just unlimited QE and they wanted us to beg for it first
[55:05.280 --> 55:08.520]  because if they don't do it we're in trouble but if they do we're in trouble
[55:08.520 --> 55:12.960]  because they engineered this Ben Swine he's one of the anchors over there and
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.240]  investigative reporter at Fox 19 and Cincinnati now has a national
[55:16.240 --> 55:21.120]  international following via YouTube and their site we're taking phone calls got
[55:21.120 --> 55:25.120]  a lot of fans out there gonna take five phone calls for you for this short
[55:25.120 --> 55:30.600]  segment and the next then you're gone let's talk to Brian in Colorado you're
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.320]  on the air with our guests go ahead big fan ears mr. Swan and you as well mr.
[55:35.320 --> 55:41.560]  Jones I wanted to bring you up to taste on a few things that I found out I live
[55:41.560 --> 55:46.880]  in Colorado and it's very frightening to have the ATF state they're gonna take
[55:46.880 --> 55:51.800]  people's guns rights that smoke marijuana or use marijuana because a lot of
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.080]  people in Colorado have guns and a lot of people in Colorado smoke marijuana but
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.640]  the thing I really wanted to point out to you gentlemen is that through my
[55:59.640 --> 56:04.720]  research I found that marijuana oil cures cancer well it's certainly been
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.400]  shown to be a treatment let me stop you this is how crazy the news is that broke
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.440]  after I was off air yesterday we carried it on the nightly news I read the
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.400]  ruling from two days ago it's true they're saying alcohol abuse marijuana
[56:18.400 --> 56:23.840]  use any drug any substance abuse that they say no judge no jury they're taking
[56:23.840 --> 56:30.080]  your guns Ben Swan what do you make of that so I really can't comment on it
[56:30.080 --> 56:38.280]  I'd love to see it though it's already in featured news archive just just put
[56:38.280 --> 56:41.280]  it up on screen for folks that are watching and listening can find it
[56:41.280 --> 56:45.000]  info wars.com I have it reposted to the front page let's go thank you Brian
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.480]  let's go to Luke in South Korea you're on the air with mr. Swan go ahead
[56:51.480 --> 56:56.520]  hi there how are you I've seen from my own experience with mainstream media that
[56:56.520 --> 57:01.520]  certain stories the government want to have suppressed never make it to air and
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.600]  in England they have the DA system defense advisory they've still got the
[57:06.600 --> 57:10.120]  legacy of that in Australia they're trying to reenact it as a voluntary yeah
[57:10.120 --> 57:13.480]  it's a denotus absolutely and then they're trying to get that here what's
[57:13.480 --> 57:19.440]  your question for mr. Swan well what the absence of a denotus how does the
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.520]  government get the issues they want suppressed suppressed in your they have
[57:23.520 --> 57:28.040]  talking points I mean I know because I've talked to Nashville they have taught
[57:28.040 --> 57:34.080]  what you saw two weeks ago where where the New York Times is in contact with the
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.960]  CIA and killing stories for him Ben your take on that absolutely I think they're
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.320]  definitely talking points to go out and I think within local media the issue isn't
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.520]  so much talking points as it is group think if if you know the sister parent
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.520]  station or if the networks aren't talking about it then it must not be news
[57:51.520 --> 57:54.520]  and so it's group think on the lower level bigger level of talking points
[57:54.520 --> 57:57.800]  exactly at that exactly at the top of the pyramid talking points are given
[57:57.800 --> 58:02.000]  White House meetings you name it book deals all of it as I've been offered it

[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:48.800]  talked about infregard to a neighbor who claimed to have worked for a racy on
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:53.880]  in the FBI and then he proudly showed me his infregard card he turned out to be a
[1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:59.400]  busy body a stalker not just a torts myself but another neighbors and about
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:03.360]  keeping Tom as well he liked to call me you heard me profile on that that's
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:06.800]  exactly what my dad was saying he said he's run into several of these now
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:11.800]  there well I'm not supposed to get into it all but the point is go ahead play
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.880]  lead also like to call police with false accusations that apparently felt
[1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:20.760]  powerful by his infregard card maybe everyone should carry one sort of as a
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:26.200]  KMA you know as a Eric Russo's talking about Nicholas Rockefeller's thing
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.720]  that you only have a KMA chip kiss my you know what ship unfortunately he died
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:35.880]  of emphysema due to his irresistible smoking habit and I guess I could bring
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:40.640]  up another issue that I called about there's a locally based radio talk
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:44.160]  network radio network that carries your showed can talk network here in the
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.240]  Tampa Bay area on 1340 a.m. and 1350 a.m. and 80 a.m. a little rock Arkansas that
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:55.440]  the 50,000 watt transmitter who now accepts the local new community currency
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:00.000]  called clearwater hours I want to get the owner of that system on I know they
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.640]  got us on a bunch of great affiliates God bless them spread the word here is my
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.880]  dad David Jones now that was probably infregard calling in because you notice
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:11.280]  they wouldn't admit him for guard or any of it exists it was I want to hear your
[1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:14.640]  dad it isn't true as if we don't know this country's going to hell in a hand
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:19.360]  basket then and they admit the veterans are the number one enemy and they got
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:24.200]  spy networks that's all admitted they're harassing veterans you name it but oh it
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:27.600]  doesn't exist dad I know you don't you didn't want to tell me the whole story
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:30.920]  because it's patient you know doctor privilege but you're allowed to say as
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:35.480]  a dentist what happened is it true that this person has been your patient for a
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:40.040]  very long time wanted to hire you to be a minion and then you went and talked to
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:43.280]  other dentists and found out they've been visited by other groups let me
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:46.960]  explain I had actually was doing some consulting and Dallas at the time and I
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:53.000]  was passing through Waco and I heard a local police liaison in Waco talking
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.040]  about how that people could volunteer and it could be a career path toward
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.680]  really good employment for kids and high school and people in their
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:07.280]  neighborhoods and all different night levels and it was literally about
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:12.600]  becoming a volunteer part of an intelligence gathering keep your
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:18.000]  neighborhood safe volunteer type program and it was going on and it and it was
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  real interesting to me because about that same time someone had a pre-approach
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:28.280]  dr. King and his neighborhood about being involved in and doing that sorry
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:31.560]  and I would see something say something keep your neighbors but tell us what
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:37.240]  happened to you I basically was just approached by a patient that was
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:42.920]  involved in law enforcement that had said that you know they would like for
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:49.360]  me to be involved in basically just being aware of what was going on and to
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:54.600]  talk to other doctors and things in our organization that we were in a good
[1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:58.480]  position to now that we've started this we got Tom Woods coming on but stay

[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:18.280]  the GCN radio network
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:27.400]  well ladies and gentlemen I've been taking calls for two hours and I'm
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:30.680]  doing a lot better than I normally do and it's been pretty powerful hearing
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:35.440]  whistleblowers about infra-guards spying on people and things and we opened up
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:40.040]  our internal phone lines as well and never got to that phone bank Scott Chuck
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:44.640]  lion heart Blake I'm gonna get to you guys with Tom Woods because you've you've
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:47.680]  been patient if not you can hang up I know we got loaded phone lines over here
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:53.760]  we've got whistleblowers on infra-guard pouring in this is crazy I mean this
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.560]  subject is big now infra-guard guys type it into Google and show people or
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:03.120]  start page.com just type in infra-guard if the FBI admits they have it they have
[1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:07.640]  clergy response teams we covered it when it was still secret and it's it's
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.960]  getting preachers a spy on their flocks to try to influence them to accept gun
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:16.860]  confiscation you name it I played newscast where they admit it and then
[1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:23.480]  this caller calls in and says I disagree you know I want to hear your dad say
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:27.600]  that he got approached to be part of the see something say something and
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:30.840]  invited to meetings and things and then my dad talked to other dentists if I'm
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:34.960]  not they've been visited by other groups at home and this is on record they
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:39.600]  count on you being ignorant they'll have these community FBI meetings you go to
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:43.760]  them it's not about al-qaeda it's about the veteran next door that's in the news
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:48.440]  so my point is this is a year and a half ago now my dad ended up calling into the
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:53.920]  back line and getting on is that is that my dad suddenly heard ads on the radio
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.920]  about it dentists he knew what happened to then it happened to him he can't tell
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:02.600]  the whole story because of patient doctor privilege my dad's a dentist but
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:06.160]  dad I got to go to our guest here and I appreciate you listening to the show I
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:11.280]  didn't know you were listening when the guy called in so just briefly you know
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:15.120]  the guy was implying and I was making this up you know the TSA and sticking
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:19.560]  their hands on our pants either break down your concern and what went on
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:24.560]  without violating the in fact just tell the stories of the other doctors that's
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:29.120]  that the getting visited at home that's basically it was all a cumulative effect
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:32.920]  from having heard things on the radio mentioning it to people and then just
[1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.880]  out of the blue of someone who'd been a patient for a long time it was a fairly
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.640]  senior person involved in the administration on law enforcement had
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:49.360]  said we're organizing community level things whereby people are volunteering
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:53.720]  to go out in their neighborhoods and see what are happening and what we've
[1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:58.360]  found that teachers and doctors and sort of other people bankers have key
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:01.720]  positions where they can see and understand things that are going on that
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:06.840]  we need to know and you know I could use your help and on administrative level
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:12.160]  and we're creating career paths for a lot of people at all different ages young
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:16.800]  people people in high school people in college and people that are senior
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:22.160]  people in their professions and right now it's an organizational state but it
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:26.960]  could develop into something much more involved yeah and now dad I think you're
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:30.160]  conflating you're conflating several stories here because I know you don't
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:35.720]  listen all the time but but there was also the other individual and I know you
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:41.080]  can't that also came in flashes a little badge and things and was talking
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:45.400]  about something else well I've had several people approach me over time I
[1:11:45.400 --> 1:11:48.320]  didn't know which incident you were talking about this was about the time
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:52.600]  after I had been I'd gone to that through Waco and pick a hard up very
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:58.040]  similar community a program but yeah there was one guy wanted you to watch
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:01.560]  your patience as well well now this was the whole thing is that that's the whole
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.680]  point is that if you you you're in a situation of interviewing people and
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:08.840]  talking to people and being in positions of trust and things like that but I
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:16.200]  think morning they were interested in me basically doing some monitoring of
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:21.000]  charting issues and things on it on a general basis but it didn't get so so
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.760]  detailed because I was not interested in it so it kind of but then you found out
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:30.840]  that other dentists were getting visits at home yes I found out that a very high
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:34.960]  percentage of them were okay so there you go all right dad thank you so much
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:37.760]  just briefly while you're here in Tom Woods is patiently holding by selling
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.360]  author I keep meaning to get you on air because I want to promote things you know
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:46.600]  I wasn't promoting the ungevity insurance cards because I just wasn't sure about
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:50.040]  them hadn't used them I've now gotten a few prescriptions the last year took that
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:53.840]  long to actually get a few prescriptions I don't get them a lot as you know the
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.640]  nasal spray and then some stuff for my kids we saved over 30% each time with
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:02.400]  them they're totally free you can just put in basically whatever name you want
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.760]  and it accesses the discount you though have given out thousands of these now
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:10.480]  you know you manage 14 dental offices what type of responses with the info
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:14.920]  wars RX since the guy called in and said we were making this up now that we have
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:18.840]  you on there about this let's do a evil capitalism plug I will just say that I
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:22.840]  have even started having patients that have insurance use them for example I
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:30.400]  have a patient who uses a prescription for let's just say creating younger skin
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:36.640]  it's basically retinoic acid and the she was able to get the meds cheap or
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:41.240]  using the discount card then it would be on her insurance yeah so again an
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:45.760]  extensive item again you've been now the last six months using and I was never
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:48.280]  going to promote it because I couldn't understand it it sounded too good to be
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:53.040]  true and then you were telling me hey this is what's really hot because you
[1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:57.840]  you know bought a bunch of great value I just basically give them away for free
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:01.000]  and people anybody and I first I was saying use this if you don't have
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  insurance but people were telling me in fact I heard one of your pharmacy
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:09.320]  people online talking about how sometimes that you can buy stuff generic
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:14.160]  cheaper without using insurance than you do with it because the volume pricing is
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:18.440]  so low if you're buying this say three months six months for your supply
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:22.960]  rather than paying the copay but this doesn't even access you know generic
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.520]  stuff or bolt buying this is across the board find out at info wars rx.com dad
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:31.760]  thank you for joining us alrighty have a great day there he goes okay punk good
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.480]  try calling in implying that isn't going on counting on listeners being ignorant
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:42.560]  not knowing infregard is real there you go okay now I apologize to our guest we
[1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:46.000]  are going to shift gears now joining us via video Skype of your prison planet
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:52.200]  dot TV viewer or if you're listening on XM 166 out there Thomas E. Woods Jr. is a
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:56.000]  senior fellow at the Lubid von Mies Institute and created the Tom Woods
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:59.960]  Liberty classroom that sounds evil right there he probably have infregard watch
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:05.080]  him he holds a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard and his masters is
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:09.600]  and it just goes on and a PhD from Columbia University he is the author of
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:13.080]  11 books most recently rollback repealing big government before the
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:17.080]  coming financial collapse nullification how to resist federal tyranny is when
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:21.320]  for a century Woods has been edited and written the introduction to five
[1:15:21.320 --> 1:15:27.080]  additional books and I just always enjoy hearing him when he's a guest on the
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:32.560]  radio or on TV Tom Woods dot com and thank you for holding the last five
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.080]  minutes while my dad was on what is your take briefly of the Stasi state the
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:41.040]  infregard the clergy response teams Homeland Security Singh veterans are
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.080]  the number one terror threat well it's really something I mean of course you
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:49.400]  know we had the case of somebody being incarcerated because of some Facebook
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:53.720]  posts for heaven's sake and I mean we seems to me we cannot hit this hard
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:57.720]  enough now on the other hand there are two things that I know about all this on
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:03.000]  the one hand technology is being exploited by the bad guys to go after
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.240]  the rest of us but on the other hand there are ways in which we can use
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:10.800]  technology to fight back against them and one silver lining as we're watching
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:14.920]  this sort of police state develop is that today you know people got smartphones
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:19.800]  and they can record these incidents with the police very easily and
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:23.720]  discreetly and before you know what they're all over YouTube and things that
[1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:27.200]  the authorities might have been able to get away with in the past suddenly
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.400]  they're on the defensive so I'm still cautiously optimistic we've still got
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:36.200]  some weapons in our arsenal here but now the feds want to be able to hit a code
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:40.800]  city-wide and kill all the cameras on the iPhones and droids did you see that I
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:46.520]  didn't see that I'm hopeful that there's got to be some some entrepreneur
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:49.880]  somewhere who figures out a way around that in the same way that you know they
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:53.800]  try to they try to do the same thing to radar detectors and there are always
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:57.880]  ways around it my hope is that a free people that actually cares about his
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.880]  freedom will always be one step ahead with you but why are we letting the
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:05.240]  government say we're gonna hit a button and broadcast a code to turn your
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:09.040]  camera off without a warrant without anything controlling your property it's
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:12.040]  incredible that's true of course we're not letting that they're doing it
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:16.360]  regardless of how we feel and it just goes to show how frustrating it is I'm
[1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:20.400]  sure you feel the same way when I see people get really passionate in a
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:24.240]  presidential election year for a candidate other than Ron Paul I feel
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:29.160]  like you just haven't woken up yet there obviously isn't going to be a change
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:33.400]  between Romney and Obama and the fact that people are going to see this
[1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:37.440]  Dinesh D'Souza movie and walking out saying I gotta clamp down I gotta do
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:42.040]  everything I can to get establishment candidate a out so I can replace him with
[1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:46.520]  establishment candidate B if only these people's efforts were directed in the
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:50.720]  right place we might be getting somewhere I'm glad you brought that film up
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:54.040]  I mean it was at about an eighth grade level instead of a second grade level
[1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:58.080]  like most you know democratic films are but it's honest that government wants
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:01.800]  to destroy America but that's to consolidate it it's really colonialism
[1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:06.680]  by the globalist and crony capitalist against America it's not Obama is
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.320]  anti-colonialist so he's misguided Obama's a total globalist like Romney
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:17.120]  yeah of course that's right Obama is first of all Obama is not a Marxist he
[1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:21.240]  doesn't hold most of the Marxist views but in a way that makes him more more
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:24.520]  sinister and more dangerous he doesn't want to bring he doesn't want to end
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:28.880]  American imperialism or any of the old Marxist slogans he wants to intensify them
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:32.760]  as does Romney and in terms of surveillance and all the other issues
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:38.840]  the two people are indistinguishable materialism home yeah I'm what I want
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:42.080]  to do is one of these days I'm gonna make a video when it gets time for the
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.520]  presidential debates a video the top ten questions that will not be asked of
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:50.480]  these people because if you did ask it it would expose the scam of the of the
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:55.680]  so-called free elections that we have well Tom you know I tell you an hour is
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:58.520]  not enough time we got shown about ten minutes late we're gonna go to break here
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:01.600]  and come back I'm gonna give you the floor what do you want to get into first
[1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:06.920]  solutions I I was told well sure we might as well try right can't hurt to try
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:10.800]  and we can't be afraid of failing because how could we be in a worse spot
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:14.560]  than we are now that's a good point and you know you've predicted the
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:17.640]  collapse and you've talked about ways to get the word out before that happens
[1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:21.200]  now it's here I want to talk about your last two books I've read both of them

[1:24:17.080 --> 1:24:20.160]  think this is our first visit with him over the years hopefully the first
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:24.240]  admitting Tom what are solutions to this fight I mean Ron Paul still out there
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:28.800]  getting the word out that he's riding off in the sunset a little bit rands up
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:33.680]  there you know close to his dad but not his dad obviously those are focal points
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:36.440]  there's what you're doing with Lou Rockwell and others doing a great job I
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:42.080]  know that you're in a film that we promote and sell nullification which
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:46.000]  breaks down states rights and when I go study what the Pentagon's doing they're
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.840]  not preparing to fight Al-Qaeda there they talk about going after
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:55.280]  legislatures that rebel and don't go along so the the corrupt system is
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:59.640]  worried about states rights that tells me it's the answer tell us about that
[1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:04.880]  well my view is that we have to try something that's not out of the New
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:09.080]  York Times playbook I mean the New York Times and the mainstream media their
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:13.240]  role is to try to limit our range of debate is to say well here are the
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:16.000]  issues that you're allowed to talk about here are the positions here's the
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.480]  three-inch range you're allowed to take on those issues and if we're gonna play
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:23.680]  by their rules we're never gonna get so we've got to be willing to do things
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.840]  that aren't mentioned in Newsweek or aren't mentioned on the TV and so
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.640]  that's why I like the idea of state nullification I wrote a book called
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:36.480]  nullification as you mentioned and the idea of this is that the states created
[1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:39.920]  the federal government they ought to have some say in whether the federal
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:43.920]  government is obeying the Constitution or not saying what their opinion on that
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:48.600]  is and in fact as Madison and Jefferson said in 1798 the states in the last
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:51.880]  resort have to say to the federal government no what you're doing is
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:56.440]  unconstitutional we refuse to go along with it now that is needless to say not
[1:25:56.440 --> 1:26:00.120]  in the Romney agenda it's not the Obama agenda it's not what Chris Matthews
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:04.000]  would say it's not what Bill O'Reilly would say so in my book that makes it
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:08.880]  great so basically you've got all the corrupt as Mike Church calls in the
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:12.720]  Decepticons on the one side and you got Thomas Jefferson on the other I'll take
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.240]  Thomas Jefferson and state nullification we're starting to see this
[1:26:15.240 --> 1:26:19.440]  picking up steam around the country as people feel like you know I voted for
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:23.640]  the candidates I've handed out pocket constitutions I've done everything else
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:27.720]  I'm gonna try this if it's good enough for Thomas Jefferson it's good enough
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:31.200]  for me what is the harm in trying it and I'll tell you there's a lot of fun
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:35.960]  trying it because when you see the look on the face of Rachel Maddow and Chris
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:40.240]  Matthews when they talk about the reappearance of state nullification
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.400]  it's like their dog died this is not something they want us doing by the way
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:49.480]  you have absolutely hit the heart of it they control the debates between the
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:55.920]  demo rats and the Decepticons they sit there and and and give you this false
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:00.560]  tiny spectrum and my seven-year-old daughter was in the back of the car and
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:04.360]  she goes well daddy are we Democrats or Republicans and my nine-year-old son
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:08.880]  said no that's a false choice because he listens to the show more and said
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.680]  that's you know how they control us you know we need more choices and I was like
[1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:17.840]  amen to that and you know she started to get it I'm like they give you false
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:22.080]  choices and they're scared because they're losing control of the narrative
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.520]  now they can't keep us on the reservation absolutely so of course when
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:29.680]  you do pursue something like state nullification as some states have been
[1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:33.480]  talking about with a variety of pieces of federal legislation naturally that the
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:36.680]  state is going to come out with all the guns rhetorical guns at least at this
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:40.720]  stage that they have namely they're going to accuse you of well of course
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.360]  you're an extremist the word they never define of course there's nothing
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:48.920]  extreme about what they do you understand I'm extreme not them they call it
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:53.000]  tradition they call it sedition to even want to have a state yeah exactly so
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:56.360]  yes it's a decision that's right with Chris the irony well there's a lot of
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:28:01.000]  irony here but I hardly think it's a decision to support Thomas Jefferson so
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.520]  I don't point that out they never want to talk with Jefferson but the law in the
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:09.040]  short of it is we're just reclaiming what are obviously our American rights as
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:13.680]  as and in the nullification but the whole reason I wrote it was that I knew we
[1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:17.120]  were going to be attacked and smeared we support slavery and all this nonsense
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:20.680]  nullification was never used to uphold slavery it was used to fight against the
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:23.680]  the fugitive slave laws they don't want us to know that because they want to
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:29.360]  paint us as these terrible people who pine for slavery use for those that
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:34.960]  don't know states rights so that people could run in me say that's exactly what
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:38.160]  was going on in Wisconsin and elsewhere and they said we have to protect our
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:42.240]  state sovereignty our right to protect these poor souls and give them a jury
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:46.080]  trial and not have them just be dragged away to their masters that's history
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:48.960]  that we're not supposed to know we're supposed to know the states are wicked
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:52.280]  the federal government is this great wonderful progressive force and we are
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:57.800]  blasting that narrative to bits with nullification keep telling us about it
[1:28:57.800 --> 1:29:01.880]  well let me set short break a short segment loss of it I figured I want to
[1:29:01.880 --> 1:29:05.040]  give you a chance to jump in and stop me well we're going to break in about a
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:07.720]  minute it's just that that is the answer when you read the John Warren
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:13.280]  Defense Authorization Act when you look I mean you saw when Texas unanimously in
[1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:16.800]  the house said we're gonna enforce the law don't grow up people at the airport
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:21.080]  misdemeanor on the outside felony on the inside that's just the law they
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:25.800]  threatened F-16 arm blockade and it wasn't even big news it's like oh well our
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:30.760]  F-16s will stop you from enforcing that I mean the state should have called that
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:34.000]  block I want to come back get your take on that and then just keep expanding
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.720]  because we sell the DVD that's based on your book to a great extent you're in

[1:33:48.880 --> 1:34:01.560]  we are go Tom Woods best-selling authors our guest the documentary film
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:07.080]  nullification the rightful remedy a documentary film is so professionally
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:12.920]  done when so ever the general government assumes undeligated powers a
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:19.120]  nullification of the act is the rightful remedy Thomas Jefferson and again ladies
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:25.200]  and gentlemen people can get this powerful film at info or store.com and
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:30.400]  Tom Woods has a book of the same name he's in it Stuart Rhodes and so many
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:34.880]  others it's really an amazing film nullify now because the federal government
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:40.520]  itself has been taken over and I want to get into that subject right now with our
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:46.240]  guest but there's also a a a dark side type of nullification when Congress
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:49.320]  won't do things that are unconstitutional like past carbon taxes
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:53.800]  Obama just doesn't the executive order so the federal government itself as they
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:58.200]  bragged on CNBC has been captured by these offshore globalists that are above
[1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:04.120]  the law and fat on bailout money here's an article out of local news Elgin
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:09.320]  sustainability visioning workshop set for September 10th that's here in Elgin
[1:35:09.320 --> 1:35:13.240]  outside Austin it's it's a cow town and they said they want to take over the
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:17.320]  local land decide who can develop and they put it out there like it's a
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.960]  wonderful new thing that's what the UN said three years ago at the Copenhagen
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:25.480]  Treaty they said we can't take over the the the federal government fully will
[1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:29.760]  take over at the city and county and state level and Schwarzenegger leads
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:33.280]  that initiative show they understand the real powers local that's what they say
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:36.280]  think globally act locally so they don't want us to win that they're like oh
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:40.800]  no let's have 60% turnouts for a federal election but 8% on average for
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:45.080]  local so everybody get out to Elgin tonight we'll give you that at the very
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:49.160]  end of the show but these meetings are happening everywhere we're hi you want
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:53.800]  to be have a livable area pass a law that bureaucrats decide if you can use
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:57.400]  your land at all you know forget fishing while I've seen you have a puddle on
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:00.000]  your land that you've owned for a hundred years now we're going to take it now
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:03.720]  just look pass a law because it's trendy you know we're gonna shut down your
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:08.680]  coal power plant because it's trendy going back to Tom Woods Tom getting in
[1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:13.920]  to the issue of what the feds are doing and how they themselves have been
[1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:18.600]  taken over we we ended the last segment bringing up the point about Texas
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:24.480]  threatened with F-16s to to not let aircraft come into our state if we
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:30.280]  dared to not let TSA you aren't even police stick their hands down our pants
[1:36:30.280 --> 1:36:35.640]  well my own recommendation for this is that as we go forward and as we gain
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:38.000]  more and more interest in the idea of nullification is that we need to
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:41.960]  coordinate we need to have friendly legislators in one state coordinating
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:45.760]  with legislators in other states and we do have legislators around the country
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:49.080]  who are on board for nullification I know that for a fact I know a lot of them
[1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:53.880]  and have the states do this all at the same time and then really I mean of
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:56.880]  course the federal government has overwhelming power it could strictly
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:00.640]  speaking do whatever it wants but it does have to reckon with public opinion
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:04.960]  at some level it does not want the general public to withdraw its consent
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:09.680]  entirely so I'd like to say what if 15 states refuse to do something at once
[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:13.160]  or 20 or 25 what are they gonna do withhold the highway money from
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:17.520]  everybody at some point they have got to back down which they have done in the
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:21.280]  past they back down on real ID although now they're trying to get that back they
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:26.040]  back down on 55 miles an hour all we have to have is a collective this is
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:30.720]  wrong you shouldn't be over this and a Sammy Hagar song we've got to make it
[1:37:30.720 --> 1:37:36.480]  culturally popular to rediscover liberty yeah absolute and and the fact that I
[1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:38.880]  mean you could sort of play on you sort of do what I used to do when I was a
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.840]  college professor I'd have all these 18-year-old kids and they weren't all
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:45.600]  that excited about being in my class I don't know why but they weren't and so
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:48.760]  one of the ways I would get them excited is I would say look I'm gonna teach you
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:53.000]  stuff in this room that if you went to Harvard they would not tell you and then
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.200]  suddenly their teenage rebellious nature I was I was using it for my
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:00.280]  purposes so suddenly because they want to know what are they keeping from me
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:04.040]  well likewise nullification and the sorts of things we're doing are sorts of
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:08.240]  things that we are not supposed to do no authority wants us to do them that sort
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:11.320]  of makes them cool I mean in the old days the left used to say question
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:14.880]  authority now the left is the authority half the time so they don't they have no
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:18.680]  use for questions anymore we are the question-askers and we're the ones and
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:21.080]  I'll give you the answer the answer is nullification not the answer to every
[1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:25.280]  problem but what it does even if it fails which I don't think it will but
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:31.000]  even if it did it succeeds in getting people to think outside this suffocating
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.400]  box yes like the only the only opinion you can have is between Joe Biden and
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:40.240]  Mitt Romney that's just a that's a mental exactly but but but I mean what you
[1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:45.400]  just said is so true they lie awake at night afraid of nullification because
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:48.720]  the states created the federal government and the two are supposed to be a
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:52.200]  separation of powers and the federal government has become this distant
[1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:56.680]  imperium just like England became a distant imperium and the city of London
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.880]  from the 13 colonies and you read what's in the Declaration of Independence
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:06.240]  it's exactly what's happening today and then some I mean it means things are
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:10.360]  worse today than they were then and like you said so-called liberals aren't
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:16.840]  liberals they are authoritarians they they always want to tell us well a nine
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:21.040]  month old baby in the wombs on a baby we say it's a fetus you know everything
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.440]  with them is they define everything and it's so pretentious and it's a mind
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:31.360]  game go ahead I'm sorry no no no I agree with everything you said on the
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:36.400]  nullification issue Jefferson predicted this outcome and he warned he said if
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:40.480]  you let the federal government have the final monopolistic word on what the
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:45.520]  Constitution means take a wild guess on what will happen it's gonna interpret it
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:49.840]  in ways that benefit itself and in ways that eclipse the states and the people
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.160]  well obviously that has happened now the argument for nullification
[1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:57.760]  constitutionally morally every other way is such a home run I know this because
[1:39:57.760 --> 1:40:01.880]  I've had exchanges with law professors on it these law professors can't debate
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:05.440]  their way out of a paper bag they've all they've all have the same three rotten
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:09.040]  arguments so I got so sick of answering the same things over and over again I
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:13.720]  just put up I bought the domain name state nullification calm and I basically
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:18.200]  put up there all the information you need to be even a law professor because
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:22.160]  they don't have the arguments it is true that Jefferson said these things it is
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:25.800]  true that the states created the federal government all these things are true
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:29.640]  that the Constitution was ratified state by state that the United States in the
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.000]  Constitution is never referred to in the singular the United States is always
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:38.480]  30 years ago the FBI had to get permission to come in your town now the
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:42.840]  police get little federal cards and other totes and why do we even have
[1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:46.960]  states then why do we even have an America why not just a global government
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:50.040]  well that's why they have to get rid of the states to then get rid of the
[1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:53.600]  sovereignty itself of the country right exactly the states are not just you know
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.840]  cute little you know arbitrary boundary lines and you know Vermont has some
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:01.840]  quirks and California has its quirks and isn't that neat these are supposed to be
[1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:06.280]  boundary lines against tyranny that's why they're there by walls there for for
[1:41:06.280 --> 1:41:09.600]  convenience for the government they're not there for fun they're there for this
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:12.760]  purpose if we're not gonna use them you're right man is what might as well not have
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:17.880]  well they're firewalls aren't they like bulkheads in a ship I mean if one falls
[1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:22.320]  people can run to the other oh and absolutely in fact what's so awesome is
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:26.840]  that in the early 19th century so 200 years ago the governor of Connecticut
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:31.240]  what a northern state yes that's right if the governor of Connecticut Jonathan
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:35.840]  Trumbull said that the state governments are in the last resort resort the
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:41.600]  bulwark of the liberties of the people and so in 2010 in Connecticut the very
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:46.160]  same state 200 years later there was an attorney general race and the woman who
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.760]  was running as a Republican got in the debates picked up my book
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:41:53.840]  nullification which quotes the old count Connecticut governor 200 years ago and
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:57.560]  she quoted from it and said we need to do this again well of course the media
[1:41:57.560 --> 1:42:03.000]  just went absolutely berserk how she's not staying between the the Biden and
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.640]  Romney spectrum how dare she say these things that it's exciting that we have
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.760]  all this history yeah real US history that is not taught and I don't think
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:17.440]  it's not taught just because by accident or they didn't have time to get to it
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:21.520]  that day it's because if you don't teach it it's easier to pass off this
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.320]  narrative whereby in American history all we have is at the great glorious
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:30.360]  progressive federal government always doing wondrous deeds for the people
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:34.520]  that's that's what they want us to take so that we'll sit back and not ask
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:39.720]  some questions where do you see this confrontation going because clearly the
[1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:44.800]  federal government's buying 1.4 billion bullets the lapdog media spins that into
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:49.320]  174 thousand and says why are you guys upset when they're setting up check
[1:42:49.320 --> 1:42:54.920]  points TSA on the streets 1.4 billion bullets and they spin it to 174
[1:42:54.920 --> 1:43:01.960]  thousand when they are federalizing everything in DAA Patriot Act face
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:07.040]  scanning cameras going into buy and sell out of a science fiction dystopia and
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:10.640]  then they still look at us and go you're the crazy people that say the
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:14.720]  government's too big or you know the southern property law center and ADL are
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.360]  like dangerous terrorist think there's a world government as it's being
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:24.200]  announced everywhere I mean it's it's I don't think they understand or do they
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:28.040]  that they're really losing the hearts and minds right now and shoveling more
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:34.440]  disinfo is only making people's exodus from under their dark wings accelerate I
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:39.040]  think so I mean the fact that as Lou Rockwell said at the Paul festival I
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:43.480]  don't think there's a 25 year old in this country a 25 or under who still
[1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:48.120]  reads a newspaper so in other words the usual mechanisms that they once used to
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:54.040]  to for to manufacture consent no longer exist as far as most young people are
[1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:56.680]  concerned and then of course we all know how Ron Paul did among the young
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:01.280]  people Gary Johnson who's not quite Ron Paul but nevertheless he represents some
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:04.600]  kind of a difference is doing much better among the younger people so it
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:08.800]  not although time is not really on our side in some ways well in other ways at
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:12.600]  least we see that there the young people who haven't been raised on a diet of you
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:16.280]  listen to the three channels and you accept what they say are willing to
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:20.120]  look elsewhere for their information because they know liars when they see
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:23.560]  them well that encourages me but we also as you write we've got to talk about the
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:27.560]  local level because maybe at this point I mean Ron Paul did as a great service
[1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:30.280]  educational service on the national level and I don't know what we would have
[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:34.200]  done without that but moving forward we got to think about the local level and
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:37.320]  what you can do as an individual like New Hampshire is a great example they've
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:42.640]  passed a jury nullification law so the juries can can not only decide whether
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:46.440]  the person was guilty or innocent but also decide the justice of the law the
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:50.320]  free state project in New Hampshire is trying to encourage a free society by
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:53.680]  just having people go to one place New Hampshire and working together to build
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:57.720]  a free site now unfortunately my old state of Massachusetts which I'm sorry I
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:01.440]  apologize I'm from Massachusetts is screwing that up because so many people
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:04.560]  in Massachusetts they screw up Massachusetts they have no idea why
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:07.720]  Massachusetts is screwed up they have no idea that they did it and then they
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:09.920]  moved to New Hampshire they want to screw up New Hampshire so they've got
[1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:13.200]  their hands full up there but these are the sorts of things that Liberty-minded
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:17.640]  people creatively are coming up with when they're faced with what seems like in
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:21.560]  insuperable odds they're just saying well you know what it may be insuperable
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:25.520]  odds but but I'm gonna go down fighting you know and and maybe we just might
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.600]  win it's not in California I mean they passed a 20% carbon tax a couple years
[1:45:30.600 --> 1:45:37.320]  ago knowing that when you raise taxes too much it it actually destroys the tax
[1:45:37.320 --> 1:45:42.600]  receipts and now the exodus has accelerated and then their answer is
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:48.880]  raise taxes again there is this predatory instinct to the bureaucrat and the
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:55.000]  bureaucrat minions and also these kleptocrat megacorporations that love
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.320]  working with big government to shut down their competition I was reading
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:02.520]  where Walmart now you know has much lower profits well what do they expect
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:07.240]  when they engage in anti-free market monopolistic tactics and then try to
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:11.040]  frame the free market for a monopoly they've created that's the opposite of
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:15.520]  that well there's also you know there's also this move to try to get to a
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:20.280]  national sales tax on the internet and there are some merchants who would like
[1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:24.880]  to see that happen because they feel like that would help them against local
[1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:29.240]  competitors and so on everybody winds up trying to use the government to line
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:33.520]  his pockets which is which is why see unfortunately in the mainstream media the
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:36.920]  way they respond to that is say well we got to take the money out of politics
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:41.840]  not you got to take the power out of Washington because you're never gonna
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:45.320]  be able to get the money out as long as there's stuff to be had the crooks will
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:49.480]  always figure out how to get their rubby hands on it so you have to go after
[1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:53.320]  the source of the problem which is not that too much money is being donated to
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:57.840]  campaigns it's that once elected the president can favor you we don't want
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:02.840]  that well that's like the more money they spend on education the more expensive
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:08.920]  it gets to lower the quality more money you spend on health then the higher the
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:13.400]  cost and the less quality because it's all being centrally controlled you cut
[1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:17.960]  the money off then that will start cutting the corruption off yeah
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:22.360]  absolutely I mean the education bureaucracy is a disaster and a joke I
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:27.320]  mean the the administration is so bloated in all these cities in in New
[1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:31.320]  York City it's something like 6,000 bureaucrats in the central office
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:35.320]  whereas the Catholic schools educate like one sixth as many students so they
[1:47:35.320 --> 1:47:38.960]  should have a thousand bureaucrats they've got 26 I mean it goes to show
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:42.240]  there's something wrong here this is not a matter of I just said this on C-Span
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:46.160]  the other day this is not a matter of the government is there because these are
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.040]  wonderful public-spirited people who just want to promote the common good no
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:55.080]  these are people who want to loot and expropriate you and build up their own
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:59.040]  impenetrable thiefdoms where they increase their budgets and their power
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:01.920]  that's what it is it's not what you learned in third grade about how the
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:04.920]  government works that's the that's the reality of what's going on look at this
[1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:09.120]  example where the people end up in the state of deposit box having coins were
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.880]  a 7.9 million a piece of these shank god and 33 and the government said well we
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.240]  have an executive order that we can take your gold and they just steal it and then
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:22.240]  and then ABC News reports it like it's a good thing I mean don't people
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:25.440]  understand that once due process the Constitution of Bill of Rights is gone
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:30.600]  none of us have any protections don't the bureaucrats know that that they can
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:35.160]  be looted now I mean I mean you know don't the cops know that once there's
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:38.840]  on a bill of rights and Constitution that they have no protections well that's
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.040]  why I think it's important all this there's been some good educational work
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:45.600]  done to try to reach local police and educate them and make them alert to
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:48.160]  what's going on a lot of them are just they feel like they're just doing their
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:52.400]  jobs and they're not really aware of the of the implications of all this so that
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:55.760]  does need that doesn't need to be promoted but the one of the short of it
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.280]  is what we're seeing though today at the same time I mean I think we've got two
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.440]  things going on at once on the one hand the acceleration of trends that are
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.040]  deeply disturbing and dangerous for all of us but on the other hand we have more
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:12.280]  people than ever who are becoming alert to this and are becoming interested in
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:17.080]  alternative sources of opinion and that's all to the good and so that for
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:21.760]  instance September 22nd I'm told there's a big nationwide and the Fed rally and
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.600]  all the different Federal Reserve banks now now for me most of the time I feel
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:29.000]  like a lot of these demonstrations don't really do much but I make an exception
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.400]  to this because the very fact that there's a demonstration outside of
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:37.720]  Federal Reserve Bank makes people realize the Federal Reserve is something
[1:49:37.720 --> 1:49:41.480]  people actually have an opinion about and it makes them start realizing hey
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:45.080]  it's private and hey we're not just gonna protest the puppet Republicans and
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:49.720]  Democrats we're gonna go directly to the real puppeteer yeah exactly right
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:53.160]  exactly right because again establishment candidate a versus
[1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:57.080]  establishment candidate b isn't gonna change anything these people are none of
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:49:59.920]  them are gonna gonna dismantle the Federal Reserve that's their bread and
[1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:03.000]  butter none of them are gonna do any of these things so we have to go directly
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:07.840]  again we have to go directly to the public and say what is the thing the
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:11.720]  most important institution that is privileged by the government namely the
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:15.840]  Federal Reserve that you never hear about or if you do talk about it you are
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:19.680]  dismissed from polite society why is that why do you think it is that we're not
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:23.840]  supposed to talk about this again aroused people's curiosity that can't hurt
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:27.960]  now I again I don't know in the end game of all this how this turns out if we
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:31.680]  necessarily win maybe we went maybe we don't win well resistance is victory the
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:34.600]  level of turning will live under is what we put up with as Jefferson said I
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:40.440]  want to come back and talk about how we counter all of this but bottom line
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:43.720]  people are really starting to wake up as you were saying and as things get worse
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:47.800]  and worse that will only get other people to wake up stay with us we'll be
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:50.080]  right back
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:05.160]  we take a lot for granted lights water even food we eat but what if these things

[1:53:56.400 --> 1:54:08.140]  prepared calm
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:35.640]  Yeah, the federal government had decided we were all going to drive 55, and the people
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:39.480]  said we're not putting up with it, and it took 20 years, but now they're raising the
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:41.640]  speed limit up to 85 in Texas.
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:44.080]  Hey, the Germans can drive 150.
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:52.680]  A lot of the studies show that you get places quicker and there's actually less accidents,
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:55.280]  but you better not be texting while you're driving.
[1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:59.460]  The point is, the reason I wanted to play a little clip of that, is that it's an example
[1:54:59.460 --> 1:55:04.760]  of people just saying no, and culturally getting what's happening, abortions becoming incredibly
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:11.000]  unpopular, gun controls becoming incredibly unpopular, because people are just waking
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:14.280]  up and figuring out, hey, you don't want my guns to protect me.
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:17.160]  You want to make me your slave.
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:18.160]  And that's what's happening.
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:21.840]  Tom Woods is our guest, best-selling author, researcher.
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:25.640]  He's also been awarded Humanities Studies Fellowships, and he's taught at universities.
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:29.340]  I'm not going to go over the whole deal, but he has written the book, Nullification.
[1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:33.840]  We sell the DVD that he's in that is incredibly powerful.
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:35.920]  Nullificationinfowarstore.com.
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:36.920]  Hope you get it today.
[1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:38.600]  We've got about five minutes left.
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:40.560]  Look, I mean, I mentioned this.
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.640]  You've got the UN and globalists taking over with sustainable development and all the rest
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:48.360]  of it in towns everywhere, because no one's resisting them.
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:50.560]  They understand the power of the local.
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:54.840]  And so I tell listeners, just get out there with the truth and get in these parasites
[1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:55.840]  face.
[1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:57.880]  And they'll act like you're powerless up front.
[1:55:57.880 --> 1:55:58.880]  That's a mind game.
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:00.440]  The truth is, they're powerless.
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:01.440]  Tom Woods.
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:03.240]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:08.040]  And as you said earlier, the turnouts for these local elections are basically negligible.
[1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:10.320]  So this is, I mean, talk about low-hanging fruit.
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:14.120]  Forget about trying to run for Congress or something when you could get in the state
[1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:16.560]  Senate without all that much difficulty.
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:21.240]  And a lot of good, liberty-minded people will rally around you, and you don't need a gigantic
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:22.240]  budget.
[1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:27.280]  But if you are remotely charismatic and you know your stuff, then you can't actually stop
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:28.280]  these people.
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:32.320]  Because really, these people, they prosper in the darkness.
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:38.040]  They prosper by keeping their intentions quiet or off the table or masking them with cutesy
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:42.240]  saccharine-sounding language about the children and future generations, whatever.
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:47.280]  But they need that benign mask ripped off their faces by somebody who's knowledgeable and
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:49.200]  frankly, who can laugh at them.
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:54.280]  Humor is so important because these people like to be treated with deadly earnest.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:58.400]  And for us, just to treat them as just laughable nobodies, just gets under their skin.
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:00.520]  And to me, it's not enough to just, to fight them.
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:01.520]  I want to get under their skin.
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  You know, it's funny.
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:06.720]  I didn't understand that until a few years ago, 17 years on air, that they will ban our
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:13.240]  videos and file false claims on them when I make fun of a professor saying reduce humanity
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:19.080]  or I make fun of the TSA, they do, they do not like us laughing at them.
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  You're right.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:21.080]  Yeah.
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:23.720]  So I mean, basically everybody's got to do what he's got to do.
[1:57:23.720 --> 1:57:27.680]  And I know, you know, you have a huge audience and a lot of your audience feels like I'm
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:29.680]  already doing everything I can do.
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:30.920]  But maybe not everybody.
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:34.560]  Maybe, maybe it's, you have to, maybe you should be writing a blog or something instead
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:38.760]  of emailing 50 of your friends, your thoughts all the time, share your thoughts with the
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  world.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:43.840]  Start doing YouTube videos, start doing local access, put out a local newspaper, put out
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:46.080]  a newsletter at work, just start talking.
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:47.080]  Whatever.
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:48.080]  Yeah.
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:49.080]  Read a book with your friends, something.
[1:57:49.080 --> 1:57:53.880]  But I mean, we have an opportunity that hasn't been seen since Gutenberg to spread information.
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.480]  And if we don't take it, we have only ourselves.
[1:57:55.480 --> 1:58:00.200]  And that's why Obama now says the cyber security executive order to shut down free speech.
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:05.080]  He's now saying in executive order, Congress wouldn't do what he wanted.
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:07.920]  Well the executive order thing, I mean, we could do a whole show on that, but that is
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.600]  just so egregiously unconstitutional, but neither party will actually stop it.
[1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:16.480]  As long as my party's president is doing it, it's okay.
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:17.480]  All right.
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  Tom Woods, we're out of time.
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:19.480]  Will you come back and visit us soon?
[1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:20.480]  Be glad to.

[1:59:53.680 --> 2:00:05.640]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:10.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:17.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:27.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:42.520]  Well, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who's been in a lot of serious war zones and reported
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:45.560]  on some of the biggest stories of our time as a Pulitzer Prize winner.
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:49.920]  He is Chris Hedges on the website, truthdig.com.
[2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:56.440]  He has a new book out that we're going to be breaking down with him today, Days of Destruction,
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:00:57.440]  What Days of Revolt.
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:00:59.480]  I can't wait to read it.
[2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:01.680]  And he's saying, is revolt all we have left?
[2:01:01.680 --> 2:01:04.080]  Well, yeah, there are many forms of revolt.
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:09.320]  I mean, I went into, you know, basically preaching fit last hour, but it's effective.
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:10.320]  It shows my desperation.
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:15.280]  It's almost like my ghost dance here, wishing that we weren't going into such a fascist
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:17.280]  corporatist tyranny.
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:22.720]  But Chris Hedges joins us, one of the few real liberal voices that you can say is respectable
[2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:25.680]  and really makes sense and who doesn't compromise.
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:32.160]  It's very scary to see none of the main conservatives against torture, secret war, the end of the
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:34.760]  Bill of Rights, and really hardly any liberals.
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:38.800]  In fact, a lot of them love it because it's empowering their precious state that they
[2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:40.760]  don't understand as an our corporate instrument.
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:43.520]  Chris, we're about to go to break here in a few minutes, but I didn't want to waste
[2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:45.360]  any time getting you on.
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:48.560]  Great to have you here, sir.
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:50.480]  Tell us a little bit about the new book.
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:58.200]  Well, it goes to the sacrifice zones, the poorest pockets of the country that have been forced
[2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:02.680]  to kneel before unfettered corporate capitalism.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:09.120]  And it's a kind of warning because they went first and we're next as we allow these corporate
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:16.920]  forces to reconfigure the country into a form of neo-futilism, an oligarchic state backed
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:24.160]  by the most intrusive security, surveillance, apparatus, probably in the history of humankind.
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.520]  And I speak as somebody who covered the fall of East Germany, a very familiar with the
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:34.480]  Stasi state, and there are no impediments left.
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:41.000]  So it looks at places like Camden, New Jersey, which per capita is the poorest city in the
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  United States.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:48.280]  Not surprisingly, also one of the most dangerous, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, Lakota, Indian Reservation
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:54.480]  where the average life expectancy for a male is 48, that is the lowest in the western hemisphere
[2:02:54.480 --> 2:03:01.280]  outside of Haiti, the cold fields of southern West Virginia, one of the most minerally rich
[2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:06.960]  pockets of the United States and yet of course harbors the poorest population along with
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:12.680]  the terrible ecological devastation and finally the produce fields where these undocumented
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:17.560]  workers who are the perfect worker in the eyes of the corporate state because they have
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:25.480]  no legal rights, they can be abused, there are no benefits, they work day by day, they
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:29.160]  show up in collection centers, when they don't have enough work they speak out literally
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:33.760]  under mango trees in Florida, and then we finally end with the Occupy Movement which
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:41.160]  is again with the title of the book Days of Destruction, Days Revolt, that first bubbling
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:47.280]  I think of consciousness, of revolt, of a recognition that we have undergone a corporate
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:54.320]  coup d'état in slow motion and it's over, Citizens United probably nailed the last peg
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:59.400]  in the coffin and civil disobedience is I think all we have left.
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.040]  Now we're going to go to break here in a moment and come back and get into your case against
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:08.800]  the NDAA and all the amazing work you're engaged in and just some of the signposts that we
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:14.120]  see showing that for my view has been a conscious, rank corporation talked about it 15 years
[2:04:14.120 --> 2:04:19.520]  ago, construction of a system designed to implode the economy under a feudal system
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:25.880]  as you said, using poverty as political control because you can say what you want about America
[2:04:25.880 --> 2:04:30.640]  and what it's done the last 100 years, but even in the 40s, 50s, 60s there was a plan
[2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:36.400]  to build up the third world and stuff, now it is, no make everybody poor and have private
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:41.520]  cities the elites live in and it's such an evil mouth-thusian view, I want to get your
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:47.440]  well-traveled expert view on this from your perspective and talk about the book straight
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:52.440]  ahead after this break, amazing interview coming up with Chris Hedges, truthdig.com
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:56.160]  we'll tell you more about the book, days of destruction, days of revolt, I'm Alex Jones
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:00.680]  with infowars.com.
[2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:05.080]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest
[2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:10.520]  half year on record, 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions, not only corn,
[2:05:10.520 --> 2:05:15.160]  but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[2:05:15.160 --> 2:05:19.160]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:20.160]  food prices.
[2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:24.800]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting
[2:05:24.800 --> 2:05:27.800]  your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:31.680]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too, now
[2:05:31.680 --> 2:05:33.320]  is the time to get your supply.

[2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:23.840]  that's right it was Thomas Jefferson that said resistance to tyrants is obedience to
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:31.400]  God many other founders said similar things but the point is that we are going into a
[2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:38.040]  classical tyranny, no one can deny it, the NSA has been caught spying on everyone in
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:43.400]  live time totally illegal, there are resting people torturing in them, torturing their
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:48.680]  children in front of them, Bush rags about in his book and doesn't get in trouble even
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:53.840]  though his minions went to jail and now Obama has accelerated it and Romney signals he's
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:09:00.880]  going to accelerate it, we're in deep trouble, we've got an amazing guest joining us, Pulitzer
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:08.120]  Prize winning journalist who has covered you name it, the Stasi, the Russians and many
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:14.640]  tyrannies, he's been in high level coverage of negotiations all over the Middle East and
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:21.600]  he pursued earlier this year over the NDAA that Obama signed on December 31st when he
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:29.600]  thought no one was paying attention, 2011, he has a new book just out, days of destruction,
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:33.040]  days of revolt, we're going to talk about that, you've only got him to the bottom of
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:37.840]  the hour, he's again gracious to join us a very busy man and I want to talk about his
[2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:43.640]  NDAA suit that's having some success, I want to get his take on everything that's unfolding
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:48.680]  but now we have activists put on terror watchers preventing protesting DNC, turned out the
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:54.120]  Army, the ACLU, there's the ACLU press release just out yesterday on it, they got the document
[2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:59.800]  where the Army, DOD did it and they say in here that it's low level terrorism to protest
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:06.960]  and asked the court to keep him in jail because protesting is now illegal, we are seeing again
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:14.120]  the FBI caught with 12 million IDs of folks with Apple computers, here joining us to break
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:19.640]  it down is Chris Hedges who I don't really need to go over more of his bio here, most
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:27.200]  people know who he is or should know who he is but he joins us now, Chris what is the
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:29.240]  state of the world in your view?
[2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:34.880]  Well I think one of the things we have to be clear about is that the assault on civil
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:41.160]  liberties which began under the Bush administration has in fact been accelerated by the Obama
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:47.440]  administration, it's worse under Obama than under Bush, when you tick off all the things
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:53.160]  that the Obama administration has done over the last four years, refusal to restore habeas
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:11:00.640]  corpus, interpretation of the 2001 authorization to use military force act as giving the executive
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:05.840]  branch the right to assassinate American citizens, whatever you think of these figures like
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:11.080]  Onward Allaki the Yemeni cleric and of course the 16 year old son who was never accused
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:17.000]  of anything two weeks later, the FISA amendment act which I'm one of the plaintiffs but will
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:24.280]  be heard in the Supreme Court on October 29th which retroactively made legal but under our
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:29.760]  constitution has always been illegal, the warrantless wiretapping monitoring and eavesdropping
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:35.160]  of tens of millions of American citizens who have done nothing, been charged with no crime
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:40.480]  and we know that all of our personal information is now being stored out in super computers
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:47.400]  in Utah, the Obama administration has also employed six types, the espionage act which
[2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:53.440]  was never designed to ferret out whistle blowers as they are using it, these are people who
[2:11:53.440 --> 2:12:00.880]  have exposed war crimes in the case of the CIA official Sterling who purportedly leaked
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:08.400]  this information to Jim Ries at the New York Times, he's used it to essentially shut down
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:14.400]  anything that counters the official government narrative and I was an investigative reporter
[2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:18.360]  for the New York Times, I know many of the major investigative reporters and they will
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:24.480]  tell you that at this point investigating anything the government does has become impossible
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:29.840]  even on background briefings will no longer be given because people are scared of being
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:34.920]  charged with the espionage act as six officials have been charged which of course brings with
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:40.000]  it prison time and that just brings us to the National Defense Authorization Act which
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:46.240]  as you mentioned Alex was signed by the president on December 31st, New Year's Eve of course
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:51.400]  a moment when he thought we weren't looking, now the National Defense Authorization Act
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:59.080]  section 1021 authorizes the U.S. government or more specifically the executive branch
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:07.040]  to condemn or label an American citizen a terrorist and not only a terrorist but in
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:12.800]  the language of that section someone who has relationships with what they call associated
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:18.320]  forces a term that's never defined to use the military this is contravening 200 years
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:25.240]  of domestic law to detain these people hold them in military facilities strip them of
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:32.680]  due process and if the military so determines actually ship them to offshore penal colonies
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:38.680]  like Guantanamo and other black sites around the world in the language of this section
[2:13:38.680 --> 2:13:44.080]  until the end of hostilities whenever that is their age of permanent war that's a very
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:51.400]  long time we challenge that in federal and the southern district court of New York federal
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:59.960]  judge Catherine Forrest issued a temporary injunction in essence in validating that section
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:09.560]  of the NDA we had a final hearing the beginning of August and in which Judge Forrest it will
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:15.160]  now determine whether that temporary injunction will become permanent but we know how the
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:21.760]  Obama administration will respond if she invalidates that section of the NDA which of course I think
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:28.880]  she should they've already challenged the temporary injunction they will clearly challenge
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:36.960]  the permanent injunction if she rules that it is unconstitutional as it appears she will
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:40.160]  that will take it to an appellate court if they uphold the ruling it will go to the Supreme
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:45.600]  Court but all of this comes under the Obama administration and my frustration with self-professed
[2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:53.720]  liberals is that they're entranced with the rhetoric of Obama and utterly ignore the facts
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:15:01.640]  utterly ignore what he has done and as you mentioned earlier I think what we are seeing
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:09.280]  is in essence a rewriting of the legal code to criminalize any form of legitimate dissent
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:14.840]  and that's because the corporate state corporate power understands very well what's coming
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:19.520]  both in terms of the environmental crisis and the economic crisis and they want the
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:24.800]  legal mechanisms to shut it down you know it's interesting that in the August in the
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:31.720]  last hearing in Judge Forrest's courtroom she as the judge actually brought up the detention
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:40.680]  of 110,000 Japanese Americans who you know because of their ethnicity were sent to internment
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:47.560]  camps again without any kind of legal recourse and said that this section of the NDA essentially
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:53.760]  sets that precedent. We are now reaching the Alexander Sheldson Niedsen type moment asking
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:58.480]  will we burn later in the camps wishing we'd done something and now three months ago the
[2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:03.120]  army document came out for reeducation centers the army admitted in a press release that our
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:08.480]  document was real but we shouldn't have it in another public document for gun confiscation
[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:14.960]  during crises they're buying armored vehicles they bought 1.4 billion rounds of ammo the
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:22.120]  media spends it to say hey they need 174,000 rounds of ammo no it's 1.4 billion so we're
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.440]  seeing all sorts of propaganda Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist who's covered
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:30.200]  police states worldwide Chris Hedges joins us we're going to talk about his book here
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:34.200]  in a moment we're going to skip this network break so we have more time with him what is
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:38.400]  the ruling class thinking because we've always had different corrupt elites and things but
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:42.960]  there was still an understanding even for the ultra wealthy and powerful that you want
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:49.160]  checks and balances going back to Magna Carta because other elites can come in and rob you
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:53.600]  and that nobody wants to live in a society that's not free I mean free societies are
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:59.320]  more productive they're happier they're better what has happened to the ruling class that
[2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:06.920]  they're going I mean the Stalin Mao Hitler route I mean this is I mean earlier in the
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:10.240]  shorter segment I'd like you to recap that you pointed out you've covered a lot of historical
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:16.080]  events that happened as they happen this is one of the nastiest most scientifically crafted
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:22.400]  over the top I mean so many things that are in 1984 have now been surpassed and now they're
[2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:26.600]  getting ready for the physical roundups I don't think people understand you haven't
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:31.840]  looked at history like you and others have just how dark it is is my point yeah I mean
[2:17:31.840 --> 2:17:36.400]  in the language of patriotism these people are traitors and that's the difference as
[2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:40.920]  you point out between the older ruling elite and I come out of the working class they were
[2:17:40.920 --> 2:17:46.600]  certainly no friends to working men and women frankly but they cared about the sustenance
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:52.320]  of the nation the new ruling elite is global it in the language of business is quite willing
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:58.240]  to harvest the nation that's how you've seen manufacturing jobs shipped overseas and you
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:03.000]  look at labor conditions in southern China where Apple products I mean all sorts of products
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:08.400]  that we buy are made and it's out of Dick and Sony in England you know 70 hour work
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:16.240]  weeks abusive conditions you know no labor protection and what they tell now workers
[2:18:16.240 --> 2:18:22.200]  around the world is that in order to be competitive they have to be competitive in essence with
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:27.960]  prison labor in China or sweatshop workers in Bangladesh who make 22 cents an hour exactly
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:33.960]  where Foxcom that Apple uses or being lectured by Al Gore here domestically they have to put
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:40.000]  suicide nets up yeah you know what happens is when they don't meet their quotas and
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:46.560]  there's a good book by a Berkeley sociologist who's the Chinese origin or when wrote about
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:51.240]  it when wrote about these conditions when they don't meet their quotas and they don't
[2:18:51.240 --> 2:18:55.880]  make the profits there are workers who will work and actually not be paid and at the end
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:19:00.640]  of the month they will climb up to the roof of these overcrowded dormitories and jump off
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:08.640]  and commit suicide and that's the world that these corporations have created I mean they
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:12.720]  and that's the difference between the old robber barons the Rockefellers the melons
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:17.640]  the Carnegie's and the new robber barons who are quite willing to sacrifice the nation
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:24.360]  indeed are for profit they you know they when they do their speculative gambling on Wall
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:29.640]  Street and their bubbles crash they loot the US Treasury and then they make the rest of
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:33.880]  us pay for it through austerity programs you see the same thing in Europe because of course
[2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:40.480]  it's a global corporate movement so that when Papandreou in Greece announces okay you want
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:44.440]  to start I'm going to put it to a referendum he's gone within a week and he's replaced
[2:19:44.440 --> 2:19:53.000]  with a banker technocrat that you know that that is essentially pliable and a puppet
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:58.040]  of the banks and of the corporate interest this is a global phenomena we're not exempt
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:05.400]  from it and and and and and these these essentially narrow oligarchic corporate forces that we
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:08.600]  see it you know they make all their money here and then they move overseas so they don't
[2:20:08.600 --> 2:20:13.240]  have to pay any taxes well they're moving to armored redoubts on on Pacific islands
[2:20:13.240 --> 2:20:18.280]  and admitting they are and they're bragging that they're converting us to a tyranny and
[2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:23.320]  training the police that we're their enemy I mean this is a nightmare scenario and and
[2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:28.800]  the attitude is Americans are uppity we're going to bring you down we're going to cut
[2:20:28.800 --> 2:20:33.760]  you down to size while lecturing people who are on welfare because they've destroyed the
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:40.680]  jobs base while they are the biggest recipients of corporate welfare contracts bailouts and
[2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:45.480]  then in Europe I've looked at the numbers almost all of the real debt is owed by the
[2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:50.200]  big zombie banks and they've done this trick of convincing everyone that the Europeans
[2:20:50.200 --> 2:20:55.840]  are lazy and now today they're reporting that they want Greeks to work six-day work weeks
[2:20:55.840 --> 2:21:00.640]  and then most the money is to be paid to the bankers that Greece is having to hand their
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:09.320]  islands over to yeah well that's precisely it and you know that they they will corporations
[2:21:09.320 --> 2:21:14.200]  know only one word and that's more and they are going to push and push and push you know
[2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:20.200]  like all sort of elites that have unplugged themselves from the reality around them they're
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:26.200]  woefully out of touch with what most Americans are undergoing and and and it is always the
[2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:33.200]  ruling elites that finally determine the parameters and configurations of revolt revolt and rebellion
[2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:38.960]  and you know they because they have not responded rationally as the columnist Paul Krugman writes
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:44.160]  week after week to both the economic and political crisis it means that there will be a better
[2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:49.760]  backlash what exactly it will look like how it will appear when it will appear I don't
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:54.480]  know I've covered you know the revolutions in Eastern Europe uprisings in Palestine
[2:21:54.480 --> 2:21:59.800]  the war in Yugoslavia but I do know especially having spent the last two years on this book
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:06.520]  in the poorest pockets of the United States without any question that is coming and the
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:12.240]  establishment knows that and is making preparations for it I think to use that crisis as a pretext
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:19.360]  to grab even more power if you expand on this out into the future what type of world do
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:25.920]  you think the ultra rich who are obviously monopoly capitalist what type of world are
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:33.920]  they planning on building in essence a kind of feudal system where you have a tiny filthy
[2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:42.480]  rich oligarchically a small sort of core of corporate managers public relations people
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:47.720]  propaganda and then the rest of us hanging on by our fingertips and you know interestingly
[2:22:47.720 --> 2:22:54.920]  enough this completely replicates the political and economic structure that Orwell painted
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:23:00.040]  in 1984 with Oceana where you had an inner party of two to four percent an outer party
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:04.440]  of about twelve percent of the rest are what he calls parole that that's already I mean
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:08.600]  all you have to do is look out your window at a decaying infrastructure closing schools
[2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:16.000]  closing fire departments you know closing libraries a long term unemployment and under
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:23.960]  employment coupled with you know this this kind of constant sustenance of criminal enterprise
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:29.160]  I mean look at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs is bailed out every penny on the dollar by
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:34.880]  the American taxpayer and now we give them in essence zero percent interest loans so
[2:23:34.880 --> 2:23:38.200]  that they can gamble I don't know what it is it's not capitalism I don't even know
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:43.840]  what and then to loan it back to us at 1020 30 or more percent and they often don't loan
[2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:48.720]  talk to any small businessman they can't get loans I mean and why should the banks loan
[2:23:48.720 --> 2:23:53.080]  they've got all the money they could ever want taxpayer back money expanding on this
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:24:00.360]  I went and saw the next Jesus film that the 2016 Obama's America and and they were saying
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:07.000]  that Obama was anti-colonialist when really I see this is a new colonialism where it's
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:11.760]  these mega banks and mega elites that are destroying the nation states that were the
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:17.720]  old cores of the empire not just exploiting the third world they've brought the cancer
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:24.160]  home but then they spin it that Obama is an anti-colonialist and so that's why he's doing
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:27.840]  what he's doing I mean it's an amazing spin yeah I would agree with you and you know we
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:33.800]  actually call the places that you know places like him an internal colonnades because it
[2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:39.640]  is a form of colonialism and you know just to go back to your point earlier about the
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:45.800]  militarization of police you know I think when you look at the the war on so-called war
[2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:51.000]  on drugs you see that the portal the way they entered it so that if there's a night raid
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:58.600]  now in Oakland you have Kevlar plated command helicopters command centers people dressed
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  in black carrying m16s it looks no difference from a night raid in Fallujah and that's the
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:13.480]  point that as the disintegration continues the more brutal forms of control that are
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:21.880]  used on the outer reaches of empire migrate back to the heart of empire and the major
[2:25:21.880 --> 2:25:28.240]  corporations then plan to even implode the old homelands and then just have a giant squalor
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:34.840]  that they rule over from private heavily armed redoubts and cities and that's now even their
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:40.440]  admitted plan the ran corporation is saying what a hellish vision what a hellish world
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:45.480]  it sounds like something the devil would come up with yeah and you have corporations like
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:50.680]  bechtel buying up all the clean water in chili and other places because they know that pretty
[2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:56.680]  soon water you know water for most of us will be contaminated we'll have to pay for it just
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:01.240]  like everything else yeah I mean they they you know if you sit down inside the NSA or
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:05.560]  any other they're sort of analysis of where we're going is not going to be much different
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:11.640]  from yours or mine it is just doesn't make it out into the mainstream well that's right
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:17.000]  I've got British Ministry of Defense reports Pentagon reports admitting a hellish world
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:23.320]  and then if I cover it the media calls it pessimism porn won't this be the defining
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:28.760]  moment when your case goes to the Supreme Court if they don't uphold the Constitution I mean
[2:26:28.760 --> 2:26:33.160]  this will be overthrowing Magna Carta habeas corpus I mean this is probably one of the
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:38.760]  biggest cases ever what is it like to be at the center of this well it's sort of
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:44.200]  bizarre in a sense because I agree with you I mean it is and the judge agrees with us
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:51.960]  that this is just this amazing attempt to essentially strip us of of of the rule of
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:56.840]  law due process and yet it doesn't get covered it doesn't get covered because both the Republicans
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:27:01.960]  and the Democrats are essentially beholden to corporate power and the security and surveillance
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:07.160]  state I mean this was a bipartisan effort is sponsored by Carl Levin and John McCain
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:15.000]  and so because the media won't step outside these very narrow parameters which essentially
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:22.360]  stretch from A to B that's what's done me the most how egregious the assault is how naked the
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:27.720]  assault is and how it's virtually uncovered I mean the New York Times did write a good editorial
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:33.240]  about it after the temporary injunction was issued but you know you know if you look on
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:37.880]  the airwaves it doesn't exist and yet you have all these people sort of shouting about the
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:46.760]  Constitution and civil liberties and and here in an incredibly overt attempt to to take away
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:56.920]  you know our right to trial silence and now I see a lot of conservatives going along with this
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:28:01.080]  when the government's now said don't worry about al-Qaeda and we're going to use them and others
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:07.080]  to take down Syria and Libyan places but you know the new enemy is domestic threats and they're out
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:12.360]  like they've done with Muslims provocaturing you know militia groups in Michigan and things
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:17.960]  trying to get some type of civil war going so they can now target the American people as the
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:23.800]  enemy this is very cold-blooded and I don't think it is a left-right issue you know you know the
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:29.960]  American conservative just ran a long article called in defense of Bradley Manning raising
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:37.000]  precisely these points and that's why I think that you know the political theater of the Republicans
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:49.240]  and the Democrats you know is really a kind of a mass money drenched spectacle that diverts us from
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:55.720]  debating yes issues that I don't think that you know really you know for anybody who cares about
[2:28:55.720 --> 2:29:00.280]  the rule of law and the democratic state no matter what your political opinion is there
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:04.360]  should be any divide on it all well that's right we're all Americans we're all humans and if America
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:09.480]  becomes this pure tyranny boy the world better look out if they think we've been doing bad stuff so
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:14.600]  far Chris look out you know I know you've got to go I'll talk to you briefly during the break if
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:19.320]  you can stay five more I want to come back and talk about the book but if not folks no no sure let's
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:24.040]  let's do it okay days of destruction days of revolt I have not read it yet I will read it because
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:29.880]  let me tell you when I see Chris Hedges videos online he's focused he knows what he's talking
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:34.920]  about he's articulate I get mad just yelling scream I wish I was like him but then I'm just a
[2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:39.080]  constitutionalist I want my bill of rights I want my constitution if that's liberal that's
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:43.720]  conservative then that's what I am but I just love Chris Hedges and he's so so so good to come on
[2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:47.640]  and talk about this with us we'll be right back to talk about his book for a few minutes stay with us

[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:30.280]  okay we've got about uh six seven minutes left with mr hedges uh holding over with us
[2:33:30.280 --> 2:33:35.000]  Pulitzer prize winning author journalist who's covered some of the most dangerous places in the
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:39.160]  world and he's saying that well what he sees here in america i wanted to expand on that
[2:33:39.160 --> 2:33:43.960]  is the worst he's ever seen so far i wanted to elaborate on that because because it's intriguing
[2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:49.880]  if i went over his bio here for folks that may not know who chris hedges is he's he's been
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:54.200]  in over 50 countries he's covered the big battle zones he's covered world leaders he's covered the
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:34:01.000]  the the stasi and their activities just amazing he's got a new book out that we're going to be
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:05.400]  obviously breaking down as soon as i get a chance to read it days of destruction days of revolt
[2:34:05.400 --> 2:34:11.800]  but i wanted him to go over uh basically what the book covers because earlier he started mentioning
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:16.280]  that it's a reservation program and i've interviewed a lot of native americans who've gone over the
[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:22.200]  history and they point out that indian policy became what hitler used and i'd actually read that
[2:34:22.200 --> 2:34:27.480]  in hitler's own writings that he used that model of the concentration camp off the reservation the
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:33.960]  company's store that keeps control of the people keeps them in poverty uh their life expectancy
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:39.240]  and that that's the whole model now of this corporate state get rid of your jobs and then give
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:45.000]  you a pittance to barely even keep you at subsistence destroying destinies destroying societies
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:50.840]  so you can control them and now the corporate state doesn't want even free market competition
[2:34:50.840 --> 2:34:55.480]  it's coming in with regulations shutting down what's left of our industry i mean it's a cold
[2:34:55.480 --> 2:35:01.480]  blooded systematic military style takeover so chris a breakdown your new book which i can't
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.160]  wait to read days of destruction days of revolt well yeah i mean alex i think you nailed it i
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:13.480]  mean that's why we begin with pine ridge because that's where it all began uh and originally uh
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:19.640]  you know those reservations were openly called prisoner or war camps uh and you're right they
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:25.480]  they make uh self-sufficiency impossible and create this kind of culture of dependence
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:33.720]  uh which destroys dignity self-worth uh community uh with all of the attendant problems that's why
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:40.760]  you have an 80 percent estimated 80 percent alcoholism rate on pine ridge uh and everywhere we went
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:45.400]  whether it was camden whether it was uh southern west virginia where people are taking oxy cotton
[2:35:45.400 --> 2:35:54.040]  what they call hillbilly heroin uh you know they uh they they they the the sort of the drugs and the
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:59.880]  uh alcohol anesthetize people to the kind of pain and the suffering to which they have been
[2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:05.560]  reduced and i think the reservation model is in fact uh one that we spent a lot of time reporting
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:13.000]  on and looking at uh for precisely that reason uh you know when you reduce people to a level
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:20.040]  uh of desperation uh it becomes uh far easier to control them uh and that's what we're seeing
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:26.440]  i mean you know just all sorts of just in the last few weeks uh the refusal to uh restore
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:31.400]  unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of americans which means tens of thousands of
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:39.080]  these people will eventually lose their homes uh a number now over six million uh you know that
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:45.080]  there's just the obama care is another example uh it's a corporate uh essentially the equivalent
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:51.160]  of the bank bailout bill for the pharmaceutical and insurance industry is 470 uh seven billion
[2:36:51.160 --> 2:36:56.360]  dollars in subsidies and of course they can keep as anyone such as myself knows who doesn't have a
[2:36:56.360 --> 2:37:01.880]  company plan keep jacking up copayments and premiums and i've got interrupts see you're the only
[2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:05.640]  scholar out there on the so-called left but you're just a human who wants freedom who's
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:10.360]  honest at the insurance companies wrote it and then the right wing gives obama cover and goes
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:15.240]  how dare you want to make us commies when the whole thing was written to let corporations
[2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:21.320]  control the quality of care make you buy their product and jack up the price i mean it's such a
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:26.520]  fraud but then you've got all the people on the left who mean well supporting it through ignorance
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:34.840]  yeah it is it is uh i mean you know that this is i think a very telling piece of legislation
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:39.800]  because it was written in the heritage foundation it was first put into practice by mit romney when
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:46.680]  he was governor in 2006 in massachusetts and then adopted by barack obama incredible care is obama
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:53.640]  care and that is a kind of window into the kind of false debates uh that go back and forth because
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:38:00.440]  both of these two political parties uh you know are slavishly devoted to corporate interests uh
[2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:08.360]  obama uh obama care is essentially forcing us to buy defective corporate product a for-profit
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:14.200]  product it's staggering and what is the revolt angle of the book because again i haven't had a
[2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:18.360]  chance to uh read again i'm in order today i think it's just this understanding that
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:25.320]  we the formal mechanisms of power are not going to uh defend uh civil liberties or our interests
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:31.880]  or institute the kinds of reforms that will bring back the kind of egalitarian society
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:37.560]  that i think we all want that that uh now resistance has to come outside those formal
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:43.400]  mechanisms of power that means acts of civil disobedience i was arrested with occupy protesters
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:48.680]  in front of goldman sacks go into jails more time than i care to donate to the federal government
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:56.040]  um but i don't i don't think we have any option left and um i'm not naive enough to even promise
[2:38:56.040 --> 2:39:01.400]  you that it will work uh but i can tell you that the system is so corrupt uh you know you take
[2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:07.640]  new york city police and you look closely most of the egregious assaults against protesters
[2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:13.400]  were carried out by the white shirted uh officers who are earning about 110 000 a year there was a
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:18.840]  lot of fraternization with the blue uniform police because these corporations hire them like
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:25.400]  goldman sacks and city bank as rena cups for private security for 37 an hour in their off time so
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.520]  they can uh you know make some money well goldman sacks gave him what was it was some giant amount
[2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:36.920]  of money the week before as a pure gift right to the police a public bribe yeah a jp morgan i think
[2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:42.360]  it was yeah jp morgan was like exactly i mean and i think you know when i covered the fall of east
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:48.040]  germany what happens is when the foot soldiers are no longer willing to defend the elite you
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:52.440]  know when eric hannaker the dictator in east germany sent down an elite paratroop division
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:58.040]  to leipzig where i was and they wouldn't fire on the crowd hannaker lasted another week in power
[2:39:58.040 --> 2:40:06.360]  and i think that uh you know in fact uh part of the reason i'm guessing that the ndaa was pushed
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:11.800]  through i think is because there's a kind of fear among these corporate oligarchs that the police
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:15.640]  won't protect them well that's one of my final questions here i got a few to race through i want
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:19.880]  to know what else is in the book uh so so people will definitely get it because your ideas are
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:26.280]  you're right on for my own research but so well laid out that was my next issue i'll guarantee you
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:31.080]  that if things continue to implode the people they know that aren't going to shut up and go along
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:37.960]  or people like chris edges people like alex jones people that they know are controlled by conscience
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:41.960]  not because i'm some goody two shoes but because i don't want to live in a fascist state i mean i
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:47.240]  want my children to have a future and they're really trying to set the precedent for this
[2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:54.040]  as they force people into a revolt kind of arresting and which they admit scooping up people
[2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:59.800]  that they see as leaders yeah i mean i think that you once you create that legal mechanism
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:05.720]  that essentially permits that are given to the state that kind of power then you're in really
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:11.480]  serious trouble they use it on marginal elements within the society first muslims black black
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:17.320]  anarchists whatever militia members um but you don't want to give them that kind of legal power
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:23.960]  uh which we unfortunately we've already done uh because uh they they use the sort of fringe
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:29.800]  elements as a way to justify that kind of power and then they turn it on the rest of us that's
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:36.600]  exactly right in history has just borne that out you know in conflict after conflict that that i've
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:42.280]  covered and watched what about geopolitically it seems like uh the world is kind of waking up to
[2:41:42.280 --> 2:41:48.840]  the fact that the united states has been seized by very evil forces yeah i mean you know i was
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:53.240]  quite an opponent of the invasion of iraq on that issue uh and i i had been the middle east
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:42:00.760]  bureau chief of the new york times uh because uh you know it was not only uh you know a tactical
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:05.800]  blunder but probably one of the most strategic blunders we made in essence throwing the balance
[2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:13.720]  of power to iran um uh yeah i think that unfortunately you know we don't have a lot of friends left
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:22.920]  uh because of i think very misguided uh imperial projects uh that again of course i mean the war
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:28.760]  in afghanistan which let's be frank we're losing uh you know there are a handful of corporations
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:35.320]  uh halliburton and and uh rafian and on and on and on that for whom this they make money is in all
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:40.520]  wars could the anglo-american establishment kind of stall and not have a burlin wall moment but
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:48.440]  just kind of collapse like the suviate union i i mean it's all it's that's the big question i mean
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:54.760]  collapse is coming how does it come does it does it come gradually is there kind of a slow decline
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:43:02.360]  like the ottoman empire does it implode um these are questions that uh uh i ask all the time but i
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:06.520]  don't have a definitive answer well i think they're going to try to go hitler crazy and launch a bunch
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:12.200]  of wars that are so bad everybody kind of lines up because we're in so much trouble well yeah the
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:16.840]  government's corrupt but we're you know fighting russia and china now so let's line up we just lost
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:22.760]  500 000 people i mean i i i think the elite are that crazy and and the way they're digging in the
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:27.720]  way they're getting everything ready looks like they're gearing up for world war three at a scale
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:34.520]  much bigger than the cold war the cog the armored pillboxes the the weapons cashing studying history
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:40.200]  chris and closing i'm not just trying to be a fearmonger here i'm scared i mean i've i've studied
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:45.080]  history i'm a history buff and they're digging in for what looks like not just a war with the people
[2:43:45.080 --> 2:43:51.000]  but a war with everybody else well you know that says randolph born said in world war one
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:56.120]  he said war is the health of the state by which he meant that when the state declares war
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:44:01.720]  you're right everybody lines up behind it you know in the name of patriotism and everything else
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:07.320]  and it isn't a very effective measure as it was in world war one to essentially crush any form of
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:13.240]  dissent so uh yeah you're right i mean the history has has shown that to be a very effective tactic
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:21.080]  for despotic states to channel uh energy uh enrage and mute internal dissent by creating an
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:25.720]  internal enemy and going after it yeah it's i don't i don't put it past them well hopefully your
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:30.280]  book will wake people up and i know it's got amazing illustrations and it tells a little bit
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:34.360]  about the book that you haven't covered and about the cartoonist that you worked with and this is
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:41.080]  joe sacco who uh is an amazing reporter in his own right does whole graphic novels that he reports
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:49.720]  out uh we met in bosnia in uh 1995 and uh i think one of the reasons i found him so important in the
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:56.120]  book 50 pages of illustrations as well as comic panels sort of profiling people's lives is that
[2:44:56.120 --> 2:45:01.160]  so many of these americans by the corporate media have been rendered invisible and i think one of
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:06.280]  the goals of the book was to make them visible and sacco did that gave the book a kind of punch
[2:45:06.280 --> 2:45:14.120]  that pure pros wouldn't have had do you have hope for the future i mean would you say it's a 60%
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:20.120]  chance we're going to go into this total tyranny or is it a 70% or a 20% i mean what's your there's
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:25.240]  few people who've traveled more seen more reported on more uh so i really respect your view on this
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:30.920]  i know our listeners do i mean looking into that crystal ball what's our odds i think it looks pretty
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:37.480]  bleak um but i don't think we can use the word hope unless we active really resist every way
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:44.920]  possible you know which is why you know i was in protests outside goldman sex uh why i sued barack
[2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:52.280]  obama and leon panetta over the ndaa i think it's a kind of moral imperative to resist uh and um
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:58.360]  but at the same time you know a very sort of sober view of it it doesn't look great have you been
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:05.720]  threatened um yeah but over my opposition to the iraq war and then interestingly by black black anarchists
[2:46:06.280 --> 2:46:11.560]  who i've been very critical of well i've yeah most of them are run my feds well chris hedges
[2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:19.240]  oh yeah i mean that's what i found from my research uh again uh your website uh is also a great place
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:25.320]  for people uh to visit uh tell us about your website truth dig yeah this is bob shear's website out of
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:29.720]  la i write a column every monday for them all right well thank you so much chris thank you alex
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:34.600]  all right there he goes i ended up spending more time with us man i wish he was wrong i wish i was
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:42.360]  wrong you know last hour i kind of went into this ranting rage about the tyranny we face um but i mean
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:50.200]  i've bet my family that we can beat this i mean i let me tell you if i didn't think we could turn
[2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:55.800]  this around i would leave the united states not that somewhere else would be perfect but i would get
[2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:01.800]  out of the fight because let me tell you something the people running things have made a friend with
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:08.120]  evil they have decided that they're going to rule the world they've got the power they've got this
[2:47:08.120 --> 2:47:14.120]  historic moment they're going to use it and we've got to decide we've got our historic moment as human
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:20.440]  beings that stand for freedom and justice to resist these people because you know chris hedges talks
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:24.440]  about how they want to render us impotent and where we can't have jobs in the future that is the
[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:31.640]  policy of the globalist and you know obama is not anti-colonialist colonialism became what you call
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:38.360]  globalist and then the right wing packages anti-colonialist as communist when the communists
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:42.920]  are actually running their own form of collectivist colonialism that then implodes and is taken over
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:47.160]  by the bankers i mean we're facing such a sophisticated situation people say well are you
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:53.640]  for occupier against it the globalist talked about occupy because their computers were able
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:58.680]  to predict that there would be flare-ups at that moment against the banks and that people knew
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:03.640]  that the banker bailouts were a corporate transference of wealth from the people to the elite
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:11.400]  just a robbery a private taxation mechanism so they announced everybody who's mad at corruption
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:17.400]  wall street show up then the democratic operative show up but a lot of other activists as well
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:22.200]  sorrows is unable to take control of it that was going to be kind of the revolutionary arm of the
[2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:27.960]  obama second election but with the corporates running it the occupy folks got wise to that
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:35.160]  didn't work so then they flushed them and obama in what 37 locations nationwide and in multiple
[2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:42.280]  whole bunch of states 14 states had people arrested in midnight raids with the directed by the feds
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:48.200]  folks when your police are being directed by feds to scoop up protesters you're not in
[2:48:48.200 --> 2:48:52.840]  kansas anymore you're in a dangerous police state and what people don't get is well i don't care if
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:57.800]  i'm a police state i want cops and guys with machine guns on every corner because it's for al-qaeda
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:03.640]  but see it's not for al-qaeda now it's for you and it's because they're planning to take your bank
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:08.600]  account they're planning to devalue your dollar they're planning to take your pension fund and
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:13.000]  i don't mean the government pension fund i'm talking about your private ones they're already doing
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.480]  that in europe putting taxes on them and stuff i mean i've got the financial news on europe i'm
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:26.280]  going to get to after um well i guess dr stallman's joining us i'm almost out of time where is my
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:32.520]  financial stack i mean we just hit a few of these right now this is so serious folks and for the
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:38.200]  minions that are serving this we're not coming back from this okay you notice the deeper we get into
[2:49:38.200 --> 2:49:45.720]  globalism nafta gad any of it things get worse because it's meant to be bad they write white
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:54.280]  papers on it it's horrible it's not my opinion we're signing on to evil it's happened the same
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:50:03.880]  robber barren family's funding hitler okay we're in trouble these elites put mal into power because
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:09.880]  they wanted to have a strong guy take over our government put mal said tongue into power that's
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:16.600]  been declassified for about 10 years i just got chills saying that do you realize under under
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:24.440]  globalist funding he killed the chinese say 85 million people the cia says 64 million
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:33.400]  man they they aren't playing games they want to reorganize and kind of erase the disc clear
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:38.840]  the table in america and europe and they are lining up the troops in the military to do it
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:46.520]  and uh they're gonna do most of it with starvation and man i just don't want to go down this road
[2:50:46.520 --> 2:50:51.480]  i mean they've got america in the guillotine and i'm saying let's get our head out of here
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:58.040]  and let's get our neck out of this thing let's wake up and say no no no no

[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:41.480]  make them weak they'd kill the strongest members they'd kill people that tried to lead um and again
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:46.280]  that was done to a minority that that's how cultures always do it but then it ends up getting
