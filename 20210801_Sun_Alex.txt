[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  It's Sunday August 1st the year
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.520]  is 2021. I'm your host Alex Jones back in studio. Thank you so much for joining us on this special
[00:37.880 --> 00:45.160]  Sunday evening. If you go to the front page of info wars.com you will see today's headline that we
[00:45.160 --> 00:51.960]  have the live show feed posted in and it's quite a shocking headline. The British government
[00:51.960 --> 01:21.560]  officially warns that 2.6 billion plus people that 2.6 billion people may die as a result of
[01:22.360 --> 01:31.480]  the mutations coming from the so-called COVID-19 vaccines that are really just genetically modified
[01:31.480 --> 01:37.480]  injections. If you can crew put that headline back up there one more time I want that headline to
[01:37.480 --> 01:43.080]  sink in because this isn't just fear porn this is what they're planning emergency alert British
[01:43.080 --> 01:50.920]  government warns COVID vaccine induced mutations may kill 2.6 billion people and that's been the
[01:50.920 --> 01:58.680]  plan all along. If you just joined us we have everybody from the Washington Post to CNN to Fox
[01:58.680 --> 02:09.240]  News to the Wall Street Journal to Bill Maher saying the vaccines don't work and the majority of
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.800]  people sick and majority people in hospital majority people dying have had their COVID injections
[02:15.800 --> 02:23.080]  and I've got the government statistics from Israel from Singapore from the UK from Canada
[02:23.080 --> 02:27.960]  from the United States from all the countries around the world in fact the only sick people
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.440]  in Sweden are the vaccinated the zero deaths their illnesses in Sweden from unvaccinated.
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.240]  So here's the more incredible point and I'm really wrapping my brain around this war game
[02:41.240 --> 02:47.320]  but remember crimson contagion that we covered four or five months ago that got millions 10
[02:47.320 --> 02:52.040]  million views or so general Flynn said it was the best work he'd seen on COVID all we were doing
[02:52.040 --> 02:57.720]  was going over the war game from three and a half years ago put up by the Rockefellers and others
[02:58.280 --> 03:02.120]  saying they would inject people with this vaccine everybody would get sick
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.720]  and then out of that would collapse civilization
[03:05.720 --> 03:11.160]  the spars pandemic and then the crimson contagion
[03:13.160 --> 03:19.720]  emergency saturday broadcast world shot by spars 2025 2028 document it's the spars
[03:19.720 --> 03:22.280]  document and then that's carried on into crimson contagion
[03:22.280 --> 03:33.000]  and there it is again needs 50 million views but almost 4 million views on band.video
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.240]  all right i'm going to really try to control myself here today and i'm really going to try
[03:41.240 --> 03:49.640]  to judiciously cover this as best i can a chris sky there's a very smart businessman and a patriot
[03:49.640 --> 03:56.600]  from canada who has really been topping twitter the last week with his prediction of the endless
[03:56.600 --> 04:03.160]  lockdown with total precision he'll be joining us by the hour and then mike adams who was the
[04:03.160 --> 04:09.960]  first person i heard talk about the so-called vaccine triggering this specific type of auto
[04:09.960 --> 04:16.040]  immune response that now even fox news is having to admit is real and taking place that's coming up
[04:16.040 --> 04:22.040]  today so tonight this is going to be an incredible transmission and then i'm going to co-host part
[04:22.040 --> 04:29.000]  of the sunday live show that elin normally host with the great harris and smith the host of
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.920]  american journal eight a.m weekdays well from six to eight tonight he's going to be hosting and
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.280]  i'm going to host part of that with him because i've got so much on my plate i know there's no
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.440]  way i'm going to get done with all of it in the first two hours so chris sky coming up mike
[04:42.440 --> 04:49.800]  adams coming up i'm yours truly alec shones and just this information i studied today like six
[04:49.800 --> 04:56.520]  hours and when i almost fell down i got dizzy when i contemplated when i stood up almost had a nervous
[04:56.520 --> 05:08.760]  breakdown there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on that
[05:08.760 --> 05:14.600]  it's criminals aren't extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same things
[05:14.600 --> 05:20.120]  over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[05:21.160 --> 05:29.480]  well guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout of hiv and the
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.960]  mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and
[05:33.960 --> 05:39.240]  they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t1
[05:39.240 --> 05:45.560]  besides the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.440]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the
[05:50.440 --> 05:55.720]  covet 19 and the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[05:55.720 --> 06:07.480]  basically giving you the equivalent of a shot v that's right ladies and gentlemen
[06:11.320 --> 06:20.360]  antibody dependent enhancement that's the term you're going to get to know real real well
[06:20.360 --> 06:27.480]  when your friends your family and you bleed out and die in the near future
[06:29.320 --> 06:36.520]  there are treatments that are now being developed and tested that can save some people
[06:38.120 --> 06:45.160]  and that's why the uk government just ordered a record amount of anti blood clotting agents
[06:45.160 --> 06:53.160]  three billion pounds worth that orders much bigger than anyone in their history obviously
[06:53.160 --> 07:00.280]  because they know what they've already done to you antibody dependent enhancement
[07:02.440 --> 07:04.600]  suddenly they're even talking about it on cnn
[07:07.960 --> 07:13.560]  and that's just one of the things in hundreds of studies many of which were conducted by Dr.
[07:13.560 --> 07:26.120]  Fauci we discover that almost all of the different types of mammals that they injected with similar
[07:26.120 --> 07:29.400]  vaccines that target spike proteins on coronaviruses
[07:32.440 --> 07:37.880]  that in almost every case the animals die within a few months of being given the injection
[07:37.880 --> 07:44.680]  and it can be extrapolated out the humans in the physiological differences would
[07:44.680 --> 07:50.680]  die in a few years that's how Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and so many other respected medical doctors came
[07:50.680 --> 07:56.520]  on this show and said you will see antibody dependent enhancement
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.640]  by the first fall and winter after the injections and now it's already beginning
[08:03.640 --> 08:11.560]  all right i'm Alex Jones your host this is a live sunday august 1st 2021 transmission
[08:12.760 --> 08:19.720]  and let me just start right here with the big announcement it is not debated by the cdc it
[08:19.720 --> 08:25.720]  is not debated by the NIH national institute of health it is not debated by the NIH
[08:25.720 --> 08:33.720]  or the british national health service or any of the major governments in the world
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.160]  that the so-called COVID-19 vaccinations whether they be a virus vector
[08:44.040 --> 08:50.280]  from johnson and johnson or aster zenica or whether they be an mRNA from aderna or phycer
[08:50.280 --> 08:57.640]  all of them make you get COVID and make you shed COVID and make you create deadly variants and
[08:57.640 --> 09:04.520]  doesn't work it doesn't lessen how bad your sickness is all of it was a lie and it turns out they knew
[09:04.520 --> 09:11.080]  from hundreds of prestigious studies and government initiatives university of texas
[09:11.080 --> 09:17.720]  wasn't studies it was a four-year initiative of seven universities led by the university of texas
[09:17.720 --> 09:24.440]  where they gave all sorts of spike protein vaccines for coronaviruses to rats ferrets
[09:24.440 --> 09:27.720]  of their animals and some rats lived none of the ferrets lived
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.720]  and this is all a test to see what they can do to you just like they said six months ago it's a
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.760]  rare heart condition a rare blood clot in the brain a rare stroke no it's in the majority of
[09:40.760 --> 09:47.640]  people because it starts growing protein crystals you don't have a virus you get given protein
[09:47.640 --> 09:53.160]  crystals that's what the spike protein is and your body starts growing it
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.040]  and in every case they've done this it kills the lab animals the vast majority
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.720]  they knew what they did like if you poured a gallon of gas on yourself let it soaked in and
[10:05.720 --> 10:10.520]  then struck a match what's going to happen you're going to burn to death or have you took a
[10:10.520 --> 10:17.240]  shot gun and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger you're going to blow your head off see
[10:17.880 --> 10:25.000]  this and that's that's why i'm so shocked is this is 100 known like eating a teaspoon of cyanide
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.400]  with your iced tea you're going to be dead in two minutes or if i laid my hand out on this table
[10:31.400 --> 10:39.000]  took a hatchet right to my fingers it's going to cut them off so i've got the actual cdc study here
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.840]  i'm not going to just show you articles at info wars.com i'm going to show you the actual study
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.520]  overhead shot please cdc released a study showing three fourths of delta cases are among the
[10:48.520 --> 10:55.400]  vaccinated says mask of the answer more lies from the same people it goes on to say 74 percent of
[10:55.400 --> 11:02.520]  the individuals that have tested positive took the vaccine and it goes on into all the different
[11:02.520 --> 11:07.160]  sloughing off of new more deadly variants of the virus which all these top scientists warn
[11:07.160 --> 11:13.640]  would be the case here's another one cdc study admits 74 percent of covid suffers in massachusetts
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.920]  outbreak were fully vaccinated but let's look at some other countries see what they found
[11:18.920 --> 11:25.080]  because i don't just believe the cdc look at this andrew bosman mdms i linked three right to the
[11:25.080 --> 11:33.000]  government of finland finish hospital just one example c19 delta variant outbreak 103 infections
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.760]  among c8 cw's in patients and 18 elderly inpatient deaths two-thirds of infections 66 percent
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.480]  and 70 and 67 percent occurred in those partially or fully vaccinated with mrna
[11:47.480 --> 11:55.080]  vaxed and i got stacks of these 76 percent of the infections among the patients occurred
[11:55.080 --> 12:03.560]  with those fully or partially vaccinated that's in 44 to 58 and it goes on here's another one
[12:03.560 --> 12:08.680]  out of Israel this is this is what six million people participating the biggest test in history
[12:08.680 --> 12:16.680]  of a coronavirus and the vast majority again over 70 were inoculated think about that
[12:16.680 --> 12:26.840]  can have an overhead shot guys please thanks so so just look at this here for yourself must have a
[12:27.560 --> 12:33.480]  yeah we got a frozen camera anyways we'll post all these uh up on info wars dot com
[12:34.200 --> 12:37.960]  and news wars dot com you can find any of this it's all over the news i mean none of this is even
[12:37.960 --> 12:46.840]  debated oh and then meanwhile what else is going on miracle drug is wide saving against coven and
[12:46.840 --> 12:52.200]  will stop sufferers needing hospitalization treatment and from all over the world they're
[12:52.200 --> 13:00.600]  reporting that either pills of steroids not the type that gets you big like Arnold sports today or
[13:00.600 --> 13:07.640]  but the type that kill inflammation corticotypic either in pill form or inhaled have basically
[13:07.640 --> 13:14.200]  100 rate and guess who the un and others are working with to suppress that big tech so again
[13:14.200 --> 13:22.120]  talk about criminal activity ladies and gentlemen that's the way these systems operate and it goes
[13:22.120 --> 13:28.520]  on and it continues from there here's a washington post headline most people infected in Providence
[13:28.520 --> 13:33.880]  town covered outbreak were vaccinated cdc study shows there's your god the washington post telling
[13:33.880 --> 13:44.120]  you that but it gets worse we've been here this entire time for a year and a half telling you
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.000]  these vaccines weren't vaccines that they were franken shots they were gmo that they wouldn't work
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  that they lower your immunity next time that they would make you sick and that bill gates is on
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.560]  records saying he wants to depopulate the earth and we had all these scientists on specifically
[13:57.560 --> 14:02.600]  warning you and showed you clips of hundreds of prominent scientists and researchers coming out
[14:02.600 --> 14:07.480]  like the former head scientist at Pfizer and the Nobel Prize winner for discovery of HIV and the
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.600]  head EU advisor would Wolfgang Woodard those are just no names i've been telling you for a year and
[14:12.600 --> 14:19.400]  a half now they have the dean of the Baylor medical school coming out saying i have her on video
[14:19.400 --> 14:26.280]  that's coming up i have more than 30 clips of the heads of universities the heads of major
[14:26.280 --> 14:31.640]  scientific institutions in the united states in england in ireland and i got plenty from germany
[14:31.640 --> 14:37.640]  just in german and i got plenty from france and all over the world saying the same thing this is
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.840]  going to kill millions and millions and millions and millions of people and it doesn't protect you
[14:42.840 --> 14:51.240]  and they knew it but it still just got pushed forward people warned you and it still happens
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.680]  so the question is why did the globalists do this knowing it was going to come out they did it
[14:54.680 --> 15:01.000]  we have to war game every angle of this during the break we'll see if i can fix the overhead
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.720]  shot so i can actually show you all this or i can work with the crew maybe to get it on the
[15:05.720 --> 15:10.920]  computer in there for you but i want to show everybody this tonight i want you to see this
[15:10.920 --> 15:16.200]  i want you to understand this and i want you to see the u.s patent office documents where
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.960]  fowty and bill gates and others from chapel hill north carolina at bio weapons lab
[15:21.960 --> 15:26.200]  sent all the ingredients and how to make this virus that they would own and control to the
[15:26.200 --> 15:32.280]  wuhan lab to develop and put it together so we've got all of this coming up tonight and then the
[15:32.280 --> 15:41.160]  really big news the british official government agency responding to bio threats has come out
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.600]  ladies and gentlemen and said mutants from the vaccinated may create a super strain that they
[15:46.600 --> 15:55.000]  believe will kill 2.6 plus billion people that's the headline info wars dot com free world news dot tv
[15:59.640 --> 16:05.080]  as we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown the first one has already destroyed
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.560]  the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's caused

[20:21.480 --> 20:29.320]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:29.320 --> 20:36.440]  all right it's the worst of times but it's also the best of times at the same time horrible things
[20:36.440 --> 20:43.800]  are happening incredible tyranny is taking place massive censorship of top scientists and top medical
[20:43.800 --> 20:51.240]  doctors and and victims of these poison vaccines are being carried out by big tech who themselves
[20:51.240 --> 20:55.960]  are heavily invested in big pharma and vice versa that you've got the controlled corporate media
[20:55.960 --> 21:01.720]  that's biggest sponsor is the big pharmaceutical companies and then you ask yourself why would
[21:01.720 --> 21:09.320]  they then roll out extremely tested vaccines on other animals and humans in other trials previously
[21:09.320 --> 21:15.880]  with coronaviruses targeting the spike protein and why in all the studies should they say don't
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.720]  give it to humans it'll kill them because they got to attack us sometime they've got to depopulate us
[21:21.720 --> 21:26.120]  and they've got to make us sick so it sucks everything out of the economy so that as the
[21:26.120 --> 21:32.120]  economy collapses they pose as the saviors the big megabanks who have endless currency because
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.000]  they just make it out of nothing so that when the society collapses they give us universal basic
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.800]  income and then they control the dwindling resources and completely win that's in the
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.920]  book written early last year by claus schwaub who calls for depopulating the earth of david
[21:48.920 --> 21:53.960]  rockefeller and of course it's protégé bill gates this is the battle plan that is now being
[21:53.960 --> 22:01.560]  executed this is like caesar writing letters home when he was in germanian gull for 15 years
[22:01.560 --> 22:06.920]  conquering it letters back to the senate about what he done this is like one of the first letters
[22:06.920 --> 22:12.520]  caesar sent back to you know to to the senate to tell him how great he was this is claus schwaub
[22:12.520 --> 22:16.920]  bragging how they're executing us in live time and bringing in world government and depopulating
[22:16.920 --> 22:23.720]  us and everything that's a that's a wartime letter this is a battle plan funded by the
[22:23.720 --> 22:30.680]  rockefeller foundation in 1974 the culmination of a decade long research process with the man who
[22:30.680 --> 22:37.320]  later became the white house science czar for eight years under maraca saying obama
[22:37.880 --> 22:44.040]  eco science how to sterilize you how to poison you and how to use that to break down society
[22:44.040 --> 22:48.360]  and how medical tyranny is the way to take over because people trust the medical system
[22:48.360 --> 22:53.720]  so world government the un and big corporations poses the medical system they can conquer the
[22:53.720 --> 23:04.280]  world eco science population resources environment john p hodron and other depopulationists paul
[23:04.280 --> 23:14.600]  earlick and annie earlick his wife might want to read it oh there's another one you might want to
[23:14.600 --> 23:20.200]  read from two months ago the new terrorism plan under our puppet president says anyone
[23:20.200 --> 23:26.680]  questioning lockdowns is a terrorist oh and now he's saying new lockdowns may be needed funny how
[23:26.680 --> 23:38.040]  that works and when you read spars pandemic 2025 2028 put out by john hopkins with all the un
[23:38.040 --> 23:45.800]  and bill gates funding it's set in here 2025 2028 that's supposed to be 2020 2023 and it describes
[23:45.800 --> 23:49.800]  everything they're doing in lifetime just like operation lockstep and even how they're going
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.280]  to burn some public health officials and act like it's all a big accident that they killed billions
[23:54.280 --> 24:06.040]  of you they've got it all planned out and you're like they're gonna get destroyed they don't care
[24:06.040 --> 24:15.000]  they want to kill they want to kill so our overhead shot every once in a while maybe twice a year
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.640]  when these wireless cameras seizes up it just did last segment but they've got it back up and running
[24:19.640 --> 24:23.640]  let me show you those articles of your tv viewer radio listeners you can find these easily just
[24:23.640 --> 24:29.880]  write down when i say you'll you'll go you'll go find them cdc releases studies showing three
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.920]  fourths of delta cases are among the vaccinated says mask are the answer even though it does nothing
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.560]  and they go on to say that the majority of the people sick and the majority dying have had the
[24:41.560 --> 24:48.120]  shot did not a big news story and that's not just an area of massachusetts but i showed you
[24:48.120 --> 24:57.000]  you out of finland the exact same numbers in fact this is this is 76 percent of the people
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.720]  44 to 58 that were there and it goes on to say all the deaths were vaccinated
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.120]  or in this state's two-thirds of the infections and that's 67 occurred there's one here where it's
[25:10.120 --> 25:14.920]  100 percent let me just show you those numbers again here's out of israel six million people
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.600]  studied the biggest study ever on a coronavirus and they found that the vast majority again same
[25:20.600 --> 25:26.680]  thing had been inoculated and the vast majority dying are and they're suppressing all the different
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.520]  miracle drugs and the rest of it big articles on that can't have you suppress it with something
[25:30.520 --> 25:41.960]  like ivermectin or things like the steroid demexum methazone and again here's the washington post
[25:41.960 --> 25:47.400]  for those that don't know well here's your god most people infected in providence town
[25:47.960 --> 25:54.520]  covered outbreak where vaccinated cdc study shows now let's get to the really ultra massive news
[25:55.240 --> 26:01.560]  oops fda accidentally reveals a list of covid vaccine side effects including
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.440]  microcardiitis something like a heart attack autoimmune disease and death and this was from
[26:08.440 --> 26:15.000]  last year turns out a staffer didn't like what happened so they left the slide in which by the
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.600]  way they already admitted previously it's why they wouldn't approve it that these type of vaccines
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.000]  cause this i'm gonna show you top doctors around the world coming out including now the dean of the
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.880]  baler medical school that's a pretty prestigious medical school they they worked by the way on
[26:35.880 --> 26:42.760]  the ut study the ut initiative on rats given a vaccine for spike protein where 80 some percent
[26:42.760 --> 26:48.280]  of the rats died oh that's coming up i mean do you realize that they know all about this
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.920]  so a lot of this is cover the ass time that's why i mean it's a who's who of elite scientists
[26:54.920 --> 26:59.560]  saying this is insane and basically everybody's taking a shot is going to be an invalid if they're
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.800]  lucky a lot of you're going to be dead so now they're getting ready to start giving you
[27:03.800 --> 27:09.160]  a for the rest of your life i guess blood centers and other stuff i mean they have really hurt you
[27:09.160 --> 27:16.200]  bad and you're like that'll collapse society that'll that's what the globalist want they don't care
[27:16.200 --> 27:20.440]  what happens to joe biden they don't care what happens to they want to bring down civilization
[27:20.440 --> 27:24.120]  they want to post-industrial world how do you do it you kill billions of people and you make
[27:24.120 --> 27:28.120]  billions of people sick and that'll collapse civilization everybody else will be scared to
[27:28.120 --> 27:33.720]  go into work or be around anybody or be around the vaccinated this is a psychological weapon
[27:33.720 --> 27:39.320]  of fear it's put to destroy confidence in the government you think the u.s. government will
[27:39.320 --> 27:44.600]  ever have credibility again when this all comes out and it finally all clicked this morning and
[27:44.600 --> 27:49.000]  it's why i i actually got dizzy when you've heard like women will get told hey your husband was
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.600]  just found dead and the woman will stagger back and fall over i've been studying all day
[27:52.600 --> 27:57.480]  when this all crystallized in my mind like a thousand points plus a thousand i actually got
[27:57.480 --> 28:06.600]  dizzy and i was stumbling around and it all hit me i had to sit down that's why they did it during
[28:06.600 --> 28:12.600]  trump and got him to sign on to it to discredit trump and nationalism and patriotism and populism
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.520]  and they knew that trump would be so pigheaded he'll keep defending it even as it starts killing
[28:16.520 --> 28:22.120]  everybody so man they really know what they're doing i mean these are some sophisticated people
[28:22.120 --> 28:29.720]  wow and again if you're a new listener it is completely confirmed absolutely confirmed
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.760]  even mainstream news the vaccine doesn't help you hurts you and makes you spread all this other
[28:34.760 --> 28:39.160]  garbage just what all the scientists said over a year ago would happen and it's just a giant
[28:39.160 --> 28:45.080]  trap a giant bear trap we're all caught in and i haven't even hit the new news sage that's the
[28:45.080 --> 28:51.720]  big government agency in the uk they say that the vaccinated could trigger a new super variant
[28:51.720 --> 29:02.120]  that kills 2.6 25 billion stay with us jerald in south carolina go ahead you're on the air

[29:39.240 --> 29:46.120]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended

[29:51.240 --> 29:55.880]  that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's

[33:10.760 --> 33:30.360]  info wars.com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:30.360 --> 33:40.680]  so i've been politically awake and involved for over 30 years i've been on air for 27 coming
[33:40.680 --> 33:46.600]  up on 28 years now you're not satisfied and i knew the globalist wanted depopulation the
[33:46.600 --> 33:50.520]  rockefeller set up the u-in to carry it out i'd read a lot of the books they've written about
[33:50.520 --> 33:55.560]  different ways to sterilize this and different plans they had to launch depopulation how they'd
[33:55.560 --> 34:01.960]  use the breakup of the family and the destruction of small businesses under u-in environmental
[34:01.960 --> 34:08.280]  auspices and and i watched them eat around the edges of it but i i really hope we could expose
[34:08.280 --> 34:14.120]  them and back them off so they wouldn't launch the main attack but then when i saw what they
[34:14.120 --> 34:20.440]  rolled out in china and the fear mongering and the wuhan lab and the lockdowns here and and the
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.800]  mask and suppressing treatments for regular viral infections so they get some high death numbers
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.680]  and sending sick people into nursing homes but not letting their families go in i knew they
[34:30.680 --> 34:37.400]  were making a move and then i'd already read operation lockstep and i'd already read spars
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.480]  pandemic drill by john hobkins years ago because it was globalist battle drills on how they were
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.000]  going to bring in world government how they admitted they were going to bring in worldwide
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.600]  authoritarianism but when i saw all these top scientists come out last year and say we've
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.760]  looked at what they say the vaccine does it'll cause autoimmune disease it will cause brain
[35:00.760 --> 35:06.120]  damage it will cause all of these serious problems antibody dependent enhancement
[35:07.800 --> 35:12.280]  and all these top people are like i think it'll kill 30 40 of those that take it within about
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.480]  two or three years according to these rat studies that i went and looked up the studies i didn't
[35:17.480 --> 35:22.600]  believe these people even though they were respected and it was all true and then we watch
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.680]  people take the shots start having heart attacks and strokes and all the rest of it and now they're
[35:26.680 --> 35:33.400]  having this whole antibody dependent enhancement and it's all over the news and they're now in
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.320]  the washington post saying people that have the shot are more likely to give people covet now
[35:39.320 --> 35:45.800]  and they're having autoimmune disorders antibody dependence now you'd think oh jones i bet he got
[35:45.800 --> 35:53.560]  happy no i didn't get happy i am totally freaked out because it's one thing to know their plan
[35:53.560 --> 35:59.000]  it's another thing to be living and to think about how psychotic they are because they even like i said
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.960]  they've got the heads of major medical schools the dean of the of the baler medical school that's
[36:05.960 --> 36:11.560]  one of the that's a top 10 medical school saying this is crazy and evil and wrong she's just out
[36:11.560 --> 36:19.880]  today and now the cdc says three fours of the people spreading it have it from the shot and
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.680]  this big one that i want to get chris guys take on going to chris gone for a full hour this week
[36:24.680 --> 36:30.280]  we got until five minutes the next hour this is the british government agency sage next
[36:30.280 --> 36:37.160]  covet variant could kill one in three people 2.625 billion in the estimates of the mutations
[36:37.160 --> 36:42.200]  similar to what they saw with mirrors if it became gain of function and they're telling
[36:42.200 --> 36:47.560]  you what they got next for you they're going to claim its mutation so chris sky back in september
[36:47.560 --> 36:53.560]  of last year was extremely prescient looking at their own government documents that have been
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.200]  confirmed to be real where they're talking about the permanent lockdown and a permanent
[36:58.200 --> 37:03.080]  dictatorship since he was last on effect i forgot it guys get the novice coach a health minister
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.800]  says we need to stop people demonstrating stop people going outside keep lockdowns he said
[37:08.680 --> 37:16.040]  to stop people talking since then the german the french and the australian health ministers have
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.200]  all said the same thing so this is a real authoritarian takeover here's chris sky before
[37:22.200 --> 37:25.880]  lockdown two was announced now we're into lockdown three in canada but lockdown two is about to
[37:25.880 --> 37:31.640]  happen here here he is predicting it it's psychic jim bro was the top trending thing on twitter a
[37:31.640 --> 37:38.200]  few days ago recognized for predicting lockdown agenda here it is don't need a mask the mask is
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.600]  about compliance because they know canadians like to do what they're told so they tell you have to
[37:42.600 --> 37:46.600]  wear a mask next they're going to tell you have to contact trace then they're going to tell you
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.440]  you have to take the vaccine and because canadians like to do what they're told they're hoping that
[37:50.440 --> 37:55.960]  everyone just complies and then guess what kids once you take your vaccine like a dumb person
[37:55.960 --> 38:00.760]  that doesn't know any better they're going to tell you a story the vaccine isn't as effective as we
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.240]  thought it was going to be so now you still got to wear your mask still got to get contact trace
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.560]  still have all the restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine and
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.960]  then what did you get out of all of this you got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel
[38:13.960 --> 38:18.520]  your business was closed they took your rights and freedoms they forced a vaccine on you and
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.560]  what happened the same amount of people died everything is the exact same and now they're
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.440]  going to put you back on lockdown and bring it all the way till july of next year so they
[38:28.440 --> 38:33.160]  can do the same thing again bring you from july august and september getting you off
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.880]  lockdown but just to bring you back on lockdown again if you idiots haven't figured it out yet
[38:37.880 --> 38:43.960]  it's a perpetual cycle that you never get out of and it's a way to take your rights your freedoms
[38:43.960 --> 38:49.320]  close your business take your wealth why so you become dependent on government why if you're
[38:49.320 --> 38:53.800]  independent the government works for you like it's supposed to if you depend on the government to
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.280]  give you a paycheck to feed your family every month because they closed your business on you
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.920]  now the government doesn't work for you the government rules you so instead of a middle
[39:02.920 --> 39:08.600]  class we have the government upper class and the lower class dependents that rely on the
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.400]  government to survive in other words we have a slave class and that's what they're trying to do
[39:13.400 --> 39:21.000]  it that simple all right real chris sky dot com this is website need to support him to get his
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.280]  book need to check out what he's doing he's with us for the next 20 minutes i appreciate him coming
[39:24.280 --> 39:30.680]  on you know wherever you want bro but for folks that don't know that was september of last year
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.840]  you laid it out tell folks again how you did it and let's get into what's currently happening
[39:34.840 --> 39:42.520]  and what you think's coming next that's huge it's uh that i knew it was coming like you said i saw
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.000]  the document from the un i was traveling around the world trying to tell everybody what was coming
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.480]  it was a coordinated response from all the world's governments so whenever something like that happens
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.800]  that it's suspect so i just got back from ireland where i predicted their lockdown to the day
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.200]  and actually stayed there till the day they got locked down september 20th and they came back
[40:02.200 --> 40:07.800]  in toronto to try to warn everybody here and i went to our protest on saturday in toronto
[40:07.800 --> 40:13.400]  i have said september 26th and that's when i made that video to let everybody know what was going to happen
[40:13.400 --> 40:20.200]  oh my camera died you're here you sound great keep going okay so i had to let everybody know
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.280]  what was going to happen people call me crazy now they see everything that i said came to light
[40:24.280 --> 40:28.040]  so now we got to give a red alert and let everybody know what's going to happen next
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.440]  and this is very very important because they're going to try to make the biggest division we've
[40:32.440 --> 40:37.160]  ever seen in society and that division is going to go way past the people versus mass squares
[40:37.160 --> 40:43.160]  non-mass squares etc now it's going to be turning the vaccinated against the unvaccinated so they've
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.640]  already got us into the pacification process they're trying to lull us into submission
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.400]  they tried to give us a little bit of our freedom back they wanted to destroy the freedom movement
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.600]  they wanted to disorganize us kill the momentum kill all of kill everything we've been trying to do
[40:56.600 --> 41:01.720]  in reality they're prepping the stage already with predictive programming we're already telling us
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.520]  cases are starting to rise they're already telling us the vaccine doesn't work they're already telling
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.720]  us uh vaccinated unvaccinated people are dangerous they're already trying to call for limiting the
[41:11.720 --> 41:16.520]  movement and restricting the freedoms of the unvaccinated so what we're going to see and
[41:16.520 --> 41:23.640]  this is why i've been on tour since july 17th all around canada to warn people that it's all coming
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.760]  back and this time when they lock us down and put the mass back on us it's going to be vaccinated
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.240]  people and unvaccinated people only this time we're going to be seeing the vaccinated people
[41:33.240 --> 41:38.520]  getting sick they're going to blame the vaccinated people getting sick on a so-called new variant
[41:38.520 --> 41:43.000]  when in reality it's the vaccine themselves getting people sick they're also going to go and blame
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.760]  the new variant on the unvaccinated so they can demonize anybody who doesn't take the vaccine
[41:48.760 --> 41:54.360]  so not only will this provide wonderful division that the government likes it'll also set the stage
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.480]  for public consent of the majority which are the vaccinated to limit the freedom of movement on
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.760]  other people and if you see what they're doing in france right now you can't even go to a grocery
[42:04.760 --> 42:11.720]  store in france unless you show proof of vaccination or you show a negative covid test so they're
[42:11.720 --> 42:16.520]  they're doing this all over the world and i was trying to warn people that they're also trying to
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.720]  subvert us with political movements holy political movements in canada that are masquerading as
[42:21.720 --> 42:27.160]  freedom movements when in reality there's no political solution to this problem americans
[42:27.160 --> 42:32.680]  are free right now compared to canadians not because they waited for a new but a new election
[42:32.680 --> 42:38.360]  and a new donald trump to save them but because they employed what i call united non-compliance
[42:38.360 --> 42:43.080]  they stood up as a nation they took off their mask they opened their businesses and they just
[42:43.080 --> 42:46.840]  said no to the government stay right there we're gonna stay right there we're gonna right back
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.240]  in a few minutes to give you the floor you're absolutely right about all this and we need to
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.640]  get past political labels and political parties to get down to basic human rights stay with us
[42:55.640 --> 43:06.760]  this is the info war there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.240]  that it's criminals aren't extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same
[43:13.240 --> 43:19.240]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[43:19.240 --> 43:28.600]  well guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenesis globalist that ran the rollout of hiv and the
[43:28.600 --> 43:33.080]  mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and
[43:33.080 --> 43:38.360]  they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t1
[43:38.360 --> 43:44.680]  besides the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[43:44.680 --> 43:50.360]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the covid-19
[43:50.360 --> 43:54.840]  and the vaccine because now they admit the covid-19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[43:54.840 --> 43:58.600]  basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.840]  jacob in ohio welcome go ahead hey how's it going alex good uh great last caller i just wanted

[47:29.480 --> 47:37.080]  and we have chris sky on the line with us from canada hold another story how he's a political
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.240]  president how they've arrested him how they're trying to say he can't travel you got similar
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.040]  laws being passed in australia in the uk they're writing women down with clijdsdale horses and
[47:46.040 --> 47:50.600]  almost killing them if they dare go outside they're not supposed to but if you're a leftist group
[47:50.600 --> 47:56.120]  you can go burn down cities this is the marshal law of global government the marshal law of the
[47:56.120 --> 48:02.520]  united nations and an operation lockstep written by the rockefeller foundation 11 years ago they say
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.480]  they would use the threat of a virus for a takeover and who's in control of world policy now
[48:07.480 --> 48:13.080]  the rockefeller foundation directs joe biden and the united nations bill gates has been somewhat
[48:13.080 --> 48:20.280]  removed from command now let's go back to chris sky chris i want to point something out when we
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.720]  talk about this a year and a half ago or or 10 months ago people go okay so what but then when
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.520]  it comes true they go oh this is amazing you're saying what's coming next today but i can play
[48:30.520 --> 48:36.200]  video clips right now of you on with us six months ago and of me last year saying they're
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.840]  going to claim a new variance out so that's why you've got to have this new booster and they're
[48:40.840 --> 48:45.080]  going to say the variant came from the unvaccinated it's so easy to know what they're going to do
[48:45.800 --> 48:51.480]  so so again how do we do that because this is so incredibly premeditated so finish up with what
[48:51.480 --> 48:57.880]  you were saying about what's coming next from your own research and their own admissions and then
[48:58.440 --> 49:03.160]  how you think we can fight back against it because you got cut off by that break no problem so
[49:04.040 --> 49:07.960]  everybody knows we're going back on another lockdown just like you said the narrative is
[49:07.960 --> 49:13.400]  going to be over the next few weeks and few months cases are rising the vaccine's not working
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.960]  variants are spreading unvaccinated people are dangerous and they're going to start calling for
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.200]  vaccine passports not just for travel but to limit the movements of these vaccinated people
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.400]  or the non-vaccinated people so exactly what's going to happen in the fall is you're going to see
[49:27.400 --> 49:32.200]  a whole bunch of vaccinated people get sick you're going to see them scream about rising cases
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.800]  they're going to institute all the restrictions like masks and everything else they're going to
[49:35.800 --> 49:40.520]  lock us all down again and at the same time they're going to be telling all the vaccinated people
[49:40.520 --> 49:45.720]  that you're sick because of these unvaccinated people and that's going to get the public pretense
[49:45.720 --> 49:52.200]  that they need to start trying to impose restrictions federally in both countries not just so at the
[49:52.200 --> 49:58.280]  state or provincial level on all the citizens that's their plan so why can we make it backfire
[49:58.280 --> 50:03.880]  simple everybody's carrot was get the vaccine and life will go back to normal and I already warned
[50:03.880 --> 50:07.080]  everybody that that was a lie and they're just going to make you wear the mask and put the
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.160]  restrictions back on you after you've taken the jab well now they're already telling everybody
[50:11.160 --> 50:16.680]  they got to take a third jab and maybe even a fourth jab this fall and winter so when you told
[50:16.680 --> 50:19.560]  these people they're going to get vaccinated everything's going to go back to normal and I'm
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.040]  come in there and say the only way out of this is united non-compliance well all those people that
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.200]  comply are going to get locked down in the winter then the government's going to have to tell them
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.640]  oh a fifth or sixth jab is going to be the thing that sets you free even the most compliant even
[50:33.640 --> 50:39.000]  the most naive not going to agree with that and I've seen a massive shift in Canada in the last
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.880]  few months as I've been traveling around and doing my tours normally it's when I go to a freedom rally
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.200]  everyone's there that knows me they're there for me so everyone knows me everyone's excited to see
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.480]  me now I can't even stand outside of a hotel for two minutes or even walk down the street without
[50:53.480 --> 50:59.880]  the average Canadian coming up to me enthusiastically and knowing who I am knowing what I'm about
[50:59.880 --> 51:05.880]  agreeing with me appreciating me and feeling the exact same way we literally had a guy pull
[51:05.880 --> 51:10.680]  us over on the street and I'm in Calgary Judd or Edmonton sorry driving and we thought he was
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.360]  having like a road rage incident or something but he just rolled down the window and started
[51:14.360 --> 51:18.920]  screaming how he has my book and how he loves us and that's the kind of reception we're getting
[51:18.920 --> 51:23.320]  everywhere from the average Canadian what does that tell you it tells you that the average person
[51:23.320 --> 51:29.080]  the largest demographic of Canadians the non-voter more than all the other parties put together
[51:29.080 --> 51:34.120]  these are the people we need to engage for united non-compliance exactly the same thing
[51:34.120 --> 51:39.000]  went and you tell the story you're not bragging I'm not bragging I went to Lake Tahoe for a
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.200]  workcation I went to CVS twice I went to a few restaurants everyone mobbed me the owners the
[51:46.200 --> 51:51.880]  bus boys the waitresses I mean I went to CVS and was in there 30 minutes I was just trying to buy
[51:52.440 --> 51:56.600]  some Neos Born and Band-Aids for my four-year-old the cutter you know I mean all this kind of
[51:56.600 --> 52:03.160]  stuff is going on it's totally insane it's absolutely out of control what the globalists
[52:03.160 --> 52:08.840]  are doing but the people are really really waking up and I think Klaus Schwab up at his ivory towers
[52:08.840 --> 52:13.560]  I think Bill Gates in his ivory tower doesn't know what's happening he doesn't but I want to
[52:13.560 --> 52:17.720]  say something else really quick because now the government's terrified that we're achieving this
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.200]  level of the silent majority being engaged along with the political people along with the freedom
[52:22.200 --> 52:27.800]  lovers so they're trying to subvert the movement here in Canada with a supposed political freedom
[52:27.800 --> 52:34.360]  movement and they're using the PPC party and Maxine Bernier as this Trojan horse to try to
[52:34.360 --> 52:39.400]  mislead the people and try to give the people a so-called political option to this because they
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.760]  know the people are ready to act they're ready for united non-compliance phase two taking action
[52:44.760 --> 52:49.800]  and the best way to stop people from taking action is to give them a pretend viable political
[52:49.800 --> 52:55.000]  solution that way they don't use their anger and take action instead they just vote and they sit
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.160]  down back on their couch and they wait for this politician to save them Maxine Bernier has been
[52:59.160 --> 53:03.240]  selling telling everyone he's this big freedom fighter he's been telling everybody don't listen
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.440]  to Chris Sky he just wants to sell a book well I found out Maxine Bernier and the PPC party are
[53:08.440 --> 53:14.520]  making money off the sale of face masks I found out Maxine Bernier was working with George Soros
[53:14.520 --> 53:19.800]  and the Tides Foundation all the way back until 2005 as the head of the Sustainable Development
[53:19.800 --> 53:25.560]  Committee in Canada so he's not a freedom fighter he's a globalist just like all the rest and they
[53:25.560 --> 53:31.880]  have this phony political movement it all started on Canada let me just say this Chris Chris you're
[53:31.880 --> 53:36.840]  the superstar that predicted it all that's a great guy grassroots person I don't know who these people
[53:36.840 --> 53:42.120]  are I'm not doubting you but it's a distraction I see the whisper campaigns against you every time
[53:42.120 --> 53:46.600]  we have you on we get all these messages don't have him on he's bad I know it's all crap I think
[53:46.600 --> 53:51.800]  you're above these people and I think you should just ignore them that's the best day but it only
[53:51.800 --> 53:57.000]  I have to point it out because I want everybody to understand there is no political solution to
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.360]  this problem every quote you got to stop hoping some magic person does it you've got to start saying
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.480]  no and then give people some examples of how they do that that's what you got to do so we got people
[54:07.480 --> 54:12.200]  in different groups to take action and when we have a big protest we break the people down into
[54:12.200 --> 54:17.080]  smaller groups the first group we do is the small business owners and we get them to organize as many
[54:17.080 --> 54:21.560]  small businesses as possible and we organize an opening date we did that in British Columbia the
[54:21.560 --> 54:26.680]  west coast of Canada where the businesses were hungry and in one month we got almost 2000 businesses
[54:26.680 --> 54:32.600]  organized to open and the government allowed them to open the day after our opening date that we
[54:32.600 --> 54:38.040]  declared and if you look at a place like Ontario where I live we just got those same restrictions
[54:38.040 --> 54:45.000]  lifted maybe a couple weeks ago so when people take action that's what takes that mission is death
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.480]  resistance is victory so let me ask you this because I mean look I got a crystal ball
[54:49.480 --> 54:53.160]  research their own documents you've got one your own research and documents and I really respect
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.400]  your view on this why do you think they've been covering up numbers before why are they admitting
[54:57.400 --> 55:01.400]  the vast majority of the ill are vaccinated why are they admitting they're the ones shedding
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.360]  viruses why are they I mean is that just that real scientists are putting out real numbers
[55:06.360 --> 55:09.480]  because the media doesn't know how to deal with this they don't know what to do I mean the fact
[55:09.480 --> 55:14.200]  that again all of the world it's the people that are getting the shots that are sick again as I
[55:14.200 --> 55:19.160]  predicted a year ago as you predicted a year ago it's not from COVID it's from the vaccine they're
[55:19.160 --> 55:25.320]  calling vaccine illness new COVID well it's kind of hard to sweep under the rug that three quarters
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.480]  of all COVID cases including places like Singapore and all around the world they're reporting the
[55:29.480 --> 55:33.800]  same numbers three quarters of all new COVID cases are basically vaccinated people so they
[55:33.800 --> 55:37.800]  can't really sweep that under the rug so what they're going to do is use it to their advantage
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.120]  they're going to say oh no it's not the vaccine's fault it's the new variant and this new variant
[55:42.120 --> 55:47.320]  was created by all these unvaccinated that didn't go with the program and didn't do their part and
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.400]  that's why this new variants created and that's why our vaccines that were supposed to save the
[55:51.400 --> 55:56.040]  day can't they always want to position themselves as the people that are trying to help and they
[55:56.040 --> 55:59.960]  always want to position the people like us that are really trying to help and the reason that this
[55:59.960 --> 56:07.000]  keeps getting perpetuated absolutely when we come back I want to play a clip of that Canadian
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.200]  health official saying we don't want to ever lift the lockdowns because people will actually talk
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.160]  folks thought he misspoke then the Canadian the German the Australian the British government
[56:17.160 --> 56:22.760]  all repeated what he said what do you make of them being so brazen because they have no choice
[56:22.760 --> 56:27.000]  they have to try to silence people like you and me because we're having the impact that we need to
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.160]  have we're not just having an impact we're having the impact we are the chain I like I said I saw
[56:33.160 --> 56:39.080]  a massive shift in Canadian society the masses have awoken so now the only thing they can try to do
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.600]  is try to put the cat back in the bag which we know is impossible that's why they're trying
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.720]  to pass all these bills like C 36 and C 10 in Canada they're going to limit our freedom of
[56:47.720 --> 56:51.560]  speech because they've already taken all our other rights with the vaccine passport they've
[56:51.560 --> 56:55.560]  already closed our businesses and destroyed our industries with the lockdowns so the only thing
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.280]  we have left is the ability to speak about what's happening and that's their number one enemy right
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.280]  now because we're telling the truth and they're lying so they're at a huge disadvantage which
[57:04.280 --> 57:09.320]  is why they have to use media government elected officials medical professionals to tell their
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.320]  lie and it can just get regular just like you're going around telling the truth and ruining their
[57:13.320 --> 57:16.920]  plans Chris Scott will do five more minutes with you please come back for a full hour this week

[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:17.560]  all right chris guys there was one more segment i'm asking to come on for a full hour sometime
[1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:21.480]  this week i've asked him before he's such a busy guy chris cross in canada he hadn't been able to
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:25.400]  do it and if you ever get down to the u.s he's got a first class ticket here i want to go see him
[1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:30.280]  but they won't let me into canada this charity's incredible but here's the one of the health
[1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:36.600]  ministers up in canada since we mentioned this saying we want to keep marshal law in place so
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:41.800]  people can't get together and quote shared disinformation here it is hi there thanks for
[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:47.480]  taking my questions i'm wondering about the injunction um banning public gatherings and
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:52.840]  whether there really is a need for such a far reaching one given a trajectory we're on now
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:01.240]  so i mean i think it's still there we still have uh the you know bringing large large numbers of
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:08.600]  people together uh it can present some risk we'll we'll continue to look at that but i think the
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:14.840]  other purpose of the injunction is to uh is to uh you know prevent uh you know groups that are
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:20.520]  spreading uh deliberately spreading uh false information that connects but but could actually
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:26.360]  create risk the information itself if listened to creates risk to the public as well so and that's
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:31.720]  that that certainly is a need to manage that uh misinformation campaign as well since he said
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:35.800]  that a month ago i have them in a bunch of other countries like australia and put it on screen singing
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:40.920]  chris sky in closing the mask is off they've really overplayed their hand we people tend to think
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:45.080]  we have a studied history well they're the authorities they must have the upper hand no
[1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:50.360]  tyrants have psych psychological problems uh it's mental illness it's like child molesters have a
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.480]  compulsion they are going to do this they're not gonna stop they want to control us their control
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:02:02.920]  freaks we have to say no the the point it stops with thomas everson said 240 years ago is the point
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:10.760]  we start saying no correct percent that's why i got the campaign just say no and it's about saying
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:14.920]  no to the vaccine it's about saying no to the math it's about saying no to all the restrictions
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:21.320]  that you know are not in your best interest and you're a real leader of a country your job is to
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:27.000]  run the country in a way where the people can make their own decisions and attain success if you're
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:33.480]  wasting energy resources time and money to manage the people then you're not a leader you're a tyrant
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:37.560]  and that's what we're seeing right now and people need to understand that freedom is essential
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:43.240]  isn't just a tagline that's the reality if people don't have freedom you cannot have a happy content
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:48.680]  society and you cannot have a society where you can actually be successful pass something on to
[1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:54.440]  your children and so on and so forth they are literally trying to destroy the american dream
[1:02:54.440 --> 1:03:00.520]  the canadian dream and replace it with a version of worldwide communism and it sounds scary and it
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.320]  sounds ridiculous but that's exactly what they are doing they've systematically removed our rights
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:10.360]  with a medical tyranny they're trying to remove our financial dependence by closing our our businesses
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:15.640]  and get killing our jobs and now they're trying to stop the spread of information because people
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:21.160]  have figured it out and the more this is what people need to realize the people that are asleep
[1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:26.840]  this is not about your health this is not about your safety this is about control and that one
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.120]  little tiny thing that alters your perception from the lie that they've been telling you to the
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:37.240]  reality that is true is what they're trying to prevent from spreading worldwide and that's why
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:43.080]  they want to control they what they call false information and false is just a misonyomer for
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:48.440]  anything we don't want you to know because it's quite obvious that the cat is out of the bag
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:53.640]  the vaccine doesn't work the only people getting sick are the vaccinated there's no
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:59.400]  covid we are through it they are already calling it and we're talking about this pick a day you're
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.600]  coming on this week but we're gonna talk about chris sky on leadership leadership is by example
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:08.840]  that's the counter to tyrants they want to tell us don't lead the answer is start leading and that's
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:13.000]  what you're doing that's what i'm doing it's beautiful my friend pick a day tell the producer
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.560]  right now go ahead and we gotta let people know we're leading by example we're not pretending
[1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:22.760]  to be a messiah or a savior or telling you to follow us no we're just leading by example trying
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:28.120]  to provide you the inspiration the knowledge and the current make you do it we lead by example
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:32.680]  that's what i'm saying a tyrant makes you do something leadership you you you you demonstrate
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:38.440]  it right and that's what we're trying to do with this book and that's what they're so afraid of
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.520]  and if you want me to come on i'll come on i could come on even august 3rd it's my birthday

[1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:44.360]  great stand against the population and world government this is not a radio broadcaster
[1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:52.680]  tv show this is an emergency transmission all right ladies and gentlemen uh i'm really
[1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:56.600]  thankful that my cannabis would come on today on short notice but i'll sit there this morning
[1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:00.760]  and already done like five hours of research and i just couldn't believe what was happening
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:07.160]  so much good stuff so much bad stuff i mean we we're talking about three university heads i've
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:14.760]  got clips of the baler medical school two other top heads coming out and saying the shots are
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:23.400]  deadly don't do it it's a disaster all these other top scientists i probably watched four hours today
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:28.280]  of six seven hours of research of just clips of medical doctors and scientists and i've tracked
[1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:33.960]  down their curriculum vitae and they'd be who they said they were and it matched with the research
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:39.560]  in the documents in the cdc saying 74 of the new covet cases aren't people that are vaccinated and
[1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:44.840]  they're worse and most of the deaths are in them and then the same thing in israel the same thing
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:51.880]  in singapore the same thing in jebraltar the same thing the same thing in iceland and i i'm looking
[1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:57.000]  at all this and then i'm looking at the patents that we talked about over a year ago when my
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:02.040]  cannabis was on with us where at chapel of north carolina falchion mill gates the patents on gain
[1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:08.840]  a function for the coronavirus and all of it and it's just mind blowing and then the un saying it's
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:14.040]  the great research so mike joins us for the hour i'll host some into the next hour with harris
[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:18.280]  smith who's doing sunday live tonight that's a great show because we cut it to six minutes of ads
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:22.760]  an hour just for the radio and tv stations we took our network ads out and i'm working on a system
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:26.680]  where we pull half our ads out as well for the rest of the shows but people that are used to
[1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:31.240]  podcasts ask why do you have 14 minutes of ads an hour well that's how tv and radio work we are on
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:36.200]  tv on the radio so we're not just internet podcasts and thank god we weren't just that not put down
[1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:39.480]  podcasts they're revolutionary and great i've been you know spearheading that before it was called
[1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:46.040]  podcast but we didn't have our old vestigial media the old tv and radio we'd been off the
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:51.720]  air during the deplatforming so it gave us a toehold to grow back so uh that's uh been a blessing
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:57.400]  so here are some of the headlines we're going to mike adams to tackle this forever he wants
[1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:03.720]  but as a father and and and you know as a as a man uh being assaulted like this i have a lot of
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.840]  physiological issues now uh not being violent and and we've got to be smart i don't want violence
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:15.880]  i don't return the enemy into martyrs i'm just saying they're assaulting us and now they're coming
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:20.120]  with the contact tracers and now they want to stay don't let us have food take our property
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:26.360]  take our children all over the news that's war that's siege so how do we fight back but not
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:30.760]  getting caught up in violence we'll talk about that with mike adams as well but here's some of
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:35.320]  the headlines cdc released a study showing three fourths of delta cases aren't among the vaccinated
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:41.480]  says mask are the answer that's out of massachusetts here it is out of finland similar numbers almost
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:47.000]  all the deaths the vaccinated there's another out of israel six million people in the study again
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  almost 80 the unvaccinated i mean uh are the vaccinated the unvaccinated not getting sick
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.280]  they're suppressing all these miracle drugs all these different corticotypic steroids they don't
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:03.960]  want you to know about that because they want you to die from anything fda accidentally reveals a
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:10.200]  list of covid vaccine side effects including heart attacks autoimmune disease and death just
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:16.280]  incredible and the big story and i got so much more we'll get to with mike adams is sage that's
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:25.000]  the government agency in the uk says next covid variant could kill one in three people the next
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.680]  covid variant could kill one in up to three people sage warns doomsday scenario is realistic
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:37.160]  possibility and uk's vaccine rollout may even speed up mutant strains emergence says the government
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:41.560]  agency i'm reading from their press release picked up by the daily mail a doomsday new covid variant
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:45.960]  that could kill up to one in three people is a realistic possibility close quote according to
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:52.040]  government top scientist now mike adams is like me he's so busy covering tomorrow's news today at
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:58.600]  naturalnews.com that i called him today and i said can you pull up all the times you're on my show
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:03.560]  last year and this year because i first heard from you now it's all over the news about antibody
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:10.520]  dependent enhancement i said can you get those clips where you first said they're gonna say it
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:15.720]  fails they're gonna say it's antibody resistant but they're gonna blame that on the unvaccinated
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.360]  and he said that on the show over a year ago well now they're doing exactly what mike said
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.840]  he'd get there from a document he extrapolated that out with the brain god gave him so screw
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:29.640]  your ai folks we got something better than you got new world order so it goes on the mike said i'll
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:35.560]  try to have my crew find it but everybody heard mike a year ago say that here and predict it all
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:40.440]  and yeah predictions are king because you're already awake you listened you heard it you did
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:45.160]  your own research when we're able to get the predictions i made and christ sky made and mike
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:52.520]  adams made and wolfgang woodar dr woodar and dr yedon and and all these guys that's what wakes
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:58.680]  sheeple up okay when they see it that's what finally gets them to wake up so we'll talk more about this
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:04.040]  and then admitting that looking at the evidence they believe it created doomsday variant and that
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:09.400]  it is the inoculated that are creating the new variants including this new strain now again i
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:13.560]  don't believe much of what these folks say but i anecdotally go off this we'll go to mike adams
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:18.760]  rest of the hour a year ago when they said all the hospitals were full they weren't we sent people
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:23.880]  to them folks went and showed it this year i've got friends and family that work in hospitals i've
[1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:28.360]  got crew that work in hospitals one of the staff here's wife works at one it's full of people that
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:32.840]  can't breathe it's full of people dying and guess what they're all inoculated just like the number
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:38.200]  show so it's just what mike adams and i and others said the shot will make you sick then they'll
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:43.640]  blame the un inoculated for it they've done it we're now here we'll cover what's currently
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:48.040]  happening and what's coming next and how to stop it mike adams naturalnews.com thanks for holding
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:53.240]  while i did that seven minute rant with three minutes to break take over all right well let's
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:59.560]  begin with dr robert malone who appeared with steve bannon war room earlier this week and dr
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:06.920]  malone of course is a very much pro vaccine scientist and he warned on that broadcast that
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:13.080]  we are now beginning to see the early signs of antibody dependent enhancement happening
[1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:18.840]  so alex is it's happening now we're starting to see the opening wave just the opening little pieces
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:26.840]  of what's going to be a massive wave over the next 12 months as the people who got vaccinated
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:33.960]  in february and march and april they're going to start losing any ability to fight off the virus
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:41.160]  and the delta variant towards sort of november december january combined with vitamin d deficiency
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:48.360]  and the antibody dependent enhancement is likely to begin kicking in with devastating consequences
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:53.000]  at that time and i'll i'll stay here right now today events have already been put into place
[1:13:53.560 --> 1:14:00.760]  we're going to see millions of people dead in the next 12 to 36 months because of these vaccines
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:05.960]  and it cannot be stopped many people today are walking dead because of these vaccines
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:11.000]  and the reason they've done this and the reason that they've admitted now over the last week
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:17.640]  that these vaccines don't work and that they're causing the spread of these uh so-called delta
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:24.120]  strains the reason they're doing this is because they want an uprising in america this is bait
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:28.360]  they want an uprising even among those who were vaccinated and then are now
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:33.320]  angry and coming to their senses and saying what we were lied to they want a massive uprising
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:40.200]  because they need a justification for a military style martial law crackdown in order to cover
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.880]  their tracks because their entire globalist system is about to implode and many of them are
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:52.200]  going to go to prison or be tried under nuremberg 2.0 and they're now going to crash and destroy
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:57.080]  everything in sight but they need military control over the population during that time
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:00.920]  so the lockdowns are just going to be the beginning they want people to have resistance
[1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:07.240]  against the lockdowns they want a mass uprising and then they can take the guns then they can go
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:12.440]  door to door with force inoculations then they can take the new homeless who are losing their
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:19.080]  their apartments and so on because of the you know the the the cdc a rule about rent now ending
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:25.480]  they're going to be taking the covet concentration camps so all of that is what's coming up over the
[1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:30.200]  next couple of months in america it's going to look like and feel like an absolute war zone
[1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:35.960]  they are carrying out war against we the people it has begun and by the way what you say is very
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:40.200]  astute because i've been watching a lot of claus Schwab speeches he just said like last month
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:45.400]  soon the anger over lockdown will bring you to the collapse and then the new great reset will be
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:50.280]  here with us they admit they're destabilizing everything right now we've got the chief
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:56.040]  UK scientist over the whole inoculation program admitting it didn't work i played that a month ago
[1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:03.080]  as we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown the first one has already destroyed
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:07.480]  the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death and it's caused
[1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:12.520]  massive supply chain problems across the western world ladies and gentlemen now is the time for

[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:07.640]  but for humanity has to have its revolution we have to first recognize this anti-human
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:16.040]  and takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:25.800]  these artificial corporate controlled slaves or slaves just just property from cradle to grave
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:33.480]  of the system rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.400]  satanic control we have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which relies on
[1:17:39.400 --> 1:17:44.200]  nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:50.440]  it's that choice it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:55.960]  we've got freedom or slavery go to evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the

[1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:19.400]  all right alex jones here back live with mike adams the health ranger natural news dot com
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:24.680]  he's been writing for 20 years by selling books and over 300 websites so of course has his own
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:31.080]  uh chemical biological radiological testing lab here in central texas good friend of mine and i was
[1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:36.040]  ranting i got most of the segment i want him to just start over here and and walk through all this
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:40.360]  because people say well i don't care why the globalists are launching this we just know their
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:44.200]  criminals arrest them but if you don't know why they're doing it you won't know what their next
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:48.600]  steps gonna be they wouldn't launch something this violent this evil this out of control
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:53.560]  that's so easy to predict i mean i'm completely shook up that it's all happening just as we said it
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:21:00.280]  would which shows from their own documents they're committed to this so so what's their next big move
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:04.760]  how do we stop it how do we bring him to justice i don't want to just overall scare people there's
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:09.320]  a lot of people waking up i think less people took the shots worldwide than they wanted there's
[1:21:09.320 --> 1:21:13.720]  so many good doctors and scientists that are rebelling against them and rebelling against big
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:18.520]  tech there's been a big backlash against the censorship so even bill mars come out against
[1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:24.520]  him you've got tucker carlson doing a great job so so lay out the the battlefield here
[1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:28.680]  wherever you want to go with this are the huge announcements that the people that have had the
[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:32.760]  shots are making folks sick well they were going to try to say that we were making them sick i mean
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:39.080]  it really seems like their own medical system is rebelling against big tech new world order
[1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:43.560]  that's been masquerading as the medical system and and now there's kind of a civil war in the
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:50.440]  medical system like adams uh there is most of the most prominent outspoken doctors right now who
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:55.720]  are warning about what's happening with these vaccines you know you talk about dr bosh dr
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:22:02.760]  hoffey uh dr david martin dr peter mccullough and so on uh these are all pro vaccine doctors
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:07.960]  you know dr robert malone the inventor of mr name and dr bosh has worked in the vaccine
[1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:12.920]  industry for many many years and he has an epidemiological warning about what happens
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:18.600]  when you have the natural evolutionary pressures of vaccine resistant variants being incubated
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:23.960]  in the bodies of those who were vaccinated so basically the people who've been vaccinated are
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:31.720]  walking incubation vessels for deadly bio weapons that are being spread it's all happening on purpose
[1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:37.240]  the that the so-called vaccines are really gene therapy injections which are highly illegal humans
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:44.760]  are now petri dishes or farms for this colonizing creature that's right that's right but the real
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:50.200]  shocker here has have you noticed over the last week that all of the so-called woke corporations
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:56.200]  have now demanded mandatory vaccines among their own workers so we're talking facebook google twitter
[1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:02.520]  disney walmart even the washington post and many other corporations like that they know that they
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:10.520]  are ordering the vaccine slaughter of their own people their own employees and you ask why why
[1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:15.400]  would they do that well at google in particular and by the way zack vorhees has been a guest on
[1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:21.800]  your show explaining all of this at google the humans have been teaching google's machine
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:29.000]  learning systems and ai systems for the last five years how to no longer need humans in the loop
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.560]  when it comes to moderation they don't want to have humans around to know how to counter the ai
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:38.760]  later and have the knowledge the enemy that lowers the opt the the trader that lowers the drawbridge
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:44.680]  always gets executed by the army that takes over and yes why would the washington post mass murderer
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:49.160]  its own so-called journalists and propagandas because they don't need humans to write the
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:55.480]  propaganda any longer they have machine learning systems and ai systems that can be simply given
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:24:00.360]  orders here write these stories and they can write the stories without any humans in the loop
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:06.760]  but more importantly the bigger picture here and i'm not trying to scare people but they don't plan
[1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:13.080]  for there to be a united states of america remaining by the year 2025 they don't plan to have elections
[1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:20.440]  next year they plan to create so much of a chaotic emergency such a collapse that they
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:26.760]  can then justify and exert totalitarian control over absolutely everything including the internet
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:32.600]  kill switch taking down independent websites but leaving up only the approved website they do plan
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:39.320]  to go door to door with vaccine strike force teams as jen sake mentioned they do plan military
[1:24:39.320 --> 1:24:44.200]  martial law if they can get away with it now there's going to be pushed back by states like texas
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:48.760]  like florida like south dakota and so on a lot of pushback but in the states where they can get away
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:55.160]  with it they're going to have military martial law gun confiscations and forced medical kidnapping
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:25:00.200]  taking people away to covet concentration camps where many of them will never be seen you said
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:05.320]  that over a year ago now they're openly saying so now this is a speculation this is officially their
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:12.920]  plan this is absolutely their plan and understand that the globalists are now acting as if they
[1:25:12.920 --> 1:25:20.200]  have knowledge of a global level mass extinction type of event or threat probably one that they
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:27.240]  are going to unleash and they want to make sure that there are billions fewer human beings around
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:32.360]  when that happens because they can't control billions of people once people realize they've
[1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:36.440]  been lied to and they've been poisoned and they're being killed i've been allowed to write on this
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:39.800]  because you're going way out third dimensional cheshire absolutely right they're acting like a
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.360]  gun is to their head to go ahead and get rid of us now because what's going to happen is so
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:49.000]  destabilizing they know that that could organize into a new political group that challenges them
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.320]  so they're acting like that there there will be no resources very soon they're acting very desperate
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:59.400]  yeah my apologies i i do tend to just leap ahead because you and i have a knowledge base and
[1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:04.680]  your listeners have a knowledge base of so much that the average american is just clueless about so
[1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:10.440]  i i do tend to leap ahead but look let's just say as a thought experiment that a giant asteroid
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:13.800]  were going to hit the planet i'm not saying that's going to happen but let's just say
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:18.760]  that we're going to happen in 500 days let's say and the globalists knew about it would they tell
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:24.520]  the people no they would never tell you you wouldn't know until you see it in the sky a giant flaming
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:28.520]  mountain like in the book of revelation you know the reason they wouldn't tell you is because the
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:35.640]  globalists need the infrastructure to function so they can continue to stockpile food and parts
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:39.000]  and fuel and all the things that they need on their private islands and underground
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.840]  cities and caves and everything last minute to build up their stock exactly because we right now
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:49.080]  we're there no box exactly you got it now if they told the people hey there's a giant mountain
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:52.440]  falling out of the sky in 500 days and again i'm not that's not my prediction that's just a thought
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:57.720]  experiment but if they told people that everybody would stop working everybody would go home and
[1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:01.960]  decide you know how do i want to spend my last 500 days on this planet probably with your family
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:05.560]  or something right i said mike let's stop for a minute you're not you're you're an engineer so
[1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:09.720]  you're looking at math though like you're wargaming the way they're behaving is like this is already
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:15.560]  going to happen exactly yes we can infer from their behavior why are they going to the private
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:19.800]  islands why are they building the underground tunnels even in texas something would kill so many
[1:27:19.800 --> 1:27:24.600]  people as i've said because there's got to be something bigger coming and alice why do they
[1:27:24.600 --> 1:27:31.080]  not care that they are absolutely destroying the reputation of the cdc the fda the vaccine industry
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:38.600]  the who and the biden regime itself answer because none of those things exist in their plan in a few
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:43.560]  years universities they don't care about banks they don't care about the fbi that's right yeah
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:48.440]  yeah exactly and they don't care about how much money they print because they know they're going
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:52.600]  to collapse the dollar anyway and anybody who's dumb enough to be holding dollars is going to lose
[1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:57.320]  everything anyway it all just comes down to what do you have that's outside the monetary system
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:01.560]  and in many cases real physical things let me use another analogy they made a deal with aliens
[1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:05.720]  they're going to blow the planet up in up two years whatever it is they've built them a spaceship
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.320]  and they're leaving and then they've just got a deal they get the spaceship if they help kill us
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:13.800]  quietly and you know make sure nobody wakes up and challenges it and i'm not saying that's what's
[1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:18.920]  happening but mike is saying is true they're acting like everybody's dead and it's all over
[1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:23.400]  unless they basically call us off we'll be right back i mean that folks i'm telling you mike adams
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:27.480]  is on fire today natural news dot com i'm gonna come back and just have him say more i'm gonna stick
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.480]  a sock in my mouth and just shut up because i want to hear his wargaming on what he thinks
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:36.520]  and then i've got all these doctor videos these new ones the dean of of the major medical school
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:42.440]  coming out against the shots everything next hour let's be with harris and smith free world news
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:46.200]  dot tv is the link you can share the other ones get blocked everywhere free world news
[1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:52.600]  dot tv and and i'm not trying to scare you folks but if you play chess here and extrapolate this out
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.920]  what mike adams is saying is the only answer
[1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:06.120]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on and that it's
[1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:11.800]  criminals are extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same things over
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:18.680]  and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again well guess
[1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:27.000]  what it was anthony fowchie and ugenesis globalist that ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.320]  of it with act and other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and they were the
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:36.680]  ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the team lymphocytes
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:42.600]  the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:47.400]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:52.680]  covet 19 of the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:56.520]  basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen
[1:29:58.200 --> 1:30:03.000]  ladies and gentlemen oan schroyer here the host of the info wars war room and i am very excited

[1:33:13.080 --> 1:33:18.200]  welcome back look i'm not trying to chew my horn here and say i'm super smart i'm smart
[1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:26.120]  smart most people people have different types of smarts uh but so many scientists i know are great
[1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:30.520]  people but they go on one problem one problem alone and they say i don't care why the global
[1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:34.760]  security populace i don't care why they put this in the vaccines they knew it they did it they need
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:42.040]  to go to jail and i totally agree but mike adams is the type of guy that i'm like in ways that i'm
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:47.320]  obsessed with why is the enemy doing this because when they're highly sophisticated and control the
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:51.400]  planet they've got a way they think they're going to get out of it and they've got something else
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:58.600]  big coming and they're doing stuff so reckless so violent so insane so premeditated that that
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:03.080]  that that you know they've got a big reason for it these years 2020 they said they launched
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:10.280]  agenda 2030 they say basically no more virus that's what we are by 2030 so whatever they've
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:16.520]  made a deal with it's easy militarily historically to look at this behavior and see how anti-human
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:22.200]  it is and say they made a deal with an awful world power and i'm not into that kind of stuff
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:27.480]  i could simply add two plus two equals whatever so whatever reason it is whatever's going on
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:34.440]  this this is bad and and now everything we said came true we're not pleased about that
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.240]  that means they're going for broke so so mike i'm intrigued by this i'm gonna try to shut up
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:43.080]  continue getting into this in their behavior and is there any way to short-circuit because
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.160]  this clearly when there's hundreds of millions dying which is already starting to happen
[1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:50.440]  they're all going to go to prison they're all going to get destroyed unless they know
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.080]  something even bigger is coming that is going to eclipse what they've already currently done
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:35:00.600]  or maybe it's a nuclear war maybe it's an emp strike i mean there's so many wild cards but
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:07.800]  whatever it is it's bad on a magnitude much bigger than this do you agree uh yes the the most likely
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:11.640]  scenario and i've wargamed two primary scenarios of what i think is going to happen i'll share
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:16.040]  both of them with you here the first one is what i was talking about last break where they're going
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:23.320]  to engineer a planned financial collapse freezing of the entire global banking system all transactions
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:30.120]  frozen and then of course the dollar collapsing and then this will unleash a humanitarian crisis
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:36.840]  which will justify uh biden calling for un troops to come into the united states actually
[1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:43.080]  communist chinese troops under the un banner on quote humanitarian missions so that's that's
[1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:47.560]  scenario one and in that scenario it's just going to be door to door executions uh covid
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.520]  concentration camps mass murder and that's even for those who survived the vaccine you're still
[1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:57.160]  going to be targeted for murder the second scenario and remember this is a very dynamic
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:06.680]  situation this could also play out is that they're they are gearing up to flip the script and say
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:12.520]  oh my god these are trump's vaccines that are killing everybody trump pushed operation warp
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:17.320]  speed trump pushed the uh the pharmaceutical companies he twisted their arms he gave them
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:22.040]  incentives he pushed the fda and the cdc for emergency authorization and they're going to
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:28.600]  say uh trump's a mass killer from the vaccines but the rest of the sciences while the democrats
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:34.360]  when he was launching it slayed those easter eggs of saying don't trust him yep exactly but
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:39.000]  remember that in this scenario which i this is maybe a 20 chance of happening the other
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.240]  scenario is the 80 but in this scenario they are trying to then save science and save the medical
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:50.360]  journals and save the vaccine industry and save the cdc by turning against trump and putting
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:55.880]  all the blame on trump remember that that biden really had nothing to do with the the pushing
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:37:01.400]  of the development of these vaccines and i'm not saying that trump is at all uh ill-intentioned on
[1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:07.080]  this you know trump has tried so hard to to kill the swamp you know drain the swamp i should say
[1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:14.040]  and save america but i think that he was he was kind of led down the primrose path on these vaccines
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.080]  and he was lied to by the vaccine companies and i can see how this situation could be turned
[1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:23.960]  against him quite dramatically to blame trump and blame republicans and blame uh so-called
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:29.400]  anti-vaxxers and in fact what happened over this last week with the cdc coming out and
[1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:34.920]  announcing that vaccinated people can be essentially super spreaders you can see they're
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:40.440]  they're laying the seeds for that as a possible narrative you know how they do this alex they'll
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:46.360]  they'll put out a bunch of things so that later they can invoke the one that they want at that time
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:50.040]  and that's what they've done they've laid the groundwork and then they're going to react to
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:56.120]  whatever the public is doing and then unleash whatever scenario is the most beneficial for
[1:37:56.120 --> 1:38:01.960]  usurping power and mass murdering as many human beings as possible but in either scenario i'm
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:07.160]  sorry go ahead no no i'm just listening to you and and and again what does it do to defend trump
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:10.840]  you and i aren't defending trump because we get something we get attacked trump wasn't perfect
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:14.920]  he had problems i knew the inside baseball how they throw his executive orders away
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:19.000]  hurry he signed an executive order and they changed the language of it i know that really
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:24.200]  trump meant well but was totally surrounded and and it was a joke basically so for people that
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:29.720]  think trump was involved in doing this no he pigheadedly won't say it's bad now because he
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:34.520]  thinks he'll get blamed he has said oh you shouldn't take it if you don't want to but but you're
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:39.640]  absolutely right i see a leftist talking point saying oh this is trumps vaccine so i see them
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:45.080]  kind of reintroducing that right now as a possible escape valve but i i think you're right that's only
[1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:50.600]  an alternate plan they've got if their main plan doesn't go well well right and and the way to stop
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:57.240]  the main plan is for people to be extremely well prepared so that you're not driven into crisis when
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:02.520]  they shut down access to grocery stores by saying that only vaccinated people can shop for food which
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:07.800]  is what cnn called for and by the way there's a local governor i think in the philippines so i don't
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:13.880]  remember which town that has already called for banning uh all unvaccinated people uh from grocery
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:18.520]  stores that basically want to starve you out the head of the nih came out so that on cnn today
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.400]  and abc news i mean that's macron called for that that that's happening everywhere they're calling
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.520]  for it right cnn said you shouldn't be able to have food or leave your house catlin sabilia said
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:34.600]  that so i mean that's a is it that a declaration of war it's both a declaration of war and it's
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:39.800]  also an admission that they know their actions are never going to be rooted in any kind of reason
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:46.120]  or liberty or even human rights this is a violation of human rights i mean what kind of a a country
[1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:52.120]  what kind of a regime in the white house would send food aid to africa and then starve the american
[1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:59.320]  people at the same time to force them to take an unapproved deadly experimental gene therapy concoction
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:04.840]  that's being forced almost at gunpoint i mean these are massive human rights violations so again
[1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:11.400]  we can infer from that that they are so desperate that they're trying to invoke a a massive nationwide
[1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:16.680]  uprising because they need the uprising in order to have the crackdown and the marshal law and the
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.800]  door-to-door uh strike force teams okay so this is all about problem reaction solution and they're
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:27.000]  gonna they're gonna come up with crazier stuff crazier stuff you know like um nationwide call
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.120]  for medical kidnapping of all children who are not vaccinated something crazy like that oh there
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:36.120]  are other violations of human rights should we intervene when parents won't give their children
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:40.440]  the shot a it's not even authorized a it's experimental but again it's all just this
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:45.320]  preparing us this look look we can talk about asteroids or whatever but really they created
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:52.040]  quadrillions in fake currency they can't prop it up much longer uh and they know that uh politically
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:56.440]  they're in trouble and then the pedophile stuff came out on them and so they launched all of this
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:01.000]  destabilization program as their war against humanity to get us so distracted with wanting to
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:05.880]  have food and and and to be essential that we accept the world id and accept their system but
[1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:10.040]  i'll say this like it's backfiring massively and i'm worried about how they're going to double down
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:16.200]  and i think you're right all the pre-programming is cyber polygon massive shutdown FEMA drills on
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:22.760]  the 11th of taking over the internet and remember they they have to have stimulus money pushed into
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:29.000]  the economy to keep the Ponzi scheme going of of wall street and all the people getting kickbacks
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:33.480]  and bribes and who are connected to washington and so on and in order to justify the stimulus money
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:39.560]  they have to have a crisis to demand the bailout and get congress to approve it so this we're on
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:45.160]  the last legs of the history of the american empire and specifically the experiment with fiat
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:51.640]  currency all the way back to the creature from jekyll island 1913 in the case of global crisis
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:56.120]  and a global virus is the pretext to distract us during their great reset instead of them going
[1:41:56.120 --> 1:42:01.480]  to prison for what they've done instead they get total power and control you're exactly right and
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:08.280]  let me mention every major city in america once this collapse kicks in every city becomes a death

[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:08.360]  by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go won't we do but because they have great cameras
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:13.480]  and great recording systems and great ways to communicate i still have one because this trojan
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:18.360]  horse just for me the entire has a lot of power but when i'm not using it i lock it up in a high
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:24.600]  quality faraday cage a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com we finally got them back in stock the highest

[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.600]  to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:01.160]  the criminal globalist system they're 50 off right now at infowarstore.com the bio security state is
[1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:07.320]  here it's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty bad and evil
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:13.880]  they corrupt puppet prime minister of canada who says he admires the communist dictatorship of gg
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:20.120]  ping and wishes to make canada's fame has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:27.080]  the country all the way out to 2024 and that in 2024 you will again take two shots and he says it'll
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:32.360]  be whatever phyzer cooks up it wants to put in your body this is the rockelfeller foundation
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:37.000]  they developed this whole plan with bill gates for now implementing it and now they've announced that
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.640]  u.s policy is set by the private rockelfeller foundation of course the rockelfeller foundation
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:47.240]  by the 30s was the main funder of adolf a lois hitler and the eugenics at colesprings harbour
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:51.960]  that train the coser golem institute in germany and volwars will continue to set fast they fight
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:56.680]  this i don't know how long we can the enemy's coming for us all now god bless and good luck i
[1:46:56.680 --> 1:47:03.880]  would begin your ride with god right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:14.440 --> 1:47:20.120]  there's a man you know it really is surreal to study all these globalist documents and think tanks
[1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:24.280]  and their activities around the world with several populations they control to see how ruthless they
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:28.760]  are and to be able to extrapolate out and predict what they would do but now the last few years to
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:34.760]  watch them in operation mode and to just know that we were right about it all and and then to see
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:41.720]  the fact that they're going for broke is just horrifying and then to witness the average person
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:48.200]  still asleep uh or bought into mainline politics especially mainline liberals that trust the system
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:55.560]  and think they're part of some utopian class of good people that morally know best when they sign
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:48:01.080]  on to something that hitler was trying to emulate you know that that that that hitler wish he'd grow
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:08.200]  up and be uh but obviously so much more sophisticated and so much more guarded look at this video
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:13.720]  first man to receive the fiverr shot he was dead a month later it's on screen and they watch we
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:18.520]  we we i mean we're we're watching them snuff film that's a snuff film if you're a tv viewer
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:24.920]  and it's just all out of the open we're replaceable we're a commodity we're nobody and once you
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:34.120]  have that attitude you lose your soul and so this is a doomsday situation this countdown
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:37.880]  mike adams you've made a lot of really important points tonight you've talked about this but just
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:41.720]  pulling back any other key points you want to make other facets we haven't covered in
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:47.320]  uh dealing with how to get prepared the globalists for those that don't know are running away
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:53.720]  to kawaii hawaii they're they're they're running away to new zealand they're running away to northern
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:49:02.200]  canada with private airfields they are running away to fiji i'd literally buying up whole islands
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:06.440]  buying up the country and buying up the military uh and i've talked to folks that are around these
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:10.520]  people they say they're completely freaked out even scared these are people worth 50 million
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:16.920]  100 billion 120 billion they're scared uh and and and they're talking about the end of the world
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.680]  that's what's leaking out uh to uh individuals in the international security system that i know
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:27.960]  and and they're asking me so here's the goodness it's gone from alan shones is right about some
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:33.000]  stuff too okay alex what's going to happen next which i don't know exactly what happens next
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.560]  but it's like when the people worth 100 billion dollars are scared and don't even want to do this
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.960]  who is it above these people because almost all these people other than like claus swabber bill
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:48.120]  gates don't even like this mike adams we ought we ought to do a show sometimes soon i'd be happy
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:52.680]  to come on and do it with you an hour or two or three just focus on preparedness steps and let me
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:58.120]  just share one amazing bombshell preparedness thing that anybody can do right now it's dirt cheap
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:01.800]  and there's not going to be any regulatory concerns here i don't sell any of these products and you
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:07.720]  don't either alex but everybody can go online right now and buy a common espresso machine
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:14.200]  that produces espresso espresso at 15 bar now the bar is a measure of atmospheric pressure 15 bar
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:22.520]  means 15 essentially times normal atmospheric pressure this is really a food extraction device
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:28.360]  on the cheap we use the same technology in our lab to do food extractions but ours is like a $50,000
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:33.080]  machine for 120 bucks you can get an espresso machine and what do you put in it well there are
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:39.560]  natural substances that contain shakimic acid and one of them is called the star anise herb
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:46.120]  that's star a in i s e star anise in chinese is called bat jiao and uh also let's see what else
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:52.360]  fennel seed contains shakimic acid in certain types of pine needles contain shakimic acid
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:58.440]  you can put those herbs just just kind of pound them into like a like a powder with a hammer
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:02.600]  you can put them in there instead of coffee you can run the espresso machine you can extract
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:09.000]  shakimic acid now what's special about shakimic acid it's the basis for the tamiflu prescription
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:16.280]  drug that's used to stop a viral respiratory pandemics and it also blocks viral replication
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:20.680]  in the blood seriously the reason i mentioned this golden example is learn about herbs and their
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:27.160]  extraction exactly and you got to go off grid on your medicine because you won't necessarily be
[1:51:27.160 --> 1:51:31.720]  able to go to a pharmacy you won't necessarily have a doctor you know depends on how how bad the
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:37.720]  breakdown is but you can go off grid you can stockpile fennel seeds they're dirt cheap and again
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:42.200]  i don't sell them you don't sell them you can just stockpile them you can get a cheap espresso
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:47.800]  machine you can make your own natural herbal extracts and and even with other herbs as well
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:53.640]  that's just one golden life saving piece of information these industries are going to start
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:59.720]  well well exactly and also think about food rationing you know food rationing is coming
[1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:02.760]  they're already talking about blocking people from grocery stores they're going to go down
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:07.880]  the model of venezuela with rationing and price controls and biometric tracking for you to shop
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:13.400]  at the grocery store so what do you need answer off grid food i call it which is food you grow
[1:52:13.400 --> 1:52:19.000]  yourself it could be a hydrant hydroponic system it could be containers on your balcony you don't
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  even need a yard it could be sprouting it could be a garden but off grid food is food that the
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:30.360]  government doesn't know about so that's what's going to keep you alive when the rationing is
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:34.600]  is designed to starve you to death you understand submit to every thing they want you to do and
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:39.480]  they're going to hold exactly hostage and then make them demand the countryside capitulate
[1:52:39.480 --> 1:52:43.000]  we're just going to have to i'm sorry sit there and watch the city starve because we're not going
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.840]  to be able to help them but we're going to be gifted and told it's our fault the cities are dying
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:51.880]  let me give you one more thing if you have a hydroponic system and you're growing lettuce
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:58.760]  let's say guess what how can you turn lettuce into a zinc supplement that may be life saving
[1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:05.080]  you can put zinc sulfate powder into the hydroponic solution when you do that the plants take up
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:12.040]  extra zinc you are now growing living zinc supplements that can help keep you alive so
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:17.240]  alex i mean there are just thousands of tidbits like this common knowledge i mean it used to be
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:21.640]  common maybe a generation ago most people don't know any of this stuff and this is knowledge
[1:53:21.640 --> 1:53:28.120]  that can keep you alive and help you rediscover this exactly and if we don't do these things if
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:32.280]  you depend on the system for your food your medicine your money your technology everything
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:38.200]  you're going to be enslaved or dead very soon you've got to go off grid with everything including
[1:53:38.200 --> 1:53:43.240]  money so how do you go off grid money well it's things other than the dollar it could be gold
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:47.800]  or silver or crypto or something other than the dollar that's all that you know how to fix the car
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:54.280]  engine could be you know how to fix your plumbing exactly skills well yeah it's exactly and you
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:57.880]  you've got to be able to of course defend yourself because there's going to be so many desperate
[1:53:57.880 --> 1:54:03.560]  people looting and so on so you need off grid defense which usually comes in the form of like
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:09.240]  a Glock or a rifle and some ammo and maybe a you know a thermal camera you know to keep an eye on
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:14.040]  things but you've got to think in these terms of how you keep yourself alive how you make your own
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:19.080]  medicine how you grow your own food how you have your own off grid money all of these things and
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:23.400]  these are the answers because i think we can survive this by the way mike for anybody doubting
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:27.080]  what you're saying the un already implemented the lockdown that's still going in africa the
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:30.760]  star of the additional 20 million people 200 million set the star of the death now if the
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:35.000]  lockdown continues so everything you're saying that can happen here is already happening to our
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.320]  fellow humans yeah that's right i mean the model's already been proven they've done this time and
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:44.120]  time again throughout the history of totalitarianism they know how to start people to death they know how
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:48.840]  to run concentration camps heck they're building them you know probably in texas with all that the
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:54.440]  how many acres are owned by the Chinese guy wonder they got the majority to kill the minority
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:57.640]  over a million and then once the majority did that then they divided the minority with the
[1:54:57.640 --> 1:55:03.400]  majority for killing the majority so they know what they're doing yeah and guess how they can get you
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:09.640]  to show up and volunteer to go into a concentration camp oh starve you to death first starve you to
[1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:14.760]  death and then just hand out pamphlets oh we have food and shelter over here just show up and turn
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:20.040]  in your guns and you'll be taken care of so if if you're if anybody out there and this is not your
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.320]  listeners but other oblivious people if they're dumb enough to not have their own supplies and not
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:30.680]  be able to survive off grid you're going to end up turning yourself in to some kind of a FEMA camp
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:35.880]  or starve to death so people who are prepared says use food as a weapon that's their official plan
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:41.240]  in the minute we have exactly Mike so it's got to hurt them that their whole COVID vaccine they're
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:45.000]  having to admit it's causing people sick or are you saying that was part of the plan because that's
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.440]  actually in the sparse pandemic document war game doubt by the UN and by the rock and fellers
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:54.440]  of my john Hopkins well that was always part of the plan because they knew they had to inject
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:56:00.520]  people with spike protein to worsen the symptoms and cause the death wave they knew that the virus
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:06.760]  itself which is probably just more like a renamed a common cold virus at this point the virus couldn't
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:11.160]  produce these kinds of fatalities but the spike protein that that they synthesize this is what
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:16.760]  they really built uh built in uhan was the weaponized spike protein that can kill a lot of people
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:21.000]  and cause vascular damage and that's causing the micro blood clots and that's what they admit is
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:26.200]  now happening we're completely vindicated and verified my fadamsmatchnews.com thank you so much
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:33.160]  thank you alex okay wow uh i'm gonna end this main transmission but on the satellite tv and radio
