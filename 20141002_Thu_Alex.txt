[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:13.520 --> 00:21.060]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:21.060 --> 00:31.400]  Texas Alex Jones it's Paul Joseph Watson with the Alex Jones show on this
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.240]  Thursday October 2nd filling in for Alex hopefully we will have Alex calling in
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.840]  from the road a little later on in the show we've also got Lionel from Lionel
[00:40.840 --> 00:46.040]  media popping in in the third hour to discuss media narratives the latest
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.000]  Ebola news and a whole gamut of different subjects but we're focusing on a
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.540]  bowler in the first hour David Knight will be in in the second hour also so
[00:55.540 --> 00:59.180]  the latest news of course is that we've now got potentially up to a hundred
[00:59.180 --> 01:05.820]  patients alleged supposed victims exposed to the Ebola virus as a result of
[01:05.820 --> 01:11.100]  this individual who arrived in Dallas last week from Liberia we also have
[01:11.100 --> 01:15.420]  another case in Hawaii which they're investigating at the moment not confirmed
[01:15.420 --> 01:19.020]  that it's a bowler but they're saying that it's very possible that that could
[01:19.020 --> 01:22.300]  be the case now it's up to a hundred Texas checks a hundred for Ebola
[01:22.300 --> 01:28.140]  exposure so yesterday it went from 12 to 18 80 this morning now they're saying
[01:28.140 --> 01:32.420]  a hundred we're also following another case in a different state where there
[01:32.420 --> 01:36.860]  is another potential Ebola victim that's not being confirmed but there is a
[01:36.860 --> 01:41.500]  medical worker there in that state saying that it is about to be confirmed
[01:41.500 --> 01:46.060]  within the next few hours so we'll continue to keep track of that big
[01:46.060 --> 01:51.180]  headlines coming up today on the Alex Jones show biggest as far as I'm
[01:51.180 --> 01:54.740]  concerned is on the top left a drudge report.com which is red linked and its
[01:54.740 --> 01:59.540]  UN Ebola chief raises nightmare prospect that virus could mutate and become
[01:59.540 --> 02:02.860]  airborne if it is not quickly brought under control obviously this is a an
[02:02.860 --> 02:06.820]  issue that we've been discussing for weeks and months the potential that
[02:06.820 --> 02:11.860]  Ebola has at least to a limited extent gone airborne now we have one of the UN's
[02:11.860 --> 02:15.980]  top Ebola professionals in charge of the situation saying the same thing the
[02:15.980 --> 02:20.500]  longer the Ebola epidemic continues infecting people unabated the higher
[02:20.500 --> 02:24.260]  the chances it will mutate and become airborne the UN's Ebola response chief
[02:24.260 --> 02:29.460]  has warned and this is Anthony Banbury the secretary general special
[02:29.460 --> 02:33.540]  representative who said that there's a nightmare prospect and this this is not
[02:33.540 --> 02:37.700]  Alex Jones saying this this is the head of the UN Ebola response team a
[02:37.700 --> 02:41.940]  nightmare prospect that the deadly disease will become airborne if it
[02:41.940 --> 02:46.540]  continues infecting new hosts his comments come as organizations battling
[02:46.540 --> 02:50.580]  the crisis in West Africa warn that the international community has just four
[02:50.580 --> 02:55.300]  weeks to stop it before it spirals completely out of control there you see
[02:55.300 --> 03:00.700]  the article out the Daily Mail which of course ties into this separate article
[03:00.700 --> 03:03.740]  which we've got up on informals.com which we're going to cover in more detail
[03:03.740 --> 03:09.580]  out of shtfplan.com Max Slavo who we're trying to get on the show today if not
[03:09.580 --> 03:14.700]  today maybe tomorrow report disaster teams were notified months ago they
[03:14.700 --> 03:19.940]  would be activated in October and this was dark teams disaster assistance
[03:19.940 --> 03:24.100]  response teams no word yet on exactly where in the country but they were told
[03:24.100 --> 03:28.340]  to prepare to be activated in the month of October and that's according to a
[03:28.340 --> 03:32.260]  public tweet from a large government supplier of emergency response products
[03:32.260 --> 03:37.060]  specializing in high-risk events so they basically basically put out a tweet and
[03:37.060 --> 03:40.820]  you can see it in this article there said that we're now hearing this is the
[03:40.820 --> 03:44.620]  tip of the iceberg as we enter October and in a subsequent tweet they said
[03:44.620 --> 03:50.300]  dark teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October timing
[03:50.300 --> 03:54.820]  seems weird and they cite the source as a current dark member and that's
[03:54.820 --> 04:02.180]  Golden State Fire EMS a company that specializes in high-risk events they
[04:02.180 --> 04:06.100]  haven't retracted that on Twitter it's still out there so we're trying to pin
[04:06.100 --> 04:11.820]  down more details on that of course in regard to the airborne transmission of
[04:11.820 --> 04:16.820]  Ebola which the UN is now warning about we had this story up on info wars.com
[04:16.820 --> 04:22.220]  yesterday Canadian health agency deletes info on airborne spread of Ebola and
[04:22.220 --> 04:26.940]  this is the public health agency of Canada this is their official health
[04:26.940 --> 04:31.060]  agency around about the end of August here you can see that they had an
[04:31.060 --> 04:34.980]  advisory on their website saying that airborne spread among humans is
[04:34.980 --> 04:39.420]  strongly suspected they later deleted that we're gonna get into that and more
[04:39.420 --> 04:44.340]  Ebola info we're gonna get into the Hong Kong protests and a lot more besides
[04:44.340 --> 04:49.260]  that Lionel coming up Alex Jones popping in this is the Alex Jones show live

[08:38.260 --> 08:43.220]  we're back on this thursday october 2nd edition of the alex jones show I'm
[08:43.220 --> 08:47.500]  Paul Joseph Watson your host filling in for alex jones we expect alex to be
[08:47.500 --> 08:52.620]  popping in at some point during the broadcast with breaking Ebola news we're
[08:52.620 --> 08:57.020]  going to go to a clip in a minute out of local hawaii news about a potential new
[08:57.020 --> 09:00.980]  Ebola case there but as I was mentioning before the break we had this story up on
[09:00.980 --> 09:05.700]  info wars dot com yesterday canadian health agency deletes info on airborne
[09:05.700 --> 09:10.660]  spread of Ebola and this was one of the main sources that I cited of course in
[09:10.660 --> 09:15.540]  the aftermath of the 2012 canadian study where they proved that Ebola could be
[09:15.540 --> 09:21.100]  spread via the respiratory tract between pigs infected with Ebola and monkeys
[09:21.100 --> 09:26.260]  who are kept in the same pen but separated by a wire fence so there was
[09:26.260 --> 09:30.020]  no physical contact between them of course we're being told over and over
[09:30.020 --> 09:34.260]  again that you can only catch Ebola by having physical contact exchange of
[09:34.260 --> 09:39.300]  bodily fluids but now top experts are questioning that and as far back as the
[09:39.300 --> 09:43.060]  end of August actually the canadian public health agency which is their
[09:43.060 --> 09:48.780]  official public health body had on their official website this quote which is the
[09:48.780 --> 09:55.340]  airborne spread among humans of Ebola is quote strongly suspected now if you
[09:55.340 --> 09:59.340]  take a look at that now it's it's changed it says airborne transmission has
[09:59.340 --> 10:04.180]  not been demonstrated between non-human primates so it's interesting that they
[10:04.180 --> 10:08.620]  rolled that back at the end of August or just after the end of August when all
[10:08.620 --> 10:12.500]  these questions were being asked about the airborne spread of Ebola of course
[10:12.500 --> 10:17.140]  we had major doctors go public in the New York Times in the op-ed pages
[10:17.140 --> 10:21.940]  basically asking the same question has this mutated has it gone airborne at
[10:21.940 --> 10:26.980]  least to some extent because we've had hundreds of health workers in Africa
[10:26.980 --> 10:32.460]  including Western health workers die after contracting Ebola of course you
[10:32.460 --> 10:37.060]  would normally expect them to take the utmost precautions in avoiding bodily
[10:37.060 --> 10:41.780]  contact and avoiding swapping bodily fluids with Ebola victims and yet
[10:41.780 --> 10:46.460]  hundreds have died which of course leads to this top story which is the UN's top
[10:46.460 --> 10:51.940]  Ebola chief raises nightmare prospect that virus could mutate and become
[10:51.940 --> 10:56.660]  airborne if it's not quickly brought under control so basically this top
[10:56.660 --> 11:02.260]  official Anthony Banbury is saying if we don't get a hold of this now as it
[11:02.260 --> 11:06.700]  spreads you know in its natural state which is not via airborne transmission as
[11:06.700 --> 11:11.180]  far as we understand if we don't clamp down on it now then it could indeed go
[11:11.180 --> 11:16.020]  airborne and of course then that opens up a whole nightmare scenario and again
[11:16.020 --> 11:21.820]  major story up on info wars.com today out of SHTF plan report disaster
[11:21.820 --> 11:26.660]  teams were notified months ago they would be activated in November so this
[11:26.660 --> 11:32.340]  was disaster assistance response teams according to a source within Dart they
[11:32.340 --> 11:37.300]  were told last month at least as long as a month ago actually more than a month
[11:37.300 --> 11:42.540]  ago that they would be notified or activated in October as a result of a
[11:42.540 --> 11:46.380]  major Ebola outbreak in the United States you can see the tweets up there
[11:46.380 --> 11:52.060]  from Golden State Fire EMS which is a company that sells health products and
[11:52.060 --> 11:57.100]  health services to government agencies in America and they said that these Dart
[11:57.100 --> 12:01.020]  teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October timing
[12:01.020 --> 12:05.140]  seems weird and people challenged them on that they haven't retracted it so we'll
[12:05.140 --> 12:09.020]  continue to dig into it another story which we're going to get into more
[12:09.020 --> 12:14.380]  detail about is this one commentary health workers need optimal respiratory
[12:14.380 --> 12:18.060]  protection for Ebola now this is fascinating because it's it's written
[12:18.060 --> 12:23.060]  by Dr. Brusso and Dr. Jones at the University of Illinois at Chicago
[12:23.060 --> 12:28.260]  Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences and basically they asked the
[12:28.260 --> 12:34.420]  same question that this UN Ebola chief is asking do we truly understand the
[12:34.420 --> 12:39.140]  communicable nature of Ebola they're talking about compelling the use of
[12:39.140 --> 12:44.700]  respiratory protect protection not just face masks so in this article they get
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.620]  into the fact that Ebola has quote unclear modes of transmission they
[12:49.620 --> 12:53.220]  talk about their belief that there's quote a scientific and epidemiological
[12:53.220 --> 12:57.340]  evidence that the Ebola virus has the potential to be transmitted via
[12:57.340 --> 13:04.100]  infectious aerosol particles both near and at a distance from infected patients
[13:04.100 --> 13:07.060]  which means that health care workers should be wearing respirators not face
[13:07.060 --> 13:12.620]  masks so our current understanding is that this Ebola virus can be transmitted
[13:12.620 --> 13:16.500]  by droplets from coughing or sneezing but that you have to be very near the
[13:16.500 --> 13:22.940]  victim so within three feet according to this study by these professors out of
[13:22.940 --> 13:29.580]  the University of Illinois in Chicago that's not the case they talk about the
[13:29.580 --> 13:32.860]  fact there's been a lot of online and published controversy about whether it
[13:32.860 --> 13:37.300]  the Ebola virus can be transmitted by aerosols most scientific and medical
[13:37.300 --> 13:40.460]  personnel along with public health organizations have been unequivocal in
[13:40.460 --> 13:43.700]  their statements that Ebola can be transmitted only by direct contact with
[13:43.700 --> 13:48.500]  virus laden fluids and we've heard that over and over again over the past
[13:48.500 --> 13:52.020]  couple of days with this case arriving in America of course the CDC of the
[13:52.020 --> 13:57.260]  health authorities trying to downplay the threat of Ebola after the fact that
[13:57.260 --> 14:02.140]  they botched it by allowing this Ebola victim to basically walk around Dallas
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.620]  for a period of four days exposing at least a hundred people to the Ebola
[14:06.620 --> 14:11.540]  virus and the aftermath of that going public they downplayed any potential
[14:11.540 --> 14:16.980]  that this could be airborne as we've seen both with the UN official top German
[14:16.980 --> 14:22.140]  virologist doctors that have written editorials in the New York Times it's
[14:22.140 --> 14:25.420]  very much a concern and it's a concern for these professors out of the
[14:25.420 --> 14:30.100]  University of Illinois they talk about the fact that our current
[14:30.100 --> 14:34.820]  understanding that Ebola is not airborne transmissible at least to a limited
[14:34.820 --> 14:40.500]  extent over three feet reflects quote an incorrect and outmoded understanding of
[14:40.500 --> 14:45.220]  infectious aerosols which has been institutionalized in politics language
[14:45.220 --> 14:50.140]  culture and approaches to infection control so they go through the fact that
[14:50.140 --> 14:55.540]  this could indeed be airborne to a greater extent than three feet to a
[14:55.540 --> 14:59.860]  greater extent than somebody coughing and sneezing which of course in terms of
[14:59.860 --> 15:05.540]  airline travel is crucial no flights have been canceled so far despite the fact
[15:05.540 --> 15:09.180]  that France the United Arab Emirates Britain and other countries have
[15:09.180 --> 15:14.580]  canceled flights as a result of this Ebola outbreak in Africa weeks and
[15:14.580 --> 15:19.500]  months ago now flight attendants and border patrol agents in America are
[15:19.500 --> 15:24.820]  being told to watch for signs of Ebola despite the fact that I saw a case on
[15:24.820 --> 15:30.540]  CNN the other day where the CNN reporters who had been in Liberia openly
[15:30.540 --> 15:35.140]  stated to border control to the flight attendants that they had been there they
[15:35.140 --> 15:39.220]  need to be checked for potential exposure to the Ebola virus potential
[15:39.220 --> 15:43.700]  symptoms the customs and border patrol agents according to these CNN
[15:43.700 --> 15:48.780]  reporters were not interested so we've had the CDC saying for months that they
[15:48.780 --> 15:52.380]  had this under control that it wasn't a threat you know Obama said it was very
[15:52.380 --> 15:56.060]  unlikely there would be an Ebola case in the United States and it appears they've
[15:56.060 --> 16:00.060]  been caught with a pants down completely completely unprepared for this
[16:00.060 --> 16:04.660]  they failed to deal with it when it sprung up in Dallas now we've got a new
[16:04.660 --> 16:09.260]  case in Hawaii a potential new case and we're going to go to a local news clip
[16:09.260 --> 16:13.980]  about that now Joe health officials say they just found out about this possible
[16:13.980 --> 16:20.540]  case this morning and they do not want the public to be concerned we are early
[16:20.540 --> 16:28.340]  in the investigation of a patient very very early who may warrior investigating
[16:28.340 --> 16:32.260]  who might have Ebola state health officials confirmed tests are being
[16:32.260 --> 16:36.780]  conducted on a patient who remains hospitalized the Hawaii nurses
[16:36.780 --> 16:41.540]  association said the person is being treated at Queens it's very possible
[16:41.540 --> 16:45.660]  that they do it that they have a bullet but I think it's also even in more
[16:45.660 --> 16:50.700]  likely that they have another condition that presents with similar symptoms
[16:50.700 --> 16:55.900]  Dr. Melissa Varay said the patient could have a number of illnesses including
[16:55.900 --> 17:01.580]  Ebola flu malaria and typhoid she wouldn't tell me any symptoms the person
[17:01.580 --> 17:06.540]  was having or if the person had recently traveled to West Africa but she
[17:06.540 --> 17:13.220]  did say a big red flag of Ebola is a fever and recent travel to that area why
[17:13.220 --> 17:20.220]  is this person being isolated so again when when we've been what we've asked
[17:20.220 --> 17:25.780]  the hospital to tell us about is anyone with a travel history and anyone with a
[17:25.780 --> 17:31.140]  fever and when those two come together we've asked them to be very careful and
[17:31.140 --> 17:34.220]  in abundance of caution while you're working them up for whatever else might
[17:34.220 --> 17:43.220]  be going on also make sure you isolate against Ebola just in case of Hawaii a
[17:43.220 --> 17:49.140]  potential new case of Ebola not confirmed yet as I said at the beginning of
[17:49.140 --> 17:53.300]  the show we're also tracking a case in a different state where a health
[17:53.300 --> 17:57.620]  professional a medical worker claims that there is a case that they're about
[17:57.620 --> 18:00.940]  to announce in a completely different state so if that's the case it would
[18:00.940 --> 18:05.740]  bring us up to a potential of three but only one confirmed so far of course in
[18:05.740 --> 18:11.340]  Dallas but he potentially exposed up to a hundred people or more to the Ebola
[18:11.340 --> 18:17.140]  virus mainly because he went into the hospital on September the 26th and was
[18:17.140 --> 18:22.220]  turned away was given antibiotics despite the fact that he told hospital
[18:22.220 --> 18:27.740]  workers that he had just flown in from Liberia and that he had the symptoms
[18:27.740 --> 18:32.780]  associated with the onset of Ebola here's an article out of the Guardian
[18:32.780 --> 18:38.460]  US Ebola patient told staff of Liberia travel but was allowed to leave
[18:38.460 --> 18:44.180]  hospital so our initial understanding of this was that he didn't tell the nurses
[18:44.180 --> 18:47.580]  the hospital workers where he had come from they didn't ask that was obviously
[18:47.580 --> 18:52.660]  the the first faux pas but now we know that he actually told them directly he
[18:52.660 --> 18:57.580]  had come from Liberia yet they still asked no questions whatsoever gave him
[18:57.580 --> 19:02.980]  some antibiotics and sent him on his way for a further two days after he had
[19:02.980 --> 19:07.740]  already been in Dallas since September 20th and again no questions asked we've
[19:07.740 --> 19:12.900]  also got this out of CNN Health hospital dropped the ball with the ball the
[19:12.900 --> 19:17.220]  patients travel history NH officials says the first person to be diagnosed
[19:17.220 --> 19:21.740]  with Ebola on American soil went to the emergency room last week but was
[19:21.740 --> 19:25.260]  released from the hospital even though he told staff he had traveled from
[19:25.260 --> 19:29.780]  Liberia a travel history was taken but it wasn't communicated to the people who
[19:29.780 --> 19:34.300]  were making the decision it was a mistake they dropped the ball and that was
[19:34.300 --> 19:39.340]  very apparent in the press conference yesterday where they deflected basically
[19:39.340 --> 19:43.500]  any questions about how this was allowed to occur how this patient was allowed to
[19:43.500 --> 19:47.900]  wander around Dallas for a period of days we're gonna be back after the break

[24:34.660 --> 24:39.100]  Joseph Watson filling in for Alex who will be calling in at some point from
[24:39.100 --> 24:43.260]  the road we've got a big top story up on info wars.com right now Rand Paul
[24:43.260 --> 24:48.380]  political correctness hindering scientific decisions on Ebola outbreak
[24:48.380 --> 24:53.180]  and he says quote my suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than we've
[24:53.180 --> 24:57.740]  been told so this ties into the warning from the UN head that it could have gone
[24:57.740 --> 25:02.740]  airborne now we have Rand Paul complaining about political correctness
[25:02.740 --> 25:10.340]  and that hindering the CDC in being able to deal with this Ebola outbreak also
[25:10.340 --> 25:13.940]  saying that it's possibly a lot more transmissible than we've been told
[25:13.940 --> 25:19.300]  which is developing into a common theme we also have this article out of Reuters
[25:19.300 --> 25:25.740]  Dallas Ebola patient vomited outside apartment on way to hospital so we know
[25:25.740 --> 25:29.300]  that he was taken to the hospital inside this ambulance which was then used
[25:29.300 --> 25:34.940]  for two days afterwards potentially exposing other people health workers to
[25:34.940 --> 25:40.620]  the Ebola virus also it came out yesterday I believe that this individual
[25:40.620 --> 25:46.620]  Thomas Eric Duncan first contracted the Ebola virus having helped one of his
[25:46.620 --> 25:51.780]  family members back in Liberia into a taxi I believe it was a pregnant woman
[25:51.780 --> 25:56.700]  that was stricken with Ebola he helped her into a taxi back in Liberia there's
[25:56.700 --> 26:00.780]  the article out of the New York Times US patient aided pregnant Liberian then took
[26:00.780 --> 26:07.540]  ill so I mean it almost certainly he knew that he would contract Ebola having
[26:07.540 --> 26:11.940]  done this then he flies to the United States almost immediately to get
[26:11.940 --> 26:16.860]  treatment and I've seen questions being asked for the people who can afford it
[26:16.860 --> 26:21.420]  obviously the hospitals in Africa are completely overwhelmed by this people
[26:21.420 --> 26:25.820]  who turn up for treatment fearing they're in a bowl of victim get turned away
[26:25.820 --> 26:29.740]  and we've seen videos where people are just hanging out the back of ambulance
[26:29.740 --> 26:33.420]  as they can't even make it into the hospital no one's really helping them
[26:33.420 --> 26:37.220]  into the hospital because they don't have any beds available in those West
[26:37.220 --> 26:42.940]  African countries Liberia Sierra Leone and others so the question is being asked
[26:42.940 --> 26:46.820]  you know if this guy had the money could he have traveled to the United States in
[26:46.820 --> 26:52.820]  the knowledge that he would get the best health care having been having
[26:52.820 --> 26:57.980]  contracted Ebola knowing that he had done so from this pregnant woman of course
[26:57.980 --> 27:02.620]  they turned him away he told them he had come from Liberia gave him antibiotics
[27:02.620 --> 27:08.020]  and turned him away now we have the global situation which is just getting
[27:08.020 --> 27:13.820]  increasingly drastic every day BBC reports Ebola outbreak five infected
[27:13.820 --> 27:18.620]  every hour in Sierra Leone a leading charity is one that rates of five new
[27:18.620 --> 27:23.300]  Ebola cases an hour in Sierra Leone means healthcare demands are far outstripping
[27:23.300 --> 27:30.300]  supply save the children said there were 765 new cases of Ebola reported in the
[27:30.300 --> 27:35.620]  West African state last week while there were only 327 beds in the country so
[27:35.620 --> 27:39.940]  again they're completely overwhelmed they can't take in the staggering number
[27:39.940 --> 27:44.620]  of patients that this is impacting and here at the end of the article we see
[27:44.620 --> 27:50.700]  the scale of the disease is also quote massively under reported according to the
[27:50.700 --> 27:55.780]  charity because quote untold numbers of children are dying anonymously at home
[27:55.780 --> 28:03.100]  or in the streets so this figure of Ebola deaths so far 300 3338 of course
[28:03.100 --> 28:08.860]  many more infected recovered could be many more because a lot of them just
[28:08.860 --> 28:12.300]  aren't being recorded a lot of people are just collapsing and dying in the
[28:12.300 --> 28:17.300]  streets so if you think it's bad now I mean imagine living in those West
[28:17.300 --> 28:23.180]  African countries we had top German virologists talking about five million
[28:23.180 --> 28:29.220]  dead in Liberia in Sierra Leone because the virus is just going to burn
[28:29.220 --> 28:32.420]  itself out according to him it's just going to infect everybody that's the
[28:32.420 --> 28:37.420]  only point where it's going to actually stop Daily Mail online reports four
[28:37.420 --> 28:42.980]  weeks to stop Ebola 34 global organizations will warn international
[28:42.980 --> 28:48.140]  conference we have one month to stop the epidemic spiraling completely out of
[28:48.140 --> 28:52.580]  control the international community has just four weeks to stop the Ebola crisis
[28:52.580 --> 28:57.580]  spiraling completely out of control organizations working in West Africa have
[28:57.580 --> 29:05.660]  today warned so again that ties in with the UN head the top UN Ebola head who
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.980]  said that this could be transmissible and it needs to be stopped now as long as
[29:09.980 --> 29:14.500]  it isn't transmissible according to our understanding before it potentially
[29:14.500 --> 29:20.820]  mutates goes airborne which of course is a nightmare scenario in his words UN
[29:20.820 --> 29:25.980]  Ebola she virus could mutate and become airborne if it is not controlled we're
[29:25.980 --> 29:28.900]  going to get into that and more Ebola needs we're also going to cover some

[35:14.260 --> 35:20.300]  and it's really helped that's oxy powder and DNA force at info wars store.com

[35:27.220 --> 35:32.020]  course it supports the broadcast and everything we do here at info wars.com
[35:32.020 --> 35:38.220]  so that's infowars.infowarsstore.com for the oxy powder DNA force and all the
[35:38.220 --> 35:44.260]  other health products breaking news narrow of NBC news.com Ebola patient
[35:44.260 --> 35:50.140]  Thomas Eric Duncan's nephew I had to call CDC the first person diagnosed with
[35:50.140 --> 35:55.180]  Ebola in the US wasn't appropriately treated for suspected infection until
[35:55.180 --> 35:58.420]  after a relative personally called the Centers for Disease Control and
[35:58.420 --> 36:04.220]  Prevention his nephew told NBC news on Wednesday night health officials have
[36:04.220 --> 36:08.620]  acknowledged that Thomas Eric Duncan 42 was initially sent home from Texas
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.620]  Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas when he showed up on September 26
[36:12.620 --> 36:16.940]  complaining of fever and abdominal pain he had to return two days later in an
[36:16.940 --> 36:22.740]  ambulance this is what the nephew says that was the day quo I called CDC to get
[36:22.740 --> 36:26.620]  some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he wasn't
[36:26.620 --> 36:32.100]  getting the appropriate care Duncan's nephew Josephus weeks told NBC news on
[36:32.100 --> 36:37.820]  Wednesday night so again we know before this guy Thomas Eric Duncan arrived in
[36:37.820 --> 36:43.460]  Dallas he had helped an Ebola victim a pregnant woman who subsequently died
[36:43.460 --> 36:50.340]  from the Ebola virus into a taxi to get her to the hospital he then contracted
[36:50.340 --> 36:54.860]  Ebola flew to the United States via I think it was Brussels and Washington
[36:54.860 --> 37:00.580]  dollars walks into a Dallas hospital and again they give him antibiotics even
[37:00.580 --> 37:04.700]  though he tells them he just came in from Liberia he has the early onset
[37:04.700 --> 37:10.700]  symptoms of Ebola so now we're learning that his nephew had to directly call the
[37:10.700 --> 37:17.620]  CDC to warn that he was a potential Ebola victim until he could actually be
[37:17.620 --> 37:22.620]  isolated and get proper treatment I mean who knows they gave him antibiotics the
[37:22.620 --> 37:27.180]  first time would they have sent him away again into the general population if
[37:27.180 --> 37:32.900]  this nephew hadn't have called the CDC so I mean yesterday it was apparent that
[37:32.900 --> 37:36.740]  they completely dropped the ball I mean the screw-up gets even worse now we have
[37:36.740 --> 37:41.860]  the denials and a NIH director on Ebola screw up I think we just need to put
[37:41.860 --> 37:49.380]  that behind us he told MSNBC's morning Joe earlier today so again move along
[37:49.380 --> 37:56.300]  nothing to see here as potential new cases are being reported let's go to
[37:56.300 --> 38:03.140]  some of your calls on Ebola Gabrielle in Michigan you're on the air go ahead
[38:03.420 --> 38:10.260]  hey Paul speaking of nothing to see here I wanted to put up a statement that
[38:10.260 --> 38:16.740]  they're saying that you don't show symptoms until later and they're
[38:16.740 --> 38:21.300]  screening people for fevers at the airport and you're not going to have
[38:21.300 --> 38:27.140]  any symptoms if you have it later come into the States and then have a full
[38:27.140 --> 38:31.540]  blown episode well precisely I mean there was article out of defense one
[38:31.540 --> 38:35.460]  yesterday which made the point that screening people at airports is
[38:35.460 --> 38:40.380]  completely useless because they cannot show these symptoms for days we're
[38:40.380 --> 38:44.460]  told that Ebola can only be contracted when the symptoms start to be shown by
[38:44.460 --> 38:48.740]  the sufferer but they can go days without showing any of these symptoms they
[38:48.740 --> 38:52.860]  see the article out of defense one there's really no way to screen for Ebola
[38:52.860 --> 38:57.620]  at airports which is the only measure that they are now apparently putting in
[38:57.620 --> 39:03.540]  place as of yesterday customs border patrol and flight attendants are being
[39:03.540 --> 39:08.380]  told to watch for people with signs of fever with signs of symptoms potentially
[39:08.380 --> 39:12.300]  linked with Ebola why that wasn't already in place I don't know but even now
[39:12.300 --> 39:18.340]  it is in place it's really going to have little effect whatsoever no flights have
[39:18.340 --> 39:22.020]  been cancelled as a result of this it doesn't appear as if that's likely to
[39:22.020 --> 39:25.620]  be the case even though several of the major airlines across the world
[39:25.620 --> 39:30.420]  cancelled flights from Liberia weeks ago of course that's more difficult to do in
[39:30.420 --> 39:35.020]  the case of the US because those flights aren't coming in directly from Liberia
[39:35.020 --> 39:39.300]  or from Sierra Leone but there's been no indication whatsoever that the
[39:39.300 --> 39:45.100]  government that the health authorities are planning to do that so again this
[39:45.100 --> 39:48.340]  screening of temperature at airports is pretty much pointless because they could
[39:48.340 --> 39:52.780]  have Ebola and not show the symptoms for days thanks for your call
[39:52.780 --> 39:59.860]  Martinez in Texas you're on the air go ahead yes I kind of dovetailing this in
[39:59.860 --> 40:06.780]  Ebola with the session I think I mean ever since I was a kid I was an advocate
[40:06.780 --> 40:13.060]  of the session but it's always lit in a political you know fashion never have we
[40:13.060 --> 40:20.300]  had the chance and the view of our own federal government blatantly not caring
[40:20.300 --> 40:25.940]  for our safety and essentially sending us off in a war while there's an
[40:25.940 --> 40:31.660]  outbreak going on telling us that we're you know we're okay and of course it's
[40:31.660 --> 40:37.100]  not happening it's time for really for us to start taking responsibility for our
[40:37.100 --> 40:41.620]  own states and our and our own homes and communities because the federal
[40:41.620 --> 40:45.380]  government truly isn't going to be there so really my you know my question is
[40:45.380 --> 40:52.420]  is you know should should we use this as our motive to really say this has
[40:52.420 --> 40:59.220]  nothing to do with politics this has the pure honest view of safety and this is
[40:59.220 --> 41:06.460]  why we as states and his taxes should break away bring our own suits back to
[41:06.460 --> 41:11.100]  cure our own borders attack ourselves because the federal government is in
[41:11.100 --> 41:17.300]  danger well precisely I mean even in this one case alone the CDC after months of
[41:17.300 --> 41:21.460]  telling us they were prepared for a potential Ebola outbreak in the United
[41:21.460 --> 41:27.180]  States they failed completely more so the health authorities in Texas at the
[41:27.180 --> 41:31.540]  Presbyterian Hospital but again you know the CDC is now complaining that it's
[41:31.540 --> 41:35.260]  underfunded that it that it doesn't have the capacity to deal with any of this
[41:35.260 --> 41:39.740]  that's only come out now after Ebola has already arrived in the United States I
[41:39.740 --> 41:44.740]  probably should have been a big issue two months ago but it wasn't so again
[41:44.740 --> 41:50.100]  it's a good argument for secession in terms of localizing health authorities
[41:50.100 --> 41:53.940]  and dealing with this on a more decentralized basis which would probably
[41:53.940 --> 41:58.580]  be more effective rather than this federal response which again always
[41:58.580 --> 42:03.380]  seems to be botched always seems to be in the pursuit of monetary or political
[42:03.380 --> 42:07.700]  power objectives in terms of this medical martial law infrastructure that
[42:07.700 --> 42:13.820]  the CDC has set up particularly over the past 10 to 15 years so that's a good
[42:13.820 --> 42:19.660]  argument for devolving power locally thanks for the call gonna go to Tion in
[42:19.660 --> 42:25.500]  Arizona you're on the air go ahead yes I wanted to bring up the point first of
[42:25.500 --> 42:29.700]  all thanks for taking my call but I wanted to bring up the point of the
[42:29.700 --> 42:35.820]  black coffins Aaron Dyke's article in 2010 about the FEMA black coffins I mean
[42:35.820 --> 42:40.500]  I just wonder you know how soon are they gonna be filling us Americans up the
[42:40.500 --> 42:48.100]  most coffins and it it just scares me as I said yesterday I think the threat of
[42:48.100 --> 42:53.220]  the hysteria is going to be more visceral and potentially you know
[42:53.220 --> 42:58.620]  exploited by the feds as the threat of the virus itself because it only takes
[42:58.620 --> 43:03.340]  you know perhaps a dozen cases across America in different states for this to
[43:03.340 --> 43:09.540]  really get hyped up of course they've had 3,300 cases in West Africa they're
[43:09.540 --> 43:15.780]  talking about 1.2 million by the end of January imagine if there were just a
[43:15.780 --> 43:22.220]  dozen or two dozen cases in America in different states I mean this this would
[43:22.220 --> 43:27.180]  engender some kind of panic and I know the CDC is well aware of that so as I
[43:27.180 --> 43:31.460]  said it it's about managing the hysteria as much as it is about managing the
[43:31.460 --> 43:35.660]  actual virus obviously if it goes airborne which a lot of major health
[43:35.660 --> 43:40.220]  professionals the UN head of the Ebola response team is now warning about then
[43:40.220 --> 43:45.420]  that's another nightmare scenario as he called it all together but we also had
[43:45.420 --> 43:50.620]  the article a couple of days ago now which was that the CDC advised funeral
[43:50.620 --> 43:56.060]  homes in the United States to prepare for an Ebola outbreak they were telling
[43:56.060 --> 44:02.340]  funeral workers not to conduct autopsies or embalm corpses they were giving them a
[44:02.340 --> 44:08.780]  list of recommendations they you see the article up on infowars.com so they're
[44:08.780 --> 44:12.060]  well aware that this could this could really escalate that's obviously why
[44:12.060 --> 44:17.860]  they're talking to funeral homes hopefully it remains isolated I think the
[44:17.860 --> 44:20.740]  good news is the fact that those ambulance workers that brought the
[44:20.740 --> 44:26.500]  Ebola victim into the hospital in Dallas were not infected with the virus so
[44:26.500 --> 44:31.340]  that suggests that it's not airborne at least in this case and I hope that that
[44:31.340 --> 44:37.340]  remains so but thanks for the call we're gonna go to Tom in Idaho go ahead Tom
[44:37.340 --> 44:43.340]  hey Paul good morning to you morning hey have you guys heard of this fire chat
[44:43.340 --> 44:48.460]  yet going on in Hong Kong no what's that go ahead explain that to the listeners
[44:48.460 --> 44:53.420]  man they have got a free app that this guy has created that you don't need
[44:53.420 --> 44:59.100]  Wi-Fi or hotspot to communicate to your phone through texting these protesters
[44:59.100 --> 45:06.620]  are using this app to communicate and organize their protest and 100,000 apps
[45:06.620 --> 45:13.820]  and one day this creator got downloaded as spreading fast look into it I've
[45:13.820 --> 45:18.020]  I've I've looked it up on the internet and gotten as much information as I can
[45:18.020 --> 45:23.300]  it's hit a couple of mainstream news article feeds give it some credence and
[45:23.300 --> 45:27.220]  see where it goes there you go right there that's out of Forbes fire chat
[45:27.220 --> 45:31.660]  prepares encryption feature as it drives Hong Kong protests yeah I briefly saw
[45:31.660 --> 45:35.300]  this this morning I didn't get into the details Twitter helped power the Arab
[45:35.300 --> 45:40.540]  spring in 2012 which of course we also know was hijacked now the pro democracy
[45:40.540 --> 45:44.340]  demonstration setting Hong Kong emotion are being driven by a new kind of
[45:44.340 --> 45:49.580]  mobile technology an underground messaging app called fire chat so yeah as
[45:49.580 --> 45:53.500]  far as I understand it this doesn't need Wi-Fi that it says here or a carrier
[45:53.500 --> 45:57.260]  connection to the chat to one another on the app they only need another person
[45:57.260 --> 46:02.020]  with the same app within a 70 meter radius that's useful in Hong Kong where
[46:02.020 --> 46:05.860]  the influx of thousands of protesters have made cellular cellular connections
[46:05.860 --> 46:11.940]  sluggish or nonexistent so the technology I guess it's some kind of radio
[46:11.940 --> 46:16.860]  technology or some kind of extended Bluetooth within a 70 meter radius they
[46:16.860 --> 46:22.220]  can communicate with each other without the need for Wi-Fi or cellular
[46:22.220 --> 46:27.540]  connections that would be interesting to see where that originated from because
[46:27.540 --> 46:32.700]  there are a lot of questions which will delve into later in the show about
[46:32.700 --> 46:38.060]  whether this Hong Kong uprising given that it is from the outset looking in
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.740]  genuine I mean Beijing is openly announced they're gonna hand select the
[46:41.740 --> 46:47.860]  Hong Kong politicians for the 2017 election basically reimposing Chinese
[46:47.860 --> 46:53.340]  control over the area after Britain handed it back in 1997 but with those
[46:53.340 --> 46:57.380]  protections for political free speech and elections so it seems to be a
[46:57.380 --> 47:01.180]  genuine uprising looking in from the outside but then you get into the
[47:01.180 --> 47:05.180]  evidence now of who is funding it which we're gonna get into later and it could
[47:05.180 --> 47:11.060]  indeed be a case of another color revolution like we saw in Ukraine that
[47:11.060 --> 47:14.540]  at least it was hijacked by these organizations such as the National
[47:14.540 --> 47:19.340]  Endowment for Democracy that we've seen before subverting and infiltrating
[47:19.340 --> 47:23.700]  these mass protest movements as we saw with the Arab Spring back two three
[47:23.700 --> 47:28.860]  years ago it could again be the case in Hong Kong not to say that those
[47:28.860 --> 47:33.260]  grievances aren't genuine that the initial protest movement sprang up out
[47:33.260 --> 47:38.420]  of in that area but it's something we're definitely gonna dig into later in the
[47:38.420 --> 47:42.460]  show thanks for the call though we're gonna go to Ben in Missouri go ahead
[47:42.460 --> 47:48.780]  Ben hey how's it going thank you for taking my call I just wanted to say a
[47:48.780 --> 47:54.900]  couple things first of all my wife is a pediatric nurse and she is gonna follow
[47:54.900 --> 47:58.700]  me the email but she's been briefed and all of the employees have been briefed
[47:58.700 --> 48:03.540]  on Ebola I know that that's not news or anything but it's definitely you know
[48:03.540 --> 48:09.620]  it's it's true it's it seems like it's coming to me the saddest part about this
[48:09.620 --> 48:16.140]  entire thing is I have this feeling that this is a drill this is a live drill
[48:16.140 --> 48:20.620]  that's being run at the expense of the American people to see whether or not the
[48:20.620 --> 48:26.060]  government can contain a bio weapon you know they're the CDC all the different
[48:26.060 --> 48:30.020]  government energies coming together to see if they can do it and it's gonna be
[48:30.020 --> 48:34.380]  done at the expense of the American people just like everything else it's
[48:34.380 --> 48:38.860]  crazy that I could even really think that that's happened that that could be
[48:38.860 --> 48:42.460]  the case but you know based on the criminals that run things in this
[48:42.460 --> 48:45.980]  country it wouldn't shock me it wouldn't surprise me and I think that that might
[48:45.980 --> 48:50.700]  be the case that's the question that John Rappaport is asking in an article on
[48:50.700 --> 48:55.540]  prisonplanet.com today tracking Ebola contacts call in the surveillance state
[48:55.540 --> 49:00.580]  he says quote this is a perfect way for surveillance advocates to win love for
[49:00.580 --> 49:05.220]  their machine we told you the NSA was absolutely necessary in order to protect
[49:05.220 --> 49:09.100]  the American people here's the proof we can hunt and find carriers of the
[49:09.100 --> 49:14.660]  dreaded virus and you and your children will be safe so as you mentioned
[49:14.660 --> 49:19.140]  whether this turns out to be limited which you know in all probability it
[49:19.140 --> 49:23.740]  will hopefully it will they could still hijack it to beef up this
[49:23.740 --> 49:29.220]  infrastructure of medical martial law that really came into the fore after 9
[49:29.220 --> 49:35.300]  11 of course with the anthrax attacks which led directly back to Fort Detrick
[49:35.300 --> 49:41.220]  they blamed a patsy that all completely unraveled but they used it again to
[49:41.220 --> 49:45.620]  beef up this medical martial law infrastructure so you know the federal
[49:45.620 --> 49:49.740]  government tends to like to exploit these opportunities never let a good
[49:49.740 --> 49:56.700]  crisis go to waste in the words of Rahm Emanuel to call forth the surveillance
[49:56.700 --> 50:02.300]  state as John Rappaport says in his article and that's precisely what we
[50:02.300 --> 50:06.860]  see unfolding thanks for the call Jeff in Georgia go ahead you're on the air
[50:06.860 --> 50:11.780]  oh Paul thanks for taking the call yeah two things before we get started the
[50:11.780 --> 50:15.660]  Ebola thing I just wanted to remind and because of you guys Robert Tosh
[50:15.660 --> 50:20.460]  Palmley is 11 questions if you go back and look at those 11 questions I think
[50:20.460 --> 50:23.220]  that you'll find that almost all of them have been answered by now just by the
[50:23.220 --> 50:27.180]  actions of federal government as far as the Ebola thing you know is this the
[50:27.180 --> 50:29.780]  October surprise and of course one of the many that these guys are kind of
[50:29.780 --> 50:35.020]  springing us from all areas open borders open airline flights from Africa into
[50:35.020 --> 50:39.460]  the United States and Ebola breaks out and can they get this thing cranked up
[50:39.460 --> 50:43.340]  enough to scare everybody away from the polls by November 5th and if not this
[50:43.340 --> 50:48.700]  year by 2016 would it mean that you would have to have your Ebola vaccination
[50:48.700 --> 50:51.820]  before you could vote because you're gonna be in a public space it's an
[50:51.820 --> 50:54.820]  interesting point we'll be back with more of your calls after the break David

[54:46.420 --> 54:50.060]  more there's a doctor actually in Atlanta we're gonna get this clip maybe
[54:50.060 --> 54:56.740]  next segment who's protesting against what he says our CDC lies with the Ebola
[54:56.740 --> 55:01.700]  situation he actually dressed up in a hazmat suit went to Atlanta International
[55:01.700 --> 55:08.780]  Airport and staged a one-man protest a doctor against the CDC for its handling
[55:08.780 --> 55:13.620]  of this Ebola incident in Dallas so we're gonna get trying to get that video
[55:13.620 --> 55:18.980]  for you soon up next on the line is Alan in Maryland go ahead Alan you're on the
[55:18.980 --> 55:23.540]  end good afternoon there I'll Paul that's some fine work you're doing over
[55:23.540 --> 55:26.900]  there at info wars now I'm gonna make three points and I'm gonna make it very
[55:26.900 --> 55:31.500]  clear and make it quick Bill Gates and Warren Guff Warren Buffett are up to
[55:31.500 --> 55:35.220]  their necks in this stuff they're trying to clear out Africa we know that
[55:35.220 --> 55:39.580]  America is being dissolved in a battle political acid and China has been moving
[55:39.580 --> 55:45.140]  into Africa for years so this is a way to get them you know basically startled
[55:45.140 --> 55:51.060]  stop their progress etc. Bill Gates said the other night that this is not
[55:51.060 --> 55:57.180]  going to be the last epidemic Bill Gates is up to his neck in this we've been
[55:57.180 --> 56:02.340]  attacking vaccines now for what five years Alex has been doing it for forever
[56:02.340 --> 56:08.460]  and we know full well we put a huge dent in their money machine I'll tell you
[56:08.460 --> 56:13.580]  something folks what we're looking at here is a false flag the CDC lost small
[56:13.580 --> 56:19.620] pox a truckload of smallpox so they had to cover that up with Ebola now Ebola is
[56:19.620 --> 56:22.940]  not going to affect us the way it does in Africa because we have fresh water
[56:22.940 --> 56:27.220]  fresh food vitamin C vitamins and especially we have Alex Jones and all
[56:27.220 --> 56:32.020]  his products and doctor group but I want people to be on board here the
[56:32.020 --> 56:35.980]  gentleman mentioned the October surprise we've heard Robert Tosh plumbing talk
[56:35.980 --> 56:40.420]  about false flags you listen to these people speak you look at their
[56:40.420 --> 56:45.820]  writings pay attention to silent weapons for quiet wars quiet wars for silent
[56:45.820 --> 56:51.580]  weapons when they tell you that superbugs are coming and they're here you
[56:51.580 --> 56:56.300]  better believe they are not going to lose the money you know Rockefeller you've
[56:56.300 --> 57:00.140]  got Rockefeller you got Kissinger all over the place you got Brzezinski out
[57:00.140 --> 57:06.060]  there blabbing his mouth ladies and gentlemen this is how they roll and I
[57:06.060 --> 57:11.260]  tweeted what bio weapon are they going to release on us next three months ago
[57:11.260 --> 57:19.500]  and within 30 days we had Ebola and there you have it was it's interesting
[57:19.500 --> 57:23.700]  because actually Lewis Farrakhan of all people came out today incited Dick
[57:23.700 --> 57:28.860]  Cheney's rebuilding America's defenses document where he said that you know
[57:28.860 --> 57:33.380]  germ warfare bio warfare would improve to the point where it could target
[57:33.380 --> 57:37.660]  individual races obviously I don't think that's the case with Ebola because we've
[57:37.660 --> 57:41.300]  had a lot of American health workers that have been infected with it that have
[57:41.300 --> 57:45.180]  come back but definitely that's something that they had in the offing in terms of
[57:45.180 --> 57:50.180]  Africa as he said China's got huge investment in that country they're
[57:50.180 --> 57:55.540]  trying to absorb it into the bricks financial structure that is destined to
[57:55.540 --> 58:02.420]  taken on America and that's the case in Africa there's there's a lot of rallying
[58:02.420 --> 58:07.940]  back between America and China China has investments in America in Africa which
[58:07.940 --> 58:13.220]  dwarf those of America we had these troops sent in by Obama recently to
[58:13.220 --> 58:17.060]  deal with the Ebola outbreak a lot of questions being asked about what good
[58:17.060 --> 58:21.700]  troops would do in such a situation and again a lot of information should it
[58:21.700 --> 58:25.700]  suggest that could have been an undercover attempt to subvert to infiltrate
[58:25.700 --> 58:31.540]  Africa in the guise of fighting Ebola when in reality it was a geopolitical move
[58:31.540 --> 58:35.500]  against China so we'll get into that and more after the break David Knight is
[58:35.500 --> 58:42.460]  coming up in studio next it's the Alex Jones show live stay tuned thank you for

[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:45.700]  to this clip out of Atlanta which have been reported Dr. Don's Ebola protection
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:51.380]  suit to protest CDC's calling the CDC liars for their handling of this Ebola
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:57.380]  situation let's go to the clip my name is Dr. Gil mobly I'm an MD I'm an
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:01.020]  emergency trauma physician and a microbiologist I'm here this morning in
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.580]  the Atlanta Airport to put out a public call for action I believe the CDC is
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.620]  being dishonest with us about the propensity of importing Ebola cases to the
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.100]  United States once this disease consumes every third world country surely it
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.140]  will because they lack the same basic infrastructure as Sierra Leone and
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.500]  Liberia it will devour these countries at that point we will be importing
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:27.820]  clusters of Ebola on a daily basis that will overwhelm any advanced countries
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.980]  ability to contain the clusters of isolation and quarantine that spells
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.220]  bad news the CDC last week said the chance of importing Ebola was
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:41.460]  infantism and that was the same day patient was misdiagnosed in Dallas the
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:46.100]  CDC is derelict in their duty yesterday I came through international customs in
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.740]  the Atlanta Airport the only question they asked arriving passengers so they
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:55.180]  had tobacco or alcohol that is dereliction of duty the CDC is asleep
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:02:02.420]  at the wheel testing against the CDC Atlanta airport as I mentioned earlier
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.340]  the CNN news crew who came back from Liberia basically told the US Customs
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:13.140]  and Border Patrol that they had been in Liberia in close quarters with people
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:18.220]  infected with Ebola they were reporting on the situation basically Border Patrol
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.580]  were not interested they did nothing they asked no questions they took no
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.500]  tests this was a couple of days before the outbreak and as this doctor said the
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:31.340]  CDC said it was an infinitesimal probability that the United States
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:36.620]  would see a case of this now it's arrived so we've got anger protests against
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:41.460]  the CDC David Knight joins us in studio for the latest on what the CDC is
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.460]  saying about the Ebola outbreak in Africa David what's the latest well now
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:49.340]  Paul they're saying that it's going to possibly reach anywhere from a half a
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:54.100]  million to one and a half million cases in West Africa by January that's just
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.700]  three four months away that is a huge number if you look at the population
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.060]  because that's just two countries where it's the worst right now Sierra Leone
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.700]  and Liberia those two countries have a combined population of only about 10
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.300]  million people so you're looking at a very high percentage you're looking at
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:18.700]  about 5% to 20% of the population the CDC is projecting is going to come down
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.300]  with Ebola by January in those West African countries and so that really
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.220]  kind of puts all this that we've been hearing from Rick Perry and the CDC
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.940]  about how don't worry we have a wonderful medical infrastructure here
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:36.580]  compared to West Africa yes we do we also have a much larger population we do
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:41.020]  not have infinite resources to handle anything so what happens when you start
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:47.380]  to get a massive exponential increase in cases and you don't have the hospital
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:53.940]  staff you don't have the the capacity to deal with this because right now it is
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.100]  still growing exponentially we've got some other figures we're going to break
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.100]  down those figures in detail coming from the CDC we've also got some other
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.980]  information that I think people would like to know and some other areas we've
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.460]  got Californians are now going to be able to get their relatives disarmed with
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.100]  the new law that's been passed in California the US government has
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:17.740]  relaxed the standards on killing civilians with drones in areas that are
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:22.060]  supposedly affected by ISIS so we have some interest and also there's another
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:26.580]  story out of Hong Kong is that's building to a conflict there's a story
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:30.540]  out of Wall Street Journal talking about how there's a Christian subtext to this
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:36.260]  protest besides the heavy-handedness of China saying that they're going to pick
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:41.180]  who the candidates are and we'll be back with that and more we've also got Lionel
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.940]  from Lionel media coming up in the third hour to discuss a host of subjects

[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:28.500]  GCN radio network
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:33.580]  we're back on the Alex Jones show live Thursday October 2nd edition here's an
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:38.020]  article out of WorldNet daily we're going to talk about Obama or President
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.740]  obola as Michael Savage is calling him the bowl is now into the US because of
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:47.620]  President Obama's open borders policy charge talk radio host Michael Savage
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:52.500]  referring to the commander-in-chief as President obola Savage said on his
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.060]  national syndicated show Wednesday the quote only solution is zero travel in and
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.740]  out of West Africa for any American you let nobody in from a country where you
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:07.300]  have a raging epidemic he said emphasizing microbes do not discriminate you
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:12.540]  isolate you quarantine an entire nation if necessary that's what Michael Savage
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:17.580]  is saying we also in the epidemiologist is me Paul that's right yeah yeah that's
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.140]  right doctorate in epidemiology so that's what he's saying also we had a
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.180]  strange story which you mentioned David just during the break which was this
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.340]  September 6th 16th meeting that Obama had with the CDC and this incident which
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:36.340]  happened in the elevator explain that yeah I got a call from Richard Reeves here
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.540]  in infowars and and he noticed this connection and he said everybody is
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:44.140]  talking about this being essentially the final straw for the director of the
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:48.420]  Secret Service when she got fired he went to visit the CDC in Atlanta and while
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.580]  he's on an elevator there was a private security guard that they found had a gun
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.220]  that the Secret Service didn't know about after they found out about it it was a
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.180]  huge obvious breach in protocol for them but what nobody is talking about is the
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:04.500]  fact that Obama visited the CDC on September the 16th to talk about
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.500]  Ebola at the same time he's giving us assurances don't worry it's not going to
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.380]  come here and so that's that's an interesting data point I think along
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.980]  with the other disinformation that we're hearing just yesterday that Josh
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.500]  Ernest told the White House Prosecutory told reporters that they have
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:27.100]  screening processes and procedures in place at our borders they don't have
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.420]  that anybody that travels knows that they don't have it and they had a doctor
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.460]  very very angry about that who did a protest was that was that yeah that was
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:43.060]  at the Atlanta airport where the CDC is he donned a protective suit and put on
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:47.500]  wrote on the suit the CDC is lying and we have a clip of that too we played that
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.500]  in just the last segment when we had the news a lot of people don't get that they
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.340]  get local news on that let's let's go ahead and roll that clip again
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:11:00.700]  my name is dr. Gil mobly I'm an MD I'm an emergency trauma physician and a
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:07.300]  microbiologist to put out a public call for action I believe the CDC is being
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:11.500]  dishonest with us about the propensity of importing Ebola cases to the United
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.780]  States once this disease consumes every third world country as surely it will
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.660]  because he lacked the same basic infrastructure as Sierra Leone and
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:24.020]  Liberia it will devour these countries at that point we will be importing
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:29.300]  clusters of Ebola on a daily basis that will overwhelm any advanced country's
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:33.500]  ability to contain the clusters of isolation and quarantine that spells
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.740]  bad news the CDC last week said the chance of importing Ebola was
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:42.940]  infantism and that was the same day patient was misdiagnosed in Dallas the
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.620]  CDC is derelict in their duty yesterday I came through international customs in
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:51.260]  the Atlanta airport the only question they asked arriving passengers so they
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:56.980]  had tobacco or alcohol that is dereliction of duty the CDC is asleep at
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:02.740]  the wheel my name is doctor and that's interesting yeah and I mean as I said
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:07.420]  earlier these these CNN reporters that had been to Liberia they'd been in close
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.860]  quarters with these infected exposed Ebola victims they told the customs and
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:16.140]  border people directly look we've just been in Liberia you need to do some tests
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:20.740]  on us just to make sure and they ran no tests whatsoever I mean you know I came
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:24.580]  in last week they were they were certain to get my biometric fingerprints but
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:30.340]  nobody who came through got tested for any kind of temperature even though back
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:34.820]  in 2009 with a swine flu outbreak literally when we landed in China they
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.740]  boarded the plane in hazmat suits before you could get off the plane scanned
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:42.660]  everybody's temperatures so I mean David do you agree that the CDC is
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.740]  basically asleep at the wheel despite the fact they've been telling us for
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.680]  weeks that they were prepared for this oh absolutely and when you look at the
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.460]  fact that Obama in September 16th long before we learned about this even
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.340]  before the guy landed in the United States they're saying that there's not
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:04.460]  any concern but he's meeting with people at CDC and then we have this article up
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.100]  on infowars today disaster teams were notified months ago that they would be
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:15.060]  activated in October I find that interesting now combine that with this
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.420]  report from the CDC that's estimating the future number of cases in the Ebola
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:25.220]  epidemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone now what they are predicting is that those
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.420]  cases are going if you look at this chart if you're if you're watching the
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.660]  broadcast essentially you've got a hockey stick now everybody has seen the
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.460]  hockey stick the exponential growth graph when Al Gore is trying to scare
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.580]  everybody about global warming here we have something that many people are
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.860]  being criticized saying we're fear mongering we're creating hysteria and
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:50.980]  yet part of the hysteria is being created because they're not being up front
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:54.220]  with people they're not advising people what the real risks and what they're
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.940]  seeing are there they do the reports but they're pretty much hidden it's not
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:03.060]  being widely reported this is a report that came out actually before they
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.740]  released the information about this individual this is September the 26th so
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.460]  this is something that had been in the works for a while and they point out that
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:16.020]  within just six months this was first identified in West Africa and Guinea and
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:20.860]  on March 22nd of this year so it's only been about six months they say still the
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:26.300]  number of cases in Liberia are doubling every 15 to 20 days that's one of the
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.500]  reasons why we're seeing survival rates of 50% it's not that 50% of the people
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.820]  are getting better it's just that the number of cases is expanding so
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.580]  rapidly that it makes it look like the number of people that are dying there is
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:41.620]  actually lower the actual casualty figure and prognosis for people is about a
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.740]  70% death rate and Sierra Leone is not far behind now to put this in
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:50.100]  perspective Liberia only has a little over 4 million people it's got a
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:54.380]  population about the size of North Carolina imagine if there were 3,000
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:59.380]  cases of Ebola in North Carolina and you'd already had 2,000 deaths that's
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.700]  what we're looking at if you want to normalize that back to the United
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.900]  States we're looking at a situation that went from just starting six months ago
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.100]  to a situation if you normalize those numbers up to the population United
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:14.980]  States about 300,000 people coming down with Ebola and about 200,000 dying now
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.620]  that's what this doctor just said that although we have a wonderful medical
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:24.180]  system here they don't have the resources to handle that kind of massive
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.780]  pandemic and that's the issue we could easily be overwhelmed with that just as
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.260]  people in West Africa have been overwhelmed with that their infrastructure
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:40.100]  everything in that country the doctor at Emory University talked to scientific
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.940]  American and he told them they had 21 nurses five doctors and hundreds of
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.620]  staff persons working with those two people that they brought back the first
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:51.660]  to Kent Bradley Dr. Kent Bradley and the assistant and now how many times can
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.820]  they do that they did that and they were able they had that many people because
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.900]  they had to sterilize everything they got in industrial autoclaves to burn and
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.180]  sterilize everything that came in contact with so they had a massive amount
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:07.940]  of staff for just those two people what happens to our medical capacity when
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.340]  that number expands exponentially already today we saw just yesterday they
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.460]  were saying they're isolating 12 to 18 people then we see this morning it was
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.220]  80 now Reuters is reporting a hundred people have come in contact now they're
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:24.820]  not isolating these people yet they've only isolated four people so they're
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.900]  still allowing these other people I don't know how what they're doing to
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:33.100]  monitor them I mean considering the press conference yesterday I think that
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:37.660]  did a lot to scare a lot of people the fact that they would make that kind of
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.340]  mistake and the fact that they would not even address it upfront is what I find
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:45.940]  absolutely amazing right they were trying to cover their tracks I mean a hundred
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.980]  people exposed those are the people they know about I mean this is it how long
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.500]  was it four days he was walking around Dallas there could be hundreds more that
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.580]  were exposed that would they don't know about and there's no way to track them
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:59.900]  down all they're only concerned about two things continuity of government and
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:04.100]  continuity of their career okay so they're not going to admit that anything
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.620]  is wrong when I started in engineering I was working with quality control if we
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.540]  had something went wrong the first thing we had to do to a customer was to
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.780]  explain to them what the procedures were that we screwed up and how those were
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:21.100]  going to be changed that wouldn't happen again we didn't hear that from Rick
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:25.100]  Perry we didn't hear that from the Texas officials or the CDC we just heard don't
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.660]  worry we're experts we've been working on this for years we know what we're
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:34.140]  doing and we've got a great system here in America I mean America go I mean I
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:38.300]  watched that yesterday and it didn't seem very convincing they seem to be in
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.540]  quite of a fluster trying to answer those questions that were being thrown at
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.940]  them but another point is you know you mentioned when Bradley was brought in
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.940]  with the other doctors the the sophisticated procedures that were
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:53.380]  necessary to ensure his proper isolation we don't know if that's the case in the
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:59.260]  Texas Hospital also planes you cannot sterilize planes you know they're massive
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:04.700]  flying computers and there were experts on CNN today saying that it's just not
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:09.140]  possible to sterilize planes so a bowl of victims could have been on planes they
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.380]  could be reused for subsequent journeys and other people could become infected so
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:18.380]  all kinds of possibilities here then we have a seeming cover-up to some extent
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.580]  or just trying to dampen hysteria on this potential for the airborne
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.380]  transmission of Ebola again a story out of info wars.com yesterday Canadian
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:33.060]  health agency deletes info on airborne spread of Ebola and they had it in their
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:38.060]  original mode of transmission directives on their official website the public
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:43.340]  health agency of Canada quote airborne spread of Ebola among humans is strongly
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:47.660]  suspected later that was amended to read airborne transmission has not been
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:53.140]  demonstrated between non-human primates again the UN chief the head of the
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.820]  Ebola team for the United Nations came out today and said that there's a
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:00.940]  nightmare prospect that the virus could mutate and become airborne if it's not
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:04.620]  quickly brought under control so of course current understanding is that
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:09.500]  that it's not airborne but his point is if we allow it to circulate if we don't
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.460]  nip it in the bud now then it could mutate as it as it spreads amongst the
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.460]  population and that could cause it to go airborne again that's not info wars
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.940]  saying that's not Alex Jones saying that it's the head of the UN Ebola team
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.420]  saying that David Knight yeah it's pretty amazing and I got to say when I
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:34.020]  read the account last night of the patient who came here and what he was
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:39.220]  doing before he came here it was pretty clear that it's not being communicated
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.340]  to the people of Liberia what they need to do to protect themselves from the
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.180]  spread of the disease and the problem is it's not being communicated to people
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.700]  of America either we'll be back on the Alex Jones show with David Knight

[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:33.460]  studio coming up in the next hour we're going to talk to Lionel who has been a
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.620]  regular guest and contributor to info wars.com he's going to talk about some
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.740]  some of the cultural issues that surround these subjects going to talk
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:47.220]  about ISIS Syria and another and a number of different other topics now
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.820]  we're talking about Hong Kong because of course we had these huge protests
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:56.260]  erupt over the past few days I put out an article on info wars.com Hong Kong
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:00.780]  politician fears mini Tiananmen in response to unrest and this was a
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:06.420]  politician who was actually against the protesters she blamed the political
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.780]  party that she was in opposition to for stirring up these protesters so this
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:16.140]  this invocation of a potential new Tiananmen Square in terms of a a Beijing
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:19.860]  military crackdown on these demonstrators could be seen as more of a
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:23.820]  threat than anything but she basically said that they should respect
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:27.940]  authority they shouldn't be carrying out these protests against the Chinese
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:33.700]  government because this started back in August I believe it was where China put
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:39.100]  out this advisory where they said that they now see Hong Kong as basically
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:44.540]  their own fiefdom after the special administrative region was handed to them
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.940]  by the British back in 1997 under the understanding that Hong Kong would retain
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:56.460]  its political freedoms its electoral freedoms until at least 2047 so now
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:01.340]  China comes in and says we have the right to choose your political candidates
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.940]  before you can vote on them understandably that has caused a massive
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:11.420]  revolt in Hong Kong now we've got huge protests tear gas some police brutality
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.380]  attempting to disperse those demonstrators and David Knight more on
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.860]  this in terms of the identity of the protest movement involved in this
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.500]  yeah Paul so much for the promises of communists okay they said they're gonna
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.660]  even 50 years and already they're cracking down here but it's starting to
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:32.020]  reach ahead again they have Hong Kong protesters they they tried to get them to
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.300]  stand down even some of the leaders were telling them to stand down and yet the
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:39.940]  people stepped up their demonstrations they occupied offices now we have reports
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.780]  out the Guardian today that police have been seen carrying rubber bullets and
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:47.340]  other kit into compound housing offices of the chief executive that they are
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.580]  occupying they said pictures that are widely shared on social media are showing
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.460]  police carrying long boxes a barrel that is labeled round 38 millimeter rubber
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.460]  baton multi another with a one and a half inch CS on it possibly a reference
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:04.100]  to CS gas so it looks like they're going to start getting rough you know you
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.140]  carried that article on Monday about the official talking about they didn't want
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:12.740]  to see Tiananmen Square coming and I had just seen a picture before I saw your
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:18.540]  article of a small woman very small woman in a red dress barefoot right in
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:23.580]  the face of a half a dozen guys just armed to the teeth and in full riot
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:27.740]  gear that were towering over her about a foot taller than she was I looked at
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:32.420]  that and I said that is the Hong Kong version of Tiananmen Square that is the
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.580]  resolution of these people but there's something else behind this there's the
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:40.660]  Wall Street Journal article that came out today that essentially looked at the
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.860]  Christian influence of this I said the Hong Kong democracy protests carry a
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:50.140]  Christian mission for some now Christians understand where this is going
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:55.860]  this is not simply a political issue it impinges on every freedom and of course
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:01.300]  we all know how severely the Chinese government has persecuted Christians
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.700]  when I was in mainland China and we took a train from mainland China to Hong Kong
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:09.740]  we could tell that we were out of mainland China and approaching Hong Kong
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:14.620]  because we started seeing crosses you don't see that in mainland China so they
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.020]  know where this is headed and just like the black regiment that was part of the
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.500]  American Revolution here and that was the clergy who got up in front of the
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.780]  independence movement in front of the religious movement it's one of the
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:30.340]  reasons why free speech and freedom of religion is our very first amendment
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:34.500]  recognizing our God-given freedoms they understood that that's why the
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.100]  American clergy was up front the same thing is essentially happening in
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:43.300]  Hong Kong unfortunately here in America most of the people in the churches will
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.580]  take the position of that lady saying obey your government just sit down and
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.900]  shut up obey your government they don't see where this is headed even into
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.420]  Christian persecution and so what they're saying is that Hong Kong churches are
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:58.740]  playing a very quiet but important role in the city's protests offering food and
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.940]  shelter to demonstrators with some organizers and supporters citing
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.220]  Christian values as the inspiration for their fight and they have a political
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.900]  science scientists here saying that Christians in the Chinese government the
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.100]  difference is unbridgeable they say Christians by definition don't trust
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.460]  the communists the communists have suppressed Christians wherever they
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.100]  are and of course we we know that is true they even talked to a couple of the
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.460]  occupied leaders one is a Baptist minister another one said he's a
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:27.900]  Christian but he wouldn't talk about his faith in detail he said his faith was in
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.940]  the streets he knew that they were going to stand up to this so it's one of one
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.980]  other data point that we see just like that app that that guy was talking about
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.140]  how they could communicate with each other over short distances without Wi-Fi
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:42.140]  without cell phone we'll be back with more on the situation in Hong Kong and

[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:57.220]  lied on his airport health questionnaire some more questions about

[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:16.740]  got Carlucci our land destroyer basically he refers to a Washington post
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:21.180]  article which states quote Chinese Chinese leaders unnerved by protests
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:25.420]  elsewhere this year have been steadily tightening controls over civic organizations
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:31.020]  on the mainland suspected of carrying out the work of foreign powers later in
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:35.540]  the article they go on to explain how the Chinese president and Vladimir Putin
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:39.900]  are talking about this Hong Kong situation as if it could be a staged or
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.380]  at least hijacked cover color revolution so now they're saying that these
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:48.820]  Hong Kong protests could have been funded by the likes of the National
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:53.100]  Endowment for Democracy which we've seen before with the Arab Spring and of
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:58.100]  course in Kiev with the overthrow of the democratically elected government
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.980]  there were very much evident in hijacking and steering the protests
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:07.380]  again not to say that this Hong Kong situation isn't founded on genuine
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:11.140]  grievances it obviously is given that Beijing has basically announced that now
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:16.100]  it's going to hand select political candidates in Hong Kong before people
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.540]  can vote on them again eviscerating their freedoms that they've cherished for a
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:25.780]  long time and defended staunchly against potential Chinese imposition David
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:31.940]  Knight your take on these claims that the US the CIA the NDE could be hijacking
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.820]  the Hong Kong protests as a form of destabilization aimed at China well no
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.660]  doubt they are they always use these they always use these Machiavellian
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:44.460]  calculations and they always fund the enemy of their enemy whether they want
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:48.140]  to do it and they will always try to co-opt any movement that is always an
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:53.380]  issue anywhere but just because they give money to them as they've given to
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:57.980]  other people that doesn't delegitimize the movement I believe there's a lot more
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.700]  to this I believe there's a lot more to some of these other movements that have
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:09.020]  been funded so just as we see that there are people in Islamic countries that are
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:16.260]  angry and furious and activated because of the American presence there they use
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.500]  those people they manipulate that they build it up to create another threat we
[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:25.340]  we understand that there is a large part of the American government that is in
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.740]  the military industrial complex that is always fermenting unrest always
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.780]  fermenting war because that is in their interest and we understand there's
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:35.980]  competing blocks but there are still very legitimate things that are going on
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:39.460]  here in Hong Kong and I think the people there as I mentioned before they
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:44.340]  truly understand the issue of freedom and when the Chinese government steps in
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:48.260]  and says we are not going to allow you to have any candidates stand for election
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.500]  unless they have pledged their loyalty and love for mainland Chinese communists
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:58.140]  that was the impetus of this that's where it began and it's up to those people in
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:02.940]  Hong Kong just as it is to anyone anywhere to make sure that their
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:07.740]  freedom movements don't get co-opted by other people just as we've seen that
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:12.540]  happening here with the Tea Party with Occupy America that doesn't Occupy
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:17.780]  Wall Street we don't delegitimize the grievances of those people but they
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:23.300]  have to be aware that their movements and their grievances aren't taken over by
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:27.180]  people who are just going to co-op that and shove it aside and and push that
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.460]  down and not address what they want to have happen and I mean the situation in
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:37.220]  China they have alternate political parties in China but they're it's in
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.940]  name only I mean the alternate political party leaders have to go to again
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:46.380]  pledge their love for the Communist Party of China on basically a monthly basis
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:49.900]  they have to go to a kind of brainwashing session where they get the
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:53.300]  talking points from the Communist Party even though they're supposedly
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:57.900]  representing an alternative and they have to profess their allegiance to the
[01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:02.580]  Communist Party so this is what Beijing is trying to impose on Hong Kong which
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.340]  up until now has been its own autonomous state of course since being
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:12.060]  handed back to China by the British in 97 but those freedoms those protections
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:17.700]  were supposed to be legally bound protected against communist incursion
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.780]  now Beijing is trying to roll that back which is why you see a lot of the
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:25.820]  protests moving on though there's a story out of California David I mean we've
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:29.460]  we've talked about this before in fact there was a case I remember a couple of
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:34.700]  years ago one of the stars of the National Geographic doomsday preppers
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:39.020]  show he basically went in to get treated for back pain at his local doctors
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:44.620]  they took him to be suicidal he later ended up having his gun seized because
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:48.300]  he may have you know he may have self-harmed or whatever the excuse was
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:52.940]  now we're seeing that a similar case in California David where they're talking
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:57.540]  about family members of gun owners ratting them out and potentially
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:01.300]  leading to gun confiscation tell us about that well yeah that's a bill that
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.420]  was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown it's the first law in the United
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.420]  States it's going to give families who think that a close relative might
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.180]  commit gun violence it gives the family the ability to petition for restraining
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.500]  order essentially have that person's firearms taken away now of course we
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:19.460]  don't want to see mentally ill people with firearms but it all boils down to
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:23.900]  what is the process here is this due processes going on is there another
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:29.380]  agenda and I would say Paul that since virtually all these cases are predicated
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:34.980]  not by gun ownership but by the use of SSRIs why can't the family petition that
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.660]  they get their SSRIs taken away I mean they're not going to do anything to
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:43.260]  address what we all believe here at Info Wars is the root cause of this and
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:51.660]  that is the increased conditions when you take these SSRIs for psychological
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:55.460]  conditions in many cases it exacerbates those conditions especially if
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:40:00.940]  someone comes off of the SSRI so that's really what they need to address and the
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:06.660]  fact that they are not looking at that makes you understand that there's a
[01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:10.980]  different agenda here that's strictly another way to control firearms and to
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:15.540]  do it without due process okay we're gonna go to some of your calls now John in
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.500]  Michigan's been holding a while we'll go to John you're on the air I want to talk
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.580]  about this lady from Gainesville, Georgia named Ashley Huff she was only 23 she
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:30.860]  was arrested for possessing a spoon covered in spaghetti oh residue tomato
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:36.220]  sauce and she spent about 47 days in jail after she couldn't make all these
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:41.660]  appointments for drug testing and for like and all this stuff I don't know
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:45.820]  these weird appointments they gave her and her public defender even came on
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:54.620]  said it's a it's a giant mistake you know and it ruined her life and it's sad
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.900]  because they tried to get her to take the plea bargain the whole time just
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:03.300]  plead guilty you know and we'll let you out you know and it's pretty sad but
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:08.940]  also I was looking at there's been like a formerly classified documents that
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:12.540]  have been obtained from the Department of Defense they reveal that like a
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:17.980]  colloidal silver has an effect against fighting Ebola you know with your immune
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:23.580]  system it helps fight the hemorrhagic fever and and apparently they've been
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:29.460]  both trying to block shipments going to Africa the World Health Organization has
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:34.180]  recently blocked yeah yeah I heard I've read about that story I don't know if
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:37.060]  it's confirmed or not but it definitely seems to be one that keeps cropping up
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:41.700]  referring to the previous story I mean David isn't this you know emblematic of
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:47.020]  a banana Republic where you commit some petty crime that's mistaken you get
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:51.460]  trapped in the penal system and you can't get out I mean that's that really
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:56.220]  gets to the heart of it doesn't it really does and you know it the
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:01.460]  spaghettios is an extreme case of that but look at the reality that 80% of the
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:08.020]  people in prison for drug offenses are there for possession of marijuana we
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:12.700]  have more people in prison than any other country per population way more than
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:16.300]  communist China that we were just talking about and most of them are there
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:21.500]  because of marijuana so you know when we look at this prison system there's a
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:25.300]  lot of profit that is there for the private prison companies and a lot of
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:29.740]  different areas but it's a way for the government to exercise control there's a
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:34.700]  lot of ballot initiatives coming up where people would have in Alaska and
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:39.140]  other places there's marijuana that is on the ballot are they going to allow
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:42.420]  medical marijuana are they going to decriminalize it I think it's something
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:46.140]  that people need to take a very close look at and we need to question whether
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:51.620]  or not we want to continue this drug war that's gone on now for 40 50 years it
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:55.860]  started back in the 70s when Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs and then
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:01.340]  it went into steroids with Ronald Reagan where they had mandatory minimums and
[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:05.860]  all other kinds of that filled up the prisons it hasn't worked it hasn't
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:08.820]  worked our experiment with alcohol prohibition didn't work the only
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:11.500]  difference is that with alcohol prohibition they did it legally they
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:14.540]  passed the constitutional amendment they don't even have the constitutionally
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:18.860]  legal authority to prohibit marijuana or any of these other drugs that they're
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:22.180]  now enforcing as part of the war on drugs that's something people need to
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:27.620]  take a look at 5% of the world's population in the United States yet it
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:32.540]  has 25% of the world's prison population that makes the United States the
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:37.500]  world's largest jailer I mean these these stats are ridiculous since 1970 the
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:43.700]  prison population in the United States has increased 700% and most of that is
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:47.540]  the war on drugs and I've had law enforcement against prohibition on
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.020]  many times have interviewed them on the nightly news Jim Girok a former
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:56.620]  prosecutor in Cook County in Chicago and he started out believing that they
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.100]  could stop this by interdiction that they could stop it by force just as many
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.420]  people believe that they could stop the harmful effects of alcohol that way you
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:08.860]  can't it's a social problem it's a psychological problem it's a spiritual
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:12.940]  it's a medical problem it is not a law enforcement problem and so they need to
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:16.260]  address it that way that's what's filling up our prisons and there's a lot
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:19.500]  of very sinister undercurrents to that with the private prisons and other
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.740]  things like that but it's that legal system that's where we first began
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.500]  losing our rights to do process where they could essentially charge inanimate
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:31.260]  objects with crimes and just confiscate them so even before the war on terror we
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:36.300]  had the war on drugs is essentially attacking the fundamental basis of our
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:40.340]  liberty and our right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty I mean
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:44.420]  talking about due process with these guns I mean we have lost due process so
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:49.260]  many decades ago with war on drugs Pamela in California you're on the air go
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:53.540]  ahead Pamela hi I'm calling because I wanted to let everyone know about
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:45:00.180]  Thursday Texas federal lawsuit to force Obama and DHS to stop illegal alien
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:05.180]  dump of illegal aliens that are not pre-screened for illnesses criminal
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:10.620]  background and identity and quarantine these people as well as people coming
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:17.180]  traveling legally from Ebola stricken areas and this here there's actually a
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:21.940]  hearing on this lawsuit October 29th in Brownsville Texas at the federal
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:28.140]  courthouse that 10 in the morning and Orly Tates is a private citizen she's a
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:34.420]  doctor of a dentistry in California and she's a private citizen she brought this
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:39.140]  lawsuit and she's doing the work that all the state's attorney generals and all
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:45.220]  the state governor should be doing in trying to defend herself and defend
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:50.100]  other citizens of this country from the federal government's lack of protecting
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:55.460]  us by stealing the borders by ensuring the people coming over the border on
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:01.580]  carrying seriously contagious deadly illnesses like Ebola so I was calling
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:07.300]  about that and just really demonstrates the actually governor Perry was
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:13.060]  alerted of this lawsuit hasn't done anything to become an intervener or to
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:18.060]  join the lawsuit and then also the state attorney general of Texas was alerted by
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:24.540]  myself I called both offices so we're in a sorry state of affairs or even our
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.220]  states are not protecting us from the federal government yeah I mean we've got
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:32.700]  an article on info was.com which kind of ties into that which is Rand Paul
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:37.340]  blaming political correctness for hindering scientific decisions on Ebola
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:42.220]  outbreak and we've seen this at the border haven't we David where even the
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:45.700]  ISIS threat now is being ignored even though we had the leaks from within
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:50.940]  law enforcement sources the ISIS was active in Mexico just across the border
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.540]  being ignored by the Obama administration because its border agenda is
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:47:00.060]  diametrically opposite to having anything safe and secure what's your take on
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:03.420]  that David. Well you mentioned Rand Paul's interview saying that it was
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:07.500]  political correctness it was the article up that dredgingly to on Breitbart
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:11.580]  Nancy Pelosi chides a reporter for using the term illegal alien you know when
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:15.900]  they asked her a question about illegal alien she said are you referring to
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.660]  undocumented people who are in the United States he says illegal alien yes
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:25.820]  ma'am she said undocumented people okay so we've got 13 and a half thousand
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.580]  people the daily caller says and these two countries that are under an Ebola
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:34.340]  pandemic that have visas to enter the United States now if you got a visa
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:39.220]  permission there are certain conditions in that visa they are granting you put
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:44.260]  permission to enter why can't we at least have the conditions that people
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.260]  are going to be quarantined we've got dogs coming into the UK as we mentioned
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:51.500]  yesterday 21 days if they're coming in from the EU or the United States if they're
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:55.300]  coming in from other countries three months why can't we at least protect our
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:59.340]  human population as much as other countries are concerned about protecting
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:04.300]  their dogs it's just political correctness Josh and Kansas you're on the
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:09.300]  air go ahead Josh hey guys great listening to you I wanted to talk to you
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:14.540]  a couple things real quick one about the Ebola I know you're not in these or
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.220]  anything but you know kind of what's the best thing to protect ourselves against
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:23.620]  it I got a seven-year-old daughter that you know concerns me the other thing
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:26.660]  just once you guys bought up a minute ago with that other caller about the
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:32.380]  war on drugs it's just a joke it is absolutely a joke you find me anywhere
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:38.860]  that pothead is going to do half the damage that somebody out drinking is
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:43.140]  going to do it's just not going to happen so the war on drugs that's that's
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:48.500]  absolutely just a joke I mean with Ebola there's really is nothing you can
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:52.940]  I guess you could avoid large population areas obviously you have to avoid West
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:57.060]  Africa but apart from that David there's really not a lot there's no known
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:00.620]  cure that's been actually established at the moment they're working on vaccines
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:05.180]  drugs some have been successful some haven't apart from that it's and again I
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:08.460]  meant the point go ahead you know you can take a look at what the CDC
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:13.140]  recommends might start with what they're recommending for airplanes that
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:16.220]  there's several publications where they're they're putting out their advice
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.180]  for that but you know there's certain risks that we just take every day every
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.020]  day we run down the road we're pretty close to people that are passing us
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:27.380]  just a few feet away from somebody that's coming at me 60 miles an hour
[01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:30.180]  and I'm going 60 miles an hour so there's there's an element of risk that
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:34.580]  we all accept in our everyday life one of the things you can do is make sure
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:39.860]  that your immune system and is and as good a shape as possible I do believe
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:45.940]  that there's also something that that silver is very effective you can we I
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:49.700]  take that on a regular basis so does my family I think that's very effective at
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:53.740]  not only controlling bacteria but other studies have said that they thought that
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.420]  it was effective at controlling viruses so you can do some research in that I
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:02.500]  would just say you know make sure as you should whether it's going to be from a
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:06.620]  pandemic or whether it's some kind of a power outage you should prepare in
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:10.580]  advance a little bit have some extra food in case something does turn up in
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.900]  your community and they start quarantining and isolating things it could
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:17.020]  be difficult for you to get access to food and water so just make sure you
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:21.260]  have that they're like you would if you were preparing for a storm you need to
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:24.700]  always have a certain amount of preparation and then just try to
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.780]  prepare yourself to be as healthy as possible you know many of these people
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.860]  who are survivalists will say that people who have medical issues aren't
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:35.700]  going to make it past the first couple of days if there's some kind of a grid
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:40.020]  down scenario because they just aren't in physical shape so try to get yourself
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:44.540]  in your family and as good a possible physical shape as you can we're coming

[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:32.940]  back on the Alex Jones show final segment of this second hour we're still
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:37.540]  covering Ebola David Nights got some interesting info on the American
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:42.260]  doctor who came back into Atlanta to receive treatment we've heard about the
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:47.060]  Z map being pretty hit and miss but David some interesting info on how he was
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:51.220]  treated for Ebola yeah when we first heard about it we heard a lot about the
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:54.940]  fact that he recovered based on the Z map vaccine of course that's a vaccine
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.500]  that's been developed by the US military and tobacco companies very
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:04.940]  interesting genetically modified plant a body it's not a traditional vaccine but
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:09.900]  in a question interview with scientific American the medical director at Emory
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.700]  University where Kent Brantley and the lady who was working with him were
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.300]  treated they said it's been reported that Brantley received a blood
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.740]  transfusion from a recovered patient and they asked him about that of course the
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:27.940]  medical director said I cannot comment on what I read on his chart so that brings
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:32.220]  in to even more question the efficacy of Z map because we've had two people who
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.540]  supposedly were treated with it and recovered two people who were treated
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.220]  with it and died three people who were treated with it and we still don't know
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.860]  the outcome of theirs but that's not really anything that's any better than
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:48.580]  we've seen from the people who were not treated so further down in the interview
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:54.580]  they asked him about the ethics of giving vaccines to patients that have not
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:56:01.020]  where the vaccines have not been fully vetted for safety and for efficacy of
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:05.980]  course we know that the CDC not only is lying about checking people at the
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:11.140]  borders but they also lied about the autism connection to vaccines in a
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:14.260]  study that was put out 10 years ago and covered that up for 10 years but he
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:17.860]  makes an interesting comment he says well I think it's ethical to study
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:22.220]  experimental bio biologicals and vaccines but we have to be extremely cautious
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:27.340]  it's not as though we have something we know works so he apparently doesn't have
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:33.740]  any confidence in the Z map vaccine and another thing you said was they told him
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:38.740]  he could be contagious for up to seven months that was interesting yes they
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.580]  said that they have noticed that people are shedding the Ebola virus people who
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:47.080]  have recovered they asked him about the immunity of the the doctor and they said
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.900]  yes he does have immunity now to that strain of Ebola but there's five
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:55.420]  strains of Ebola and they said that people continue to shed the virus and
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:00.060]  their sexual fluids and their urine for several months after up to seven months
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:05.740]  afterwards so that is another vector of transmission that is possible although
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:10.840]  they said that they had not they see that being shed but they have not
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.540]  verified that somebody has caught it by that method and an article you mentioned
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:19.980]  earlier out of the weekly standard White House screening procedures in place at
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.540]  our border White House press secretary Josh Ernest told reporters today that
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:28.380]  after the Ebola case in Dallas the Obama administration reminded border law
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:32.220]  enforcement agencies of the protocol to deal with people so they're saying they
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:36.500]  reminded them as if these measures were already in place but we know they weren't
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:41.940]  David yeah we see the same thing in this interview with the medical director
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.700]  at Emory University in the Scientific American interview that we heard from
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:49.180]  Perry and from the CDC yesterday he says as we've been saying all along we feel
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.540]  the high fatality rates and developing parts of the world where this infection
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:57.780]  occurs are because of a lack of resources yet when you look at how rapidly
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:02.260]  this has expanded and it's in a country where they only have four million people
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:07.420]  in just six months they've had 3,000 cases 2,000 of those people have died and
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:10.940]  when you normalize that to the population of the United States as we said
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:15.300]  before you're looking at hundreds of thousands of people coming down with it
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:19.660]  hundreds of thousands of people dying do we really have a medical system that
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:23.380]  can handle that kind of burden on it I would say no so people need to be
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:26.940]  cautious about this there's at this point there's very little that we can do
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:30.380]  but need to try to educate yourself about how this is transmitted
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:35.900]  David Knight thanks for joining us we'll be up with Lionel Media in studio next
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:38.940]  talking to Lionel about number of different topics Alex Jones show live

[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:22.100]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:25.660]  alex jones
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:37.220]  Thursday October 2nd 2014 it's Paul joseph Watson filling in for alex jones
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:41.940]  today coming up in the next segment we're going to be joined by Lionel who of
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.260]  course has been on the show before to talk about a number of interesting topics
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:50.100]  also going to take your calls for Lionel later in the hour but for now we're
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:54.300]  going to squeeze in a quick call American in North Carolina you're on the air go
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:01:01.900]  ahead talk about Ebola and how it's it's the main topic in all the mainstream
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:07.460]  articles along with Jesse Matthew and the secret service and and at the bottom
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:12.500]  of all that in the small fine print is the intro virus and that's probably what
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:16.340]  people really ought to be concerned with is you know bull wasn't really not
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:20.980]  going to hit America that hard because we're not third world but intro virus
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:25.220]  already killed the first first victim in Rhode Island and I think you know the
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:30.260]  man might be trying to trying to divert us on the secret service front those
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:35.140]  people the secret service man they did the righteous call on not killing you
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:40.020]  know a citizen American whereas you know the state police like South Carolina
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:44.820]  they got no problem with it so I'd like to commend them for that yeah I mean this
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:47.900]  this intro virus things really concerning we've got an article out of
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:52.700]  CNN intro virus d68 found in four patients who have died including 10-year-old
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:56.660]  girl samples collected from four patients who recently died have tested
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:02.460]  positive for the entero virus d68 according to the CDC so this is actually
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:07.740]  killing people you know Ebola is not killing anyone yet this is of greater
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:11.460]  immediate concern but again obviously Ebola could have the greater wider
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:16.460]  concern but this as you said is something that is getting buried under the
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:22.020]  radar thanks to the cold Jeremiah in California go ahead Jeremiah yes I have
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:27.020]  a couple quick comments please I was wanting to take on this I was listening
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:32.420]  to Joseph Israel and he was saying that everyone who does not support the new
[02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:37.580]  world order will not be able to buy or sell so they're just going to get out of
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:41.660]  the new world order and everyone who stays in the new world order is going to
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:47.900]  go down with the system and also the cure for Ebola would be anything that
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:55.340]  cures a virus like vitamin C lemon grapefruit or turmeric or tangerine
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:03:01.900]  cinnamon ginger it's a virus so anything that cures a virus could cure the
[02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:07.100]  Ebola and also I think Alex should stay in the radio studio and give the
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:12.020]  reporters the TV studio he does a he has a great vibe and environment in his
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:19.220]  radio studio I think Alex enjoys being in the in the radio studio but I mean the
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:22.900]  new studio that they've just built is really professional so that's why he
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:28.780]  also enjoys doing his special reports in there we've got hap in Minnesota hap
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:36.980]  go ahead yeah hey welcome welcome to the US Paul Joseph I'm nice to hear it from
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:41.220]  you all always Michael hey I was I was you know I've been thinking about this
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.860]  for some time now you know two months ago you just talked about it Michael about
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:52.020]  the guy the two people that came back and they said they're cured it just it
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:56.020]  just freaked me out how they said that they're cured but yet they don't talk
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:01.100]  about them very much and you were just talking about this subject a few
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:05.100]  minutes ago Michael so I was just touching base with that the other thing
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:10.180]  is you know it's a great cover-up isn't it nobody's talking about the VA or the
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:14.580]  IRS or fast and furious at the moment so it's all you know it's like the page
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:19.660]  has been turned once again once again I say because you know their cover-ups are

[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:11.860]  show but never Paul Joseph Watson or as the last caller called you Michael Michael
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:20.540]  just some kind of a code is some type of a black ops Michael I must be some conspiracy behind it
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:27.580]  but let me just first kudos to you my friend excellent excellent excellent
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:34.700]  job two shades you're too kind Lionel I'm not being too kind this is tough stuff
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:39.260]  if you were doing conventional talk radio you could be talking about the
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:45.140]  judices from Real Housewives of New Jersey being set in store Derek Jeter's
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:51.900]  farewell or maybe some other non irrelevant but you're talking about
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:58.500]  pandemics death the new black plague that's why they're taxing good for you
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:03.100]  excellent excellent job sir I guess we should be talking about Chelsea
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:07.340]  Clinton's baby or something like that's the incredible timing don't you think
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:11.900]  how did they do that but I'll tell you something I want to and also please
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:19.060]  Michael that's your nickname from now on that's our code Alex gives me enough
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:23.420]  nicknames I've got enough as it is I can imagine we'll call you Misha to make it
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:30.900]  some more European or key Parkish but anyway the your treatises your
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:37.380]  disquisitions your journalistic pieces have been superb and I've told people so
[02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:45.180]  much is it read what he is saying read his meaning you read your your work and
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:50.580]  when you first read the actual subject matter you think oh come on this this
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:56.660]  guy's golf gone off the reservation now I mean finally Paul Joseph Watson aka
[02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:05.460]  Misha has finally lost it and then you read it and again it is cited documented
[02:11:05.460 --> 02:11:13.940]  linked not merely you owe pining not what you think the world is but you and
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:21.260]  this goes for Alex and David and the entire team you never merely say you
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:28.860]  know I think that never it's always no no here is the story here is what I've
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:34.100]  heard so again I'm always I'm always defending you all Joseph Watson I'm
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:39.340]  always defending with all of that Alex Jones he's he's what he's what well
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:45.460]  he's he's what is he ecclesiastical he acts like a reverend is that it now if
[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:49.980]  you're on a religious show and you say the same thing and you start speaking in
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:54.740]  tongues on a Sunday morning and I in no way and in any way trying to impune
[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:59.820]  people of faith but you could say the same thing and yet that is okay but when
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:05.020]  you're vitriolic you're hyperbolic you're excited you're perhaps exaggerated
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:09.460]  by some standards then people say sky's off the reservation and the reason why
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:19.220]  is because we're used to the news being so bloody boring absolutely just so
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:25.900]  horrific just you know radio or TV version of Ambien but I gotta tell you
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:34.300]  something you brought up something last week which I again I I find myself three
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:38.340]  times a day at least saying what kind of a parallel you we're just telling Nico
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:43.020]  on the break what kind of a parallel universe am I in what is that why doesn't
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:48.220]  anybody run out in the street and say David Cameron before the UN you're
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:54.500]  David Cameron you're a David Cameron not mine yours don't lump him on me line
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:13:02.980]  off he's a he stood up and he said he basically dusted off the cognitive
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:11.140]  infiltration theme which will get to and in front of the UN dusted off this I
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:19.300]  thought Horry and a deluvian ancient idea about going after conspiracy there
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:24.340]  is you really somebody in the group would say listen DC come here lose that
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:28.540]  talk you're really this is the United States I know this is the UN but don't
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:33.340]  talk about telling people if they opine about 7-7 or 9-11 there's somehow
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:39.700]  they're they're practicing nonviolent extremism so let's play the clip line
[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:43.580]  let's play the clip now and we can talk about it his David Cameron in front of
[02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:50.420]  the UN roll the clip we must defeat this ideology in all its forms as evidence
[02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:56.220]  emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offenses it is
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:14:01.660]  clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to
[02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:08.580]  encourage violence but whose worldview can be used as a justification for it we
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:14.660]  know this world view the peddling of lies that 9-11 was somehow a Jewish plot
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:20.260]  or that the 7-7 London attacks were staged the idea that Muslims are
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:25.820]  persecuted all over the world as a deliberate act of Western policy the
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:32.580]  concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations we must be clear to defeat
[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:38.540]  the ideology of extremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism but
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:43.340]  not just violent extremism for governments there are some obvious
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:48.380]  ways we can do this okay that's enough we must ban preachers Lionel three days
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:52.500]  three days after that I believe the Home Secretary Theresa May came out in the
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:56.940]  UK and added to that said that basically anyone who wants to use Twitter or
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.740]  Facebook who is a domestic extremist in their words a nonviolent extremist would
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:06.620]  have to get government permission to do so I mean this this is creepy it's all
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:10.300]  well him but as he said the very fact that he's talking about it would raise
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:16.180]  suspicions I mean that would make people believe that 7-7 and 9-11 were in some
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:19.980]  way staged if they're having to go to these lengths to censor people that
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:26.860]  that's precisely right if he were to say that I know many of you today believe
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:33.340]  that I am a reptilian sorcerer what no we didn't think that why would and I know
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:41.540]  do you think that I'm that's it no I maybe we should look I thought and I'm
[02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:49.380]  sorry but for that terrible accent I in no one in any way what would appear
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:53.860]  anglophobic or whatever the particular phrase but he's speaking before the UN
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:58.380]  whatever that's worth and this is what he comes up with let's harken back to the
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:05.140]  granddaddy of all the granddaddy of all one of the most frightening pieces of
[02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:11.820]  either juridical or legal or academic Balderdash bunkham and who he was a
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:18.980]  piece co-written by Cass R. Sunstein and Adrian Vermeul I'm pronouncing this
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:26.220]  correctly both from Harvard Law School entitled conspiracy theory this this is
[02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:33.100]  the Magna Carta this is in 2008 and if you if if I could and I don't like
[02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:41.100]  reading things but you have there's no way I could Michael do this justice
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:46.180]  without reading just this this is from the the praise here the abstract many
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:52.020]  millions of people hold conspiracy theories they believe that powerful
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:59.140]  people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:06.740]  practice or some terrible event stop right there that's history go through
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:16.620]  history governments people organizations holding back the truth this is the
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:22.740]  subject matter of a of an academic tree this on where did these people come up
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:28.260]  with this plum crazy idea that governments what has your whole show been
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:36.900]  it's about Ebola and the lies the prevarication the the the the harm that
[02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:43.500]  is being hidden but let me just this is what he said I must those who subscribe
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:50.940]  to conspiracy theories may create serious risks including risks of violence
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:57.180]  and the existence of such theories raises questions raises significant
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:02.700]  challenges for policy and law the first challenge is to understand understand
[02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:07.900]  the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper the second challenge is
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:14.140]  to understand how such theories might be undermined now he's talking about not
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:18.260]  only do we want to understand okay fine we could talk about why do why are
[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:23.740]  people superstitious why are people not whatever fine I understand that but how
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:27.980]  can we undermine them here is the important and I'll just leave it at
[02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:33.100]  this because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:41.140]  crippled epistemology a crippled epistemology in accordance with which it
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:47.060]  is rational to hold such theories the best response we stop right there this
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:52.820]  is Obama's regulations are this is the husband of Samantha Power this is a noted
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:19:01.180]  illegal heavyweight rock star juridical and academic bigwig he says the best
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:09.460]  response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups
[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:15.620]  Paul Joseph Watson every single thing that you talk about I talk about that
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:22.380]  anybody talks about could buy any stretch of the imagination be construed as
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:32.380]  extreme extreme by what standard I am a lawyer by tree and a statute is per se
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:37.260]  unconstitutional when it is susceptible to reasons to explanations to
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:41.940]  interpretations that are inconsistent that you read and you're not sure for

[02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:37.780]  so get those lined up for the next segment we just played a clip of David Cameron in
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:42.460]  front of the United Nations last week basically he was talking about ISIS he
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:47.500]  made a comparison basically saying that anybody who is a non-violent extremist
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:52.340]  is in the same category as ISIS what did he characterize as a nonviolent
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:57.860]  extremist basically anyone who questions the government narrative on events
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:03.860]  such as the 7-7 attacks in London or 9-11 so it's basically this process and
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:07.940]  we asked the question before the break what is considered extreme this process
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:14.140]  of creating a new brand of thought crime to in fact brand individuals who espouse
[02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:19.060]  it any questioning of the government narrative what so ever what so ever is
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:22.980]  not only a conspiracy theory anymore which they used as that pejorative term
[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:28.100]  to demonize three free thought to demonize the questioning of any motive of
[02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:33.180]  any person in a position of power now they've gone one step further Lionel
[02:25:33.180 --> 02:25:37.460]  and are saying that you could be in league with the terrorists I mean we saw
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:40.740]  after 9-11 we must never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories George
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:44.980]  W Bush now they're saying that we could be in league with the terrorists by
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:51.980]  espousing this dangerous notion of questioning government how extreme is
[02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:58.740]  that let me ask you this Paul Joseph Watson let's say I were to question the
[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:03.900]  government and I hate their quotes but I will do it I question the government
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:08.860]  not out of it any kind of nefarious wrongdoing but let's just say I think
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:16.020]  they're inept let's say that I questioned the Warren Commission now
[02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:21.300]  another question is is there a statute of limitations to my questioning the
[02:26:21.300 --> 02:26:27.460]  government if I question the findings of the main in 1898 there was certainly
[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:32.060]  complicit I think we all can understand that if I were to question the United
[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:40.260]  States' role in let's say Operation Ajax and the overthrow of Mosadec oh by
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:46.820]  the way another question is let's say I were to question something now and
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:53.260]  something is declassified so imagine a Paul Joseph Watson in the era of Mosadec
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:59.020]  and the Shah who says I think the CIA was involved in that under this theory
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:06.980]  were to be enacted Paul Joseph Watson aka Michael is incarcerated now years later
[02:27:06.980 --> 02:27:13.500]  the CIA declassifies it you know what we were right do we let you out isn't that
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:22.580]  called academic quest I mean do I I because I can question and not 9-11 but
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:25.660]  I can question anything I can question the government and saying that Agent
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:30.780]  Orange was far more lethal and and and and teratogenic in the problematic and
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:37.580]  depleted uranium and DU I'm not saying the government I could be questioning the
[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:43.300]  finding based on ineptitude bad sample size I could have a pretty clinical
[02:27:43.300 --> 02:27:51.820]  way so this broad brush admonition don't question your elders of covers
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:57.900]  everything from the most benign disagreement let me ask you this last
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:04.940]  week Senator Bob Graham the 9-11 Commission said I want this redacted
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:13.060]  testimony back I want it known regarding Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9-11 is
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:18.900]  that nonviolent extremism is he not calling into question his own
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:25.620]  commission is this internal nonviolent extremist is he an internal conspiracy
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:31.220]  theorist is he could is he questioning himself that I I mean to think about this
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:38.340]  it is our duty it is our duty is inherent it is isn't our DNA to question
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:43.660]  authority question anything you know why because we want to I don't need
[02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:48.540]  permission and by the way I find this fascinating as you know Paul there are
[02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:53.620]  brilliant people out there who by virtue of having these new fangled devices that
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:58.420]  we're talking on can look at something remember when they said look at the video
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:06.620]  of this horrible ISIS or ISIL or Daesh or sham I mean the names grow remember
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:12.900]  when Gaddafi was ultimately spelled 38 different ways we like to do that but
[02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:17.220]  the reason why I think they want to ask you don't go back and look at these
[02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:23.620]  videos because you might see some glaring problem in some bad editing it's
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:29.060]  very clever so don't look at the videos that we put out don't question it don't
[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:35.260]  ask don't talk don't speak just nod in hypnotic obeisance your calls the line

[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:34.260]  what we're talking about with Lionel we played before the break David Cameron
[02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:38.780]  saying in front of the UN nonviolent extremism includes anyone who
[02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:44.660]  questions government narratives and to me Lionel I mean on Twitter we often see
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:49.780]  mainstream talking heads lashing out it's always fun to abuse them on Twitter
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:55.460]  like I did with Keith Olberman but often they come they come to me they lash out
[02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:58.820]  against info wars without even you know being prodded in the first place you
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:02.900]  mentioned Cass Sunstein with the cognitive infiltration subverting the
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:08.220]  so-called conspiracy movement this just suggests to me nothing else but how
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:13.340]  insecure they are about being challenged on any narrative what so ever
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:18.980]  what does it say to you about their insecurity well first and foremost you
[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:24.540]  mentioned Twitter and and a shameless plug for mine and I watch I tweet retweet
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:29.020]  and favorite and if I could do something else to to add approbation to your
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:35.420]  tweets I would but I'm at Lionel media and I'm a Twitter fanatic I think it is
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:39.900]  the pulse in the heartbeat of the world but here is the thing I don't
[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:47.300]  understand when I don't want to just make too much out of this but how much
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:52.140]  can I question let me ask again is there a statute of limitations to that which I
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:56.820]  question if I think there were very serious questions as to Vietnam and our
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:36:02.060]  involvement and the Gulf of Tonkin which has been admitted does that not does is
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:09.980]  that exempted next how can somebody who is theoretically conversed with the
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:18.780]  First Amendment a legal scholar at some of the best ostensibly legal our law
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:27.180]  schools in the nation dare to suggest that the government ostensibly should
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:32.940]  be involved in quashing and quelling and and basically stifling speech as you
[02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:40.700]  know Paul the First Amendment in fact the Bill of Rights only limits action when
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:45.020]  the federal government or the state government are involved in violating your
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:48.260]  law the federal government the state government has to violate your First
[02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:52.380]  Amendment right not individual citizens the 13th Amendment is the only Bill of
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:57.180]  Rights only constitutional amendment that a private citizen can actually violate
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:01.420]  actually commit it's the slavery or anti-slavery provision and variations
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:06.540]  thereof so here we have I just think about the irony of this a law professor
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:14.020]  advocating not boycotting which is fine by God if those conspiracy theorists are
[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:19.700]  there spew this bunkum why you tell them fine right your congressman fine
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:24.420]  petition go ahead nothing wrong with it they're talking about cognitive
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:32.740]  infiltration via the government this is this this erases any any doubt as to a
[02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:39.860]  First Amendment involvement in this how can anyone not say wait a minute hold
[02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:45.460]  the press to stop with a president who is ostensibly a constitutional professor
[02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:53.380]  I mean and this is this is so blatant so pathetic as you say so desperate so so
[02:37:53.380 --> 02:38:00.300]  much of an indeciem of an indication of how this is making a headway and again
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:05.260]  there are so many levels the word conspiracy theorists I hate I love to
[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:09.620]  harken back to the great Gorvina who said I am not a conspiracy theorist I'm a
[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:17.260]  conspiracy analyst and the word conspiracy theory has been basically a
[02:38:17.260 --> 02:38:26.100]  code word for the unspeakable truth and if you're a truth or how did they
[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:32.740]  appropriate truth or as a pejorative how did this happen a false or I can
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:40.700]  understand and if you ask any questions any questions from you pick the subject
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:48.620]  this is we need to revolt violent I mean not violent non-violently what am I
[02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:52.740]  saying non extremist but but say wait a minute no no we are not going to do this
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:57.500]  and the best way to protest this non-violently is to fill the airways
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:39:03.740]  fill the Twitter world the ether the social media with your protestations
[02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:07.180]  against this idea because remember Paul but when you were talking about this
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:12.180]  entire first portion of the show was how the government is not being straight
[02:39:12.180 --> 02:39:17.820]  with you and with us regarding Ebola static conspiracy theory and if it is
[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:23.300]  who's conspiring who are the conspirators I don't understand you might be
[02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:27.100]  saying that the government's inept the government's not doing its job the
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:32.820]  government's dropping the ball we need better CDC official we need to fund
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:39.500]  them they're in there they're inept that's not conspiratorial false flag
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.820]  inside job you just might be saying you guys don't know what the hell you're
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:49.140]  doing it's that simple we're talking with Lionel Lionel media.com Mercedes in
[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:55.180]  Oregon you're on the air with Lionel go ahead Mercedes hello Lionel and Paul
[02:39:55.180 --> 02:40:03.780]  welcome I wanted to say welcome to you know the state but now you're there
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:09.580]  with Ebola so I don't know I don't personally have Ebola yet but thank you
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:15.420]  maybe you should be going home before there's a quarantine or something maybe
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:20.260]  maybe we'll all get locked in there are worse places to be locked in though I'll
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:26.180]  say that so what's your question I'll come in for Lionel. Yeah you're
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:32.420]  definitely with good people so yeah extremism we have to exactly say no we
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:41.380]  not only is it info wars but we have to do a counter narrative where the
[02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:48.980]  counter narrative to what they're doing they go in front of the UN and say
[02:40:48.980 --> 02:40:56.300]  these horrible thing you know and we're just you know I'm on Twitter too I don't
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:02.140]  think I should be you know attacked in any way by the government just for
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:08.620]  saying hey you guys aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing. That's
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:14.580]  precisely right go ahead Lionel no no that that's precisely right and Mercedes
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:23.100]  or where I'm from we say Mercedes I firmly believe that not only does the and I
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:27.140]  say the government I don't even know what that means it's not the government
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:30.380]  there are people who work for the government they're fine they're great
[02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:36.220]  patriots and wonderful but we use that that the term to me to speak of a few
[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:46.100]  but I don't think people realize how big this is I'm telling you right now when
[02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:52.540]  you listen to me I know people in the conventional media in the usual nuts and
[02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:59.700]  bolts beaten potato terrestrial old-fashioned radio TV and they're
[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:08.660]  living in the 50s not the 1950s the 50s they don't know anything there are the
[02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:13.220]  people who say you know I don't understand this Twitter I guarantee you
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:23.020]  right now what we're saying right now lives on in a cloud in a in a in an
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:30.700]  area that is so huge so colossal so you're right about gulliver robbing
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:37.980]  nagy and so enormous mainstream media don't understand it these people on TV
[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:44.820]  who fancy themselves as being you know the cable news warriors they on their
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:52.740]  best day they don't approximate this world out there that represents far more
[02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:59.860]  people and anybody can understand so what happens is as this and mark my words
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:06.340]  Mercedes and Paul one day and I don't know when it is but but very very soon
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:12.660]  tomorrow next week somebody of note will all of a sudden say you know what I
[02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:19.700]  listen to that show and I believe in that and somebody will you say wow of note
[02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:26.340]  you know what when Jenny McCarthy bless her heart became viewed as the point
[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:31.140]  person for concerns people had in inoculation and vaccine related
[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:36.180]  diseases that was a dark day in any kind of by the way vaxxer have you heard
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:43.060]  that Paul vaxxers the vaxxers that's the new pejorative yes yes so we need
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:46.780]  eventually you're going to hear more people Rosie O'Donnell bless her heart
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:54.860]  Charlie sheen they're kind of been by virtue of a very scared media lumped in
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:44:03.140]  as the standard bearers you know the the bellwethers of this new cut no and this
[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:07.260]  is not in any way a slam or pejorative against them but when you start hearing
[02:44:07.260 --> 02:44:12.580]  people say no I agree with this all right or I watch this I I understand this
[02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:18.300]  when you start to see these the Daily Shows and Colbert and others realize
[02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:23.340]  that what they're doing is a cutesy five if that's a word version of the
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:30.940]  mainstream media direct when all of a sudden like this this discussion becomes
[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:38.740]  cool and people will run to it and they will say you mean this has been there
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:45.980]  yes there are more of us than them there was a person one time a dear friend of
[02:44:45.980 --> 02:44:50.980]  mine who gave the expression he says you know there are so many of us that we
[02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:54.540]  could drown them and I know this sounds crude but he said we could drown them in
[02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:59.220]  our urine and I thought oh my god what a horrible metaphor but I realized we
[02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:06.540]  forget our power the enormity of this because most of us right now or at home
[02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:12.900]  or at work or listening maybe later a week or so a year later and we look
[02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:20.220]  around and we're saying is anybody out there oh yes absolutely and all that I
[02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:28.020]  have said is and I think you as well is I'm not afraid of anything Paul Joseph
[02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:35.340]  Watson what do you wish you didn't know what truth do you wish you didn't know
[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:40.620]  what are you sorry for knowing what information do you wish you were dumb
[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:45.780]  about as I haven't figured it out yet I have not found anything was it boy you
[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:50.420]  know what I wish I didn't know that historical fact I wish I didn't know
[02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:55.540]  that cancer scare I wish I didn't know the truth about this war that I thought
[02:45:55.540 --> 02:46:01.140]  was noble ignorance is not bliss it's dangerous and I never apologized to
[02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:05.700]  anybody for wanting to know the truth I asked questions you've seen kids what do
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:11.820]  kids always ask why go to room why go to bed why you need your sleep why I
[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:15.780]  think I'm not being pesky it's a beautiful question why I don't understand
[02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:19.860]  this I'm not satisfied give me an example if I could did you happen to see
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:26.940]  Nora O'Donnell speak recently on CBS with Prince Turkey al-Faisal of Saudi
[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:35.020]  Arabia regarding ISIS yeah we played that clip on the Sunday show I believe
[02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:41.460]  now wait a minute stop this is where I imagine this scene like a Kubrick movie
[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:47.260]  somebody walks off in the set wearing a headset he's a stage hander said to
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:54.420]  somebody he says stop stop stop I can't take this anymore ask him about how many
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:47:01.660]  people they've beheaded they beheaded a woman recently for sorcery did you know
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:08.140]  that you're asking a man who lives in a cut who rules basically over a country
[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:15.460]  that beheads women for sorcery now let me just let that marinate a little bit
[02:47:15.460 --> 02:47:22.740]  ask him about his brother Abdul Rahman al-Faisal who's the paymaster for ISIS or
[02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:31.820]  ISIL or IS or a QI or al-Nusra front or al-Qaeda or Daesh or whatever neologism
[02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:36.500]  you want to give it and Khorasan you know how many people you know did you
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:42.340]  know this how many Khorasan members are our paul Joseph Watson 50 and this was
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:46.500]  a group that they just invented I mean it's it's basically al-Nusra who they
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:50.660]  were supporting previously because all the Syrian rebels the so-called Syrian
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:55.900]  rebels defected to al-Nusra so they're just renamed the group to hide the fact
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:48:00.020]  that they had indirectly supported the group before this so-called bombing it's
[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:06.020]  amazing I'm quite cold Judy in Florida go ahead Judy hi Paul this is really
[02:48:06.020 --> 02:48:11.140]  great to speak with you I've talked to other hosts on on Alex's program I
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:15.700]  guess I've called almost as much as regret the McGruff at this point but I
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:19.700]  had a story I wanted to tell you very very quickly and then I had my question
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:26.060]  but I sent out an email when I found out about the first Ebola case and I sent
[02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:31.100]  out to you know my network and essentially you know discussed what I
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:34.700]  felt was the gravity of the situation and said this is not fear mongering but
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:38.580]  this is something everybody needs to be aware of blah blah blah and I brought up
[02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:43.180]  the point that the plane had touched down with patient zero at Dulles
[02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:47.740]  International the reason why that's significant is because I used to live
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:56.820]  very close to it and I got an email back from a very close friend's son and he
[02:48:56.820 --> 02:49:02.340]  said in a very contrite very condescending way Ebola is not transferable
[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:05.320]  during incubation it can only be transmitted with direct contact with
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:11.220]  species saliva and blood and that's when most severe symptoms have set in and
[02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:16.540]  you know I said well you know it's also potentially airborne I said in a in a
[02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:23.380]  email back to him and I sent yours and do's report that had the video of that
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:28.380]  facility that held the monkeys on the quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia and
[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:33.300]  you know to you know further validate what I was trying to say and the thing
[02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:40.420]  is the skating rink and the statue in Reston is you know I used to work right
[02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:43.900]  down the street from it and I used to live in Reston, Virginia and this guy
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:48.540]  still lives in Reston, Virginia but you know I think he was if he's he poop has
[02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:52.700]  a lot of what I have to say but I think I guess what I'm trying to get to is that
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:58.260]  I'm really kind of tired of being you know talked to in a condescending way by
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:03.660]  anyone because what we are what I see you and Alex and anybody's got you know
[02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:10.180]  any want to know the truth that we're the intellectuals we're the ones that
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:14.060]  are the shepherds we are shepherding those and we're trying to save the lives
[02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:20.340]  of those that are you know right now condemning us that are you know not the
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:25.820]  government that's actually or that the the new world order exactly that's yeah
[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:29.540]  that's why we're taking so much like that's why you know trust in media is
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:32.780]  now back to its record low I mean people are seeing right through that and
[02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:36.060]  they're seeing right through the attacks so I mean that's definitely the case
[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:40.300]  we're gonna be back in the next segment final segment with Lionel we're gonna
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:45.100]  talk about media narratives and how we can shape them Lionelmedia.com is the

[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:23.860]  final segment of the Alex Jones show with Lionel there's an update coming from
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:27.500]  Dallas health officials they're about to give a press conference here in the
[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:32.140]  next 20 minutes or so about the Ebola situation of least obviously 100 people
[02:54:32.140 --> 02:54:37.780]  exposed at least in Dallas so hopefully there are no more confirmed cases but
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:41.900]  there is about to be another update on that situation in Dallas so we'll be
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:45.620]  tracking that of course across the website we're currently talking to Lionel
[02:54:45.620 --> 02:54:49.980]  of Lionel media dot com Lionel just in the last few minutes I wanted to get
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:54.860]  into this recent Gallup poll trust in mainstream media returns to its previous
[02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:59.580]  all-time low of 40% and again it goes back to this this David Cameron UN
[02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:04.740]  speech they're petrified of losing their ability to control the narrative they
[02:55:04.740 --> 02:55:09.140]  still have to act in concert to do so the mainstream media because they're
[02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:12.980]  losing their individual power their audience but so long as they can corral
[02:55:12.980 --> 02:55:17.660]  everybody around a talking point or around a narrative they're still able
[02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:22.740]  to sway huge numbers of the US population but obviously their power in
[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:27.980]  terms of that is is diluting you know we had drudge 15 years ago go in front of
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:32.780]  the National Press Club and basically say that the media landscape is about to
[02:55:32.780 --> 02:55:37.020]  completely change he was dead on accurate that happened over the over the
[02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:41.660]  next 15 years given that they're so insecure now apparently about losing
[02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:45.260]  the ability to control this narrative how do you see the media landscape
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:53.620]  developing over the next 15 years developing generating maybe generating
[02:55:53.620 --> 02:56:00.620]  perhaps a pock filled not only that conventional talk radio you name it you
[02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:08.420]  know just to give you an idea first and foremost I think if Alex if I knew if I
[02:56:08.420 --> 02:56:14.380]  know Alex like I think I know if you were to be at a press conference if
[02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:18.940]  somebody were to turn you was a yes and you basically ask the question is it
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:27.980]  okay that's it because believe it or not in certain mainstream media and I kid
[02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:32.500]  you not I can say that in a family show they send somebody out to a tour to a
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:37.460]  report we'll say kid all right Watson you're new here we'll give you 25 bucks
[02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:42.020]  or a six-pack if you can get the mic flag in the press conference a little
[02:56:42.020 --> 02:56:47.980]  little card little square that fits on the microphone showing the the television

[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:05.500]  mainstream media you got to look like Barbie or can or be cute and that's it
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:09.100]  I mean I mean no you will never be nobody will ever call you want to say
[02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:14.020]  Watson what the hell do you know about no I don't need to know anything the
[02:57:14.020 --> 02:57:20.420]  other day when Rick Perry was talking I think with Sean Hannity Rick Perry's
[02:57:20.420 --> 02:57:24.940]  it all there's nothing to worry about imagine this thought experiment Paul
[02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:29.020]  what if somebody said hey Rick did you hear the news that's just assume we're
