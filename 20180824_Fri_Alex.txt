[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Certainly, for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all
[00:14.200 --> 00:20.200]  that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment
[00:20.200 --> 00:26.960]  wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:26.960 --> 00:36.960]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:36.960 --> 00:48.160]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:48.160 --> 00:53.240]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:53.240 --> 01:00.240]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[01:00.240 --> 01:10.240]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.240]  They falsely edited him.
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.240]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[01:19.240 --> 01:25.240]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.240]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[01:31.240 --> 01:37.240]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.240]  And then we get hit and say, you no longer use our software.
[01:40.240 --> 01:44.240]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.240]  We just got taken down by YouTube. They just killed our stream.
[01:47.240 --> 01:49.240]  Really? Yes.
[01:49.240 --> 01:53.240]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[01:53.240 --> 01:57.240]  This is America in 2018.
[01:57.240 --> 02:05.240]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:05.240 --> 02:09.240]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[02:09.240 --> 02:12.240]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:12.240 --> 02:19.240]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:19.240 --> 02:48.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:48.240 --> 02:57.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.240]  You are living in epic history. Will you be someone that sits up there in the bleachers?
[03:02.240 --> 03:05.240]  Or will you be the man or woman in the arena?
[03:05.240 --> 03:08.240]  I have chosen my place in the arena.
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.240]  We've seen great victories. We've seen great defeats.
[03:11.240 --> 03:14.240]  And now we know the enemy is truly evil as we knew they were.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.240]  And now the battle is joined.
[03:17.240 --> 03:19.240]  There are 74 days left.
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.240]  Dan Rather, the famous fake newsman.
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.240]  Just as bad as Ryan Williams thinks we have no memory.
[03:27.240 --> 03:33.240]  And he says what Mueller knows will make Cohen Manafort pale by comparison.
[03:33.240 --> 03:39.240]  Stay tuned as Trump organization can face criminal charges from the other swamp,
[03:39.240 --> 03:42.240]  the other head of the Hydra, Manhattan DA,
[03:42.240 --> 03:48.240]  as the establishment makes its move all the giant crimes of Hillary, all the giant crimes of Obama,
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.240]  all the giant crimes of the globalist, all the giant crimes of communist China
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.240]  killing their political dissidents and Apple and other slave factories.
[03:56.240 --> 03:58.240]  But none of it matters.
[03:58.240 --> 04:03.240]  Because Donald Trump legally and lawfully years ago gave some money to two women
[04:03.240 --> 04:07.240]  who thought he was going to marry him or whatever, at least with the case of the Playboy model.
[04:07.240 --> 04:11.240]  And then, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it's so terrible.
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.240]  His lawyer was not paying taxes at a taxicab company.
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.240]  He's pled guilty.
[04:16.240 --> 04:18.240]  And so because of that, we can't have the recovery.
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.240]  America can't be great again.
[04:20.240 --> 04:26.240]  Because Trump isn't letting China have $900 billion of trade deficit against us every year
[04:26.240 --> 04:28.240]  because Trump's actually standing up for us.
[04:28.240 --> 04:29.240]  He has to be removed.
[04:29.240 --> 04:33.240]  He said, how do you take somebody out who's done a good job?
[04:33.240 --> 04:34.240]  How do you do it?
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, you do it with lies and deceit.
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.240]  You don't learn from people what the New York Times, Washington Post, others are doing.
[04:41.240 --> 04:43.240]  And it is unbelievable.
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.240]  I mean, look, we know they're evil.
[04:47.240 --> 04:50.240]  We know they're trained and bred to hate this country and to hate strength.
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.240]  But let me tell you, if there's ever any doubt about how evil these folks are, we've got the proof.
[04:55.240 --> 05:08.240]  Stay with us. Big transmission straight ahead.
[05:25.240 --> 05:27.240]  Alkalinity and pH.
[05:27.240 --> 05:33.240]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[05:33.240 --> 05:37.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[05:37.240 --> 05:44.240]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.240 --> 05:49.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[05:49.240 --> 05:55.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.240 --> 06:03.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:03.240 --> 06:07.240]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here.
[06:07.240 --> 06:11.240]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[06:11.240 --> 06:26.240]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[06:26.240 --> 06:32.240]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[06:32.240 --> 06:52.240]  It came in peace.
[06:52.240 --> 07:15.240]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant, we're not the enemy of the people.
[07:15.240 --> 07:27.240]  We're not the enemy of the people, we're not the enemy of the people, we're not the enemy of the people.
[07:27.240 --> 07:33.240]  This is CNN.
[07:33.240 --> 07:43.240]  Watching war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[07:43.240 --> 07:50.240]  Well, we're getting close to two years of El Presidente being in office a little over a year and a half.
[07:50.240 --> 07:56.240]  You see the country coming back from the dead by the Crip Keepers.
[07:56.240 --> 07:59.240]  They're not about to let the country come back. It's theirs.
[07:59.240 --> 08:05.240]  It belongs to them and the bureaucracy and the intelligence agencies and the corrupt bureaucrats.
[08:05.240 --> 08:15.240]  The swamp from D.C. and the swamp from New York and a double hydra-penser attack are moving against the president.
[08:15.240 --> 08:19.240]  And we see the headlines, the Hill, Spiro-Agnu lawyer.
[08:19.240 --> 08:24.240]  Trump should resign to keep Mueller from prosecuting his family.
[08:24.240 --> 08:27.240]  Oh, they're never going to give him any quarter.
[08:27.240 --> 08:33.240]  National Enquirer reportedly kept Trump hush money info in a safe.
[08:33.240 --> 08:40.240]  And now they've been given immunity to begin to roll on the president.
[08:40.240 --> 08:48.240]  Meanwhile, Dan Rather, what Mueller knows will make Cohen Manafort pale by comparison.
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.240]  What, like your fake George W. Bush Air National Guard records?
[08:52.240 --> 08:57.240]  Or maybe Ryan Williams saying he got shot on a helicopter?
[08:57.240 --> 08:59.240]  Real, real clear politics there.
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.240]  Trump organization could face criminal charges from Manhattan D.A.
[09:04.240 --> 09:10.240]  Yes, yes, the cesspool of corruption, New York.
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.240]  And now they're trying to tie that in to local government and go after the president himself.
[09:15.240 --> 09:18.240]  And why does the president have immunity?
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.240]  Except from impeachment. That's the other branch of government.
[09:22.240 --> 09:30.240]  He has that because any little two-bit jurisdiction would then start engaging in witch hunt prosecutions against the political enemy.
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.240]  But I want to know why the Republicans don't ever act like this.
[09:33.240 --> 09:35.240]  And that's the big issue.
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.240]  Is that you have dead to rights, the Clintons, Obama, Brennan, Clapper, Lyon to Congress.
[09:41.240 --> 09:44.240]  You have Benghazi. You have the looting of Haiti.
[09:44.240 --> 09:46.240]  You have the illegal servers.
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.240]  You have the $4 billion in the Clinton Foundation, uranium one.
[09:51.240 --> 09:58.240]  Fast and furious, the funding and founding of Al Qaeda and ISIS, on and on and on.
[09:58.240 --> 10:02.240]  But Jeff Sessions will not move against it.
[10:02.240 --> 10:20.240]  And that's what Trump keeps asking that we're going to cover coming up in the next segment is the way you just know there's complete total admitted massive corruption.
[10:20.240 --> 10:27.240]  Obama got fined $374,000 for $84 million that wasn't accounted for right.
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.240]  And the millions and millions that they found that was definitely illegal.
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.240]  But oh, you get a little fine from the campaign money.
[10:35.240 --> 10:48.240]  But then Congress from from California buys a bunch of dinners for his staff and drinks and flies his daughter and pet rabbit around with him and buys him a couple thousand dollars in video games.
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.240]  Literally, some of the charges are for cheeseburgers campaign money.
[10:53.240 --> 10:56.240]  The public's so dumb that as Democrats, I see headlines.
[10:56.240 --> 11:04.240]  Well, he stole from taxpayers campaign finance money when it's raised directly from donors is not sure low level candidates get matching funds.
[11:04.240 --> 11:06.240]  Sometimes that's different.
[11:06.240 --> 11:07.240]  So they conflate all this.
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.240]  It's just crazy to see the total and complete hypocrisy of all this.
[11:12.240 --> 11:21.240]  So know this, I told everybody they're not waiting for 2020.
[11:21.240 --> 11:23.240]  They're not waiting for impeachment.
[11:23.240 --> 11:36.240]  They are going to target and prosecute Don Jr, which we broke three days ago that is now in Esquire and other publications yesterday.
[11:36.240 --> 11:43.240]  And they are going to go after everyone in his organization and find something were smited and pay taxes.
[11:43.240 --> 11:44.240]  Right.
[11:44.240 --> 11:46.240]  Or the FBI interviews him and the FBI says they lied.
[11:46.240 --> 12:01.240]  So they get indicted until enough people, namely the cabinet around Trump, get scared and agree to remove him so that they don't get indicted.
[12:01.240 --> 12:13.240]  If you looked at Brennan and Clapper and others last year, last October, they were on with Wolf Blitzer on the Aspen Institute's program.
[12:13.240 --> 12:15.240]  You played the clip here probably a hundred times or more.
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.240]  And they said, don't worry, he'll be gone soon by December.
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.240]  That was last year.
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.240]  That was nine months ago.
[12:23.240 --> 12:25.240]  He'll be gone.
[12:25.240 --> 12:26.240]  And they go, oh, impeachment.
[12:26.240 --> 12:28.240]  They go, no, extra judicial.
[12:28.240 --> 12:32.240]  So that doesn't even really mean 25th Amendment.
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.240]  I guess you could argue it's legislative.
[12:34.240 --> 12:42.240]  So it's 25th Amendment having the majority of his cabinet say we believe he's insane.
[12:42.240 --> 12:53.240]  So this is pure mafia tactics by Mueller, by the Clintons and all these people who themselves are in Russian companies and Chinese companies who themselves deliver uranium on tarmacs.
[12:53.240 --> 13:01.240]  The richness of this is incredible.
[13:01.240 --> 13:06.240]  It'd be like a judge having you in a jaywalking hearing and the judge comes in with their mask on and a bag of cash.
[13:06.240 --> 13:09.240]  It says, sorry, I just robbed a bank during lunch.
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.240]  Can the bailouts help me with the cash?
[13:13.240 --> 13:18.240]  Now we're going to put you in jail for the jaywalking.
[13:18.240 --> 13:25.240]  Trump's Ring of Fire.
[13:25.240 --> 13:31.240]  Trump's Ring of Fire national inquire boss has immunity and Cohen probe.
[13:31.240 --> 13:36.240]  And that means, oh, we're going to charge you even though this isn't illegal.
[13:36.240 --> 13:40.240]  And a bunch of companies and groups do this where they catch and kill these stories.
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.240]  People come with the story.
[13:41.240 --> 13:43.240]  They're wanting money anyways.
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.240]  Okay, here you want the money.
[13:44.240 --> 13:45.240]  That's a transaction.
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.240]  They're the one blackmailing you.
[13:47.240 --> 13:50.240]  Is paying blackmail illegal?
[13:50.240 --> 13:52.240]  None of you haven't committed a crime.
[13:52.240 --> 13:54.240]  It's only illegal if you're doing it to cover up a crime.
[13:54.240 --> 13:55.240]  And that's all admitted.
[13:55.240 --> 14:00.240]  And they've had the former heads of the Justice Department come out and say that and they don't know what Sessions is doing.
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.240]  I can tell you what Sessions is doing.
[14:05.240 --> 14:10.240]  They came in and they intimidated him and they threatened him and they did that day one.
[14:10.240 --> 14:12.240]  And he took that job.
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.240]  And he needs to be fired right now and so does Mueller and every one of these people down 10, 15 deep.
[14:17.240 --> 14:20.240]  And there needs to be giant prosecutions of the deep state.
[14:20.240 --> 14:28.240]  And Trump has to move on these people or politically or they're going to go all out, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:28.240 --> 14:29.240]  But there are a lot of cowards in D.C.
[14:29.240 --> 14:31.240]  Not everybody's like Donald Trump.
[14:31.240 --> 14:32.240]  Very few are.
[14:32.240 --> 14:34.240]  All right, I'm going to go to break here in a moment.
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.240]  Please don't forget we are running a new big special right now.

[16:28.240 --> 16:33.240]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.

[19:22.240 --> 19:32.240]  Thank you for watching.
[19:52.240 --> 20:21.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.240 --> 20:36.240]  Coming up next segment.
[20:36.240 --> 20:41.240]  From the very folks that brought us the fake PP gate dossier, Buzzfeed.
[20:41.240 --> 20:46.240]  Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare a 2018 election strategy.
[20:46.240 --> 20:51.240]  They've already had these meetings. Tim Cook runs them, that's even leaked.
[20:51.240 --> 20:55.240]  And it's how to censor everyone.
[20:55.240 --> 20:59.240]  They're gathering at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco,
[20:59.240 --> 21:05.240]  according to an email obtained by Buzzfeed News.
[21:05.240 --> 21:06.240]  This is the strategy.
[21:06.240 --> 21:11.240]  Meanwhile, Facebook censors articles from conservative news outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[21:11.240 --> 21:13.240]  They're making their move.
[21:13.240 --> 21:16.240]  And next segment, I'm going to break that down.
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.240]  So America, they're going to try to steal this election from you in front of God and country.
[21:21.240 --> 21:26.240]  And then once they've done that, Obama signed an executive order that Trump hasn't rescinded,
[21:26.240 --> 21:28.240]  because he can't do everything.
[21:28.240 --> 21:33.240]  So they try to keep him isolated to federalize all elections after this.
[21:33.240 --> 21:38.240]  And they're coming after info wars, so we won't be a voice to the people during all of this.
[21:38.240 --> 21:42.240]  But you already know what's going on. You already knew what happened.
[21:42.240 --> 21:45.240]  But these are dire straits for this country.
[21:45.240 --> 21:48.240]  Now I'm going to give you the big secret right now.
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.240]  I'm going to give you the big secret.
[21:50.240 --> 21:55.240]  Trump made a secret vet.
[21:55.240 --> 22:00.240]  It turns out Trump is a gambler.
[22:00.240 --> 22:03.240]  That's right. Trump has a gambling problem.
[22:03.240 --> 22:05.240]  A really bad one.
[22:05.240 --> 22:09.240]  I'm about to tell you about exclusively right now.
[22:09.240 --> 22:12.240]  You see, Trump is very, very stubborn.
[22:12.240 --> 22:14.240]  Trump is a loner.
[22:14.240 --> 22:19.240]  When it comes to his ideas and what he stands for, he believes in himself.
[22:19.240 --> 22:27.240]  He listens to others, but he's an island unto himself, as many leaders are.
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.240]  And he believes in the underdog and he believes in America.
[22:31.240 --> 22:35.240]  And he believes in pragmatic business, but he doesn't like seeing America
[22:35.240 --> 22:43.240]  for some globalist dominance game being put into a cultural prison,
[22:43.240 --> 22:47.240]  being demoralized, being made poor, being broken down.
[22:47.240 --> 22:50.240]  He sees it as a great asset.
[22:50.240 --> 22:54.240]  Just like he takes old buildings and rehabilitates them and turns them into beautiful new buildings
[22:54.240 --> 22:56.240]  like his D.C. National Post Office.
[22:56.240 --> 22:59.240]  It's an amazing, beautiful hotel.
[22:59.240 --> 23:02.240]  Never been in a hotel with that type of beautiful architecture
[23:02.240 --> 23:05.240]  and the blue and the silver and the gold.
[23:05.240 --> 23:10.240]  It wasn't gaudy. It was very heavenly-like.
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.240]  Trump likes nice things. He likes you being happy.
[23:13.240 --> 23:18.240]  He likes seeing you successful.
[23:18.240 --> 23:23.240]  But he doesn't like big globalist alpha dogs trying to run his life or run your life.
[23:23.240 --> 23:28.240]  So he likes like a real alpha to take on other alphas, twisted alphas.
[23:28.240 --> 23:33.240]  And so Trump made a bet. He knew that with the tariffs being totally one-sided for 50 years
[23:33.240 --> 23:36.240]  and he knew with the demoralization of the people and he knew with the Federal Reserve
[23:36.240 --> 23:41.240]  doing all it could to suppress real growth and only giving big banks money and credit.
[23:41.240 --> 23:46.240]  He knew that if he could get in there and even partially right the ship, at least he thought,
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.240]  folks would say, oh my God, no matter the attacks, no matter what happens, we want this.
[23:51.240 --> 23:54.240]  This proves we were being artificially suppressed.
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.240]  So he got in and before he even got into office when he was president-elect,
[23:59.240 --> 24:04.240]  just the fact that the world knew that the whole globalist strategy wasn't being adopted
[24:04.240 --> 24:07.240]  like it had been before of shutting down America.
[24:07.240 --> 24:14.240]  The fact that America was open for business again, the fact that that was going on,
[24:14.240 --> 24:17.240]  the fact that that was unfolding, the fact that that was happening,
[24:17.240 --> 24:22.240]  meant all this investment rushed back in because until the 60s we were half the world's wealth,
[24:22.240 --> 24:25.240]  only 4% of the population.
[24:25.240 --> 24:29.240]  So Trump bet on America.
[24:29.240 --> 24:32.240]  He doesn't go betting at casinos that he owns.
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.240]  He doesn't go really betting on golf.
[24:34.240 --> 24:37.240]  It's well known that he's not a big wager,
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.240]  but when it comes to business and standing up to tyrants and buying Mar-Lago
[24:42.240 --> 24:48.240]  where no Jews or no blacks were allowed,
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.240]  he thought I'll buy this old thing that fell apart because he's dumbass racist.
[24:52.240 --> 24:54.240]  They all died and I'll fix it up.
[24:54.240 --> 24:57.240]  I'll make it open to everybody.
[24:57.240 --> 24:58.240]  And he did.
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.240]  I'll bring in black entertainers, you name it.
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.240]  And it's one of the most successful private clubs in the country.
[25:06.240 --> 25:13.240]  So see, he bets on you because he bets on himself,
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.240]  but has Trump bit off something bigger than he can chew?
[25:16.240 --> 25:17.240]  The answer is up to you.
[25:17.240 --> 25:18.240]  What are you going to do?
[25:18.240 --> 25:19.240]  What am I going to do?
[25:19.240 --> 25:22.240]  I'm not going to abandon him when they've got the FBI
[25:22.240 --> 25:24.240]  and the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.240]  literally trying to find ways to indict me right now,
[25:29.240 --> 25:32.240]  even though I get threats people couldn't imagine every hour.
[25:32.240 --> 25:33.240]  And I'm not whining.
[25:33.240 --> 25:36.240]  I asked for this.
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.240]  Because see, I'm just like Donald Trump.
[25:39.240 --> 25:40.240]  I am.
[25:40.240 --> 25:41.240]  I'm a maverick.
[25:41.240 --> 25:42.240]  I'm my own person.
[25:42.240 --> 25:44.240]  I don't like bullies and big tough guys,
[25:44.240 --> 25:47.240]  but I don't want to dominate little people.
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.240]  And I've got the sheepdog mentality.
[25:50.240 --> 25:55.240]  And I see our country and our world being bullied.
[25:55.240 --> 25:58.240]  And I see the left creating global racism against the West.
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.240]  And I see all this cold-blooded garbage going on.
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.240]  And I see in Trump somebody who sees the world just like I do,
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.240]  just through real eyes and who tries to do the best he can
[26:06.240 --> 26:08.240]  to have a better world for everybody.
[26:08.240 --> 26:10.240]  And I see a patriot.
[26:10.240 --> 26:13.240]  And I see a real man.
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.240]  And I just ask this America, so far gone, we don't deserve it.
[26:16.240 --> 26:17.240]  That question's up to you.
[26:17.240 --> 26:19.240]  But this isn't the election.
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.240]  This is 10 times more serious.
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.240]  This is do or die time.
[26:23.240 --> 26:27.240]  And the swamp from D.C. and New York and L.A. is making its move.
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.240]  And from Beijing and from Brussels, Belgium
[26:33.240 --> 26:35.240]  is making its move on a real president.
[26:35.240 --> 26:38.240]  He's not perfect, but he's looking out for us.
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.240]  He believes in the stewardship.
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.240]  He believes his family name will be submitted forever
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.240]  above George Washington's.
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.240]  If he can defeat the globalists to turn America around,
[26:46.240 --> 26:48.240]  he is the alpha male of the planet.
[26:48.240 --> 26:50.240]  It's the challenge.
[26:50.240 --> 26:51.240]  He's got the money.
[26:51.240 --> 26:52.240]  He's got the women.
[26:52.240 --> 26:53.240]  He's got the power.
[26:53.240 --> 26:55.240]  He's not into kids like the other globalists.
[26:55.240 --> 26:57.240]  He wants to defeat the globalists.
[26:57.240 --> 26:58.240]  That's real leadership.
[26:58.240 --> 26:59.240]  And they know it.
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.240]  And it's why they're scared.
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.240]  Do we deserve that?
[27:03.240 --> 27:05.240]  I think it's up to us.
[27:05.240 --> 27:07.240]  Do we deserve it?
[27:07.240 --> 27:09.240]  Because you just got the real deal, folks.
[27:09.240 --> 27:10.240]  You just saw it.
[27:10.240 --> 27:12.240]  You just come back in, you saw it all.
[27:12.240 --> 27:14.240]  You're seeing the secret technologies,
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.240]  the cures and things being released.
[27:16.240 --> 27:17.240]  It's all about to happen.
[27:17.240 --> 27:19.240]  He's only gotten 5% done.
[27:19.240 --> 27:22.240]  If you just let him go all the way, it's going to be incredible.
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.240]  Planetary victory.
[27:26.240 --> 27:28.240]  I want victory for the planet.
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.240]  Close quote.
[27:30.240 --> 27:33.240]  I want victory for the planet.
[27:33.240 --> 27:34.240]  Globalists don't want that.
[27:34.240 --> 27:35.240]  They hate the planet.
[27:35.240 --> 27:36.240]  They hate you.
[27:36.240 --> 27:37.240]  They think you're ugly.
[27:37.240 --> 27:38.240]  See, Trump thinks he's beautiful.
[27:38.240 --> 27:39.240]  He thinks you're beautiful.
[27:39.240 --> 27:41.240]  He doesn't like seeing America treated like this.
[27:41.240 --> 27:43.240]  He doesn't believe in that.
[27:43.240 --> 27:44.240]  Watch live.
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.240]  Trump tells sessions to look into dim corruption.
[27:47.240 --> 27:56.240]  Here's the tweets where Trump gets into all of it and breaks it all down.
[27:56.240 --> 28:01.240]  And how we've got this massive, incredible corruption of the Democratic Party
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.240]  that no one is doing anything about.
[28:05.240 --> 28:07.240]  Department of Justice will not be improperly imposed
[28:07.240 --> 28:08.240]  by political considerations.
[28:08.240 --> 28:09.240]  That's a close quote.
[28:09.240 --> 28:11.240]  Jeff, that's great.
[28:11.240 --> 28:12.240]  What everyone wants.
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.240]  So look into all the corruption of the other side, including deleted emails,
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.240]  coming lies and leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strock, Page, FISA abuse,
[28:22.240 --> 28:24.240]  Christopher Steele and his phony and corrupt Ossie,
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.240]  the Clinton Foundation, legal servers of the Trump campaign,
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.240]  Russian closing by Dems and much more.
[28:30.240 --> 28:33.240]  Open up the papers and documents without redaction.
[28:33.240 --> 28:34.240]  Trump could do it.
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.240]  Come on, Jeff.
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.240]  You can do it.
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.240]  The country's waiting.
[28:37.240 --> 28:39.240]  The Russian witch hunt continues and he goes on.
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.240]  Trump's betting on you.
[28:41.240 --> 28:43.240]  That's the secret.
[28:43.240 --> 28:45.240]  The secret casino's you.
[28:45.240 --> 28:47.240]  It's you.
[28:47.240 --> 28:48.240]  It's like a fever vendetta.
[28:48.240 --> 28:50.240]  They say, why didn't you do something earlier?
[28:50.240 --> 28:52.240]  And he says, I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[28:52.240 --> 29:18.240]  I was waiting for you.
[29:22.240 --> 29:35.240]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we're proud of our 100% grown and sown American made jeans.

[30:39.240 --> 30:42.240]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.

[30:47.240 --> 30:52.240]  This vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.

[30:54.240 --> 31:00.240]  Visit infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[31:00.240 --> 31:06.240]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[31:06.240 --> 31:10.240]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[31:10.240 --> 31:15.240]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[31:15.240 --> 31:17.240]  It's made in the USA.
[31:17.240 --> 31:22.240]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[31:22.240 --> 31:24.240]  and it supports the info war.
[31:24.240 --> 31:26.240]  It is a classical 360-win.
[31:26.240 --> 31:29.240]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[31:29.240 --> 31:35.240]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[31:35.240 --> 31:37.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[31:37.240 --> 31:40.240]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[31:40.240 --> 31:45.240]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[31:45.240 --> 31:50.240]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[31:50.240 --> 31:52.240]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[31:52.240 --> 31:55.240]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[31:55.240 --> 31:57.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[31:57.240 --> 32:26.240]  With Z-Shield, infowarslife.com.
[32:27.240 --> 32:49.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[32:49.240 --> 33:17.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[33:17.240 --> 33:45.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[33:45.240 --> 34:13.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[34:13.240 --> 34:41.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[34:41.240 --> 35:09.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[35:09.240 --> 35:37.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[35:37.240 --> 35:47.240]  You on the campaign trail, the listeners, all of you, we've been able to get key intel to the president.
[35:47.240 --> 35:51.240]  And we got the Mike Adams report that I commissioned out to him.
[35:51.240 --> 35:57.240]  We've got another information to him and you now see him everywhere saying the main thing is the censorship.
[35:57.240 --> 36:07.240]  The big issue is the suppression of millions of Americans in his new tweets just yesterday and today.
[36:07.240 --> 36:14.240]  And so yes, we are talking to the president through different systems and I'll leave it at that.
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.240]  And by the way, we're talking to other folks.
[36:17.240 --> 36:34.240]  And there are a lot of people right now who the establishment thinks have been scared who don't operate through kangaroo courts and corrupt Clinton, you know, FBI people who are really looking very, very closely at the globalists and the Democrats and all the rest of it.
[36:34.240 --> 36:47.240]  Because there was that gamble that we could bring back prosperity and really turn on the engine of America and the bet of real equality and a unification president.
[36:47.240 --> 36:53.240]  That's what patriots in our government and in our some of our corporations thought.
[36:53.240 --> 37:04.240]  The argument five years ago when the Pentagon after Benghazi and after creation of ISIS by Obama.
[37:04.240 --> 37:11.240]  And after it was discovered that Obama was funding the whole Arab Spring out of Kenya and out of Cairo.
[37:11.240 --> 37:14.240]  Egypt.
[37:14.240 --> 37:22.240]  The decision had been made to move on the globalist and their Chikon funders and some other folks said no.
[37:22.240 --> 37:29.240]  If we just draft somebody, we got an idea, Donald Trump, and this is documented.
[37:29.240 --> 37:51.240]  And if we can just get the country back and even negotiate with the Chinese and not have a total shutdown and just get some basic concessions, we can turn the country back on bring the country together instead of this nightmare race war plan that Hollywood and the Democrats and all the movies and all the propaganda had ready to go with.
[37:51.240 --> 38:05.240]  So they went and found the extremely smart, extremely bullheaded, very stubborn Donald John Trump and briefed him on what he already knew from his father and everything else.
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.240]  His own experiences in Trump said no.
[38:10.240 --> 38:21.240]  And then Melania Trump came to him while he was cogitating for three, four months in Scotland and said, you know, what you told me is true. I see it. I think you should do this. And he said, well, they're going to bring up everything.
[38:21.240 --> 38:26.240]  They're going to attack you. They're going to do it all. And she said, you need to do it.
[38:26.240 --> 38:40.240]  Now, I was told that from people in the Pentagon. I was told that from Roger Stone. I was told that from others before it ever ended up in a political article right after Trump that elected was article. I think how he did it or why he did it.
[38:40.240 --> 38:51.240]  And like most of what was in the article, it's crazy to read mainstream news and finally see truth because I read that.
[38:51.240 --> 38:59.240]  And it was what I knew was true. And from conversations I'd had with Trump, it's things he'd said to me, whether it is how he did it.
[38:59.240 --> 39:08.240]  And so he just decided to go with destiny. It's the ultimate gamble. And it's very fatalistic. He's going to go all the way. He's not going to stop. He's not going to plea bargain.
[39:08.240 --> 39:15.240]  He's not going to back down. They've got news articles everywhere saying you should step down. You know, you should resign now. We'll destroy your family.
[39:15.240 --> 39:23.240]  Trump is being told now in national news, you resigned now or we'll put your son in prison. We broke that three days ago. Now it's mainstream news.
[39:23.240 --> 39:26.240]  Tomorrow's news today.
[39:26.240 --> 39:41.240]  Well, Trump already canvassed his family and Donald Trump Jr. was for it. Eric Trump was for it. His wife was for it. They were all for it.
[39:41.240 --> 39:50.240]  Now there's no turning back. So just like there's evil in the world, there's good in the world.
[39:50.240 --> 39:59.240]  And you know Trump's real by the way they're attacking him. And you know he's real by the way things are getting better when he's in office.
[39:59.240 --> 40:07.240]  And I can look four, five, six, seven, 10, 20 moves ahead. And if the globalists do this to Trump, I mean the moves only get worse.
[40:07.240 --> 40:16.240]  It's like the globalists I've noticed only think of step one or two and they always lie to themselves. They can fix it, but they go down this road.
[40:16.240 --> 40:26.240]  I mean, Katie bar the door, you know, I was going to name the segment when we put it out on the internet for live right now on radio and TV on stations.
[40:26.240 --> 40:34.240]  I was going to name it Democrats, you know, Big Tech caught meeting in secret to steal the election.
[40:34.240 --> 40:45.240]  I'm going to do that next next segment. I guess if you call this segment something, you know, the takeaway.
[40:45.240 --> 40:55.240]  It would be Democrats openly tell Trump, Rizan will destroy your family.
[40:55.240 --> 41:03.240]  I mean, that's that's in the Hill that's in the Associated Press. That's everywhere. I mean, here are the headlines.
[41:03.240 --> 41:07.240]  Spiro Agnew lawyer Trump should resign to keep Mueller from prosecuting his family.
[41:07.240 --> 41:10.240]  Shouldn't America be angry about that?
[41:10.240 --> 41:17.240]  Prosecute the family about a lie to the FBI, which isn't even proven about a meeting to get dirt on Hillary.
[41:17.240 --> 41:20.240]  When they're in bed with the Russians and the chai cons, everybody else.
[41:20.240 --> 41:30.240]  I mean, oh my God, you know, take care of your family, sell out to us, but that sells your whole family out and the human family out doing that.
[41:30.240 --> 41:36.240]  National Enquirer Boss is immunity and Cohen probe. That means they're going to charge them unless they make stuff about Trump.
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.240]  Trump Organization could face criminal charges from Manhattan DA.
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.240]  They're now giving immunity to the head of the Trump Organization.
[41:45.240 --> 41:52.240]  This is the mafia. I don't mean the Italian mafia. The Italian mafia got destroyed because it kind of challenged the real mafia.
[41:52.240 --> 42:00.240]  This is the real white shoe boy mafia, the standard oil. I mean, you look at Mueller.
[42:00.240 --> 42:04.240]  You understand, Mueller is so rich that his wealth isn't even known.
[42:04.240 --> 42:13.240]  I mean, the heads of standard oil, the heads of giant railroads, all of them, it's all he is, is a fusion of all the robber barons into him.
[42:13.240 --> 42:22.240]  That Robert Mueller is them. I mean, I went into the genealogy, I knew about this, but I spent an hour on his known genealogy yesterday.
[42:22.240 --> 42:34.240]  He literally is related to five directly heads of five railroads who would just out west mow down whole towns if they didn't give them what they wanted.
[42:34.240 --> 42:46.240]  He is a genetic psychopath. Money laundering, everything. Every crime you can imagine, it's him. Good God help us.
[42:46.240 --> 42:52.240]  Anyways, the threat to the Trump family right now, as we first told you, it's all confirmed. How mafioso is that?

[47:03.240 --> 47:10.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.240 --> 47:20.240]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:20.240 --> 47:43.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. We have some just incredibly important news. It's so transparent. It's so tyrannical. It's so over the top.
[47:43.240 --> 47:56.240]  I don't have words described right now. And it's why they silenced us and kicked us off almost every major platform just two weeks ago is because they're getting ready to steal the 2018 election.
[47:56.240 --> 48:09.240]  Now, I've known it's even come out in New York Times that Tim Cook has Sunday meetings with the other heads of big tech companies over the phone to try to coordinate their monopolistic cartel.
[48:09.240 --> 48:19.240]  And back in the old days, they broke up oil companies for being cartels. That's illegal in this country.
[48:19.240 --> 48:32.240]  But now from Buzzfeed, who again is the establishment mouthpiece, so they get these little tidbits, tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare for the 2018 election strategy.
[48:32.240 --> 48:43.240]  Now, this came out this morning. They're meeting currently on Friday as we speak.
[48:43.240 --> 48:53.240]  And what have I pointed out to the president? It's collusion by big tech. And what else did I point out? How insane it is that even though it violates the Sherman Antitrust Act, even though it's racketeering,
[48:53.240 --> 49:08.240]  they admit in media matters own documents that media matters funded mainly by George Soros meets with the heads of tech and has interfaces into everything you do on YouTube, Google, iPhone, everything,
[49:08.240 --> 49:14.240]  and tracks and traces and then read your private messages and then controls what you say and what you do.
[49:14.240 --> 49:23.240]  And their job is, quote, suppressing and shutting down Fox News, conservatives, info wars, everybody. This is organized crime.
[49:23.240 --> 49:31.240]  But they believe they control the Justice Department and so they believe they're protected and Trump is up against this cabal.
[49:31.240 --> 49:39.240]  So here's the huge news.
[49:39.240 --> 49:54.240]  Here is the ultimate news. The Democrats and the globalist and the offshore banks and others that fund them are so incredibly arrogant that they can have three Democrat top senators call for all conservatives to be banned after I was banned
[49:54.240 --> 49:58.240]  and call for the end of the First Amendment and sell it like it's a great idea.
[49:58.240 --> 50:12.240]  And then they can meet in collusion to have 25 plus companies ban us in one day two weeks ago. Clear market collusion. You name it. I have my top law firm's own analysis of it open and shut illegal.
[50:12.240 --> 50:33.240]  And then now they even tell their pet fake Russia, Russia dossier publication Buzzfeed that they're meeting in secret as we speak to decide to coordinate how to censor everybody because they got to do it across platforms to be successful.
[50:33.240 --> 50:42.240]  The real threat isn't Russia. It's China and it's the big tech companies who've colluded with China who are doing this openly like you're a bunch of idiots.
[50:42.240 --> 50:54.240]  Look at this. Representatives from a host of the biggest US tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter have reached a private meeting.
[50:54.240 --> 51:10.240]  And if scheduled it for Friday to share their tactics in preparation for the 2018 midterm elections, so they're just hiding it in plain view the collusion.
[51:10.240 --> 51:28.240]  Last week Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gletscher invited employees from a dozen companies including Google, Microsoft and Snapchat all the ones that banned us to gather at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco according to an email obtained by Buzzkill news.
[51:28.240 --> 51:43.240]  That's Buzzfeed. As I've mentioned to several of you over the last few weeks, we have been looking to scheduling a fellow and a follow up discussion to our industry conversation about information operations.
[51:43.240 --> 51:55.240]  Information operations. That's against America. Election protection. That means let the global stay in power, steal the election and the work we are all doing to tackle these challenges.
[51:55.240 --> 52:04.240]  He wrote, you know, I'm just not right there because we've got a guest coming up. I want to cancel them. This is too important because I'm going to do this without graphics or anything when I come back.
[52:04.240 --> 52:14.240]  I'm going to do this in a focused way here on air because this is the biggest thing ever to hit this country. And so we'll have to move the South African farmers to a little bit later.
[52:14.240 --> 52:25.240]  If they can't make it, that's fine. And you know, all the rest of it's coming up. So that's just the way it is because I'm going to have a focused broadcast here on air with the subjects covered or I'm going to not do the show.
[52:25.240 --> 52:35.240]  That's how it works because everybody's in a punch drunk situation in this country, not realizing what we're facing or what we're dealing with or where we've gotten to.
[52:35.240 --> 52:49.240]  It's that simple. I mean, you've got big tech, all the companies together is like $5 trillion. The ones that banned me the first day were 2.4, the next day another trillion.
[52:49.240 --> 53:03.240]  So 3.3 trillion, 3.4 trillion. And these are total monopolies out of control spying on you, selling your data, stealing elections and Congress is sitting there drooling like they've been given lobotomies.
[53:03.240 --> 53:14.240]  And they've got all these corrupt organizations and groups trying to indict the president and his family when they've got corruption a trillion times worse than even what they claim.
[53:14.240 --> 53:27.240]  And it's insane. And the average leftist is all charred up and charged up and ready for war against you and your family because their losers and their whole identity is about controlling you and your family.
[53:27.240 --> 53:46.240]  So I'm going to explain this again. Big tech companies are meeting in secret right now and they admit their planning is still the election.
[53:46.240 --> 53:57.240]  And you say, why are they so? Because it's a hidden and plain view. They know we got reports of the president. They know he's aware of this. They know he was making comments. They know he's involved.
[53:57.240 --> 54:06.240]  They know for whatever reason Twitter didn't go along. So they think maybe Dorsey's really talking to the president. So they all then want to come meet with them.
[54:06.240 --> 54:15.240]  All the folks that have already banned me. And that means you in secret. This isn't Netflix dramas. This isn't Netflix movies. This isn't some James Bond movie.
[54:15.240 --> 54:20.240]  This is the real world, people. It's the real one.
[54:20.240 --> 54:26.240]  Or a Nazi collaborator that's overthrown countless countries thinks he's better than you. George Soros.
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.240]  That thinks he's got you.
[54:31.240 --> 54:39.240]  So I'll come back next hour and I'll do my best to raise the alarm.
[54:39.240 --> 54:47.240]  But this is best I can almost straight shoot you on this. But I'm explaining again. I'm not that important.
[54:47.240 --> 54:55.240]  Hillary thought I was weak because they could take me out of context. They ran $18 million of ads against Trump was using me and their own studies showed it.
[54:55.240 --> 55:03.240]  Maybe we'll vote more for Trump because they wanted something avant-garde. Then they went, oh my God, we built Jones up, which they didn't really build me up that big. Only in their own minds.
[55:03.240 --> 55:11.240]  So then they built me up even bigger. And now they've built me up where I'm as big as Trump in most of these.
[55:11.240 --> 55:17.240]  I mean, we're talking thousands of articles a day. I don't want to be as big as Trump. He's in the crucible. He's in the crosshairs.
[55:17.240 --> 55:30.240]  And now they believe I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo. And then now it's gone into total cuckoo land because it's their existential hatred of America and of alpha male and of chivalry and of being honest and of being decent.
[55:30.240 --> 55:42.240]  And they don't know what to do. So they think if they can destroy me, somehow they can kill the spirit of America, but I'm only a manifestation of that.
[55:42.240 --> 55:51.240]  And I described mainstream media that no one watches like a burning wreck car that rebels use to drive into a castle wall. I mean, none of it makes sense what they're doing.
[55:51.240 --> 55:59.240]  It's all just existential. They think they're dying because their only identity is squatting on America.
[55:59.240 --> 56:04.240]  And I've got a bunch of guests coming up about that. So we're going to cover it all the next hour.
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.240]  But they're meeting in secret about how they're going to collude. They're already censoring massively. It's how to respond to the president.
[56:10.240 --> 56:14.240]  And is he awake? And what's going on? And how can he strike back? And what are they going to do?
[56:14.240 --> 56:22.240]  Because they've been threatened by Senator Warner and others that you'll destroy Trump or when we take over, we will nationalize you. He said that.
[56:22.240 --> 56:29.240]  So they rolled over because Trump wouldn't threaten them. They were being threatened by the chai comms and Warner and Hollywood.
[56:29.240 --> 56:35.240]  So they rolled over. Now, Trump woke up. They're saying, what do we do? Who do we roll over to? We need leadership.
[56:35.240 --> 56:40.240]  Roll over to free speech. Roll over to an internet bill of rights. Roll over to not being influenced.
[56:40.240 --> 56:46.240]  And unless it's illegal, let it be. That's what you roll over to Twitter and Google.
[56:46.240 --> 56:52.240]  But you're a bunch of punk asses that want to keep your $50 billion a piece so you can all candy ass around.
[56:52.240 --> 56:58.240]  It was the freedom that gave you all the wealth. Speaking of that, the enemy wants to cut our funding off to destroy us.
[56:58.240 --> 57:07.240]  We've got huge sales in FullWarStore.com. We've got ultimate bone broth formula that is beyond any way, beyond any protein, beyond anything,

[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:20.240]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:30.240]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to lay it all out. Tech giants are meeting right now in secret in their own emails about how to carry out information warfare against you and your families.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:44.240]  They're so criminal. They're so committed. They're so out of control. They even admit they're doing it. I mean, it is just amazing. That's coming up next segment. And I have a leader of a major group of the Afrikaners who are being exterminated and having their land taken by the
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:55.240]  communists. That is all coming up at about 15 after. But first, let's go ahead and go to this report on Tucker Carlson defending these First Amendment.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:02.240]  As you probably heard, recently many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:11.240]  Because it looks like his website, Infowars, just lost their war on info. Yesterday. Yep.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:22.240]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones's accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  Oh, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions. All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:42.240]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Alex Jones. Infowars. Not Tucker. Infowars. Alex Jones.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:54.240]  Infowars. Infowars. Now, I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than, like, Bill Maher, Michelle Wolfe or Rosie O'Donnell, but he's got a point of view and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:05.240]  Did Twitter make mistakes around Alex Jones' info wars? At the time, we did not receive reports that we felt we could take any action that violated on our terms of service.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:18.240]  It was your colleagues, as CNN pointed out, a number of them. We took action on one and then we noticed that all the others, likely because they were made known to Alex Jones and Infowars, were being deleted.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:28.240]  But this isn't about Alex Jones. This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.240]  The left, which seeks to crush anything it can control, applauded the news.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting. I think the things he said are awful. He makes me physically sit. With that being said, he does have the ear of the president and he has six million people that listen to him.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.240]  And I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this. We have a problem in this country and I would like him to be exposed.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.240]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.240]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.240]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.240]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:11.240]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.240]  So, if we're gone, we're out of there.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:27.240]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.240]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:40.240]  And Jones is hardly their only target. That's for sure. Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.240]  Facebook censor our free speech and shame on the ones that don't even seem that we have been censored.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:58.240]  Alex Jones, who is not my friend and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off Twitter, I think, and Facebook and a few other platforms. I think he's gonna quit.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.240]  Thank God!
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:09.240]  Well, if you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech. That's free speech for the speech you hate. That's what free speech means.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:15.240]  Our establishment crushes dissent not because our establishment is strong, but because it is weak and afraid.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:21.240]  They're the ones in control, and they're the ultimate censors at universities, the media everywhere. They're monsters.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.240]  And now they want you completely banned from all new forms of digital communication.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:31.240]  Elites aren't afraid of what Alex Jones says, Krieger writes. They're terrified that it's popular.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:38.240]  Trump didn't divide American society. Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and, by the way, justified distrusting institutions.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:45.240]  Elites did that. Trump's election and Alex Jones's popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.240]  People know what's true. They can smell it. You can't stop them from knowing that.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.240]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:15.240]  I want to plow into all of this, that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:24.240]  you are funding the revolution. I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:38.240]  You cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:50.240]  infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139. And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:06:16.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:31.240]  So the arrogant New York Times, the narcissistic psychotic CNN, the mentally ill America-hating MSNBC, they all had a plan.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:38.240]  Hillary, they said the New York Times, according to their special algorithm, had a 98% chance of winning until Election Day.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:52.240]  And now America's coming back, the economy's coming back, the one-sidedness of globalism and fraudulent trade deals selling off American power has become clear that America in the 1960s was 4% of the world's population.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:02.240]  96% lived outside our borders. And we had over half the wealth, about 55% of it, because we had the only big middle class in the world.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:11.240]  And the globalists said, we'll parlay that into a new corporate empire. We, with tariffs and other systems, will slowly shut down America,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:25.240]  transfer the power to authoritarian dictatorships, become fabulously rich, and then finally America will give them the terms of surrender, won't even know who they are, and we'll conquer them in the end.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:34.240]  But along came InfoWars, along came Matt Drudge, along came Donald Trump, along UK, and things didn't go the way they wanted.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:40.240]  We're about to cover the most insanely transparent, disgusting evil you've ever seen.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:50.240]  What does Senator Warner and Senator Wyden and Senator Murphy, what do they do when they're in these different meetings,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:08:00.240]  and when they put out these press releases saying, we want Alex Jones shut down. We want Trump shut down. They're Russian agents.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:08.240]  No judge, no jury, no indictment, no proof. They're the ones giving the uranium to the Russians. They're the ones that are anti-American.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:17.240]  They're the ones in the Democratic Party that say America was never great. America was never great, and America will never be great.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.240]  I am homo, I teto.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:29.240]  They look at us that bleed red, white, and blue and tell us we're the enemy because they're the globalists. So what's really going on here?
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.240]  Here's a zero-hedge article from two years ago.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:41.240]  Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act of the law on executive order, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:48.240]  To have the CIA basically run the board of governors of the FCC, not the FCC board, but the board of governors,
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.240]  and to declare independent media, nationalist media as Russian to be shut down.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:09:00.240]  That's federal law. Trump needs to sign executive order blocking that, and we're advising him of that right now.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.240]  Then it continues.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:11.240]  Trump's land censorship. Social media giants are silencing millions of people after he said it was wrong when I was banned, and that CNN's the real fake news,
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.240]  and who should watch as those that claim they're the gatekeeper or the judge, jury, and executioner over that.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:24.240]  Social media giants are silencing millions of people, can't do this, even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like CNN,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.240]  who says he's trying to shut them down. No, they lobby to have us shut down and others shut down.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:36.240]  Whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.240]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. People tune in every once in a while to see what's happening, but in general, no one watches this.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:52.240]  The article's on infowars.com and newswars.com. Now that takes us to the big enchilada right now.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:59.240]  This is out of BuzzFeed, the little lapdog of the establishment, the fake news kings. I mean, the whole world of fake news. They are the cutting edge.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.240]  They are the vanguard.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:07.240]  Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare a 2018 election strategy.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:18.240]  They're meeting this Friday at Twitter headquarters in S. Hole City, San Francisco, with the feces lying the streets and the heroin addicts everywhere.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:27.240]  They are meeting there in their heaven. And they're admittedly in the article saying, we've got Russians hitting us.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.240]  And they list the Democrats saying it. So we've got to work to stop the Russians. Wink, wink.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.240]  And that means anybody promoting Trump, anybody promoting our military, anybody promoting the Second Amendment.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.240]  And they go through it saying, we haven't really had meetings before, which they've all been colluding.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:49.240]  Now just going, oh my God, we got caught colluding. Trump's after us for chairman any trust stuff. It's all coming out.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.240]  We did this. Jones has got them all the documents. Jones' law firms. What do we do?
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.240]  We'll just have a big meeting and say it's our first meeting.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:06.240]  So all of this is just complete disinformation. Tim Cook, every Sunday, they leaked this years ago, even in the Washington Post New York Times.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.240]  And he kind of holds court over Google and Facebook and all the rest of them.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:18.240]  And so Twitter, you know, is the holdout on the racing Alex Jones. So, oh, they get the big meeting.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:26.240]  The whole thing's scripted. And it goes over it with all these big groups colluding, deciding how to protect the election.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.240]  That means how to make sure the Democrats get in, which they've already been doing. They're banning.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:37.240]  I've got hundreds and hundreds of articles a day. I can't even track of just every libertarian, every conservative, every Christian group.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:47.240]  Pat Buchanan, Gavin McGannish, Prager University, Matt Drudge being shadow banned on Twitter, where none of his tweets would go through.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:53.240]  That was six months ago. It's everywhere. But again, we're all Ruskies.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.240]  Facebook censors articles from conservative outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:05.240]  Mainline sites from the New York Post are now being blocked.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:12.240]  The Washington Times is now being blocked. Everything's being blocked.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.240]  Because we're not allowed to have a voice because this is the coup. This is the digital coup.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:22.240]  So here's the article. It's up on info wars.com. Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.240]  Remember I talk about secret meetings, Bilderberg. Oh, no corporations meeting secret. That's illegal.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:33.240]  That violates the Sherman Antitrust Act 1906. Teddy Roosevelt, the Rough Riders. Why?
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:46.240]  Let's see now. Oh, BuzzFeed tells you, but it's no big deal. Yeah, you know, BuzzFeed and Salon promote sex with children and stuff, but that's okay too.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:52.240]  So does HBO. That's kind of the same thing. Yeah, there's a secret meeting. Yeah, it's all the big companies.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:59.240]  Yeah, they're talking about how to work on the election because they're all scared because Trump says he may move against him.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:06.240]  He's already gone with the Fair Housing Act against Facebook that tracks what race you are, what your sexual proclivity is.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.240]  All this stuff to then decide what to pitch you and how much to charge you.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:19.240]  But Trump needs to do a lot more with executive orders. You name it because the fight to steal the election from the president is now.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.240]  And the fight to steal it from you is now.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:39.240]  Representatives from a host of the biggest U.S. tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, have scheduled a private meeting for Friday to share their tactics in preparation, which they've already done two and a half months, 74, 73 days out.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:58.240]  Now, it gets really telling around here. Last week, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleisher, invited employees from a dozen companies, including Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, to gather at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:10.240]  So, as I've mentioned to several of you over the last few weeks, we have been looking to schedule a follow on discussion. Oh, they already had a follow, they had one before.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:17.240]  Because later they say it's the first. To our industry conversation about information operation, information warfare.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:29.240]  Oh, election protection. Oh, that means to give us the Democrats, letting Hillary get the questions beforehand, saying she went all the polls and the work we are all doing to tackle these challenges.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:36.240]  That means the American, the bitter clinger, the gun owner, the Christian, their food, the alpha male, they wrote.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:47.240]  The meeting, the Facebook official wrote, will have me three born agenda. Each couple present the work they've been doing to counter the American people with information operations.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:57.240]  There will be a discussion period for problems each company faces and tactics they've learned to suppress the people. And to talk about whether such meetings should become a regular occurrence.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:10.240]  You've got to openly merge all the corporations in every decision together as if it isn't already going on. You've got to get the CIA and the globalists embedded in all these together right there at point blank range.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:17.240]  And part of that is the whole media working together to shut us down. They go to Robert Mueller's office and how he needs them to fight Russians.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:29.240]  Oh, Mueller. Oh, yes. Fight the Ruskies. Can't let America become great again. Oh, my gosh. We're out of time. We've got a South African farmer.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:39.240]  One of the leaders of the group's warning was coming. It's now happening. That's coming up. Just please remember, without you sharing the videos at infowars.com, without you sharing the articles,

[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:41.240]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:57.240]  We're defending apartheid. That doesn't mean we're defending Muammar Gaddafi in the north, but he was stabilizing much of the area as soon as he was taken out. Everything around it is collapsing, and so whether it was Gaddafi system or South African system, it's very, very sad.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:16.240]  And Simon Roche is one of the leaders of the movement that has been pointing out that the major political parties, both the ANC and others, were moving in a big, big, big, big way towards exterminating all the whites and taking their land.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:27.240]  And that was their political campaign platforms, and we're going to play some of those videos coming up. But now you've had the president and the deputy come out and say, we're going to start taking the land.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:36.240]  They tried. Local police would not carry it out at least in some areas. You have killings every day going on. You have Africa imploding all over the place.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:42.240]  You have the numbers 100 million now reportedly according to our South African sources from 50 million in the census.
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:53.240]  So Africa is collapsing to the north into Europe. It's collapsing into the south. And Simon Roche is, it runs a super high tech organization in modern farming.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:59.240]  When I said they're like Amish reading books about and talking to other folks, they're out in the middle of the country. They work really hard. They're Christians.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:09.240]  You know, they're praying every, you know, couple hours and they're not living in fancy surroundings. I see that as like Mennonites that are like Amish light, but he pointed out to me off air that, you know, we're not really an Amish sec, which is true.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:16.240]  That comes out of Switzerland. They're from there from the Netherlands. But they've been there 400 years and I've looked at the history books.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.240]  There was almost no one down there. As soon as they made everything green, all these big tribes moved down to be around the money and around the success, which is fine.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:33.240]  Then the British invaded to take it over. This is all history. And it looks like the British today are the ones manipulating because they want to failed state like the Chinese do to not have any industry or any life.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:40.240]  Just come in and extract things. We'll talk big picture coming up. We'll look at the close in here in just a little while.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:50.240]  But I saw articles where, oh, out of the major Canadian broadcasters and the U.S. broadcasters, South Africa leader fact checks Trump on white farmers tweet.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:23:00.240]  They don't show the video. They just say, oh, he fact checks them. We actually see what Julius said. Malema said, he said, yeah, we're going to kill you. Yeah, we're going to take your land.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:07.240]  We're going to play what he said in English. So our own media, the British government and others are saying, yes, take the white farmers land.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:14.240]  But I just saw a video we'll show next segment of Zimbabwe where they killed all the farmers who drove them out.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:20.240]  Now that that dictatorship is out for decades, the blacks are hugging the whites and begging them to come back.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.240]  And what are they begging to come back to Christianity, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:30.240]  There it is. Zimbabwe farmers coming back. This is what folks think. They've been gone for a while.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:38.240]  So that's the breakdown. It's the rest of the hour. It's suidlanders, suitlanders.org.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:47.240]  Simon Roche is head of the office of the headquarters, the world's largest on state civil defense organization, Southlanders of South Africa.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:58.240]  Once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the rainbow nation.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.240]  He also lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:08.240]  And he's predicted all of this here on the broadcast last year, this year, March 1st. It's all happened.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:15.240]  So why don't you, for people this segment, I appreciate you joining us, give people the big view of what's really going on in South Africa versus Hollywood,
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:20.240]  who the players are, from what I've read, the fact that most African tribes want you there, but the communists don't.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240]  Explain what's going on.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:31.240]  The big picture, Alex, is that South Africa has had multiracial democracy for about 24 years.
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.240]  And in that period, there has been a steady decline of many facets of the country.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:45.240]  And it's now reached the point where the government is saying that it is going to expropriate white and owned land without compensation.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  On the false basis that the land was stolen, our president has made it clear that we have to rectify the original sin of South Africa,
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:25:02.240]  completely overlooking those portions of land that were uninhabited as proven by white and black historians alike,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:10.240]  overlooking the fact that the west of the Great Fish River of South Africa, approximately 40% of the country,
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.240]  had never seen a black settlement in any way, shape, or form ever by the time that the whites and blacks met.
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:22.240]  And that's because populations mainly lived on the sea, I mean, everywhere in the world.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.240]  Yeah, exactly. The sea and towards the north.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:33.240]  Our country sort of strangely shaped, so if I speak about north and west, it's kind of the equivalent of south and north.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.240]  The reality, the actual reality is this, that much of that land was bought.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  Let's not even talk about rights of conquest, which is recognized by all black tribes in Africa.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:53.240]  There is no dispute over the land that was taken from the Hottentot and Koi people, the Bushmen and the Hottentot people.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.240]  There is no dispute over that. There's no dispute over the land that the Zulus took from the Colossus.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.240]  There's no dispute over the land taken by the Matabele.
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:07.240]  It's only land that whites might have taken, and in many cases it was never taken.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.240]  It was either not occupied or it was obtained by treaty in those cases.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.240]  So we're in a crisis now where the ANC said, right, we're going to take the land.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.240]  This is our intention. This is our plan.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.240]  But what we'll do, because we're Democrats, good people,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.240]  we're going to hold a kind of a national referendum.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.240]  We'll permit people to write in from all over South Africa and tell us their opinions,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.240]  and we'll stage a roadshow across the country.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:40.240]  And people can come and address the members of our parliament directly and tell them what they think about it.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.240]  And the two processes were not directly in parallel that they overlapped.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.240]  So that's like when our own government says, we're going to ban this,
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.240]  but we're going to let you make comment, but they do what they want.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:57.240]  Right, 600 of the 700,000 written responses were opposed to the taking of the land.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.240]  So the government probably said, well, we'll have to reopen that process.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.240]  And they issued an instruction to their members, the African National Congress Party members,
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.240]  this time you better all write in, send faxes, emails, do whatever you've got to do.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.240]  So let's be clear, the vast majority of the black and minority white members did the right thing
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.240]  and said, don't take people's land, but the party wants it.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.240]  The party wants the land for itself.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.240]  Everybody must get used to one thing right from the beginning.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.240]  There is not enough land to keep people happy.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.240]  You can't give 50 million people 30,000 farms.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.240]  That's not mass.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.240]  So who's going to get the farms?
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.240]  And as it is, I'd like to add one other thing.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  There is the fallacy that the eight and a half percent white population of South Africa
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.240]  owns 90% of the land or whatever you like.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.240]  It's a complete fiction to give you one example.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.240]  And I could give you many would be all night in the province.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:03.240]  Of course, you're going to tell the Zulu people as a nation do own and have always owned 32% of the province.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:08.240]  There was never a case of 10% of the people owning 90% of the land.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.240]  It is simply a fallacy.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240]  I'll tell you something that you might find interesting.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.240]  The New York Times contacted me yesterday for an interview.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.240]  We did an interview.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.240]  They asked me about the trip to the USA last year.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.240]  They asked me who we saw and so on.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.240]  I said to them, well, you know, we saw some good people.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.240]  Some people were not really our cup of tea.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.240]  And they said, well, give us an example of somebody that you didn't like.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.240]  I said, Dr. David Duke, do you know how they reported it this morning?
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  They said, we met Dr. David Duke.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.240]  Completely overlooking the fact.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240]  So this narrative.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.240]  Stay there. I know.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.240]  No, I know.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.240]  The New York Times is calling people asking if I if I'm grabbing men's butts at the office.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.240]  I mean, it is just because they go away.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]  He's a Christian conservative.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.240]  If we can say he grabs men's butts, maybe his supporters won't support him.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.240]  Listen to what Chris said about Andrew 400.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.240]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in 10 weeks.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.240]  My son was getting married and when I went for the suit fitting, I was the size 48.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.240]  And when I went back to do the final fitting, I was a 44.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.240]  I have more energy.
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.240]  That's for sure.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.240]  I probably lost four inches around my belly.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.240]  I'm 57.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240]  And I'm back when I was in my 30s.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.240]  Here's what Dwayne said about Andrew 400.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.240]  This product really works.

[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.240]  It's one of the few things I've ever bought that works.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.240]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.240]  I feel better.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.240]  I have more energy.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.240]  I walk 12 miles a day.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.240]  I feel great.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.240]  It changed my life.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:36.240]  It really has.

[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:05.240]  You know, it's funny that Simon Roche of SouthlandersSUIDlanders.org
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.240]  one of the main leaders there of the farmer groups
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.240]  brought the New York Times.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.240]  I mean, I've known the New York Times just bad for a long time
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.240]  but I've had, let me not exaggerate,
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:18.240]  six people called me the last week,
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.240]  some of which I haven't seen in years
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.240]  and they've called like first cousins, second cousins, you name it
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.240]  and they say, we hear Alex Jones grabs men
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.240]  and fondles them around the office.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.240]  And the people say, no, we've never seen even fondle anybody.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240]  Not a woman, not a man.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.240]  But that goes back to that fake EEOC complaint
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.240]  where the person said,
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.240]  the Daily Mail admits they paid by the way,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.240]  said, well, he never asked me out
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.240]  but I felt like he was grooming me for gay sex.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.240]  So telepathically now this is going on
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.240]  and I later learned from other people involved
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.240]  that the lawyers are sitting around and they're like,
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:01.240]  wait, people don't care about an employment problem.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.240]  Let's say, what will hurt a conservative?
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.240]  They go, oh, let's say he's gay,
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.240]  which we're not even anti, we're not attacking anybody here.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.240]  So that's what I'm getting at is,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.240]  he brings up the New York Times, he's like,
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.240]  I don't like David Duke when I was in America.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.240]  That turns into Simon Roche loves David Duke.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.240]  This is the murdering of the truth
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.240]  and that's why at this point,
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.240]  used to I might talk to a reporter a little bit
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.240]  because at least they get some of what you said, no, no, no.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.240]  You can tell them the sky is blue, they'll say it's red.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.240]  You cannot talk to them.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.240]  They use it as the cover for their life
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:34.240]  and you have to understand folks, they're going for broke
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.240]  but Simon, I want to get into the current state,
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  Trump coming out.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.240]  We've got who the different players are in South Africa
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.240]  and how this always follows the same path.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.240]  Please continue.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.240]  Yeah, very simply, the ruling party
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.240]  is the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.240]  They've been in power for 24 years solid.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.240]  We have an election coming up next year in 2019.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.240]  Their lapdog, the party that they have founded
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:04.240]  to occupy the political territory
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.240]  that they had to concede for world opinion.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:09.240]  The African National Congress couldn't be seen to be Marxist
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.240]  or openly Marxist.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.240]  They found a party called the Economic Freedom Fighters.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.240]  This party is ostensibly at loggerheads with them,
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.240]  always shouting, fighting, arguing, condemning
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.240]  and criticizing, but actually they're implementing
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.240]  or the driving force behind the implementation
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:35.240]  of certain written, recorded African National Congress policies
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.240]  in what they call their National Democratic Revolution documents.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.240]  The ANC wants a National Democratic Revolution,
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.240]  a Socialist Revolution.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.240]  They couldn't be seen to be the ones doing it,
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.240]  so they found a party of firebrands
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.240]  and these guys are saying, we've got to do this, we've got to do this.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.240]  The ANC then says, well, look, we probably should,
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.240]  you know the poor blacks don't have any land,
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.240]  the whites have got everything and we've got an election coming up,
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.240]  so it's chaos here at the moment.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.240]  The value of our currency has plunged.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.240]  There are more than 19,000 of just 45,000 commercial farming units.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.240]  19,000 farms for sale right now in South Africa.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.240]  Some farmers are not planting crops.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:23.240]  Other farmers are trimming down their stock, their livestock herds.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.240]  Other farmers are renting.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.240]  I spend a lot of time with farmers.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.240]  I know this well.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:34.240]  Other farmers are renting equipment rather than buying it themselves
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.240]  and renting land rather than making, you know, expansions.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.240]  I've also read that the yields are plunging and that famine could hit.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.240]  The yields are plunging.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.240]  We have become a net importer of food,
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.240]  which nobody ever foresaw happening, particularly 25 years ago,
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:55.240]  when we were told that the African National Congress would guarantee us
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.240]  a new South African rainbow nation, Utopia.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.240]  And these things have happened a little bit by little bit by little,
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240]  but they bring in a certain law, people get hurt and offended,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.240]  and then they... And this is a microcosm of America and the West
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.240]  where they sell Christians the idea of everybody in harmony,
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.240]  but then the left cheats and makes their whole thing racially based.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.240]  That is precisely correct.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.240]  And it goes to this thing of the New York Times
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:26.240]  trying to draw a line between David Duke and Donald Trump through me.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.240]  In other words, Simon Roach responding,
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.240]  Donald Trump tweeting about this thing, Mike Pompeo, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.240]  Well, we've spoken to Simon and his big buddies with David Duke.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.240]  Yes, so go ahead and kill the white farmers,
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.240]  go ahead and let South Africa fail because David Duke,
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.240]  when you said, I don't like David Duke, that becomes you love David Duke,
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:48.240]  why couldn't the New York Times just be pro-prosperity for South Africa?
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.240]  Why do they...
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.240]  Because they have an agenda.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.240]  They have an agenda, Alex, but now, if you... Not you.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.240]  Clearly, you've been saying a lot of this stuff
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:02.240]  long before the rest of us woke up.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.240]  Never mind, got out of bed.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.240]  But if you can't see this, there's something wrong with you.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.240]  The evidence is now overwhelming.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.240]  There is an all-out assault on Western European-derived Caucasian Christian culture.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.240]  That's just a reality.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.240]  None of this stuff is happening in Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Borneo.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.240]  It's all happening in Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.240]  Western Europe, the USA and to the whites of South Africa.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.240]  If people cannot see it, the problem is with them, not with the evidence.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.240]  And look, you have cold-blooded corporations look at 90% of the world being non-white.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.240]  They're all about old white guys.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.240]  They don't care, they just want power.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.240]  They've already exploited the third world.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:47.240]  And so, they've got the West being Christians saying, let's all work together.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.240]  They exploit the fact that we are trying to have a big tent because we love God
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.240]  and God's for all peoples.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.240]  They exploit our openness as a weakness while we're going, let's all love each other.
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:00.240]  They are bringing in third world populations, radicalizing them.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.240]  And like you said, the blacks voted almost unanimously to not take your land.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:09.240]  They understood that everybody was working together and it was Christian prosperity
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.240]  and rainbow coalition, but they said, no.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  The leadership said, no, we're going to kill them.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.240]  We're going to run them out because they want power.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.240]  And obviously, we know who's really running the ANC, the British government,
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.240]  the globalists that have actually backed this.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:26.240]  They want South Africa poor, just like North Africa.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.240]  They kill Qaddafi so that nobody gets anything.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.240]  They want squalor.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.240]  Just like when the Chinese come in, they build a big camp, the outsiders get nothing.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.240]  But when the West comes in, railroads, medicine, everything, the Christians lift everybody up
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.240]  and the globalists say, no, the Africans die.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.240]  And I think that's the big secret truth here.
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:50.240]  You know, it's a bit like David Ike's Luciferian consciousness.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.240]  They're crazy if you like.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.240]  But that's another example of a person yourself, Donald Trump and others,
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.240]  who were prescient about this stuff, uncannily prescient.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  This thing is clearly directed at a certain culture, a certain religion, a certain ethos.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.240]  They want to get Christianity.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.240]  That's it.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.240]  So explain that.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.240]  Why do they want to get Christianity so bad?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.240]  That's what this comes down to.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.240]  And this is what we've been saying for a long, long, long time and people laugh at us.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.240]  They scoff like they scoff and sneer at you, except that when you get proved right,
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.240]  then they find another angle of attack.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.240]  We're going to come back and play some of these clips.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240]  But what is the end game?
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.240]  I mean, the numbers, I see the videos are the slaughtered whites tortured to death.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.240]  And then we've got, in fact, I forgot to play the clip.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:37.240]  MSNBC made a joke about it and said, big deal of whites are being killed.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.240]  Yeah, that's that's lovely.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.240]  And the little girls raped.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  They literally think it's funny on the news.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.240]  Yeah, they think it's very funny.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  These people are perverts, Alex, and people like you and I have to ensure that our children
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.240]  don't marry into those gene pools that we warn everybody that we can.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.240]  These people are perverse to the marrow of their bones.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  That's the reality.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  They will happily take your money to fund birth clinics in Uganda while telling you not to
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]  breed.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:14.240]  They'll happily tell you that you as a Christian are meant to accept Muslims whose God tells
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.240]  them to hate you and to relentlessly hate you and never to stop hating you.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.240]  Well, they're trying to get everybody to turn off their live force and we'll play some
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240]  of these clips when we come back.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.240]  This guy came out and said, get the Jews, get the Christians, get everybody.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.240]  And then our media ran it and said, oh, the black leader checks Trump.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.240]  Nobody's killing whites.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.240]  Nobody wants their land.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.240]  And in the very video they play, he says, we're going to get your land.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.240]  I mean, it is just these fact checkers are unbelievable.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:48.240]  Fact checking is the biggest joke on the planet when it's run by George Soros and the rest
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.240]  of these people.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.240]  We'll be right back infowars.com, newswars.com.

[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:26.240]  One of the main leaders of the Africana farmers, Simon Roche, where he thinks this is all
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.240]  ending, who's behind it.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.240]  I've got several of these clips I want to play as well, but I want to ask him right now.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:33.240]  Where does this end?
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.240]  Because I had you on last year, I had you on this year and they had Media Matters and
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.240]  mainstream corporate media say, Jones is insane.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.240]  He's got a farmer on claiming they're killing whites, why no one ever kills whites.
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.240]  And they fire reporters that report on that here in the U.S.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.240]  They say, oh, no one's trying to take land when the president, the vice president and
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.240]  the defense minister are saying, we're not going to take your land, we're going to kill you.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.240]  And then when whites try to leave, they tell Australia, don't take those races, they stay here.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.240]  So just describe where you think this is going.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.240]  We believe that it's going to end in a crisis of epic proportions.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.240]  We believe that this situation is intractable.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:20.240]  That doesn't stop us from being decent, respectable, God fearing, hardworking, tax-paying people.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.240]  But it's one thing to be law abiding.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.240]  It's another thing to be foolish.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:32.240]  And we believe if we examine the trajectory of our state, that it is going to end in a collision,
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.240]  we believe that there will be a civil war in this country.
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.240]  If there's not, the world can laugh at us forever.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:45.240]  Our friends, our family and so on can mock us and shun us until the days of our deaths.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:49.240]  But so far, we've been right every step of the way.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.240]  We have never, ever made any error in our predictions because they're obvious conspicuous predictions.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:57.240]  We said that they would take the land.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.240]  We said that they would disempower us.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.240]  We said that they would take our weapons away as they shut down the commando system,
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:09.240]  or as they asked for weapons to be given in, handed in for free in the year 2000.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:18.240]  At the same time, they destroyed 199,000 weapons in the hands of the commando system
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.240]  that protected the farmers and destroyed only 6,000 of the 2 million acknowledged weapons
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.240]  that the African National Congress brought into the country illegally.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:31.240]  What does that tell you?
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.240]  They are trying to disempower us.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.240]  They don't want us to have weapons.
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:38.240]  They don't want us to have a commando system to protect the farmers.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.240]  For what? What could be the reason?
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.240]  We believe that this is one giant, enormous setup.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:45.240]  If we end up being wrong, fine.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:47.240]  In the meantime, we will pay our tax...
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.240]  Yeah, but they're not wrong.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.240]  I mean, the commies are all saying they're going to kill you.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.240]  This just happened in country after country in Africa.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.240]  This is the blueprint because the establishment wants to come in and loot everything.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:59.240]  Let's go ahead and get into this individual that our media is saying,
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:02.240]  check Trump, and he basically says stuff even worse.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:04.240]  Now, let's talk about Julius.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.240]  Tell us about this guy.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.240]  Julius Malema is the head of the Economic Freedom Fighters Party.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:16.240]  He is the former head of the African National Congress's very, very ferocious youth league.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:22.240]  He is the guy who famously said on the, I believe it was the 6th of November 2016,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.240]  I'm not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:31.240]  He has subsequently said that his mission in life is to cut the throat of whiteness.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.240]  And he is the main agitator behind the taking of the land.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:40.240]  He has also warned farmers that he is going to have no mercy on them.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240]  That's right.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:44.240]  And then we got, we were told to worship Nelson Mandela.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.240]  He was the total front of the globalists we know.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:50.240]  His wife literally hung tires over little kid's heads, black and white.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.240]  And that's another thing.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:56.240]  Well, the numbers of the black on black crime by these groups is incredible.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.240]  It's phenomenal, Alex.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:01.240]  You know, that's one of the main arguments of the main screen.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.240]  They all say, well, blacks are also being killed.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.240]  That's fine, but we don't want to be killed.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.240]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.240]  You know, the government released statistics on farm murders on the 4th of May this year,
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.240]  or the first time in seven years.
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:20.240]  The fact that they hadn't released them for seven years should tell you something.
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.240]  That should be enough.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.240]  We shouldn't have to say any more than that.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.240]  Yeah, what do you make of US commentators joking, saying big deal if you get killed
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240]  or only a few of you have been killed?
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.240]  What's the real numbers?
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:35.240]  The real numbers are difficult to tell, but the minimum possible rate,
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.240]  if you take the statistics and you do simple arithmetic,
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:45.240]  the minimum possible rate is 97 farmers per 100,000 per annum.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:51.240]  Compare that to a murder rate in the USA of about 4.88 per 100,000,
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.240]  a national murder rate in South Africa of about 34 per 100,000.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:00.240]  But I would say to you that the murder rates of farmers,
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.240]  given that these statistics are slightly murky,
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:07.240]  they've tried very hard not to be explicit.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.240]  If we give them the benefit of the doubt,
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.240]  if we say that some of the people murdered on the farms are farm workers,
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:17.240]  one or two here or there, if we give them every benefit of the doubt,
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:20.240]  we would say that the murder rate of farmers,
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.240]  according to the statistics produced by the South African government,
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:29.240]  not by us, is 169 per 100,000.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.240]  If that's not enough for the New York Times and for MSNBC
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:36.240]  and for the rest, may it be on their heads?
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:37.240]  Well, they love it.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.240]  They work for Soros, so they don't carry a Nazi collaborator.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.240]  They love it.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:43.240]  They've watched all these evil wars that run the whole thing.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:47.240]  Let's go to Julius Malema with a few of his clips. Here it is.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.240]  We must be prepared for Donald Trump and all of them.
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.240]  We're not scared of them.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:56.240]  We remain unshaken.
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.240]  Actually, we are more determined after the Donald Trump tweet
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.240]  to expropriate our land without compensation.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.240]  There's no white genocide here.
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:12.240]  It's an absolute rubbish to say there is white genocide.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.240]  There is black genocide in the USA.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.240]  They are killing black people in the USA.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:22.240]  There is black genocide here in South Africa.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:25.240]  Black people are being killed all the time.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:29.240]  A farmer has been sentenced to life now recently
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:31.240]  for having killed a farm worker.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:36.240]  Imagine if it was a black person sent live for having killed a white person.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.240]  It will be news all over, but this black person was killed
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:45.240]  and a white farmer sent to prison for long time in jail.
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:48.240]  It's once off reporting and it's done.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:55.240]  There's no scientific evidence that points to any white genocide in South Africa.
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:57.240]  It's not true.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.240]  And we're not scared of such things.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:03.240]  We're not going to be distracted by anyone.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:06.240]  Only death will stop us.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:11.240]  Not Trump, not poverty, not sanctions.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.240]  We have all of them in our mind.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:17.240]  We know the consequences of what we're asking.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.240]  Yeah, another failed state.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.240]  And so here's the EFF leaders.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.240]  I watched the whole segment of the club.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.240]  Here's the club.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.240]  Well, there's crazy about Jews are training a group of right-wing people
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:31.240]  to kill them when they're all over saying we're going to kill you
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:33.240]  and take your land. Here it is.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:39.240]  There's a group of white right-wingers who are being trained by Jews
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:43.240]  in Pretoria to be snipers.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:46.240]  Snipers.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.240]  They are not training guns.
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:52.240]  In the EFF, we are training, uh, uh, try guns.
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.240]  They're dealing with real stuff.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]  All right, let's stop there.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.240]  Now, let's go back to the full seven-minute press conference.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240]  He did this yesterday.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.240]  Here he is talking about the EU, Trump.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.240]  They're all coming down here.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.240]  I mean, all coming down there.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:08.240]  It's the big banks and corporations want Africa to fail
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.240]  because they come in with private contractors,
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.240]  just rope off what they want.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.240]  They don't want Africa that's got 60%,
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:19.240]  60% of the world's good fields to be the breadbasket of the world.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:20.240]  I want to develop Africa.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.240]  I want Africa to be happy and fun.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.240]  I want Africa to be civilized.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.240]  But the whole globalist plans and Cecil Rose
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:28.240]  is to not let it develop.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.240]  Here he is breaking it down.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.240]  So why are you shocked?
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.240]  I see leaders of the EFF,
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.240]  and everybody responding to Donald Trump.
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.240]  I don't have time for nonsense.
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.240]  I expected this.
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:13.240]  And more, black lives is going to come.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.240]  If South Africans are not ready to expropriate the land
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.240]  because they are scared of sanctions,
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.240]  they are scared of black lives,
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.240]  then don't vote for the EFF.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.240]  Because you vote for us, we are going to expropriate land.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:32.240]  And Donald Trump will come for us.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.240]  And Britain will come for us.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:38.240]  And the EU will come for us.
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:42.240]  I said and I said this throughout my life in the movement
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:49.240]  that for everything good comes the pain before.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:54.240]  If you are not prepared, South Africa, to take the pain.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:57.240]  So he goes on, just like Venezuela and North Korea failed.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:00.240]  He's even getting ready for decades of him to extract billions out.
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.240]  And I guess he'll have 25 Ferraris or whatever.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.240]  We're going to come back to you five or minutes with our guest.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:06.240]  But this is just insane.
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:11.240]  It's the big megabanks that funded the takedown of South Africa
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:13.240]  and got rid of one bad system, brought in something worse.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:14.240]  It's all on record.
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:16.240]  And this is their plan here in America,
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.240]  and they're playing everywhere.
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.240]  Just briefly, importstore.com, importslife.com.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.240]  I get so busy, I don't plug for the whole hour.

[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.240]  And beyond way, beyond spirulina, it's bone broth
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.240]  with a bunch of other key ingredients.

[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.240]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:08.240]  over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula

[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.240]  and from seeing my friends and family use it
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.240]  that this new product is going to end up being

[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:54.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:06.240]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:13.240]  So Simon Roche, one of the main leaders of the leader over in South Africa
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:17.240]  predicting the land seizure because they said they'd do it in the murder of white farmers
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.240]  and as he said they had a vote and the majority of blacks said no.
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:25.240]  We love the white farmers, we work with them, they work with us, we're good but it's that communist group
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:30.240]  that's also we know double the population last 20 years bringing in folks from northern Africa
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.240]  who then promised all these goodies. So in the five minutes we have left Simon
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.240]  it's just an amazing time to see Trump stand up against this and our own media demonize it
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:41.240]  the British government say yeah we support Taken Land. What's really behind this
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:44.240]  and what are other key points you'd like to add?
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:51.240]  Well we'd like to thank President Trump for what he did. It is much appreciated by our people.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.240]  We thank you for the work that you're doing Alex. We ask people to support us please.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:03.240]  Please support us, go to our website, donate via PayPal, help us to continue to fight the good fight.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:11.240]  We are fighting the good fight not just on behalf of our people but on behalf of our people all over the world.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:17.240]  Please help us to do this. We are a last bastion and we need your support.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:22.240]  This thing is going to turn nasty. The people are positioning themselves.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:28.240]  The various centers of power are clearly positioning themselves for a conflict.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:36.240]  You only have to look at the material and we think it's going to get very very rough very soon.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:42.240]  Because there's this conquest attitude just looted all now run off with the money and there's nothing there.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:50.240]  Why do you think every African country that's kicked the Europeans out has collapsed back into the dust?
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:02:00.240]  Oh Alex that's a very difficult subject but there is a naive silly foolish people will tell you they'll never do this
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.240]  because they don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg and then they do it.
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.240]  And then whites will say but they'll never do that because they don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.240]  They don't care about the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.240]  What they want is absolute power for themselves all of the time.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:23.240]  They'd rather have a hundred percent of ten than ten percent of a million or a billion or a trillion.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:28.240]  The point is that I am the big man. I want all of the power for myself.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.240]  I want everything that exists for myself and I want no rivals.
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:37.240]  It is a bit like Mambutu says his echo of Zaire who changed his name when he assumed power
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:46.240]  and the translation of his name that everybody knows is the cockerel to whom all the hens in the henhouse belong.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:50.240]  He changed his name when he took power in Zaire to that name.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.240]  He changed his name to the head rooster.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:02.240]  The head rooster and he famously would sleep with the wives of the men that he appointed to positions of power
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.240]  and that's what this is about.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.240]  They don't care how much destruction there is.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.240]  They don't care if people are wiped out.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.240]  The point is to gain as much power as possible.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:19.240]  It is a Marxism of a particular type and it is being supported by the globalists
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.240]  because the globalists know that when this crisis occurs somebody's going to have to run the mines
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.240]  and somebody's going to have to exploit the minerals and so on and so forth
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:31.240]  and they will position themselves to take care of that naturally.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.240]  They can't lose.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:35.240]  In fact, it's in their interest to sponsor.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.240]  They use a society that's trying to be Christian and open and uplifting to get control
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.240]  and they blow everything out and sit there in armored fortresses.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.240]  No one else has electricity like Shilchescu.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:45.240]  They have everything.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  They're helicopters.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.240]  Everything.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.240]  They just come extracted.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.240]  It's a big joke and you read about the stuff that's going on in Africa.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.240]  It's so sad.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.240]  And then the American left all backs up behind it.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:00.240]  Not because they're dumb, but because they work for the big corporations that are actually going to do it.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.240]  It's amazing.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:04.240]  Simon Roche, we've got 30 seconds.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:05.240]  Anything else?
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:10.240]  Well, I'd just like to say people should keep their eyes on this matter.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:12.240]  Keep focused on it.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.240]  Our leader, Mr. Gustav Miller, has been unerringly correct on this stuff.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.240]  He's a bit like you, Alex.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.240]  He looks at the facts, not at the fiction.
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.240]  He looks at what's really happening on the ground rather than what people are told to believe.
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.240]  You know, the kind of thing of who you're going to believe, me or your lying eyes.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.240]  Please keep watching, keep watching people.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.240]  You will see for yourselves what is transpiring in this country.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:40.240]  And it's a prelude to what the left wants to do here and what they're openly teaching and pushing.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  God bless you, Simon Roche.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]  We'll talk to you very, very soon.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:44.240]  And thank you so much.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.240]  God bless you.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.240]  We may see some reporters out there to actually get a front-line view of this.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.240]  All right, we'll be back with another special guest.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.240]  Whatever you do, spread those live links.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:05:17.240]  That's where it gets around the sensors.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:27.240]  Which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:34.240]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:38.240]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:49.240]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:55.240]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:19.240]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive, but if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you.
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:26.240]  And the information you find could be life-changing. He predicted 9-11.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:32.240]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin lad who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:34.240]  And this were welly and phony system.
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:42.240]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony in bohemian grove.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:53.240]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalist prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:57.240]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg group at all.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:01.240]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:13.240]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the communist Chinese and Silicon Valley. They falsely edited him.
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:23.240]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook. They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:34.240]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple and Google. Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.240]  And then we get it. Say you no longer use our software.
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:41.240]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:44.240]  We just got taken down by YouTube. They just killed our stream.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:45.240]  Really?
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:46.240]  Yep.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:54.240]  Some Americans are actually celebrating this. This is America in 2018.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:02.240]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:09.240]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded? Will you sit and do nothing?
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:16.240]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth and stand for freedom?
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:26.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:52.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:58.240]  And we're back live now into the third hour, ladies and gentlemen. I'll be hosting some of the fourth hour as well.
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:06.240]  Notice the whole Russiagate situation. There's no Russiagate. There's no Russians unless you're looking at Mueller and Hillary and the rest of them.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:16.240]  Now it's moved into taxi cab companies and people that work for Trump and them going over all their taxes and trying to find something to get them to then say bad things about the president.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:22.240]  This is the attempt to steal the election in front of everybody. But I've been wanting to get this fellow on for months.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:29.240]  It's an interesting story because it's newsworthy, but it's also a way to support the broadcast.
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:34.240]  Because I was talking to some of my family and I was saying, man, you sure look a lot younger.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:41.240]  And I said, what have you been doing? And they said specifically, and I'm not a big, you know, metrosexual type guy.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:49.240]  I'm not into creams and stuff from my face. But when I do do it, it's amazing. And I should do it all the time because it works so well.
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:56.240]  And so I wanted to get him on because his products and what he's doing are so much different than other products I've seen.
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:01.240]  And that's Dr. Vincent Jam Papa, who's joining us for much of the hour.
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.240]  Last segment, I'll get into a bunch of other news that we haven't gotten to yet on the geopolitical front.
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:13.240]  But he is a board certified plastic and reconstructive surgery, anti-aging medicine and founding director of Plastic Surgery Center International.
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:24.240]  Everybody knows about that. The Jam Papa Institute for Anti-Aging Medical Therapy and the Regenerative Medicine Institute located in Costa Rica.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:32.240]  And he joins us. He's on Twitter at Dr. Jam Papa. That's D-R-G-I-A-M-P-A-P-A.
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:40.240]  He's on with this because I was talking to family about a year and a half ago and they were telling me,
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:44.240]  oh, man, this stuff's really great. I put it under my eyes and my bags are gone.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.240]  And then I was talking to George Dory about six months ago and he was saying, man, this stuff's really great.
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:52.240]  You ought to, you know, try to get them to be a sponsor.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.240]  And I said, yeah, I've actually heard of that. I feel like an airplane magazine. You name it.
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:05.240]  So, yes, it's a sponsor to help fund the broadcast. But separate from that, ladies and gentlemen, you know, the big reason he's here and the big reason he's joining us
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:17.240]  is to just go over the facts and go over the science and go over the medicine here for everybody today and talk about really these different missing links that are unfolding.
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:24.240]  So, doctor, thanks for coming on with us. Why don't you just tell the listeners some about yourself and your awakening
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:29.240]  from all the medical doctor stuff you've done, what got you into what you're doing the last few years,
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:37.240]  because I know it's like number one in areas of Europe and Asia, but just now what you're doing is starting to hit here in the United States.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:42.240]  Sure. It's my pleasure and it's a pleasure to be on here with you to share this information.
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:48.240]  As a board certified plastic surgeon and an anti-aging physician, you know, one of the things people ask me is,
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:59.240]  well, you're a plastic surgeon, how did you get into the anti-aging field? And in general, we as plastic surgeons were the first group of physicians anywhere to transplant tissue
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:07.240]  and to understand what was the underlying biology behind why cells grow and certain people, people healed well, other people didn't,
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:16.240]  and why people grew older quicker than other people. So about 20 years ago, my focus started to turn to what causes people to age
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:25.240]  or not heal well, and eventually that turned into research looking at stem cells, which we really didn't know existed up until about 10 years ago.
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:35.240]  And that turned into, four years ago, some Nobel Prize nominations for both myself and the team in researching how does cells grow old
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:45.240]  and how could we reverse cellular aging. And eventually all of this turned into a look at what could we bring to improve the quality of lives
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:52.240]  of people in general at a very reasonable price point that really would make a difference in how they age and how they feel and look.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:13:03.240]  So with that came the research about an oral product that is now being sold globally, and that product is a very interesting oral product that's taken twice a day
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:12.240]  that actually is not a vitamin mineral supplement, but is actually one of the first products using virtually all natural ingredients
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:20.240]  that can actually change the genes in both our stem cells and body cells to either make them more active or less active based upon
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:28.240]  what we really feel is the state of the art in cellular aging. So those ingredients have actually been taken from nature,
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:37.240]  which is where we as humans evolved from over the last half a million years, and we've actually now started to understand how cells age based upon
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:45.240]  what we eat, what's included in our diet, and what those individual ingredients can actually do to both our stem cells and body cells.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:51.240]  And that's how I can catch this summary of what's brought us up to where we are at this point in time.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:14:00.240]  Well, we've launched the website with your products, infowarsys.com. That's infowarsys.com.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:08.240]  So folks can go get all your products, get the great products, support what you're doing, support what we're doing, help funder operation to reach out,
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:14.240]  make America successful and everything. But I got to tell you, I'm going to do some videos where I'm going to do it live,
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.240]  where I'm going to put just the product under my eyes, which I've done about a week so I can do this, and then show people in literally
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:26.240]  20 minutes what it does. That's just one of your products. And then you've got your AM, PM, and we do a lot of our own supplements
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:31.240]  and research. We know how cutting edge your stuff is, obviously, and I haven't brought in other sponsors.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.240]  Of course, you're not even paying me. I'm going to sell your products. We haven't brought in other partners in the last five, six years,
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:44.240]  because I haven't found anything that is up to that level. But I mean, I'm just so impressed. But I think from research and talking to suppliers,
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:52.240]  it's that you put a lot of product in the product. So many people simply do hype, but then don't actually put the expensive product into it,
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.240]  because the average supplement is what marked up seven times. Now, look at your supplements, what, maybe 100, 150 times,
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.240]  which is very, very low to be able to do what you do, put the ingredients in, and then fund your world-class organization.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:10.240]  So, I mean, you really mesh with our philosophy of, you know, really giving people high quality ingredients so they get a great response.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:16.240]  The website's infowarsyes.com will put that URL on screen for folks.
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:27.240]  Yeah, so if I can make another comment, these products are being produced by Junes Global, and they're a family of products that have been designed to work in synergy with each other.
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  Unlike many other companies that create products with individual different kind of, for instance, disease process or skin or this or whatever,
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  if these products are all designed to work in synergy, so as you take one and another and another, you notice that the actual impact and how you're feeling
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:55.240]  and how you actually look and feel or remember things is dramatically better.
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:16:06.240]  Let's talk tough. Let's talk comfort. Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue james like you wore as a kid.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:15.240]  Remember, there's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:23.240]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:28.240]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:37.240]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:42.240]  Every stitch guaranteed and our Defender motorcycle gene comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:49.240]  See them at gusset.com or call 888-848-7738.
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:54.240]  That's 888-848-7738. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:59.240]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:04.240]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:09.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:16.240]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:31.240]  And now because of their intensifying censorship it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:38.240]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:45.240]  Now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:52.240]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:19:07.240]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:19.240]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:31.240]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:46.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:56.240]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield.
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:29.240]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:47.240]  Doctor, medical doctor, Vincent, Jan Papa is our guest and the top surgeons out there were the top plastic surgeons in the world. You can see right there if you're looking at my little iPhone, infowarsyes.com, infowarsyes.com.
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:21:02.240]  That's where you go if you want to get big discounts on the full spectrum of their products. That's where you go if you want to support the broadcast and support yourself. Believe me, people don't in five years haven't had another supplement or personal wellness company here.
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:18.240]  It's just been my own products, but these are so good and I've heard about it from family and then from George Norrie and others that I had to get involved. Infowarsyes.com to go look all of this up and it is extremely, extremely exciting.
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:35.240]  We appreciate the founder of it joining us and there's some amazing graphics too that I remember one month ago and I wanted to get you on. I was going to have for the show that are also on the side of it. Just scroll down where it shows all the different things for the body and all the different ways.
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:54.240]  And then I've done our own research with our own top people, scientists you name it, just everything from your energy drinks to your AMPM, to your ZIN, to reserve, to luminescence. I mean this is a big plug for folks to go to infowarsyes.com and get these products.
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:22:12.240]  And also, everybody knows I don't sit there and promote, I've been pitched hundreds of MLM companies. This is not an MLM company, but they also have a business model where if you want to be a distributor of it where you can also then obviously people you get signed up who sell, take part in that.
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:19.240]  That's just a classic business model. There's also an opportunity link there when you go to infowarsyes.com.
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:28.240]  So again, doctor, let's just get right into it because I already know your products are the very best out there and they're so exciting.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:39.240]  What should we start with the AMPM, the skin cream, the eye cream? I learned about you again over a year ago from skin cream that I forgot about it and George Norrie told me about it and somebody else on the street told me about it.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:52.240]  Then when I was about to set you up for a guest, I had the producer go, oh my God, I already used that. It's the best stuff out there. I mean, for people who don't know, you're already a world leader in a very short time because, again, you put quality ingredients in.
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:23:02.240]  So, yeah, Alex, I think one of the most important things is to understand that human beings, we're made up of cells, right? There's 100 trillion cells that make up the human body.
[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:12.240]  And in our research, we were studying about how can we, if we could figure out how to make just one cell work better, we could use the concepts to make all those 100 trillion cells work better.
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:23.240]  So AMPM is a foundation product. What it does is it actually impacts both our body cells and our stem cells. So let me very briefly describe what stem cells are.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:32.240]  Because stem cells are our regenerative potential cells we all have, and they're the ones that go to and fix our body cells as they're damaged or as we age.
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:41.240]  And one of the key things is we all are born with a fixed number of stem cells, and that number declines each year, kind of like the gas in your tank or your car.
[02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:47.240]  As you drive that car, you lose gas up, and the quality of that gas also gets worse as you get to the bottom of the tank.
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:24:00.240]  So AMPM was designed to help maintain the regenerative potential in your body and then also help maintain the body cells that make up your organs, your skin, your hair, your tissues.
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:10.240]  And by taking this compound, this is the first compound that really focuses on both regenerative potential and ongoing function of your body organs in general.
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:21.240]  And it's based on a whole new technique or concept, which is way beyond vitamins and minerals. It's the whole new science of turning gene switches on and off.
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:28.240]  And one of the questions I get frequently is, well, how do you know what ingredients to choose or what ingredients to put in a product like this?
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:32.240]  It has 92 different compounds in it.
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:40.240]  Well, what we do is we've designed a software program that actually takes into account the latest information genetically and cellular aging.
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:56.240]  And then if we know what genes need to be altered up or down to help make your cells work more useful, more optimal, what we do is put that gene information in a software program that searches 300,000 databases over a number of hours,
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:10.240]  comes back with the latest research on natural ingredients that have been documented, proven to show that these compounds are effective at actually changing what genes we would like to alter as far as function goes.
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:19.240]  We're not removing genes or putting new genes in. We're actually making genes work better or worse, which is what happens in our body on a natural basis anyway.
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:31.240]  So this product has not only been designed to do that and been out on the market for a number of years, it has actually impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for the dramatically better.
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:37.240]  They sleep better. They feel better. They look better. They don't get as thick as often. Their skin quality improves.
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:48.240]  So this is a product that works from the inside, the most intimate component of our bodies or cells outward. And then the other products that are in the Junaise wine work from the outside in.
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:59.240]  And that's the topical syringe and creams that you had mentioned earlier. And they also are designed to use key compounds that are normally produced by our stem cells.
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:14.240]  Those are packets of DNA, RNA specific proteins that work on the skin surface, get into the skin and in conjunction or synergy with products like AMPM or the other oral products like reserve or mind.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:26.240]  What we find out is that this combination of working from the inside out and working in synergy with each other has changed the nutritional industry and wellness industry dramatically.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:34.240]  Well, all I know is we've got a great new tropic brain force. I notice we have some of the same ingredients you have, but you have some others and it's liquid that we don't have.
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:44.240]  And I'll just tell you point blank. This is next level and a lot of people drink it straight up, but I like to put it on top ice and then and then and then just put water on top of it.
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:52.240]  I'm going to get some water in here during the break. But I mean, quite frankly, I don't care how my eyes look. I'm like one of those guys that kind of likes my crow's feet.
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:58.240]  But your stuff really does wonders. My wife bought me other stuff that doesn't, you know, get rid of it when I use it for a week like yours does.
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:08.240]  But but but but mind this big old box of what I've got here. This is something as much as I work sometimes 18 hours a day that I am so incredibly excited about.
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:22.240]  So spend a few minutes talking about mind that folks can get at info wars dot com or info wars, why es dot com. That's info wars, why es dot com. And again, they get a great product for them and their family and it supports the info war.
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:30.240]  People could sign up and become distributors. I know get discounts. I know you're not on about that today, doctor. You're just the scientist behind it all. But it's just all exciting. Tell us about mind.
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:45.240]  Sure. Now, first of all, one of the things I want to bring up is that there's many tablets and caps on the market. One of the reasons mind is in a jail is because the new jail delivery systems make such a difference in efficacy and those making those active ingredients,
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:58.240]  helping them be absorbed through the intestinal lining. So when you especially if we're getting older and I'll bring this point up because as we get older, it's harder to absorb nutrients or ingredients from caps and tablets.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:10.240]  Because our intestines age to so with gel delivery systems, one of the most important thing is that the ingredients that we actually use are able to be delivered to the body.
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:20.240]  Okay, so that the body can make use of them for whatever purpose they need. So let me give you an example of what some of the things that mind has been designed to do.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:36.240]  Okay, so we know that the average person has at least 70,000 thoughts per day. Okay, and we also know that the short term memory for most patients or people is approximately seven items for 20 seconds.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:45.240]  Let's explain that when we come back because yeah, as I've gotten older, my brain still works really good. But once I've had too many thoughts in that day, I get to a point where I can't make the calculations anymore.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:54.240]  And that's what you're getting at. So how do you extend that will be right back with Dr. Vincent Jam Papa straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:24.240]  Call 834-NO-TAX or go to my website danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com danpilla.com.

[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:36.240]  Dr. Vincent Jampapa is one of the top, I mean, looking up, oral surgeons in the world, you've seen all over television, you name it, but he's developed a line of body and brain products and you name it that are incredible.
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:47.240]  Now, I was just talking to one of my crew members who's already a person that said, listen, you're supposed to just take the gel like gogurt. You know, when you're talking about mind from Genoese, and I'm like, yeah, but I like to mix it with water.
[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:59.240]  So let me just ask you, doctor, when I'm taking mind that I think my favorite product of yours, everything else is great. Is it wrong that I'm putting it in water? Is that denatured or is that good or bad?
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:08.240]  No, it's perfectly fine to do that. I mean, I'll forget when you put it into your intestines and stomach, you're basically mixing it with a gas fluid and water anyway, diluting it.
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:15.240]  So if anything, it's not going to hurt it. It might even help a little bit with absorption as well. And frankly, we all need to drink more water anyway.
[02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:24.240]  So I think that's a great thing to do. And it's a great refreshing drink. And you're just sharper mentally for a good chunk of the day after that.
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:29.240]  How did you launch Genoese? Because I mean, again, all the products are incredible.
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:39.240]  So first of all, Genoese is a product, is a company that I've been involved as a medical spokesperson and one of the key advisors for product development.
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:45.240]  And the family who launched Genoese has been very successful in this type of business in the past.
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:55.240]  They've done a phenomenal job doing over $1.2 billion in revenue the past year and growing logarithmically every year.
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:35:06.240]  So this company is about the truth in science, about real credible science, but also about focusing on not just helping people live a longer, better life.
[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:17.240]  Genoese, the company itself puts a good chunk of money back into building schools and their whole, for children all over the world, donating money to help the quality of young people.
[02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:25.240]  But more importantly, it's about creating products that work at real, have a real science base behind them.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:36.240]  Now, we've talked about Mind. We've also talked about AMPM. I want to get back into that a little bit more. They're all available again, discounted out of the gates at infowarsyes.com.
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:47.240]  And then a part of the purchase you make funds or operation, which everybody knows is so critical. But again, five years, you've heard the network and other local stations have their sponsors, and that's great.
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:58.240]  Five years since I've had an outside sponsor for supplements or products like this, and I just kept hearing about it from family, friends, George Norrie, who's just about to get involved in it as well.
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:07.240]  And that's why I'm bringing it to you because I started taking it, whether it's the skin cream or whether it's the AMPM or whether it's the mind.
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:19.240]  And I'm like, wow, this is the only thing out there as good as infowarslife.com. And I'll say, I mean, quite frankly, before I even launched all this, I've been proprietary looking and our research shows this is the very best stuff out there.
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:29.240]  The problem is with manufacturers and stuff to get what's in it and to actually get the factories to make it right and to do it. I don't get anything proprietary, but I know from dealing with it.
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  This is not easy to put products out this good. That's why people cut the corners. I mean, is that an accurate statement, doctor?
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:46.240]  That's absolutely accurate. And so let me make a comment about that. You see, it's not only the ingredients, it's the delivery system. It's how we get those ingredients into your body to be functional.
[02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:51.240]  Again, it breaks down over time. So exactly how do you keep it good in the package till delivery?
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:37:11.240]  Well, again, packages, for instance, are minors, sealed in a certain fashion, they're vacuum packed, and the capsules on the tablets for AMPM have a special coating on them that keeps them from absorbing any moisture, but also they've been designed to be released inside in your body based on the pH they're exposed to.
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:28.240]  So the technology in manufacturing goes way beyond what other companies even know about. So you're looking at a combination of science, technology, manufacturing that result in a product that gets such tremendous impact on the purpose that's been designed to do.
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:39.240]  Well, I'm excited about it. And again, I mean, five years, nobody else we've had on the show, but it's so good. Let's talk about that whole spectrum of people on the radio.
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:48.240]  They want to go to M4Wars.com and link through. We have some banners up today, but also M4WarsYes.com and then they can go there and actually see that map.
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:52.240]  You've got that 360 map of the other products. Let's talk about some of the others.
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:58.240]  Sure. Absolutely. For instance, the product called Reserve is also in a gel delivery system now.
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:17.240]  Reserve has been designed to do something very, very special. I don't know of any of the products that even do this. And that only has antioxidants, very concentrated, very extraxter, you know, the nutritional value and for self protection, but it has a special form of a resveratrol.
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:29.240]  The research we've been doing at different major universities show that as we age, we not only lose our stem cells or body cells, but we create bad cells called senescent cells.
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:38.240]  Now, those cells aren't dividing. They aren't doing anything except for creating, if you will, bad compounds that cause our healthy cells to age even more quickly.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:51.240]  So that has a special resveratrol compound that helps turn down the gene or ratchet down the effect of those genes that actually cause these dying or senescent cells, which is a big, big help.
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:59.240]  So we're looking at, and then the other products work. For instance, AMP is your general cellular revitalization product.
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:14.240]  AMP is something that we all know, really all of us, especially as professionals, we have to digest a lot of information in this digital age, helps dramatically with short-term memory, long-term memory, digital recall, symbol recall, word recall.
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:27.240]  We need this in today's 21st century rapid world. Then we look at things topically, for instance, the luminous product line has been designed to use, again, the latest science in stem cell technology.
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:42.240]  That is the packets of DNA, RNA, and particularly growth factors and these things we call cytokines that can stimulate the stem cells that are asleep in our skin to wake them up and to start making more collagen in the last...
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:51.240]  So to be clear, instead of some artificial chemical that manipulate short-term, you're just giving the body the building blocks it already needed or the trigger for it was already in you.
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:57.240]  Exactly. In fact, these are things our bodies make when they're young, but they don't continue to make while we're older.
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:09.240]  So what we've learned is to mimic what naturally occurs in our bodies and use that in the products rather than putting artificial ingredients and compounds in that in the long run, we don't know for sure what they'll do for us.
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:15.240]  All right. Everybody knows that I've been offered, when I say hundreds, probably 500 or more multi-level marketing things.
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:25.240]  And I've never gotten involved except with one because they had good products and that wasn't their main business. That was just if people want to be distributors, they want to sign up others and get good products to people and a good stable model.
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:32.240]  It's good. Then it's a great business model. That's a classic business model. You have managers under you and they sell and then you sign them on and then you make some money.
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:39.240]  But I do want, even though you didn't come on today to talk about this, if you go to infowars.com, there's an opportunity button.
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:49.240]  Last time I got involved in one of these operations, it went from 14 million to 30 something million to 80 million within just three years that I was involved in.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:58.240]  And everybody admits that I launched it and took it to a top deal. You guys are already in the top five, six internationally for whatever reason, though it's from the U.S.
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:11.240]  I've noticed when I researched it last year, it took over a year to decide to do this and you can attest to that, that now it's just about to ramp up here and then just be a great stable product for, I think, 50, 60 years in the future.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:18.240]  But I believe you're already in the top five, six worldwide of these type of businesses. I think you're going to go to number one because the products are so good.
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:26.240]  That's why everybody knows I've stayed out of the Bitcoin. I've stayed out of all that because it's speculative. A lot of it's great, but I couldn't tell you that it's a sure thing.
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  This at a gut level and a research and a business level, I believe going to infowarsys.com and getting involved with Janesh, I believe, is one of the smartest bets out there.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:41.240]  And so I would tell people, I think you should get involved in this as a business, not this as a product. What do you think, doctor?
[02:41:41.240 --> 02:41:55.240]  Well, you know what, Alice, I have to agree with you because when I speak about the products and the science behind Janesh, I tell everyone, you know, there's very few businesses you can get into where the business helps you stay healthier
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:02.240]  and more functional. And every person you meet, you have an opportunity to change their lives for the better.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:13.240]  So to me, this is one of the most amazing opportunities to not only make a great living, but to live a healthier life and to impact positively the lives of everybody around.
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:18.240]  And to feel great about what you're selling. Again, why don't I do this? Because the products aren't good enough.
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:25.240]  I finally found a product that I'm not selling that is just good or better than some of the products I'm selling. And I hate to say that, but I mean, you've knocked it out of the park.
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:33.240]  I mean, this is next level, man. I take mind and it is just there's nothing else like it. And I know you're not really pitching mind here. You're into the AMPM.
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:40.240]  I've taken it. It's great. You know, the skincare products, my wife is just insane about them. She goes and buys this expensive stuff at these, you know, salons.
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:50.240]  Here's a third the price. It is better out of the park info wars. Yes.com and support the info war. We'll be right back with the doctor straight ahead.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:43:02.240]  Vincent Jim Papa info wars life is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[02:46:49.240 --> 02:47:17.240]  It's so essential to spread the word again. Thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:26.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:35.240]  Dr. Vincent Jampapa is our guest. And again, listeners, you know that I've gotten rid of all the sponsors. Some are great. Some then quality goes down.
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:44.240]  I mean, I'll be honest when it comes to nutraceuticals. It's an incredible hassle. One batch of knockout will be so strong that one pill knocks me out.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:51.240]  I sleep like I'm dead and then one of the latest batches was not as strong and I'm like bitching at him saying this is, you know, but it's it's herbal.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:55.240]  It's natural. So there's no it's very hard to control it.
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:48:02.240]  But with Janesh and the products that Dr. Vincent Jampapa has produced, I first started talking to them.
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:10.240]  I said a year time flies two years ago when I had family taking it and I had crew and I just kept hearing about it.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:15.240]  You ought to do this. This is the best blah, blah, blah to do that. And then I talked to their people and then I never did it.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:25.240]  Then I and I finally just went ahead and bit the bullet. OK, because it's kind of a weird thing when you're selling your own nutraceuticals and then say, hey, here's this, but I'm a 360 winner.
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:32.240]  And so if something's really that good, info wars, yes.com.
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:42.240]  It can be lowercase, it can be lowercase just info wars, yes.com. You go there, you get the products, the lowest prices and it funds the operation.
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:48.240]  And again, the daughter didn't come on about the term they use MLM and the media, they demonize all the rest of it.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:54.240]  And a lot of those MLMs are just just total BS, but but but not not this because that's not even their model.
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:59.240]  It's the products and then if you want to sell it and want to do it, they have one of the best models out there and I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.240]  And I and I'm involved in it now. And I think it's going to blow up in the United States.
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:08.240]  That's my view of this. And I've done this one time before people have been really successful.
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:13.240]  They're very happy now years later. And so again, info wars, yes.com.
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:16.240]  One word info wars, yes.com.
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:20.240]  Few other issues that I'm going to cover after he leaves us.
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.240]  Trump sentencing of NSA leaker reality winner. So unfair.
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:29.240]  Yeah, she's a trader. Yeah, she's an SJW compared to Hillary. It's nothing. That's on info wars.com.
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:36.240]  Alexandria Cortez sides with cab drivers while campaign uses Uber exclusively.
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:42.240]  That's an info wars.com story. Just the insane hypocrisy of these people is unbelievable.
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:48.240]  But Dr. Jan Papa, just finishing up, I really appreciate your time and what you've done.
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:55.240]  You put with some amazing products here. Anything else you'd like to add for the listeners of why you guys are so special in a whole field of great products.
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:50:02.240]  There's a lot of great products out there. It's just that yours are a cut above. Again, info wars, yes.com.
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:10.240]  Why, why is Janesh with with with your research and you with the founders totalage?
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:15.240]  I mean, I was looking at numbers just four or five months ago meeting with the heads of your team.
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:20.240]  When we were developing the plan to launch this year, which I should have launched a lot earlier.
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:25.240]  It's just been tied up with all these attacks. Everyone knows that like the numbers, I don't want to say I'm wrong,
[02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:30.240]  but like almost number one in Asia or number one, already number two or three in Europe and then climbing here.
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:35.240]  Why have it started here in America? Why you got the latest numbers correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:39.240]  Why are you so much bigger in Asia and Europe and now only hitting here,
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.240]  which is a great opportunity for people that want to be distributors, not just users of it.
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:45.240]  Well, I think that's a great question.
[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:53.240]  Number one, cultures like Asia and Europe are much more receptive to the natural approach to health and aging than we are in the U.S.
[02:50:53.240 --> 02:51:02.240]  And also in the U.S., the concept of what like you mentioned, MLM has had MLM industries had not a great reputation in the past.
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:08.240]  Now, this is direct to direct selling that you know, does it sells its products on the Internet.
[02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:18.240]  But the company decided to launch out in a culture that was much more receptive to the natural approach to being health and wellness and aging.
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:25.240]  And particularly, we all know that in China, that's been a focus for thousands of years with natural compounds.
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:27.240]  And in Europe, it was much more receptive as well.
[02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:32.240]  So now that the company's been extremely well received in both of those marketplaces,
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:38.240]  the focus now is to really start to bring the information and message back home to the U.S.
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:42.240]  where science and technology is more readily accepted.
[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:46.240]  And with the science and technology behind the product development in Junez,
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:52.240]  we truly believe, the founders believe, the people who are executive people in this company believe that
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:59.240]  the science message will really take this company to the next level of where it will definitely be here in the U.S.
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:04.240]  And again, I want to be clear because I've done a year and a half of research before we did this
[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:06.240]  because I absolutely want the best product for our listeners.
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:10.240]  It's a 360 win. I mean, it's my whole operating system.
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:16.240]  You guys are already an established group of high quality, top of the line supplements, the latest developments.
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:23.240]  And then using a direct sales, that's really what it is, model so people cannot just be users, but also word of mouth.
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:25.240]  You can tell somebody something's great.
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:27.240]  Why not tell them it's great and then sign them up?
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:29.240]  You get a discount, you get a discount, and you make some money.
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:32.240]  So, I mean, it's just gut level and everything else.
[02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:36.240]  This is, I think, a business model that all of our listeners should look into.
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:39.240]  They should find out at infowarsyes.com.
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:40.240]  It's very easy.
[02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:42.240]  And again, you weren't coming on doctor.
[02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:44.240]  You're the science end and development end about this today.
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:49.240]  And usually, you know, the other time I've promoted something like this that turned out to be great as well.
[02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:54.240]  I was mainly just on the product end, but I just think up front in something like this,
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:59.240]  like you said, the invasion of America happening right now with this great product, this great product line,
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:03.240]  this is something people want to get in on the ground floor.
[02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:10.240]  Without a question, in closing, I'd like to say the line of products that are available are amazing at the moment.
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:17.240]  Stay tuned for some of the most amazing things that are going to come down in the next six months to a year from Junez,
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:22.240]  which will only add to the tremendous credibility and science behind where the company is at the moment.
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:24.240]  All right, we got a few minutes till break.
[02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:27.240]  Just just again, because I've been interrupting a lot of doctor.
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:32.240]  Again, recap the founding of the company, your involvement, why these products are so game changing.
[02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:36.240]  And and again, some of the other family of products that we haven't gotten to.
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.240]  Sure.
[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:38.240]  Sure.
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:41.240]  So the company was founded about a little over five years ago.
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:48.240]  At that time, I was approached by the founders because I was one of the founding physicians of the American Academy of Antiaging Medicine.
[02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:55.240]  My focus is on cellular aging, and they wanted to need to help create a product line,
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:59.240]  along with other physicians who are involved in product development,
[02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:05.240]  but to kind of create the whole new level of science and credibility based upon cellular aging.
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:12.240]  So at that time, I was a little hesitant because of the MLM market and the reputations.
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:19.240]  But I have to say that the founders of this company are some of the most philanthropic and humanistic,
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.240]  focused human beings I've ever met.
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:24.240]  They are phenomenal people.
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:27.240]  They are people who care about people, care about the people.
[02:54:27.240 --> 02:54:29.240]  Well, that's obvious because I'm in the business of this,
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:35.240]  and I know how hard it is to put actual ingredients in and only have 150% markup with all the other costs.
[02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:36.240]  It's very hard.
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:38.240]  Everything else is five to seven times.
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:41.240]  I know what you guys are doing, and I know the products blow me away.
[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:42.240]  So that's the proof.
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:43.240]  Like you said, they're smart.
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:47.240]  They're like, let's have something that blows them away, and then we're going to have great business.
[02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:54.240]  Anyways, I don't understand how 90% of supplements out there and nutraceuticals are literally watered down crap,
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:55.240]  and they're nothing but marketing.
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:56.240]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:01.240]  Why not give them a product that works so they buy it forever?
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:07.240]  Well, Alex, you hit right on the most important piece of information there.
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:11.240]  It's about credibility and good quality products.
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:12.240]  Well, yeah.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:19.240]  Why do people want a Mercedes versus a Ugo?
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:21.240]  Because they know a Mercedes is going to run better than a Ugo.
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:23.240]  I mean, it's because it's got quality.
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:25.240]  Why does somebody want...
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:29.240]  I don't get in the industry why there's so much flyby night stuff.
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:30.240]  I just don't get it.
[02:55:30.240 --> 02:55:35.240]  Okay, so the real issue here is when you buy a product, a nutraceutical product,
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  what makes that product successful, what makes the company successful is experiential effects.
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:46.240]  If you don't feel the difference or see the difference when you're taking a product,
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:49.240]  you're very unlikely to continue taking this.
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:55.240]  And what UNESCO has designed are products that people either feel a dramatic difference in their sleep,
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:58.240]  their energy, their skin looks better, their memories better,
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:00.240]  and it's all about experiential impact.
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:05.240]  And just like you said, so many of these other products promise to do from other companies,
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:09.240]  products promise to do things that they don't do, and you don't feel or see the difference.
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:12.240]  So that's why they're not successful.
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:14.240]  And that's why Junes is.
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:15.240]  Amazing.
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:18.240]  I want to get you in studio whenever you want to come to Austin where we can send a group to see you
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:19.240]  or I can see you.
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:21.240]  Dr. Jan Papa, great work.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:26.240]  A medical doctor, oral plastic surgeon, so many other types of surgeries you can do.
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:27.240]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:29.240]  We really appreciate you.
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:32.240]  My pleasure, Alex, and stay well and healthy.
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:33.240]  You bet.
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:35.240]  Well, I'm working an hour today and I'm under a lot of stress when I'm trying.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:37.240]  M4WarsYes.com.
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:41.240]  Folks, we fund an operation with high quality products.
[02:56:41.240 --> 02:56:47.240]  Their stuff has all blown me away at all of its so high quality from the packaging down with the ingredients.
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:51.240]  And if you buy it at M4WarsYes.com, it will help fund an operation.
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:56.240]  But I'm telling you, if you're wanting a business for women with the skin creams, the eye creams,
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:01.240]  and all the supplements and the rest of it, this stuff is going to just fly off the shelves.
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:04.240]  I can tell you, I know a winner when I see it.
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.240]  And it's just like brain force works real great.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:11.240]  Their mind product works really great.
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:13.240]  And that's what I'm looking for.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:15.240]  Something that gives you a big result.
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  And then we're able, just like our politics changes the world, our products change the world.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:22.240]  Anything I'm involved in is TNT.
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:26.240]  So M4WarsYes.com. M4WarsYes.com.
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.240]  And I want to invite everybody to go join there, come to the distributor, get big discounts,
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:32.240]  or just be a customer and try the products.

[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:12.240]  I know from using this myself the last few months and from seeing my friends and family use it

[02:58:49.240 --> 02:58:53.240]  when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:57.240]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glovelest.
[02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:01.240]  It is you, the M4Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying,
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:04.240]  that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats
[02:59:04.240 --> 02:59:06.240]  that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:10.240]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:14.240]  You are the M4War. And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:19.240]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to M4Wars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:59:19.240 --> 02:59:23.240]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us
[02:59:23.240 --> 02:59:27.240]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:27.240 --> 02:59:33.240]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the M4Wars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:59:33.240 --> 02:59:35.240]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[02:59:35.240 --> 02:59:42.240]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at m4wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.240 --> 03:00:06.240]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[03:00:13.240 --> 03:00:16.240]  Another time, another time.
[03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:21.240]  Slap the screen and read. You can tell the truth.
[03:00:21.240 --> 03:00:26.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance,
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:31.240]  live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:35.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:41.240]  Joe Gilbert's coming up in the next 50 minutes, and then you got Owen Troyer, Roger Stone, with his close of nose.
[03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:43.240]  You're not going to get anywhere else.
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:49.240]  You know, I look back every day of what we already broke, and then like a week later see it being national news,
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:54.240]  and it's just like, you know, we're not that good.
[03:00:54.240 --> 03:01:02.240]  It's that the mainstream media has all this news, but it's got to pass it up committees
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:07.240]  to be authorized to put it out later, and most of the times they wouldn't even put the truth out later
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:12.240]  if we hadn't broke it or if Drudge Report hadn't broke it.
[03:01:12.240 --> 03:01:16.240]  And that's why they want to shut down so that we can't force those stories out.
[03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:20.240]  That's why m4wars is so precious.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:25.240]  You know, Trump's now hitting on all cylinders, going after him, going after Facebook with antitrust operations,
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:27.240]  going after him for discrimination.
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:30.240]  So social media giants are silencing millions of people.
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.240]  Can't do this, even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like CNN,
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:38.240]  whose ratings have suffered gravely, and CNN policing the end of free speech.
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:39.240]  So they're even worse.
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:42.240]  They're not just fake news, they're mafia.
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:46.240]  People have to figure out what's real and what is not without censorship.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:48.240]  Yeah, it's the censors.
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:50.240]  That's the real tyranny.
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:56.240]  The stories are up on m4wars.com and newswars.com, but I mean, here's the thing.
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:00.240]  They're making their move right now, and I keep saying that, everybody knows it.
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:04.240]  But they wouldn't be doing all this censorship, and they wouldn't be doing all these attacks.
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:11.240]  They wouldn't have Silicon Valley meeting in secret today, according to BuzzFeed about how to censor the Internet.
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:14.240]  If they didn't know they were losing, so I want to be positive.
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:20.240]  And I want you to know we have the initiative we can win if people are awake, if people are involved.
[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:25.240]  The problem is, even the New York Post and the Washington Times are being censored now.
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:29.240]  Facebook censors articles from conservative outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:34.240]  They want only their official story out.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:37.240]  They're making their move, and it's organized crime.
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:43.240]  You know, you had a group of Italian Americans back when Jagra Hoover was being blackmailed by the Italian mafia.
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:48.240]  And finally, up in upstate New York, a bunch of them were meeting in a barn, and they finally got it documented.
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:50.240]  There was such a thing as La Cosa Nostra.
[03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:52.240]  Well, you've got La Cosa Nostra.
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:54.240]  You've got Tech Natrosa.
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:02.240]  You've got the thing of the big tech companies and the big banks engaging in this giant manipulation of culture and society.
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:09.240]  And it's all right here in front of you to steal the election, to prepare, to steal.
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:20.240]  This whole headline, tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare a 2018 theft of the election strategy.
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:29.240]  Or to steal the election strategy, to steal, two words, to steal, to steal.
[03:03:29.240 --> 03:03:38.240]  So this is in your face, and they have this thing where they hide it in plain view like it's no big deal.
[03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.240]  Like a jellyfish, they just come take you over, and it's amazing.
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:50.240]  And now they're in the news saying Donald Trump better shut up, and he better roll over and resign, or we'll indict his whole family.
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:53.240]  Well, we told you that was coming a few days ago.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:04:02.240]  And if that isn't dangerous thugs, I don't know what is, and if people don't have an instinct to say no to that, then we've lost our souls.
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:04.240]  As for me, I can't back down.
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:07.240]  And I sit there and I watch him attack us and try to censor us.
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:11.240]  And I see like a Daily Beast article, oh, Jones has crippled.
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:14.240]  After he was taken off YouTube.
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:19.240]  All I can do is tell you the truth, our core audience is bigger than ever.
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:23.240]  But I do, our outreach is somewhat crippled.
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:26.240]  And that's what they're really worried about is the outreach to new people.
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:28.240]  That's what really matters, right?
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:29.240]  Is waking them up to what's happening.
[03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:31.240]  They don't want us to question things.
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:34.240]  They don't want us, here in our own echo chamber, InfoWars is bigger than ever.
[03:04:34.240 --> 03:04:35.240]  Hardcore listeners, we love you.
[03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:38.240]  But tell everybody you know about the free app at infowars.com.
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:42.240]  The free podcast or send those videos, infowars.com.
[03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:45.240]  And for everybody you know, without you sending out the live audio feed,
[03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:48.240]  without you being the bridge, we're going to lose.
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:50.240]  But no, we're winning. We're winning.
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:05:19.240]  Daily Beast, we're winning.
[03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:23.240]  Remove 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:05:23.240 --> 03:05:26.240]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain,
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:30.240]  and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:32.240]  and away from you and your family.
[03:05:32.240 --> 03:05:35.240]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction,
[03:05:35.240 --> 03:05:40.240]  you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:45.240]  Head to infowars.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase
[03:05:45.240 --> 03:05:48.240]  or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems,
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:54.240]  it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[03:06:18.240 --> 03:06:34.240]  All right, Joe Gilbert's got a raft of important gas dealing with the deplatforming
[03:06:34.240 --> 03:06:37.240]  of Christians, conservatives, libertarians, pro-Israel folks, you name it.
[03:06:37.240 --> 03:06:41.240]  I don't care if you're the KKK or pro-Israel or a Christian or a Muslim,
[03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:43.240]  you shouldn't have your right to free speech taken.
[03:06:43.240 --> 03:06:47.240]  So, Joe Gilbert, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker is about to take over.
[03:06:47.240 --> 03:06:50.240]  But just illustrating when I was covering earlier,
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:54.240]  info wars said YouTube band would make it stronger.
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:56.240]  Actually, it's been crushed.
[03:06:56.240 --> 03:06:59.240]  Well, we didn't say it would make it stronger.
[03:06:59.240 --> 03:07:00.240]  We don't want to be banned.
[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:02.240]  We don't want to be depersoned.
[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:05.240]  We don't want to be taken off 20-something platforms.
[03:07:05.240 --> 03:07:10.240]  But for total raw listeners to infowars.com and people actually visiting us
[03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:14.240]  and every other metric, yes, the hardcore fans are more energized than ever.
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:17.240]  But this, let me just give you a real report.
[03:07:17.240 --> 03:07:20.240]  As you guys are the father of lies, I try to tell the truth.
[03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:25.240]  Info wars has never had more grassroots support.
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:27.240]  I've never gone on the street and had more support.
[03:07:27.240 --> 03:07:33.240]  But kicking me off Apple and Google and YouTube and Facebook and Stitcher
[03:07:33.240 --> 03:07:40.240]  and Spotify and webchimp so I can't send emails and just, you know,
[03:07:40.240 --> 03:07:44.240]  discuss thousands of comments and hundreds of comments on info wars.
[03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:47.240]  I mean, yeah, no, it's been a crippling attack.
[03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:49.240]  It's blown up in your face.
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:50.240]  People see you're a bunch of tyrants.
[03:07:50.240 --> 03:07:53.240]  But individually, it's not a fun road to go down.
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:55.240]  They've taken a payment processor from us.
[03:07:55.240 --> 03:07:56.240]  Now they're going to David Horowitz.
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:07:59.240]  They've done it to, you know, Jihad watch.
[03:07:59.240 --> 03:08:01.240]  I mean, this is serious.
[03:08:01.240 --> 03:08:04.240]  Nobody's trying to stop Antifa from what they're doing.
[03:08:04.240 --> 03:08:06.240]  So this is ahead of trying to steal the election,
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:10.240]  ahead of trying to indict enough Trump family members that he rolls over.
[03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:11.240]  That's where we've reached.
[03:08:11.240 --> 03:08:13.240]  But you read this article, none of it's true.
[03:08:13.240 --> 03:08:17.240]  It's like, you know, Jones, now that he's only on Twitter,
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:20.240]  doesn't have more traffic on Twitter.
[03:08:20.240 --> 03:08:24.240]  No, our traffic's about five times what it used to be on Twitter.
[03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:25.240]  But don't worry.
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:26.240]  They're trying to ban that right now.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:32.240]  Jack Dorsey is meeting reportedly in secret to ban us.
[03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:34.240]  So I don't sit there and live and die by that.
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:36.240]  If I lived and died by having platforms,
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:39.240]  I would go along with you and I'd be for Islamic invasion,
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:42.240]  Black Lives Matter, open borders, world government,
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:45.240]  tax exemption for big banks.
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:49.240]  See, I'm trying to change the world, not be part of it.
[03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:54.240]  So if I wanted to be one of you guys, I'd be at the top, at the top.
[03:08:54.240 --> 03:08:59.240]  I was offered the deals years ago, 15 years ago, 11 years ago.
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:04.240]  And look what we've built, the proof that they knew, you know, look, that's talent.
[03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:05.240]  Get that guy.
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:06.240]  That guy's a natural.
[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:07.240]  Get him, get him, get him.
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:09.240]  Well, it didn't work because I'm pro-America.
[03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:10.240]  I'm pro-free market.
[03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:13.240]  So you read this thing where they're like, oh, he's losing.
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:16.240]  I'm not going to sit there and be overconfident and say, oh, I'm totally winning.
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:17.240]  Everything's wonderful.
[03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:18.240]  Let's walk in the park.
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:23.240]  But no, we overall are stronger than ever because our audience is stronger than ever.
[03:09:23.240 --> 03:09:25.240]  And they realize how real this is and how serious it is.
[03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:27.240]  But here's where we're getting hurt in outreach.
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:34.240]  They don't want us on Facebook and YouTube and Google and all those because new people
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:39.240]  can tune in and hear, hey, Obama had 84 million in weird campaign funds.
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:41.240]  They couldn't list and only got a fine.
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:43.240]  Hey, Hillary had the seat.
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:47.240]  They don't want that being reminded and they don't want big events coming or have our own
[03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:51.240]  reporters on the ground showing anti for beating up old ladies.
[03:09:51.240 --> 03:09:55.240]  But they can't stop conservatively.
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:58.240]  There's probably million and a half people tuned in.
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.240]  People's only tuned in for like 20 minutes, but it's it's over a million people are 15
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:03.240]  minutes.
[03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:08.240]  So let's say there's a million and a half people tuned in right now, 70% in the US, 30%
[03:10:08.240 --> 03:10:09.240]  around the world.
[03:10:09.240 --> 03:10:12.240]  No one can stop you going out your front door and telling your wife, your husband, your
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:18.240]  neighbor, your friend, your boss, your employees, your church on Facebook, on Twitter, but in
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:19.240]  person in full wars.com.
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:20.240]  It is the verboten.
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:21.240]  It is the hidden.
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:23.240]  It is what they're attacking.
[03:10:23.240 --> 03:10:29.240]  The power of you outside of cyberspace, the establishment's betting everything on by word
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:34.240]  of mouth saying in full wars.com news wars.com or sharing the videos on our own platforms.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:39.240]  You know, they brag and go, Oh, all they've got is real video now and we're going to shut
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:40.240]  it down.
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:43.240]  You know, we already had real video getting set up knowing this was coming.
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:45.240]  Didn't mean we wanted to happen.
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:47.240]  And you know, my average video on there has like 5000 views.
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:49.240]  Is that my average 100,000 on YouTube?
[03:10:49.240 --> 03:10:51.240]  No, but it doesn't matter.
[03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:53.240]  It's the truth.
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:55.240]  And we're on hundreds of other platforms.
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:11:00.240]  So, you know, Joe Rogan, then I'll hand the baton to our guest host.
[03:11:00.240 --> 03:11:05.240]  He did this video that I want to respond to later because I know Joe so well since like
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:07.240]  the late nineties.
[03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:10.240]  He's like, well, since Alex is in litigation, we're not going to have him on till he's out
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:12.240]  of litigation.
[03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:18.240]  When all, when Anna Betty and Obama and all these people are in litigation, you just don't
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:20.240]  have me on about the litigation, but that cop out.
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:25.240]  Joe Rogan says, I'm not having you on my show because he's afraid of being de-platformed
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:28.240]  off of one of these things like iTunes or Google.
[03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:32.240]  That's the real message is you shut up about America and free market.
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:36.240]  You sit there in the dirt and you let us steal the election and you roll over or we'll
[03:11:36.240 --> 03:11:37.240]  de-platform you.
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:43.240]  You be good little lap dogs and you sit there saying here what we want on the news and you
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:47.240]  go along with this and you go along with all the tyranny and you go along with the open
[03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:53.240]  borders and you go along with all of it and we'll let you still be on iTunes.
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:57.240]  And that's why Joe's got one of the biggest podcasts on iTunes or YouTube because they
[03:11:57.240 --> 03:11:59.240]  don't shadow ban him.
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:02.240]  I mean, hell, Joe has a video with 5 million, he thinks it's big.
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:06.240]  We had videos during the election with 35, 40, 50 million views.
[03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:08.240]  And then they shadow banned our ass.
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:12.240]  So see, I was already 400 laps ahead of Joe.
[03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:14.240]  Not that I count that as something.
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:20.240]  So Joe thinks though, well, if he compromises with the system, he'll get to be in pole position.
[03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:24.240]  But if you're in a race car race and the best people aren't driving, you didn't really win
[03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:25.240]  the trophy.
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:29.240]  You don't really get the champagne.
[03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:31.240]  And again, I'm not mad at Joe.
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:33.240]  It's not an attack on Joe.
[03:12:33.240 --> 03:12:37.240]  So the Sutter Jennings interview, I got called by one of his best friends and told, yeah,
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.240]  Joe's family got threatened not to have you on like a year ago.
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:44.240]  I said, I heard Joe's family got threatened and Joe goes, well, Joe's lied and said that
[03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:46.240]  I found a threat when it wasn't.
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:51.240]  Well, no, I was told by one of your best friends that and then when you said it wasn't true,
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:52.240]  I said, okay, it's not true.
[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:54.240]  But whatever, Joe, your family wasn't threatened.
[03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:55.240]  Your views were threatened.
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:13:00.240]  So if you're not a threat, they're just going to stick you up there on everything and you
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:02.240]  can be what they force feed to everybody.
[03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:07.240]  And but then the comments are almost all against you, which is just sad because I think I've
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:08.240]  bet on humanity.
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:12.240]  I think I bet on the winners like Trump has, I think the prosperity and the freedom and
[03:13:12.240 --> 03:13:17.240]  people are going to see past all this globalism and see past Mueller and all his fake indictments
[03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:18.240]  and all the persecution.
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:19.240]  I'm believing in humanity.
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:22.240]  And Joe, you're this blue color guy from Boston, you know, former Taekwondo champion,
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:24.240]  you're a tough guy on your own, right?
[03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:28.240]  But at 50 something years old, I mean, I think you're trying to bet on the safe horse.
[03:13:28.240 --> 03:13:31.240]  But I think that leads towards stagnation, Joe.
[03:13:31.240 --> 03:13:33.240]  I'm not going to play the clips.
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:36.240]  Maybe at the end of this, I'm going to let Joe Gilbert take over.
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:40.240]  Maybe at the end of this live piece, we'll put a few clips, you know, of Joe.
[03:13:40.240 --> 03:13:42.240]  Got to bleep it a lot with Shooter Jennings who stood up for me.
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:43.240]  I appreciate Shooter.
[03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:46.240]  I've had a shooter on the years when you get him back on.
[03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:48.240]  And it's just, it's just watching that.
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:50.240]  When I'd already told Joe, look, I don't need to come on.
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:51.240]  It's fine.
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:53.240]  I understand you're afraid of getting de-platformed.
[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:54.240]  Other people aren't.
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:13:57.240]  This is the hill people should die on because if they get away with this, they're going
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:13:58.240]  to share everybody down.
[03:13:58.240 --> 03:13:59.240]  PewDiePie gets it.
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:00.240]  Everybody gets it.
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:02.240]  Why don't you mean PewDiePie is the number one podcaster?
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:04.240]  He's got 20 million views on YouTube.
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:05.240]  He's got 65 million subscribers.
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:07.240]  He's number one.
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:09.240]  And we're talking to him.
[03:14:09.240 --> 03:14:14.240]  And, you know, because he understands this is, this is, this is a thing that's coming
[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:15.240]  for all of us.
[03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:20.240]  So just seeing that, no, no, Joe, I didn't lie about your best friend telling me that
[03:14:20.240 --> 03:14:21.240]  you said you were threatened.
[03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:24.240]  And so you couldn't have me on the air anymore.
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:28.240]  It's not like I turned down a bunch of radio interviews and turned on national TV interviews
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:30.240]  with tens of millions of viewers.
[03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:33.240]  But I did want to come on there because you're my friend and I did want to set the record
[03:14:33.240 --> 03:14:35.240]  straight because I keep hearing you repeat.
[03:14:35.240 --> 03:14:38.240]  Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook and Jones says this.
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:41.240]  I'm like, Joe, for years, I haven't said that before I didn't.
[03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:42.240]  It's out of context.
[03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:43.240]  I'd like to clarify.
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:46.240]  Hey, Joe, you know, I'm not really saying that, but Joe keeps repeating it.
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:48.240]  So Joe knows that's not what I'm saying.
[03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:49.240]  But I get it.
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:51.240]  It's the party line.
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:54.240]  It's the party line of Jones did this, Jones did that.
[03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:55.240]  So Jones can't be on air.
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:56.240]  All these U.S.
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:15:01.240]  senators threatening the Democrats, threatening the big tech get behind us and censorship
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:04.240]  or will nationalize you when Trump loses.
[03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:05.240]  This is really un-American.
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:06.240]  It's really, really dangerous.
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:09.240]  And that's why news wars.com and info wars.com.
[03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:15.240]  And what we do at info wars.com forward slash show, we can hear real information are not going to compromise because that's the plan.
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:21.240]  We're going to go to break and come back with Joel Gilbert, but info wars.com forward slash app.
[03:15:21.240 --> 03:15:22.240]  They put that story on screen.
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:28.240]  Put it back up from Reason magazine three weeks ago that the Democrat plan to totally censor the web.
[03:15:28.240 --> 03:15:33.240]  Now it's a public plan and most people see that and they go, well, let me be yellow belly.
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:36.240]  Let me roll over and piss myself immediately.
[03:15:36.240 --> 03:15:39.240]  And but I'll tell you this, Stephen Crowder didn't piss himself.
[03:15:39.240 --> 03:15:41.240]  He's been defending me and saying what happened to me is wrong.
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:45.240]  So good job to Paul Watson and Stephen Crowder and Matt Rudge and others into Joe.
[03:15:45.240 --> 03:15:48.240]  Hey, you've chosen the side you're on.
[03:15:48.240 --> 03:15:49.240]  I say enjoy yourself.
[03:15:49.240 --> 03:16:03.240]  Enjoy George Soros health care reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor or being able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the health care system has become a challenge.

[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:21.240]  Hey, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:25.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:26.240]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:26.240 --> 03:17:29.240]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:35.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:35.240 --> 03:17:36.240]  I can help you too.
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:38.240]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[03:17:38.240 --> 03:17:39.240]  Don't wait another day.
[03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:41.240]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:46.240]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:17:54.240 --> 03:17:58.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.240 --> 03:18:01.240]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.240 --> 03:18:07.240]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:15.240]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.240 --> 03:18:21.240]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[03:18:21.240 --> 03:18:27.240]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:31.240]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.240 --> 03:18:38.240]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.240 --> 03:18:43.240]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:49.240]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.240 --> 03:19:14.240]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:19:20.240 --> 03:19:23.240]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:29.240]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:34.240]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:39.240]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:44.240]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:46.240]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:49.240]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.240 --> 03:20:17.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and ForesLive.com.
[03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:25.240]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:30.240]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:30.240 --> 03:20:34.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:20:34.240 --> 03:20:36.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:49.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Joel Gilbert, your host for this hour.
[03:20:49.240 --> 03:20:54.240]  Coming to you from the People's Republic of California, you know me as a frequent guest of Alex.
[03:20:54.240 --> 03:21:02.240]  Also, don't forget to get my latest film, Trump, the Art of the Insult in the Alex Jones store, Support Alex Jones.
[03:21:02.240 --> 03:21:08.240]  My guest this hour is the, first of all, we'll have Kevin Jackson up in the last segment,
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:10.240]  but we're going to start with Jack Cashhill.
[03:21:10.240 --> 03:21:20.240]  Jack is a journalist who's written many fascinating books, including Deconstructing Obama, Ron Brown's Body, Silence, TWA 800,
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:25.240]  and If I Had a Son, Guns, Railroading of George Zimmerman.
[03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:28.240]  It's all about Trayvon Martin's case.
[03:21:28.240 --> 03:21:37.240]  Now, we'll be taking your calls at 877-789-2539. That's 877-789-Alex.
[03:21:37.240 --> 03:21:41.240]  So let me go ahead and welcome Jack Cashhill. Jack, are you with us?
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:46.240]  Yes, I am. Thanks, Joel, for having me on the show. I always appreciate it.
[03:21:46.240 --> 03:21:51.240]  Fantastic. Well, Jack, you've seen Big Tech censored Alex Jones,
[03:21:51.240 --> 03:21:57.240]  and you wrote a fantastic piece for American Thinker called First Day Came for Alex Jones.
[03:21:57.240 --> 03:22:01.240]  Now, within days, they came for David Horowitz and his Freedom Center.
[03:22:01.240 --> 03:22:08.240]  They took him off of a Visa and Mastercard, and we've seen this phenomenon where,
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:13.240]  during the Obama years, we had government censorship, where they used the tools of state.
[03:22:13.240 --> 03:22:20.240]  The IRS was used to decimate the Tea Party, break up the Tea Party movement so they could win the 2012 election.
[03:22:20.240 --> 03:22:29.240]  The FEC, Federal Election Commission, was used against me, yours truly. They investigated me for the film Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:22:29.240 --> 03:22:38.240]  Now, we've seen that the government leftist control has shifted to the leftist agenda in the private sector
[03:22:38.240 --> 03:22:43.240]  to try to gain censorship, starting with, of course, Alex Jones.
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:46.240]  Why does the left need to censor their opposition?
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:53.240]  Why don't they just make their superior arguments that socialism is a better organizing force for society?
[03:22:53.240 --> 03:22:57.240]  Well, if they had superior arguments, they can make them, but as you know, they don't.
[03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:03.240]  And, you know, we've seen cases in my own, just in my own experience, Joel,
[03:23:03.240 --> 03:23:09.240]  because I've worked with various people who've been punished by the government for reporting the truth.
[03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:12.240]  And this goes back some time. As I mentioned in the article,
[03:23:12.240 --> 03:23:17.240]  I, you know, I first started working with James Sanders on the TWA Flight 800 investigation
[03:23:17.240 --> 03:23:25.240]  after I met his wife, who was a really, you know, sweet, pretty, Filipino TWA trainer
[03:23:25.240 --> 03:23:30.240]  who was arrested and convicted of conspiracy for introducing her husband,
[03:23:30.240 --> 03:23:37.240]  who was an investigative reporter, to the 747 manager working on the 800 investigation.
[03:23:37.240 --> 03:23:42.240]  This was a crash off Coastal Island in 1996.
[03:23:42.240 --> 03:23:45.240]  And all three of them were arrested by the FBI.
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:50.240]  The Sanders were convicted, sent, you know, they didn't want to send them to prison.
[03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:55.240]  That would be too obvious. So they just silenced them by giving Jim an investigative reporter
[03:23:55.240 --> 03:23:57.240]  five years of probation as wife three.
[03:23:57.240 --> 03:23:59.240]  That's just where it started.
[03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:05.240]  A more recent case was David Delightin of the Center for Medical Progress.
[03:24:05.240 --> 03:24:13.240]  In 2015, after a couple years of work, he and his partners surfaced these videos,
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:19.240]  undercover videos of Planned Parenthood selling, marketing, baby parts.
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:24.240]  It was grotesque. The videos were undeniable.
[03:24:24.240 --> 03:24:29.240]  Hillary Clinton found them disturbing, you know, she admitted that.
[03:24:29.240 --> 03:24:32.240]  They could not allow to be out there.
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:38.240]  So those are cases when the left, when Obama was in control.
[03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:43.240]  What about this phenomenon of big tech, the private sector, Visa, MasterCard, Twitter,
[03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:47.240]  now taking on that leftist mantra for censorship?
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:50.240]  Tell us about this phenomenon. How is that happening?
[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:54.240]  Well, you know, it's interesting because one of the people I've gotten to know and I've worked with
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:58.240]  who was also arrested, James O'Keeve, for Project Firmitas.
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:03.240]  He exposed this about nine months ago where they went undercover at Twitter
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:06.240]  and they had all these people bragging on camera
[03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:09.240]  how they could use Twitter to basically censor the right.
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:11.240]  And they were doing it.
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:15.240]  That was the time, first time we heard about the phrase shadow banning.
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:20.240]  And now they've gotten more, you know, aggressive with it, as we saw in the case of Alex Jones,
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:26.240]  where they openly colluded, you know, Spotify, YouTube, whoever else was involved, Facebook,
[03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:28.240]  to take them off.
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:33.240]  And they couldn't use the fact that the argument, they couldn't use the argument that
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:37.240]  he was a white supremacist or, you know, a hate monger.
[03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:40.240]  So they had to say that he was a conspiracy theorist.
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:46.240]  But today, conspiracy theorist is the word that we used to use for journalists 30 years ago.
[03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:49.240]  A conspiracy theorist today is the one who tells the truth.
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:51.240]  It's a really dangerous precedent.
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:54.240]  They can argue that their private concerns, blah, blah, blah.
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:56.240]  But that doesn't really carry water anymore.
[03:25:56.240 --> 03:25:58.240]  They are very close to a public utility.
[03:25:58.240 --> 03:26:03.240]  I don't think they should be regulated, but they should be protested mightily.
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:06.240]  And the people on the right should stand up.
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:09.240]  I don't care if they like Alex Jones or not, because they can be next.
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:15.240]  David Harwitz, you just mentioned, David Harwitz is utterly inoffensive on racial grounds.
[03:26:15.240 --> 03:26:20.240]  I don't know what pretext they use to take him down, but it's appalling.
[03:26:20.240 --> 03:26:26.240]  And partly because David Harwitz knows more about the communist conspiracy in America than anyone,
[03:26:26.240 --> 03:26:29.240]  which is probably the reason he had to be silent.
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:33.240]  Well, what they did, of course, they rely on the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[03:26:33.240 --> 03:26:40.240]  which has almost become a hate group to finger everyone who doesn't agree with the leftist agenda
[03:26:40.240 --> 03:26:43.240]  and calling them a hate group.
[03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:51.240]  What about how they've all colluded really to destroy Trump through their endless propaganda?
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:57.240]  Not to mention that if you just look at the public's response to that,
[03:26:57.240 --> 03:27:00.240]  they've kind of, in the media, they've kind of cheered it on.
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:05.240]  We even saw Bill Mayer actually defend Alex Jones the other day on his show,
[03:27:05.240 --> 03:27:08.240]  and the audience didn't appreciate that very much.
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:11.240]  What's happening with just the general population?
[03:27:11.240 --> 03:27:17.240]  I guess the Democrats that seem to support anti-First Amendment behavior.
[03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:25.240]  Obviously, we know they wouldn't be supporting it if it were not in their, seemingly, in their best interest.
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:33.240]  I thought the scariest part of the Bill Mayer exposure and credit to Bill Mayer for bringing this up.
[03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:36.240]  He said, liberals are supposed to be in favor of freedom of speech.
[03:27:36.240 --> 03:27:40.240]  This isn't a First Amendment issue with Twitter, but it is a freedom of speech issue.
[03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:47.240]  Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan, when Marr says that Alex Jones was banned,
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:49.240]  she goes, thank God.
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:52.240]  This is a government official at the highest level.
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:56.240]  Thank God that we took someone's free speech away.
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:28:04.240]  It's a scary trend, Joel, and I thought we had played itself out, but it hasn't.
[03:28:04.240 --> 03:28:09.240]  It will become more obvious and more dramatic, I think, in the weeks and months to come.
[03:28:09.240 --> 03:28:14.240]  Yeah, look, I think it's another attempt to influence the midterm election.
[03:28:14.240 --> 03:28:21.240]  They think if they prevent other voices from exposing some of these trends that they'll be better off.
[03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:28.240]  We'll see how the people respond and we'll see how much voter fraud they use to make it happen.
[03:28:28.240 --> 03:28:31.240]  We're going to come back next segment with Jack Cachill.
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:36.240]  He's wrote a series of articles about the Trayvon Martin film made by Jay-Z,
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:40.240]  conveniently coming out before the midterms on BET.
[03:28:40.240 --> 03:28:42.240]  There's a whole series and we're going to get into that.
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:44.240]  He wrote the book called If I Had a Son.
[03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:48.240]  We'll be right back with Jack Cachill after the break.
[03:28:52.240 --> 03:28:56.240]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:28:56.240 --> 03:29:01.240]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:29:01.240 --> 03:29:06.240]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[03:29:06.240 --> 03:29:09.240]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:29:09.240 --> 03:29:15.240]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:15.240 --> 03:29:20.240]  Sunny-bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work,
[03:29:20.240 --> 03:29:25.240]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:29:25.240 --> 03:29:26.240]  Why take another pill?
[03:29:26.240 --> 03:29:31.240]  Many people use our sunny-bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:29:31.240 --> 03:29:35.240]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[03:29:35.240 --> 03:29:38.240]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:29:38.240 --> 03:29:44.240]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:29:44.240 --> 03:29:47.240]  You can easily find Sunny-bay heating pads on Amazon.
[03:29:47.240 --> 03:29:51.240]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny-bay heating pads.
[03:29:51.240 --> 03:29:56.240]  I want to plow into all of this.
[03:29:56.240 --> 03:30:02.240]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:30:02.240 --> 03:30:12.240]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[03:30:12.240 --> 03:30:14.240]  you are funding the revolution.
[03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:16.240]  I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:30:16.240 --> 03:30:21.240]  It is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[03:30:21.240 --> 03:30:27.240]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality atomic iodine.
[03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:29.240]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:30:29.240 --> 03:30:32.240]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:30:32.240 --> 03:30:34.240]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:30:34.240 --> 03:30:39.240]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[03:30:39.240 --> 03:30:43.240]  Your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[03:30:43.240 --> 03:30:46.240]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:30:46.240 --> 03:30:49.240]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are,
[03:30:49.240 --> 03:31:14.240]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[03:31:19.240 --> 03:31:23.240]  In which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
[03:31:49.240 --> 03:31:54.240]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:32:19.240 --> 03:32:40.240]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com.
[03:32:40.240 --> 03:32:44.240]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com.
[03:32:44.240 --> 03:32:49.240]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, and how they can then reach out to others
[03:32:49.240 --> 03:32:51.240]  with the information and coin out.
[03:32:51.240 --> 03:33:20.240]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:33:21.240 --> 03:33:30.240]  Dr. Jones' show, Joel Gilbert bringing this show to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:30.240 --> 03:33:33.240]  We have with us writer Jack Cashell.
[03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:39.240]  He wrote the seminal book on the George Zimmerman Trayvon Martin trial called If I Had a Son.
[03:33:39.240 --> 03:33:42.240]  He attended the trial almost gavel to gavel.
[03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:49.240]  And Paramount Network and BET are showing a series called Rest in Power about the death of Trayvon Martin
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:56.240]  with Jay-Z as the producer, the big Obama and frequent, you know, big Obama pal and White House guest.
[03:33:56.240 --> 03:34:04.240]  Of course his wife Beyonce was famous for actually lip-syncing the national anthem at Obama's second inauguration.
[03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:11.240]  Let's take a quick look at part of the trailer of Rest in Power which is still showing every Monday night.
[03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:40.240]  Okay, those are all the scenes that we all remember from the trial and from the case.
[03:34:40.240 --> 03:34:46.240]  Look, Benjamin Crump, of course, the attorney for the Martin family called it the Skittles case.
[03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:52.240]  And it spurred Black Lives Matter and it divided the nation between those who looked at the evidence
[03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:55.240]  and those who just seemed to not even care.
[03:34:55.240 --> 03:35:04.240]  So, you know, Jack Cashell, why did Jay-Z put his name to this miniseries and why is he doing it just before the midterm elections?
[03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:15.240]  Well, that raises the question of why did this incident become a national, international phenomenon in a battleground state
[03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:17.240]  just before the 2012 election.
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:21.240]  And the reason is the same and that is you want to influence votes.
[03:35:21.240 --> 03:35:23.240]  You want to stir up the base.
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:27.240]  They're afraid with, especially with Kanye West wandering off the reservation.
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:34.240]  They've got to be afraid that if the Democrats lose 20% of the Black vote, the Democratic Party is over.
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:38.240]  I mean, they won't have enough votes to win anything anymore.
[03:35:38.240 --> 03:35:42.240]  And they can't, they have to keep reinforcing this theme.
[03:35:42.240 --> 03:35:50.240]  You know, it's interesting, Joel, because I had lunch with George Zimmerman not too long ago and with his parents and a friend.
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:55.240]  And we, and I said to him, I said, you know, George was named after his uncle Jorge.
[03:35:55.240 --> 03:35:57.240]  His mother is Afro-Peruvian.
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:06.240]  And if I said, if you know, if you had just named George Jorge, no one would have ever heard of this incident beyond Sanford, Florida.
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:09.240]  And George said, you're exactly right.
[03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:15.240]  And then the mom turned to Dan said, see, I told you we should have called him Jorge, you know.
[03:36:15.240 --> 03:36:17.240]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:36:17.240 --> 03:36:21.240]  What if Trayvon Martin had killed George Zimmerman?
[03:36:21.240 --> 03:36:31.240]  If he didn't fire the shot and he eventually went unconscious and died of hemorrhaging and head injuries, would anyone care that Trayvon Martin was sentenced to life in jail?
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:33.240]  Would we ever even know who he is?
[03:36:33.240 --> 03:36:39.240]  No, we wouldn't know who he was, nor would we have known who he was if his Zimmerman's name had been Jorge.
[03:36:39.240 --> 03:36:47.240]  Because the media would want nothing to do with the case in 2012 in a battleground state that involved a Jorge and a Trayvon.
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:49.240]  That's not in their agenda.
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:54.240]  They want the world to believe that blacks and Hispanics get along famously.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:36:55.240]  They don't.
[03:36:55.240 --> 03:36:58.240]  And this was a case where that didn't happen.
[03:36:58.240 --> 03:37:04.240]  So they turned him into what the New York Times uniquely called a white Hispanic, George Zimmerman.
[03:37:04.240 --> 03:37:09.240]  A name that sounds German, maybe even Jewish, but that certainly doesn't sound Hispanic.
[03:37:09.240 --> 03:37:12.240]  And then they ran on that name.
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:15.240]  They didn't even know what he looked like when they started their campaign.
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:23.240]  Well, Jack, look, I remember Al Sharpton going down there and they put forth this theme that they just want an arrest.
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:26.240]  Of course, he would say arrest without the T.
[03:37:26.240 --> 03:37:27.240]  We want an arrest.
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:28.240]  We want an arrest.
[03:37:28.240 --> 03:37:30.240]  And they did the same theme later in Ferguson.
[03:37:30.240 --> 03:37:37.240]  They just wanted an arrest as if an arrest was a constitutional right, like free speech.
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:44.240]  What was the point of them trying to get an arrest and did they even ever expect or care that they would get a conviction?
[03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:46.240]  Was it all about the agenda?
[03:37:46.240 --> 03:37:53.240]  Well, I mean, for the lawyers, it's all about the arrest because with an arrest, you can file a lawsuit in which case,
[03:37:53.240 --> 03:37:58.240]  which they did against the homeowners association when they had a couple of million dollars.
[03:37:58.240 --> 03:38:00.240]  So that's why the arrest was important.
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:07.240]  Now, as to the conviction, it reminds me of what happened with the original race case in America was the Sakhalin Manzetti case.
[03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:13.240]  The Soviet Union got involved through the common turn and they proclaimed the innocence of these two.
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:16.240]  It's hanging in her case in the 1920s.
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:24.240]  And Catherine Ann Porter, who is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, was one of the many liberals who were drawn to the case then.
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:28.240]  And she remembers standing outside the prison the night they were to be executed.
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:35.240]  And she said to the communist woman who was running the protest, oh, God, I hope we can save them.
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:37.240]  And the communists said to her, saved.
[03:38:37.240 --> 03:38:40.240]  What good did they do us alive?
[03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:43.240]  They wanted Sakhalin Manzetti dead.
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:50.240]  They wanted to be able to portray America as this racist stew of xenophobia, not as a melting pot.
[03:38:50.240 --> 03:38:55.240]  And the same thing would, if George Zimmerman had been convicted, the whole thing would have been forgotten about.
[03:38:55.240 --> 03:39:03.240]  But with him innocent, they could go back to the base and say, listen, there's no justice in America, no justice, no peace.
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:07.240]  And the Black Lives Matter was formed out of that incident.
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:16.240]  And then two years later, they thought they found another test case with Darren Wilson, an officer in Ferguson, and Michael Brown.
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:22.240]  And in fact, I may be the only person in America who knows both Michael Brown and George Zimmerman.
[03:39:22.240 --> 03:39:23.240]  I attract these people.
[03:39:23.240 --> 03:39:25.240]  I run into a lot of people get in trouble.
[03:39:25.240 --> 03:39:29.240]  And I find myself writing about them.
[03:39:29.240 --> 03:39:32.240]  But it's pulling what happened.
[03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:42.240]  Yeah, look, when they turned it into, then they turned it into a melted to an anti-gun rallying call claiming that this was a result of the stand your ground laws.
[03:39:42.240 --> 03:39:45.240]  My understanding is it never was a stand your ground case.
[03:39:45.240 --> 03:39:47.240]  It was simply a self-defense case.
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:50.240]  And Zimmerman never even claimed stand your ground.
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:52.240]  How far.
[03:39:52.240 --> 03:39:53.240]  Yeah, go ahead and comment.
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:40:02.240]  As you say, you're right. And what's, you know, among the many dishonesties of the JZ series is this constant talk of stand your ground.
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:04.240]  Stand your ground had nothing to do with the case.
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:12.240]  If someone jumps you and is punching you in the head, MMA style, pound and ground, and you're, you know, against a concrete sidewalk.
[03:40:12.240 --> 03:40:17.240]  And your only recourse when he grabs, goes to grab your gun is to shoot him first.
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:19.240]  That's classic self-defense.
[03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:21.240]  There's no ground to be held there.
[03:40:21.240 --> 03:40:25.240]  You know, it's not like he had a choice in leaving or not leaving that site.
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:27.240]  That was self-defense.
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:28.240]  The jury knew it.
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:29.240]  They acquitted him.
[03:40:29.240 --> 03:40:35.240]  And the media, which should, okay, I get the Black Lives Matter moment.
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:36.240]  They got an agenda.
[03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:40.240]  Is it a disgrace for the media to continue this lie?
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:44.240]  Well, why, why is this case so emotional six years later?
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:48.240]  Trayvon Martin, the hoodie, all the imagery.
[03:40:48.240 --> 03:40:51.240]  It still conjures up tremendous amount of emotion.
[03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:58.240]  And I guess that's why the JZ series was put together with the midterms in mind is how I see it.
[03:40:58.240 --> 03:40:59.240]  No, you're right.
[03:40:59.240 --> 03:41:04.240]  And, you know, because for the average person who's not following the media, particularly closely white or black,
[03:41:04.240 --> 03:41:08.240]  they're still thinking of Trayvon Martin that they still want to cover people magazine.
[03:41:08.240 --> 03:41:11.240]  You know, the 11-year-old boy who wanted to be a pilot.
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:18.240]  They don't know that at age 15, when his father left still another woman, the woman who had raised Trayvon,
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:25.240]  his life descended into, you know, your classic, I hate to say it, black teenage slump, you know,
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:30.240]  which included drugs, guns, in his case, fighting and burglary.
[03:41:30.240 --> 03:41:37.240]  And, you know, Trayvon had become, he's a half a foot taller than George Zimmerman at the time of his death.
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:42.240]  He was a skilled MMA fighter, mixed martial arts.
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:45.240]  There was one eyewitness who said, he came out.
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:47.240]  I saw this black guy in a hoodie.
[03:41:47.240 --> 03:41:53.240]  He was on top of a white Hispanic guy and his raining down blows on him, MMA style.
[03:41:53.240 --> 03:41:55.240]  The guy was helpless on below.
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:41:58.240]  He's yelling out, help, help, help me.
[03:41:58.240 --> 03:42:02.240]  They knew that within 15 minutes, the police did.
[03:42:02.240 --> 03:42:07.240]  The man testified at the trial, as soon as he did, the trial was over in any real sense.
[03:42:07.240 --> 03:42:13.240]  The media and Jay-Z refused to even talk about that witness.
[03:42:13.240 --> 03:42:18.240]  And so they have to make everything else up to cover that gap.
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:21.240]  Okay, well, Jack, you've done an amazing work with your book.
[03:42:21.240 --> 03:42:23.240]  If I had a son, I have read it.
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:24.240]  It really tracks the case.
[03:42:24.240 --> 03:42:25.240]  It's riveting.
[03:42:25.240 --> 03:42:30.240]  And you're revisiting the story with Jay-Z's documentary.
[03:42:30.240 --> 03:42:32.240]  I do encourage everyone to keep looking at it.
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:35.240]  It's for the next two Monday nights on BET.
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:40.240]  And you'll see what Jack's talking about, how they're still portraying this case, despite some of the facts.
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:42.240]  Thanks to Jack Cascio.

[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:54.240]  I am going to be taking some calls shortly. It's 1-877-789-2539.
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:47:58.240]  That's 1-877-789-Alex.
[03:47:58.240 --> 03:48:01.240]  We're going to talk about everything we've covered so far on this show.
[03:48:01.240 --> 03:48:05.240]  Before I do that, I want to comment on the film, The Incredibles.
[03:48:05.240 --> 03:48:10.240]  You should have seen, hopefully, Incredibles 1.
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:12.240]  The first version was like 10 years ago.
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:16.240]  The Incredibles 2 came out only about six weeks ago.
[03:48:16.240 --> 03:48:20.240]  It has a leftist theme.
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:28.240]  It's a complete transformation of Hollywood from superheroes and fun into leftist messaging.
[03:48:28.240 --> 03:48:30.240]  I'm going to tell you what it is in a second.
[03:48:30.240 --> 03:48:37.240]  Let's roll a small clip of the trailer to remind you about The Incredibles and how they've gone incredibly far to the left.
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:41.240]  Behold the Incredibles!
[03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:43.240]  Watch after Jack-Jack.
[03:48:43.240 --> 03:48:44.240]  I thought we were going to go with you.
[03:48:44.240 --> 03:48:46.240]  You heard your mother trampolining.
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:49.240]  We made a gap.
[03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:51.240]  Superheroes are illegal.
[03:48:51.240 --> 03:48:52.240]  What do you want to fight back?
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:56.240]  That's good enough. This was The Incredibles 2 trailer.
[03:48:56.240 --> 03:49:05.240]  What's different about The Incredibles this time is the wife is now the main character, Elastigirl.
[03:49:05.240 --> 03:49:13.240]  She's the character that goes out and fights the evil villains while Mr. Incredible stays at home and takes care of the kids for the entire movie.
[03:49:13.240 --> 03:49:16.240]  The villain is also a female.
[03:49:16.240 --> 03:49:28.240]  When the female superhero eventually captures the evil female villain, as she's going into the police station, the daughter of Elastigirl says,
[03:49:28.240 --> 03:49:31.240]  well, she's not going to stay in prison very long because she's rich.
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:41.240]  So you see how the superhero genre, along with the rest of Hollywood, has just turned into this leftist messaging concept
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:47.240]  where they're trying to push social messages and far-left messages nonstop.
[03:49:47.240 --> 03:49:53.240]  And this is why I think people are being turned off and maybe that's why I think The Incredibles 2 didn't do very well.
[03:49:53.240 --> 03:49:56.240]  But let's go ahead and take a couple of phone calls.
[03:49:56.240 --> 03:50:03.240]  We're going to go to, let's see here, I don't have any names up yet, but let's go ahead and we're going to have to wait until we get a name.
[03:50:03.240 --> 03:50:07.240]  Everyone's name is question mark right now.
[03:50:07.240 --> 03:50:19.240]  And before we do that, let's go with a little more about the series Rest in Power, the Trayvon Martin case that Jack Cashhill just talked about.
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:24.240]  I think the best way to look at that in retrospect is that that incident never should have happened.
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:33.240]  It was more like a road rage incident where two people that didn't know each other came into a situation where someone got extremely agitated
[03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:40.240]  and attacked the other person, just like in a road rage incident, normally people come out of their cars and say, hey, stop fighting, stop fighting.
[03:50:40.240 --> 03:50:49.240]  In this case, people came out of their apartments and said, you know, cut this out and Zimmerman yelled for help, please help me, please help me, no one helped him.
[03:50:49.240 --> 03:50:54.240]  So he eventually shot Martin and very tragically died.
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:51:03.240]  So we hear about these road rage types of incidents where people get on each other's nerve in some way, someone attacks, and then nobody helps them.
[03:51:03.240 --> 03:51:07.240]  So just a real tragedy that was then exploited by the people with the agenda.
[03:51:07.240 --> 03:51:10.240]  I think the local police did their job.
[03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:12.240]  They investigated for two weeks.
[03:51:12.240 --> 03:51:19.240]  They said, look, all the physical evidence, the witnesses, the 911 calls, support a self-defense story.
[03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:21.240]  There's no case here.
[03:51:21.240 --> 03:51:31.240]  And then the people with the agendas came in from Washington, from the Department of Justice, and they used both Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin for political ends.
[03:51:31.240 --> 03:51:34.240]  And that's pretty much a synopsis of, I think, the case.
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:44.240]  And I do encourage everyone to tune into BET next Monday night and the following Monday so you can hear how they're portraying the story.
[03:51:44.240 --> 03:51:46.240]  Let's go to James in North Carolina.
[03:51:46.240 --> 03:51:51.240]  Go ahead, you're on the Alex Jones show, James.
[03:51:51.240 --> 03:51:56.240]  Today, I just wanted to talk about kind of black support for Trump is just booming.
[03:51:56.240 --> 03:51:59.240]  I think it terrifies the elites and the Democrats.
[03:51:59.240 --> 03:52:06.240]  And now they're pushing anything they can to try to create race division and try to split us up, leading up to the midterms.
[03:52:06.240 --> 03:52:15.240]  I mean, look at what happens to Candace Owens, Parrish Denard, Kanye West, any black supporter that comes out in days to thank for themselves.
[03:52:15.240 --> 03:52:20.240]  As a conservative, they're trashed, they're shunned, they're crazy.
[03:52:20.240 --> 03:52:21.240]  They're not really black.
[03:52:21.240 --> 03:52:22.240]  They're an Uncle Tom.
[03:52:22.240 --> 03:52:25.240]  And this is the racism of the Democrat Party.
[03:52:25.240 --> 03:52:26.240]  It never ended.
[03:52:26.240 --> 03:52:27.240]  Yeah, it's a good point.
[03:52:27.240 --> 03:52:28.240]  It's a good point.
[03:52:28.240 --> 03:52:29.240]  Thanks for the call.
[03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:30.240]  It's a good point.
[03:52:30.240 --> 03:52:32.240]  Look, you probably saw my film also Alex Jones Store.
[03:52:32.240 --> 03:52:34.240]  There's no place like Utopia.
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:41.240]  And I went around South Side Chicago, Detroit, talked to a lot of black people and a lot of them were on welfare.
[03:52:41.240 --> 03:52:42.240]  They didn't want to be on welfare.
[03:52:42.240 --> 03:52:43.240]  They weren't happy about it.
[03:52:43.240 --> 03:52:45.240]  They wanted jobs.
[03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:46.240]  There were no jobs.
[03:52:46.240 --> 03:52:53.240]  You had a lot of people going to prison that weren't evil people, but they made terrible choices to sell drugs and get into nonsense
[03:52:53.240 --> 03:53:02.240]  because there were no opportunities that were the Democrat Party control caused after 50 years controlling these cities
[03:53:02.240 --> 03:53:07.240]  and driving away their businesses and raising taxes.
[03:53:07.240 --> 03:53:09.240]  And these people were not against the police.
[03:53:09.240 --> 03:53:10.240]  They wanted more police.
[03:53:10.240 --> 03:53:12.240]  They wanted more police in their communities.
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:13.240]  They wanted safety.
[03:53:13.240 --> 03:53:17.240]  They didn't want illegal aliens coming in and taking their jobs and driving down their wages.
[03:53:17.240 --> 03:53:20.240]  They didn't want marijuana being legalized.
[03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:25.240]  Black people in inner cities that I met were actually big time conservatives.
[03:53:25.240 --> 03:53:28.240]  They were still, though, kind of being manipulated.
[03:53:28.240 --> 03:53:30.240]  Well, we like Obama because he's black.
[03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:35.240]  And this is what the leftists had done over the years from the early 30s.
[03:53:35.240 --> 03:53:39.240]  In my movie Dreams for My Real Father, which most people have seen,
[03:53:39.240 --> 03:53:47.240]  I chronicled that Obama's real biological dad was the black Bolshevik, Frank Marshall Davis, out of Chicago,
[03:53:47.240 --> 03:53:56.240]  a journalist that the white communists recruited to try to trick black people into coming on to the socialist communist cause.
[03:53:56.240 --> 03:53:59.240]  And black people at that time were no fools.
[03:53:59.240 --> 03:54:00.240]  They were religious people.
[03:54:00.240 --> 03:54:02.240]  They were Christians with strong families.
[03:54:02.240 --> 03:54:05.240]  They didn't believe in Marxism because it was atheist.
[03:54:05.240 --> 03:54:08.240]  They didn't believe in a class warfare.
[03:54:08.240 --> 03:54:10.240]  They didn't believe in love with their neighbor.
[03:54:10.240 --> 03:54:16.240]  And in the film, I chronicled how Barack Obama was raised by Frank Marshall Davis in addition to being his real father.
[03:54:16.240 --> 03:54:18.240]  He admits he was raised by him.
[03:54:18.240 --> 03:54:20.240]  And Obama followed in his footsteps.
[03:54:20.240 --> 03:54:26.240]  He went back to Chicago and was supported by white communists developing communities project, community organizer,
[03:54:26.240 --> 03:54:30.240]  to try to trick black people to become socialists.
[03:54:30.240 --> 03:54:32.240]  It really didn't work in the 80s.
[03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:33.240]  They were no fools.
[03:54:33.240 --> 03:54:34.240]  They rejected Obama.
[03:54:34.240 --> 03:54:37.240]  When he ran for Congress in the early 2000s, Obama was rejected.
[03:54:37.240 --> 03:54:39.240]  They knew he was a phony.
[03:54:39.240 --> 03:54:48.240]  It was only later when he got the big support of Bill Ayers and some of these radicals from the 60s that they promoted a new story.
[03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:54.240]  My father's a goat herder from Kenya, so I'm going to bring everyone together and people started to buy into it.
[03:54:54.240 --> 03:55:02.240]  But it's a long sad history of how the Democrats are actually using black leaders to try to get black people to support them.
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:09.240]  And I think it's falling apart finally, they realize that the entire Democrat agenda is not in their interest.
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:12.240]  Let's now go to Scott in Connecticut.
[03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:13.240]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:15.240]  You're on the Alex Jones show.
[03:55:15.240 --> 03:55:16.240]  Yes.
[03:55:16.240 --> 03:55:17.240]  Hi, Joe.
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:23.240]  I just wanted to say I did see your film and I thought it was a way it woke me up.
[03:55:23.240 --> 03:55:30.240]  I told all my friends, I told my family who just didn't want to hear it almost like they were actually arguing with me.
[03:55:30.240 --> 03:55:31.240]  They didn't want to know.
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:34.240]  They were afraid to know the truth.
[03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:38.240]  And finally, they are knowing the truth and they finally have their buddy here.
[03:55:38.240 --> 03:55:41.240]  And thank you for writing and doing your research for that.
[03:55:41.240 --> 03:55:46.240]  And as far as the Rick Trayvon Martin case, now I'm looking at it from a new perspective.
[03:55:46.240 --> 03:55:54.240]  I was a Democrat before years ago and then I slowly changed to, you know, know, you know what I mean?
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:58.240]  So that everything now looks totally new, everything you're saying.
[03:55:58.240 --> 03:56:02.240]  I learned some new things today about, you know,
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:04.240]  Well, you know, thanks for the call.
[03:56:04.240 --> 03:56:07.240]  Look, the mainstream media narrative is very shallow.
[03:56:07.240 --> 03:56:12.240]  It's very simplistic and they want people to kind of buy into it and not think beyond that.
[03:56:12.240 --> 03:56:16.240]  Anytime you dig a little bit deeper, you can see there's much more to all this stuff.
[03:56:16.240 --> 03:56:26.240]  And, you know, the biggest fake news, the biggest fraudsters, the biggest conspiracy theorists are all the news organizations in 2008.
[03:56:26.240 --> 03:56:30.240]  They simply repeated Barack Obama's story that his father was a goat herder from Kenya
[03:56:30.240 --> 03:56:33.240]  and he's going to bring us all together with a big transparent government.
[03:56:33.240 --> 03:56:36.240]  It was all one big fraud.
[03:56:36.240 --> 03:56:46.240]  The truth that we're telling on this show, I think educates people and it's very easy to see what went wrong with the Obama years
[03:56:46.240 --> 03:56:50.240]  that were so devastating and destructive, particularly the black community.
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:54.240]  Black people I talked to in my, there's no place like Utopia.
[03:56:54.240 --> 03:56:56.240]  They said they're just getting poorer.
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:56:58.240]  Taxes have gone up.
[03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:00.240]  Their companies are leaving town.
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:04.240]  Their kids are, you know, single parent culture, drug culture.
[03:57:04.240 --> 03:57:07.240]  And I think that they get it now.
[03:57:07.240 --> 03:57:15.240]  They really appreciate that Donald Trump has brought jobs and an economy where people can grow in the free market system
[03:57:15.240 --> 03:57:20.240]  and become what they want to be and not be dependent on these welfare programs.
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:25.240]  And that's why the Democrats are so eager to have open borders to bring in illegals
[03:57:25.240 --> 03:57:31.240]  to replace the black voters and the black people that are not buying into this anymore.
[03:57:31.240 --> 03:57:37.240]  That's part of the equation and it's definitely against the interests of all Americans, especially black community.
[03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:51.240]  Thank you for being here on the Alex Jones Show. We'll see you next time.
