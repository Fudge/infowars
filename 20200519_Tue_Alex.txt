[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  We are being told by the United Nations, WHO, that they are in control.
[00:13.960 --> 00:15.360]  That is world government.
[00:15.360 --> 00:19.720]  And then you study who created the UN, who funds the UN.
[00:19.720 --> 00:27.960]  It is the Rockefeller consortium of bankers that took all their tax-free money in the
[00:27.960 --> 00:34.720]  trillions and put it into foundations to take over the planet to be tax-free.
[00:34.720 --> 00:37.280]  None of the Rockefellers measured up after David Rockefeller.
[00:37.280 --> 00:42.240]  He was in charge until his early nineties and died at what, 99, a few years ago after
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.680]  his seventh heart transplant failed.
[00:45.680 --> 00:51.360]  And the globalists really don't believe in just passing on power through royalty unless
[00:51.360 --> 00:53.200]  someone rises to the occasion.
[00:53.200 --> 01:01.640]  Well, the decision was made to make Bill Gates, the head of the New World Order, about 12
[01:01.640 --> 01:05.920]  years ago, as best I can tell, he was already top science officer.
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.840]  So there's a lot of joke memes out there about Bill Gates 2020 because he's all over the
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.640]  place saying he's the president, he's the president of the world, he's your doctor,
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.520]  he's going to tell you how to live, but really it's Bill Gates president of the world, dictator
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.400]  of the world 2020 because you didn't elect him and he didn't have a medical license.
[01:25.400 --> 01:30.080]  But when Trump comes out and says, I'm taking hydroxychloroquine, oh my God, this is going
[01:30.080 --> 01:31.080]  to kill people.
[01:31.080 --> 01:32.080]  He's the biggest devil on earth.
[01:32.080 --> 01:37.320]  We'll address all of that here on this May 19th, 2020, Tuesday, global transmission
[01:37.320 --> 01:39.800]  with 167 days out.
[01:39.800 --> 01:47.080]  But I wanted to play in a little bit of context this bombshell audio and video of Alan Dershowitz,
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.520]  the liberal slash conservative darling, the lawyer to the convicted pedophile scumbag
[01:52.520 --> 01:59.080]  Jerry, Jeffrey Epstein, who didn't kill himself, saying the Supreme Court has ruled in emergencies
[01:59.080 --> 02:00.360]  they can make you do anything they want.
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.360]  Well, that's not true.
[02:01.360 --> 02:03.040]  I went and looked it up.
[02:03.040 --> 02:08.160]  We have informed consent and no country but places like North Korea or Communist China
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.240]  make you take a vaccine and they now got articles out admitting the vaccine trials are hurting
[02:12.240 --> 02:14.840]  people or they don't work.
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.080]  So the idea that you don't own your body and that if you don't take a vaccine, you're
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.080]  going to hurt somebody else.
[02:20.080 --> 02:21.080]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.640]  If you're an idiot, you've taken the vaccine, aren't you supposedly protected?
[02:26.640 --> 02:30.280]  So all of this and more is coming up here today.
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.080]  But here is Alan Dershowitz saying he wants you assaulted by the state to drag you to
[02:36.080 --> 02:38.200]  a facility and put whatever they want in your body.
[02:38.200 --> 02:40.200]  They already do it with the GMO, the 5G.
[02:40.200 --> 02:42.960]  So this is just the logical extension of the power grab.
[02:42.960 --> 02:43.960]  Here it is.
[02:43.960 --> 02:44.960]  Legitimate.
[02:44.960 --> 02:46.960]  Let me put it very clearly.
[02:46.960 --> 02:53.920]  You have no constitutional right to endanger the public and spread the disease even if
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.320]  you disagree.
[02:55.320 --> 02:57.600]  You have no right not to be vaccinated.
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.840]  You have no right not to wear a mask.
[02:59.840 --> 03:02.400]  You have no right to open up your business.
[03:02.400 --> 03:04.400]  Wait, can I stop you?
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.800]  No right not to be vaccinated, meaning if they decide you have to be vaccinated, we
[03:09.800 --> 03:10.800]  have to be vaccinated?
[03:10.800 --> 03:11.800]  Absolutely.
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.920]  And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor's
[03:17.920 --> 03:21.360]  office and plunge a needle into your arm.
[03:21.360 --> 03:28.560]  If the vaccine is to prevent, if the vaccination is designed to prevent the spreading disease,
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.040]  if the vaccination is only to prevent a disease that you will get, for example, if there's
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.320]  a disease that will kill you, you have the right to refuse that, but you have no right
[03:37.320 --> 03:43.080]  to refuse to be vaccinated against a contagious disease.
[03:43.080 --> 03:48.080]  Public health, the police power of the Constitution, gives the state the power to compel that.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.800]  And there are cases in the United States that bring forth a case that pops into my head.
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.800]  I may have the name wrong.
[03:53.800 --> 03:54.800]  It's Jacobson.
[03:54.800 --> 03:56.400]  I think probably I have it right.
[03:56.400 --> 03:57.800]  Check it out.
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.880]  You'll see that there are cases after cases after cases that the public health permits
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.000]  reasonable actions to prevent the spread of the community.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.720]  And that's under the public safety clause, trying to look up what he was saying, plus
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.720]  I studied this, and it's a total lie.
[04:15.720 --> 04:22.680]  They're saying if you have smallpox or the bubonic plague that there is a right to quarantine
[04:22.680 --> 04:30.600]  you because you have a disease, but they do not have a right to force medical treatment
[04:30.600 --> 04:33.480]  on you.
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.840]  They're saying all of you are guilty and must stay locked up when we say, and we're
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.240]  going to put something in your body that's given liability protection as a history of
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.080]  killing people and doesn't even protect you.
[04:45.080 --> 04:48.600]  And so I'm doing a special report on that with all the documents emery get lawyers involved
[04:48.600 --> 04:57.880]  to show you that Dr. Alan Dershowitz coming to rape us with his needle is full of prunes.
[04:57.880 --> 05:04.960]  Stay with us, I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020 within a week or so.
[05:04.960 --> 05:09.000]  Many of the best selling items that we're selling them for store.com will no longer
[05:09.000 --> 05:10.000]  be at 50% off.
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.560]  In fact, last year I said I can't do 50% off anymore because our markup isn't enough
[05:14.560 --> 05:17.840]  for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.720]  But I want you to get the ultimate crude oil.
[05:20.720 --> 05:22.720]  I want you to get Vaso Beach.
[05:22.720 --> 05:24.880]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[05:24.880 --> 05:27.440]  I want you to experience X2.
[05:27.440 --> 05:30.360]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[05:30.360 --> 05:35.120]  They're all in stock right now and they're 30% to 60% off.
[05:35.120 --> 05:40.840]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on
[05:40.840 --> 05:44.480]  most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling
[05:44.480 --> 05:47.800]  out like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Vaso Beach.
[05:47.800 --> 05:52.560]  So take action, be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the InfoWare.
[05:52.560 --> 06:04.720]  Get in these great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[06:04.720 --> 06:11.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[06:11.840 --> 06:14.440]  The year is 2020.
[06:14.440 --> 06:16.320]  The date is May 19th.
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.840]  The day is Tuesday.
[06:17.840 --> 06:26.360]  And we are 167 days out from the most historic election in world history, a referendum between
[06:26.360 --> 06:33.000]  the New World Order and the post-human era, a technotronic technocracy nightmare, and
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.160]  the true fruits of the Renaissance and the Christian age to come.
[06:40.160 --> 06:44.000]  It is destined.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.200]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday transmission.
[06:49.200 --> 07:00.840]  I have never seen a more clear cut etched in stone, teaching moment to show complete
[07:00.840 --> 07:12.280]  crystal clear fraud, a rosetta stone, a skeleton key, a masterclass, a masterpiece of on its
[07:12.280 --> 07:21.960]  face lies, treason, arrogance, deception, and the projection of ignorance and superstition
[07:21.960 --> 07:29.200]  and fear of ideas and fear of communication, which the universities have now been inverted
[07:29.200 --> 07:34.960]  from the pentacle of empowering humanity to the pentagram of inverting and silencing
[07:34.960 --> 07:35.960]  debate.
[07:35.960 --> 07:45.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, hydroxychloroquine is one of the only known treatments that actually
[07:45.720 --> 07:50.680]  works for respiratory illnesses.
[07:50.680 --> 07:55.760]  It's also known as a cure for malaria and a preventative.
[07:55.760 --> 08:00.800]  It's also known as one of the only treatments of off drug that works in lupus.
[08:00.800 --> 08:06.800]  And there are hundreds and hundreds of studies that hydroxychloroquine, when taken in the
[08:06.800 --> 08:13.120]  first stages of a coronavirus COVID-19 infection, is 100% effective.
[08:13.120 --> 08:17.920]  Now, if you're 90 years old and have heart failure and liver failure and don't have any
[08:17.920 --> 08:21.200]  zinc in your body, you take hydroxychloroquine, you're going to have hallucinations because
[08:21.200 --> 08:22.840]  it causes a chemical imbalance in the brain.
[08:22.840 --> 08:24.880]  You must take zinc with it.
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.480]  Now, they did studies in China, they did studies in Europe, they found it 97% effective
[08:30.480 --> 08:33.280]  because a couple percent were already so sick, it wouldn't help.
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.320]  But see, Fauci and the globalists have their vaccines already ready.
[08:38.320 --> 08:43.160]  They already have all their dangerous drugs that just so happen to attack your testicles
[08:43.160 --> 08:45.120]  and cost thousands of dollars ready.
[08:45.120 --> 08:55.360]  They don't want some off patent drug that costs somebody 30 bucks.
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.360]  They had articles attacking me when I pointed out medical doctors are at work because they're
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.840]  allowed to give this to people who's over the counter, tonic water with quinine.
[09:03.840 --> 09:07.640]  That's all hydroxychloroquine is, is medical grade of that.
[09:07.640 --> 09:13.840]  This is the British military that developed this with the Dutch 300 years ago, Jack.
[09:13.840 --> 09:16.560]  It's why they were tough all over the world and other people weren't because they had
[09:16.560 --> 09:18.760]  vitamin C and they had quinine.
[09:18.760 --> 09:24.800]  But listen, I'm not going to go over history lesson again for you ladies and gentlemen.
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.280]  Don't talk to the White House doctor, he's got all these letters from doctors.
[09:29.280 --> 09:35.760]  You have the New York Hasidic Jew doctor that's now treated over 2,000 people, 100% recovery,
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.200]  right?
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.280]  Because the minute you have a fever or cough, he puts you on zinc, hydroxychloroquine that
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.160]  pushes into the cells and Z-PAC.
[09:46.160 --> 09:47.440]  People went, oh, that guy's a fraud.
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.760]  You don't give people antibiotics for a virus.
[09:51.760 --> 09:55.320]  The main carrier into the lungs is bacteria.
[09:55.320 --> 09:56.960]  They carry the damn virus.
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.760]  So again, this has been out since early February.
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.480]  Before that, it was out in studies years ago.
[10:06.480 --> 10:09.040]  So Trump knows they're pushing the deadly vaccine.
[10:09.040 --> 10:17.040]  He knows they're pushing these other dangerous drugs that a Fauci study says has an 8% approval,
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.800]  I mean, improvement rate.
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.160]  So it doesn't matter if it's on WebMD, it doesn't matter, it's in hundreds of studies.
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.120]  They come out and say the president is a fraud and a liar and a scammer.
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.960]  When he makes his own medical decision with his own personal doctor to take it preventively
[10:36.960 --> 10:44.400]  with zinc, and Trump decided to knock out his bacterial flora, it took a Z-PAC upfront.
[10:44.400 --> 10:46.920]  Hope he's taking probiotics to replace them.
[10:46.920 --> 10:49.960]  But yeah, around all people he's with, I get it because they could hit him with some
[10:49.960 --> 10:51.680]  weaponized version.
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.320]  So what is the CIA?
[10:53.320 --> 10:55.640]  That means some leftist arm of it.
[10:55.640 --> 10:57.040]  This is out of any fear.
[10:57.040 --> 11:00.600]  CIA, please ignore Trump's medical advice on coronavirus.
[11:00.600 --> 11:01.960]  Yeah, who are you a doctor?
[11:01.960 --> 11:03.200]  You're not Bill Gates.
[11:03.200 --> 11:08.480]  You're not Alan Dershowitz, you know, that tell us they're doctors.
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]  Trump's not a doctor.
[11:09.480 --> 11:12.000]  He's only playing one on TV, watch some posts.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.240]  Trump's not a doctor.
[11:13.240 --> 11:15.840]  Trump urges coronavirus patients to take unproven drug.
[11:15.840 --> 11:18.400]  How dare you?
[11:18.400 --> 11:25.120]  Well, this is a top story everywhere, and they're saying he's a fraud, impeach him.
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.240]  The Democrats are calling for hearings because a man has free speech as a consumer and as
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.520]  a human that his doctor told him this is good when it's a fact.
[11:34.520 --> 11:40.680]  Folks, they have people under criminal investigation or SWAT teaming medical doctors that give patients
[11:40.680 --> 11:47.680]  vitamin C because they don't want you to know that it's a disease of vitamin deficiency.
[11:47.680 --> 11:53.680]  Take D3, vitamin C, major Yahoo News AP last week admitted it.
[11:53.680 --> 12:01.560]  They did a huge EU study and found everyone that died of COVID-19 was deficient in D3.
[12:01.560 --> 12:02.840]  They know this, folks.
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.000]  If you don't have vitamin C in a couple months, your teeth fall out.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.840]  You start bleeding out your rear end.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.960]  Every old cut reopens.
[12:09.960 --> 12:13.280]  It's called scurvy, scurvy, scurvy.
[12:13.280 --> 12:15.160]  You fall apart.
[12:15.160 --> 12:16.160]  It's a sin.
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.360]  It's so ignorant like cavemen now and so scared of knowledge.
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.080]  It's like an idiocracy where the guy can read, so they go, he talks like a fag.
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.200]  Let's put him in prison.
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.320]  He knows how to read.
[12:28.320 --> 12:29.480]  I talk to lawyers.
[12:29.480 --> 12:33.960]  I talk to rich people, and I'm like, yeah, you know, zinc, you can't pregnant the cells
[12:33.960 --> 12:35.200]  if you have it.
[12:35.200 --> 12:36.200]  Oh, yeah?
[12:36.200 --> 12:37.200]  What are you, a doctor?
[12:37.200 --> 12:38.680]  I'm like, oh, here's 10 studies.
[12:38.680 --> 12:39.680]  Here's a hard one.
[12:39.680 --> 12:40.680]  Wow.
[12:40.680 --> 12:41.680]  Yeah!
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.320]  The NIH damn website.
[12:43.320 --> 12:45.080]  We used to have scientists, folks.
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.760]  Now we have a government that tells us men can have babies.
[12:48.760 --> 12:54.040]  We now have a government that says the word mother and father is bad.
[12:54.040 --> 13:00.080]  So this is a war on reality, and the president's taken months to go, oh, yeah, the studies
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.920]  saying the doctors tell me this hydroxychloric was great because it loads the cells.
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.920]  You don't need it, folks.
[13:06.920 --> 13:09.240]  You take 10 times the daily allowance.
[13:09.240 --> 13:10.240]  That's safe.
[13:10.240 --> 13:12.040]  I looked into it at doctors on the show.
[13:12.040 --> 13:14.960]  Long term, not good for your kidneys, but during this, you take it.
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.840]  You take 100 milligrams of zinc.
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.360]  You're in like Flynn if you've got the D3 and the C, but they can't get in the virus.
[13:22.360 --> 13:28.080]  Viruses cannot get into cells and cannot replicate when you have zinc load.
[13:28.080 --> 13:31.760]  Fact, fact, fact, fact, fact.
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.360]  So here is a medical doctor, one of hundreds that's gotten on local news, never national,
[13:36.360 --> 13:41.160]  saying all my patients have done perfectly with this just like the Jewish doctor first
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.160]  did.
[13:42.160 --> 13:43.160]  Here it is.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.000]  I want to ask you about hydroxychloroquine.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.200]  The president was pushing it pretty strong again yesterday.
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.200]  You said you have prescribed this.
[13:50.200 --> 13:53.560]  I want to talk to you about the effects you're seeing and what it might do for people who
[13:53.560 --> 14:00.080]  take it normally outside of coronavirus and a possible shortage of medicine for them.
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.080]  Exactly.
[14:01.080 --> 14:05.000]  We're finding clinically with our patients is that it really only works in conjunction
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  with zinc.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.280]  So the hydroxychloroquine opens the zinc channel, zinc goes into the cell, it then blocks the
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.720]  replication of the cell in the machinery.
[14:12.720 --> 14:14.720]  So it has to be used in conjunction with zinc.
[14:14.720 --> 14:17.800]  We are seeing some clinical responses in that regard.
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.600]  There are people that take it regularly for other disease processes.
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.440]  We have to be cautious and mindful that we don't prescribe it for patients who have COVID
[14:26.440 --> 14:27.440]  that are well.
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.680]  It really should be reserved for people that are really sick in the hospital or at home
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.640]  very sick that need that medication.
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.080]  Otherwise, we're going to blow through our supply, the patient that take it regularly
[14:37.080 --> 14:38.080]  for other disease processes.
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.560]  But what you're saying is you're prescribing it and it is working for COVID-19 patients.
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.720]  Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill and within eight to 12 hours
[14:48.720 --> 14:50.320]  they were basically symptom free.
[14:50.320 --> 14:56.120]  And so, clinically, I am seeing a resolution that mirrors what we saw in the French study
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.200]  and some of the other studies worldwide.
[14:59.200 --> 15:03.400]  But what I am seeing is that people are taking it alone by itself.
[15:03.400 --> 15:04.400]  It's not having efficacy.
[15:04.400 --> 15:05.400]  Okay.
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.400]  Exactly.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.400]  Because you have to.
[15:07.400 --> 15:09.080]  Hydroxychloroquine is the gun.
[15:09.080 --> 15:10.080]  The bullet is zinc.
[15:10.080 --> 15:11.080]  You got to have both.
[15:11.080 --> 15:12.080]  But here's the deal.
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.960]  The fish die out of water because it can't breathe.
[15:15.960 --> 15:23.160]  Now, you die in a couple of minutes without air, four or five minutes, right?
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.600]  I know the listeners know this, but for actual liberals and stuff, you need to understand.
[15:26.600 --> 15:28.680]  You die without water, right?
[15:28.680 --> 15:30.920]  In a week and a half, two weeks.
[15:30.920 --> 15:31.920]  You die without air.
[15:31.920 --> 15:32.920]  We'll see.
[15:32.920 --> 15:37.320]  Without vitamin C, zinc and D3, you die in a couple months.
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.880]  You normally have a virus because you're starving to death.
[15:41.880 --> 15:45.400]  You disintegrate without those things.
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.320]  By the way, you die without iodine.
[15:48.320 --> 15:51.600]  And literally, people don't know this, and you wonder why you're so damn.
[15:51.600 --> 15:57.240]  I am more powerful and have more, I'm more virile than I was 18 because I take all these
[15:57.240 --> 15:58.240]  things.
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.360]  Haul and Bloch has really been a sleeper product for us.
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.960]  We got it in a few years ago.
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.440]  It's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs.
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.720]  They discovered this more than 30 years ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.360]  a certain type of quail, that it had an antihistamine effect, and people saw their allergies and
[16:18.360 --> 16:20.680]  seasonal discomfort knocked way, way down.
[16:20.680 --> 16:26.280]  Well, now this is available in the United States, it's proprietary, it has rave reviews.
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.800]  It's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become
[16:30.800 --> 16:31.800]  a best seller.
[16:31.800 --> 16:35.000]  We're very close to selling out Haul and Bloch right now.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.240]  It'll take eight weeks to get more in, but despite that, I'm going to sell it at 50%
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.000]  off until it sells out.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.960]  So for those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence and have seasonal
[16:44.960 --> 16:52.080]  discomfort, experience PollenBlock for yourself right now at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.560]  PollenBlock, I want people that haven't tried it, try it for themselves, so it's the lowest
[16:56.560 --> 16:59.600]  price ever, even though it's selling out.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.280]  What InfoWars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[17:04.280 --> 17:09.560]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[17:09.560 --> 17:13.320]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[17:13.320 --> 17:20.680]  And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.840]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.600]  You must decide which side you're on.
[17:28.600 --> 17:33.600]  Living in denial, having mast op-com syndrome, Mert Helplissons will only deliver you into
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.680]  misery, destruction, and finally death.
[17:36.680 --> 17:42.120]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[17:42.120 --> 17:44.880]  The delusions must end now.
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.240]  InfoWars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[17:50.240 --> 17:53.320]  Most people that are aware of the new will order decide to join it out of fear.
[17:53.320 --> 17:55.320]  They are truly fearless.
[17:55.320 --> 18:02.000]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[18:02.000 --> 18:09.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:09.000 --> 18:21.120]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:21.120 --> 18:22.120]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.360]  I've got something for you, really special.
[18:25.360 --> 18:28.760]  Coming up in the next two segments, I'll leave it at that and then we're going to have in
[18:28.760 --> 18:33.920]  a minute two very informative folks, Greg Reese and of course Harrison Smith and Paul
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.640]  Joseph Watson from the fourth hour, but let me go back to this.
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.600]  This isn't just about Trump being right about hydroxychloroquine.
[18:40.600 --> 18:41.640]  He's the president.
[18:41.640 --> 18:44.040]  We elected him.
[18:44.040 --> 18:49.160]  Without even looking, I've seen hundreds of doctors on British, French, German, Russian,
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.160]  Japanese, Chinese, US, Canadian, Mexican.
[18:53.160 --> 18:56.840]  I mean, it's just this doctor says it's this doctor because they're doctors.
[18:56.840 --> 19:00.720]  They're like, yeah, studies all say it's great, you know, as long as you're on on desk doorstep
[19:00.720 --> 19:08.400]  and you get this in you, we just recommend you take D3 vitamin C and sink.
[19:08.400 --> 19:11.480]  And then the president, after four months of this being out there and them trying to
[19:11.480 --> 19:16.360]  bully him and one study below Malina Gates finance with people on their deathbed over
[19:16.360 --> 19:19.160]  85 who had multiple conditions and didn't help them.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.160]  They went into study.
[19:20.160 --> 19:23.000]  Oh, look, this didn't help anybody.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.280]  Well, yeah, if you've held somebody underwater for five minutes and you come back, you try
[19:27.280 --> 19:28.280]  to resuscitate them.
[19:28.280 --> 19:29.280]  They don't usually come back to life.
[19:29.280 --> 19:36.840]  I mean, again, all these things are essential air, water, you dive quick without food.
[19:36.840 --> 19:37.840]  What's in food?
[19:37.840 --> 19:46.440]  Vitamins, minerals, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, this is all basic science.
[19:46.440 --> 19:50.800]  But now there's this thing where they go, oh, this is insane.
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.520]  And they'll take medical doctors offline when they go on ABC News.
[19:54.520 --> 19:58.320]  Oh, by the way, you know, YouTube removed that ABC News thing out of California.
[19:58.320 --> 20:01.280]  It's like a whack-a-mole because every doctor knows this.
[20:01.280 --> 20:02.880]  They're like, well, of course.
[20:02.880 --> 20:05.720]  No, no, no dirty Americans.
[20:05.720 --> 20:13.240]  And now we're told the CIA, someone in the CIA said that this isn't true.
[20:13.240 --> 20:14.720]  Oh, the CIA.
[20:14.720 --> 20:18.880]  Oh, someone, a bureaucrat, okay, don't listen to Trump.
[20:18.880 --> 20:22.840]  Trump said his doctor told him this.
[20:22.840 --> 20:29.760]  And it's the truth, folks, but all they got to tell you is get vitamin D, C, and zinc,
[20:29.760 --> 20:31.640]  and it's in clean water.
[20:31.640 --> 20:34.120]  You need to buy the D3.
[20:34.120 --> 20:35.120]  Get the sunlight.
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.680]  What did doctors used to say forever?
[20:36.680 --> 20:38.200]  They said, oh, you're inside.
[20:38.200 --> 20:39.200]  Get some fresh air.
[20:39.200 --> 20:40.200]  Get some sunshine.
[20:40.200 --> 20:42.600]  It's the best disinfectant.
[20:42.600 --> 20:46.120]  Before they discovered that your skin makes D3, there's doctors journals where they're
[20:46.120 --> 20:54.560]  telling royalty 400 years ago, get out the sun, lay out the sun in your underwear.
[20:54.560 --> 20:59.600]  During the swine flu, they had outdoor hospitals and they had triple the recovery.
[20:59.600 --> 21:01.720]  Just laying the people out the sun.
[21:01.720 --> 21:04.520]  Turned out they hadn't had any sun.
[21:04.520 --> 21:11.120]  And I know you all know this, but this is how sick these people are.
[21:11.120 --> 21:13.480]  Here, let's hear.
[21:13.480 --> 21:16.880]  Let's hear from President Trump what freaked everybody out so much.
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.800]  And this shows how we're afraid of knowledge, afraid of common sense, and the left tells
[21:20.800 --> 21:28.080]  us you don't listen to anybody but Fauci, who actually ran the Wuhan lab coronavirus program
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.920]  with Bill Gates, who, again, they've launched the attack and they're the ones telling us
[21:32.920 --> 21:33.920]  how to respond.
[21:33.920 --> 21:34.920]  Isn't it perfect?
[21:34.920 --> 21:45.920]  Imagine who's behind the attack, publicly, publicly, publicly, it's on record, AP, Reuters,
[21:45.920 --> 21:49.000]  everything, Newsweek.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.720]  Think about that.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.360]  Think about that.
[21:52.360 --> 21:54.720]  And now they've got forced inoculations for you.
[21:54.720 --> 21:57.200]  They're telling you don't have any rights.
[21:57.200 --> 21:58.200]  They're full of crap.
[21:58.200 --> 22:00.200]  Here's part of the present.
[22:00.200 --> 22:03.920]  A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy.
[22:03.920 --> 22:05.920]  A lot of good things have come out.
[22:05.920 --> 22:10.960]  And you'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.560]  before you catch it.
[22:13.560 --> 22:16.520]  The frontline workers, many, many are taking it.
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.240]  I happen to be taking it.
[22:18.240 --> 22:20.440]  I happen to be taking it.
[22:20.440 --> 22:21.440]  Hydroxychloroquine?
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.440]  I'm taking it.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.440]  Hydroxychloroquine.
[22:23.440 --> 22:24.440]  When?
[22:24.440 --> 22:25.440]  Right now, yeah.
[22:25.440 --> 22:26.440]  Yeah, when?
[22:26.440 --> 22:29.440]  A couple of weeks ago, I started taking it because I think it's good.
[22:29.440 --> 22:31.200]  I've heard a lot of good stories.
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.040]  And if it's not good, I'll tell you right, I'm not going to get hurt by it, it's been
[22:36.040 --> 22:37.920]  around for 40 years from malaria.
[22:37.920 --> 22:38.920]  Longer than that.
[22:38.920 --> 22:39.920]  The loop is for other things.
[22:39.920 --> 22:40.920]  I take it.
[22:40.920 --> 22:41.920]  Frontline workers take it.
[22:41.920 --> 22:43.200]  A lot of doctors take it.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.200]  Excuse me.
[22:44.200 --> 22:45.200]  A lot of doctors take it.
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.200]  I take it.
[22:46.200 --> 22:47.200]  No, I don't.
[22:47.200 --> 22:48.200]  Let's put it down.
[22:48.200 --> 22:51.440]  Yeah, my family doctor takes it.
[22:51.440 --> 22:53.920]  I had been into a medical checkup in like three years.
[22:53.920 --> 22:56.920]  I went in and got the checkup and he said, I'm not worried about it.
[22:56.920 --> 23:00.320]  I've ordered hydroxychloroquine because it was sold out here.
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.320]  I got it from France.
[23:01.320 --> 23:03.320]  I'm like, okay, great.
[23:03.320 --> 23:07.360]  But I mean, I was like, don't just take the same doctor goes, yeah, but I want to push
[23:07.360 --> 23:08.360]  it in myself.
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.160]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[23:12.160 --> 23:13.960]  I mean, this is insane, folks.
[23:13.960 --> 23:16.720]  I look, I'm done talking about it.
[23:16.720 --> 23:20.360]  We got something really powerful that I got sent by three different people yesterday.
[23:20.360 --> 23:21.360]  So it's gone super viral.
[23:21.360 --> 23:25.840]  You know, when you get sent something by a bunch of people, you know, it's really, really
[23:25.840 --> 23:27.200]  going big.
[23:27.200 --> 23:32.400]  It's the Bill Gates and the population control grid and it's a part three that the great
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.640]  James Corbett award-winning investigative journalist has put out and we posted all three
[23:36.640 --> 23:40.400]  parts of his reports he's put out the last few weeks on Bill Gates.
[23:40.400 --> 23:43.880]  They're all 30 minute documentaries or so.
[23:43.880 --> 23:49.280]  And it really lays out just very factually what's going on currently with all this.
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.800]  So we've got it linked up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[23:53.800 --> 23:58.920]  That is coming up at the start of the next segment for a couple segments and then we're
[23:58.920 --> 24:03.880]  going to have our guest in here separately though, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:03.880 --> 24:08.520]  It's not a sales gimmick that we had a week of sales.
[24:08.520 --> 24:11.640]  A lot of the products were actually selling out and that now we've extended it three
[24:11.640 --> 24:13.360]  or four days.
[24:13.360 --> 24:18.720]  We weren't planning that, but this is such a popular sale and a lot of these products
[24:18.720 --> 24:20.880]  are going to be coming in for a long time.
[24:20.880 --> 24:24.720]  I've just decided to go ahead and get them in your hands and to make sure we have funding
[24:24.720 --> 24:25.920]  to go into the future.
[24:25.920 --> 24:28.960]  So I would take advantage of this because it could be two, three, four months till some
[24:28.960 --> 24:30.680]  of this stuff comes back in.
[24:30.680 --> 24:32.880]  Almost all these products are almost sold out.
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.200]  We're very close to being sold out current sales and specials extended two more days,
[24:38.200 --> 24:43.760]  maybe three more info wars biggest sell yet in 2020 has been extended for two final days.

[25:38.200 --> 25:39.200]  plus.
[25:39.200 --> 25:48.160]  Anything with the PQQ, the CoQ 10, this is it to get this dose of PQQ they were telling
[25:48.160 --> 25:50.360]  me to eat like 10 crates of blueberries or something.
[25:50.360 --> 25:51.360]  It's just ridiculous.
[25:51.360 --> 25:56.640]  The little packages of them living defense 50% off limited edition info wars face mask
[25:56.640 --> 25:57.640]  995.

[26:22.840 --> 26:27.120]  And again, that's what makes this whole operation go around.
[26:27.120 --> 26:30.880]  So take advantage of that and other specials at info wars store.com.
[26:30.880 --> 26:31.880]  We will have some new specials.
[26:31.880 --> 26:35.120]  I've been so busy with everything that's happening, I've come up with new ones.
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.160]  They won't be as deep or as expansive, but we will have some specials next week.
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.720]  Probably some of the things that have sold out, but I'm just keeping this shell going
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.640]  right now because you're really responding.
[26:44.640 --> 26:47.800]  And so that's helping find our operation, even though the margins are a lot smaller.
[26:47.800 --> 26:49.400]  The amount we're selling is a lot bigger.
[26:49.400 --> 26:53.920]  So I'm just going to pedal to the metal balls, the walls, and for the next three, four days,
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.920]  take advantage of it right now.
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.920]  We'll be right back.
[26:55.920 --> 27:02.760]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[27:02.760 --> 27:07.760]  an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.840]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.400]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.760]  all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.920]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[27:24.920 --> 27:29.760]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now, and that's what the economic
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.800]  numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart, and for the first world, it's
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.040]  going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[27:39.040 --> 27:42.720]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.720]  to the UN, and I believe their numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to
[27:47.720 --> 27:49.480]  depopulate the third world.
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.880]  So all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch
[27:52.880 --> 27:56.600]  of suckers and you bought into something better than what Hitler did.
[27:56.600 --> 28:00.440]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[28:00.440 --> 28:04.600]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[28:04.600 --> 28:07.200]  talked about, horrible, has come true.
[28:07.200 --> 28:11.040]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[28:11.040 --> 28:14.520]  It's like telling somebody, if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have
[28:14.520 --> 28:18.600]  little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown, people
[28:18.600 --> 28:21.040]  don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[28:21.040 --> 28:24.560]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the
[28:24.560 --> 28:25.560]  first world.
[28:25.560 --> 28:31.680]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[28:31.680 --> 28:32.680]  it.
[28:32.680 --> 28:36.720]  They admit it's good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[28:36.720 --> 28:42.000]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.440]  because it's their operations manual.
[28:49.440 --> 28:54.280]  I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major
[28:54.280 --> 28:57.880]  institutions and we've got to stop them.
[28:57.880 --> 29:04.440]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[29:04.440 --> 29:10.160]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes
[29:10.160 --> 29:11.160]  up.
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.880]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:17.880 --> 29:20.120]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.

[29:40.000 --> 29:42.560]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[29:42.560 --> 29:47.200]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer, doesn't make them grow, make some
[29:47.200 --> 29:50.480]  shrink, slow, which is basically the same thing.
[29:50.480 --> 30:00.080]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[30:00.080 --> 30:18.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:18.200 --> 30:23.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[30:23.040 --> 30:24.760]  You want to stop tyranny?
[30:24.760 --> 30:26.280]  Well so does he.
[30:26.280 --> 30:33.280]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.480]  Hello everyone.
[30:35.480 --> 30:38.080]  Mr. P.
[30:38.080 --> 30:40.680]  What's your secret mission about?
[30:40.680 --> 30:47.560]  It's not my mission, but an idea that came from our good friend Mr. Bill Gates.
[30:47.560 --> 30:49.360]  Hi kids.
[30:49.360 --> 30:57.600]  It's a real, actual, in-person, Bill, uh, Bill?
[30:57.600 --> 31:03.160]  He's trying to say that we're big fans, Mr. Gates.
[31:03.160 --> 31:08.960]  It's a strange fact that Bill Gates' hagiographers, PR hacks employed more often than not by large
[31:08.960 --> 31:13.400]  corporations that receive funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, consistently
[31:13.400 --> 31:19.200]  depict this drab software developer as a cartoon superhero using his superpower of being
[31:19.200 --> 31:24.040]  very rich to help save the planet.
[31:24.040 --> 31:28.440]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's
[31:28.440 --> 31:32.960]  most powerful people, Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey.
[31:32.960 --> 31:44.360]  It was like, well, it was like the Super Friends.
[31:44.360 --> 31:48.360]  But these cartoon-fueled puff pieces reveal more than they know about Gates and the other
[31:48.360 --> 31:52.040]  mega-rich philanthropists they are attempting to idolize.
[31:52.040 --> 31:55.960]  They reveal that the idea of the selfless billionaire do-gooder is a work of fiction
[31:55.960 --> 32:00.860]  so unbelievable it is only fit for Saturday morning cartoon fare.
[32:00.860 --> 32:05.560]  As we have seen in our first two explorations of Bill Gates' role as global health kingpin,
[32:05.560 --> 32:10.120]  the seemingly selfless generosity of the Gates family through their eponymous foundation has
[32:10.120 --> 32:14.440]  in fact greatly increased their own wealth, with Bill Gates' personal net worth having
[32:14.440 --> 32:17.280]  doubled in the past decade alone.
[32:17.280 --> 32:21.320]  But the takeover of public health that we have documented in how Bill Gates monopolized
[32:21.320 --> 32:26.440]  global health, and the remarkably brazen push to vaccinate everyone on the planet that we
[32:26.440 --> 32:33.640]  have documented in Bill Gates' plan to vaccinate the world, was not at base about money.
[32:33.640 --> 32:37.400]  The unimaginable wealth that Gates has accrued is now being used to purchase something much
[32:37.400 --> 32:41.000]  more useful, control.
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.640]  Control not just of the global health bodies that can coordinate a worldwide vaccination
[32:44.640 --> 32:49.920]  program or the governments that will mandate such an unprecedented campaign, but control
[32:49.920 --> 32:53.400]  over the global population itself.
[32:53.400 --> 32:58.840]  This is an exploration of Bill Gates and the population control grid.
[32:58.840 --> 33:05.440]  You're tuned into the Corbett Report.
[33:05.440 --> 33:10.400]  From a journalistic standpoint, Good Morning America's inane report on the secretive billionaire
[33:10.400 --> 33:14.840]  meeting that took place in New York in 2009 was a failure.
[33:14.840 --> 33:19.360]  It listed some of the meeting's attendees and their combined net worth.
[33:19.360 --> 33:24.120]  Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey, together with others at the meeting, including George
[33:24.120 --> 33:31.400]  Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, they're worth more than $125 billion.
[33:31.400 --> 33:35.160]  It turned to the senior editor of Forbes for a soundbite about what it would be like to
[33:35.160 --> 33:37.080]  witness such an assembly of wealth.
[33:37.080 --> 33:42.560]  To have been in the room and see this meeting of the minds really would have been a fascinating
[33:42.560 --> 33:43.560]  thing.
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.200]  And it dutifully reported the participants' own stated reason for holding the meeting.
[33:49.200 --> 33:55.160]  That much money, that much power around one table, it begs the question, what were they
[33:55.160 --> 33:56.160]  doing?
[33:56.160 --> 33:57.600]  What were they scheming?
[33:57.600 --> 33:59.280]  Total world domination?
[33:59.280 --> 34:05.440]  This group, together for six hours, was talking about charity, education, emergency relief,
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.360]  global health.
[34:08.360 --> 34:13.600]  Before wrapping up with another juvenile appeal to comic book superhero lore.
[34:13.600 --> 34:20.120]  The new Superman and Wonder Woman, the super rich friends, not fighting bad guys, but fighting
[34:20.120 --> 34:22.440]  for good, nonetheless.
[34:22.440 --> 34:26.360]  For Good Morning America, John Berman, ABC News.
[34:26.360 --> 34:32.680]  Yes, from a journalistic standpoint, Berman's report was an utter failure.
[34:32.680 --> 34:35.800]  There was no attempt to question the participants about the meeting.
[34:35.800 --> 34:40.040]  No space for any criticism of these billionaires or questions about their motives.
[34:40.040 --> 34:43.360]  No adversarial journalism of any kind.
[34:43.360 --> 34:46.800]  But as a PR piece, it was brilliant.
[34:46.800 --> 34:50.640]  It leaves the viewer with a vague sense that some kind of gathering took place somewhere
[34:50.640 --> 34:56.120]  in New York in which rich people, who, let's not forget, are superheroes, talked about
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.880]  charity.
[34:57.880 --> 35:01.000]  One would have to turn to print sources to discover that the meeting was held at the
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.480]  personal residence of Sir Paul Nurse, then President of Rockefeller University.
[35:06.480 --> 35:10.400]  That the invitation to the gathering was co-written by Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and David
[35:10.400 --> 35:12.160]  Rockefeller.
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.360]  Or that the aim of the meeting was to consider how their wealth could be used to slow the
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.000]  growth of the world's population.
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.160]  Given that these extraordinarily rich and powerful men, including Warren Buffett, David Rockefeller,
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.840]  and Ted Turner, have all expressed their belief that the growing human population is the greatest
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.440]  threat faced by humanity, it should not be surprising that they would convene a conference
[35:34.440 --> 35:38.800]  to discuss how best to channel their vast wealth into the project of reducing the number
[35:38.800 --> 35:41.680]  of people on the planet.
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.480]  Particularly unsurprising is that attendees of the meeting later dubbed Bill Gates, a
[35:45.480 --> 35:50.360]  man for whom population control is particularly close to his heart, as the most impressive
[35:50.360 --> 35:53.600]  speaker at the event.
[35:53.600 --> 36:00.640]  Here we can see a chart that looks at the total world population over the last several
[36:00.640 --> 36:02.240]  hundred years.
[36:02.240 --> 36:04.760]  And at first glance, this is a bit scary.
[36:04.760 --> 36:11.240]  We go from less than a billion in 1800, and then three, four, five, six, and 7.4 billion
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.840]  where we are today is happening even faster.
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.240]  So Melinda and I wondered whether providing new medicines and keeping children alive, would
[36:21.240 --> 36:26.440]  that create more of a population problem?
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.560]  And what the developing world does not need is more children.
[36:30.560 --> 36:36.120]  And I think that was the biggest aha to Bill and me when we got into this work, as we asked
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.120]  ourselves, of course, the same hard-nosed question you'd ask, which is, if you get into
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.200]  this work and you start to save these children, will women just keep overpopulating the world?
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.840]  And thank goodness the converse is absolutely true.
[36:48.840 --> 36:55.080]  This is a very important question to get right, because it was absolutely key for me.
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.360]  When our foundation first started up, it was focused on reproductive health.
[36:59.360 --> 37:04.640]  That was the main thing we did, because I thought population growth in poor countries
[37:04.640 --> 37:06.200]  is the biggest problem they face.
[37:06.200 --> 37:10.360]  You've got to help mothers who want to limit family size have the tools and education to
[37:10.360 --> 37:11.360]  do that.
[37:11.360 --> 37:15.880]  That's the only thing that really counts.
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.400]  In recent years, critics have pointed to Bill Gates own words linking vaccination programs
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.040]  with his goal of reducing population growth.
[37:24.040 --> 37:26.960]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[37:26.960 --> 37:28.440]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[37:28.440 --> 37:35.560]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[37:35.560 --> 37:38.720]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.800]  $10 billion over the next 10 years to make it the year of the vaccines.
[37:43.800 --> 37:44.960]  What does that mean exactly?
[37:44.960 --> 37:51.240]  Well, over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, both inventing new vaccines
[37:51.240 --> 37:54.840]  and making sure they get out to all the children who need them.
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.200]  We could cut the number of children who die every year from about 9 million to half of
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.000]  that if we have success on it.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.280]  The benefits there in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth, it really
[38:06.280 --> 38:13.680]  allows the society a chance to take care of itself once you've made that intervention.
[38:13.680 --> 38:18.800]  But as any number of fact-checking websites, not to mention Bill Gates himself, are quick
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.840]  to point out, this doesn't mean what it sounds like it means.
[38:23.840 --> 38:31.360]  What we found out is that as health improves, families choose to have less children.
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.840]  The truth is that when people's lives improve, when children survive, for instance, or when
[38:35.840 --> 38:41.760]  girls go to school, people start making decisions based on the expectation that their children
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.120]  will live and thrive.
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.640]  The result is smaller families and slower population growth.
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.120]  I came across articles that showed that the key thing you can do to reduce population growth
[38:54.120 --> 38:55.840]  is actually improve health.
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.400]  And that sounds paradoxical, you think, okay, better health means more kids, not less kids.
[39:00.400 --> 39:08.240]  Well, in fact, what parents are doing is they're trying to have two kids survive to adulthood
[39:08.240 --> 39:09.880]  to take care of them.
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.240]  And so the more disease-burdened there is, the more kids they have to have to have that
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.800]  high probability.
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.720]  So there's a perfect correlation that as you improve health, within a half-generation,
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.000]  the population growth rate goes down.
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.120]  Yes, the Gates stated plan is to reduce population growth by improving health.
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.320]  But the idea of using vaccines as sterilization agents, even without the public's knowledge
[39:37.320 --> 39:43.480]  or consent, is not conspiracy lore, but documentable fact.
[39:43.480 --> 39:49.840]  In its 1968 annual report, the Rockefeller Foundation addressed the problems of population,
[39:49.840 --> 39:56.560]  lamenting that very little work is in progress on immunological methods.
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.600]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global, corporate, media and the chai comms
[40:01.600 --> 40:07.680]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression, in fact, we're already into the worldwide
[40:07.680 --> 40:09.840]  depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.720]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[40:15.720 --> 40:16.720]  to be.
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.240]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.880]  That's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.720]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[40:31.720 --> 40:34.040]  They've admitted all of this.
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.640]  So remember, how does M-Full Wars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able
[40:39.640 --> 40:42.080]  to predict things before they happen?
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.920]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes it's dystopic
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.600]  and yes it's scary, but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more
[40:51.600 --> 40:52.600]  scary.
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.120]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.280]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[40:59.280 --> 41:05.920]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.280]  a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Biddleman and the Gates Foundation in
[41:12.280 --> 41:14.160]  full control.
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.840]  Many will submit through fear, others will be bought off, but in the end, the globalists
[41:19.840 --> 41:25.440]  submit they're building a post-human world and now that we're inside the cage, it's
[41:25.440 --> 41:29.880]  going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[41:29.880 --> 41:35.920]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[41:35.920 --> 41:42.520]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[41:42.520 --> 41:43.520]  this.
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.160]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.520]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[41:53.520 --> 41:57.640]  disgusting power trip.
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.280]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[42:56.600 --> 43:01.360]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.240]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like,
[43:05.240 --> 43:10.440]  yeah, you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're into pedophilia, yeah, we're into world
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.680]  government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential, we are shutting your ass down.
[43:16.680 --> 43:21.720]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[43:21.720 --> 43:25.720]  You're going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that there's
[43:25.720 --> 43:30.280]  no more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your
[43:30.280 --> 43:34.400]  universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[43:34.400 --> 43:37.040]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[43:37.040 --> 43:41.440]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order and that takes you understanding you
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.760]  were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the
[43:45.760 --> 43:52.080]  alarm now while you still can now is the time for action now is the time for you to shine
[43:52.080 --> 44:00.040]  and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[44:00.040 --> 44:28.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show very little work is in progress on immunological
[44:28.680 --> 44:34.600]  methods such as vaccines to reduce fertility and much more research is required if a solution
[44:34.600 --> 44:36.720]  is to be found here.
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.480]  The foundation vowed to correct this problem by funding established and beginning investigators
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.160]  to turn their attention to aspects of research and reproductive biology that have implications
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.000]  for human fertility and its control.
[44:50.000 --> 44:56.060]  This was no empty promise by the time of its 1988 annual report the Rockefeller Foundation
[44:56.060 --> 45:01.120]  was able to report progress on its funding into contraceptive research including Norplant
[45:01.120 --> 45:05.440]  a contraceptive implanted under the skin of a woman's upper arm and effective for five
[45:05.440 --> 45:11.560]  years in its 1988 report the Rockefeller Foundation was pleased to announce that Norplant which
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.520]  was developed by the Rockefeller founded population council was now approved for marketing in
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.960]  12 countries.
[45:18.960 --> 45:22.920]  The Rockefeller's population council and other research organizations joined with the
[45:22.920 --> 45:29.960]  World Health Organization in 1972 to create a task force on vaccines for fertility regulation.
[45:29.960 --> 45:36.280]  By 1995 they were able to report progress in developing a prototype of an anti-HCG vaccine
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.840]  which works by combining an immunogen formed from a synthetic peptide of human corionic
[45:40.840 --> 45:46.680]  gonadotrophin HCG a hormone secreted by the surface of the early embryo to remain implanted
[45:46.680 --> 45:50.480]  in the womb with a toxoid carrier molecule.
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.000]  The vaccine stimulates an immune reaction causing women to develop antibodies against
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.480]  the hormone thus preventing them from carrying babies to term.
[45:59.480 --> 46:05.000]  But beginning in the 1990s a series of scandals over WHO-led vaccination programs in the third
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.760]  world led to allegations that tetanus vaccines in places like the Philippines and Kenya were
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.880]  being laced with HCG in order to implement population control by stealth.
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.160]  The controversy generated by these stories led global institutions to step back from
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.280]  the campaign to champion population control by vaccine.
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.880]  But as usual, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was there to renew interest working
[46:27.880 --> 46:33.280]  with the UK government to host a London summit on family planning in 2012 at which the Foundation
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.760]  announced their support for funding the research, development and deployment of injectable contraceptives
[46:38.760 --> 46:41.480]  to the developing world.
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.440]  You heard me talk earlier about Sadie who I met in Niger.
[46:45.440 --> 46:50.280]  She was traveling 15 kilometers to get an injection.
[46:50.280 --> 46:55.080]  But let's ask ourselves, what if she didn't have to travel to that clinic?
[46:55.080 --> 47:00.160]  If we put it in her perspective, how can we keep her in her village to get the contraceptives
[47:00.160 --> 47:01.160]  she wants?
[47:01.160 --> 47:05.240]  Well, Pfizer is testing a new form of depot.
[47:05.240 --> 47:10.600]  The injection that she goes 15 kilometers to get, they're now putting it in a new form,
[47:10.600 --> 47:13.960]  a new device that can be given, it's very, very small.
[47:13.960 --> 47:17.480]  It's called UNIJECT, I think it's going to be pictured here.
[47:17.480 --> 47:24.040]  It's a high quality product, it's effective, it's safe, it's tiny as you can see and it
[47:24.040 --> 47:29.640]  can be put in a healthcare workers kit to give to the woman at the village level.
[47:29.640 --> 47:36.160]  So Sadie won't have to go 15 kilometers any longer to get that injection.
[47:36.160 --> 47:39.120]  But the Gates were not content to stop there.
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.240]  In 2014, it was announced that Microchips Biotech Inc., a company in Lexington, Massachusetts,
[47:45.240 --> 47:50.120]  had developed a new form of birth control, a wireless implant that can be turned on and
[47:50.120 --> 47:55.680]  off with a remote control and that is designed to last up to 16 years.
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.240]  According to MIT Technology Review, the idea originated when Bill Gates visited Robert
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.520]  Langer's MIT lab in 2012 and asked him if it would be possible to create an implantable
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.800]  birth control device that could be turned on or off remotely.
[48:09.800 --> 48:14.160]  Langer referred Gates to the controlled release microchip technology he had invented and licensed
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.960]  to Microchips Biotechnology and the Gates Foundation granted $20 million to the firm
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.200]  to develop the implants.
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.320]  Reducing population growth has, by Gates' own admission, been a core mission of the
[48:26.320 --> 48:29.240]  Gates Foundation since its inception.
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.400]  But in order to really understand what Gates means by population control, we have to look
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.520]  beyond the concept of controlling population size.
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.520]  At its most fundamental level, the population control the Gates speaks of is not birth control,
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.260]  but control of the population itself.
[48:48.260 --> 48:52.640]  In order to understand the broader population control agenda and how it ties into the Gates
[48:52.640 --> 48:58.760]  Foundation's plans, we have to look at a puzzling development that took place in 2017.
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.760]  In that year, Gavi, the Gates Founded and Funded Alliance that partners the Gates Foundation,
[49:03.760 --> 49:08.400]  the World Health Organization and the World Bank with vaccine manufacturers to help ensure
[49:08.400 --> 49:13.720]  healthy markets for vaccines, took a strange pivot away from its core mission of vaccinating
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.960]  every child on the planet to providing every child with a digital biometric identity.
[49:19.960 --> 49:25.280]  The idea was first floated by Gavi CEO Seth Berkeley in a Nature article that year, Immunization
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.320]  Needs a Technology Boost, where he states that the goal of 100% immunization will not
[49:30.320 --> 49:36.640]  be reached without secure digital identification systems that can store a child's medical history.
[49:36.640 --> 49:39.600]  He then gives a specific example.
[49:39.600 --> 49:43.960]  We are working with a company in India called Kushi Baby, which creates off-grid digital
[49:43.960 --> 49:45.800]  health records.
[49:45.800 --> 49:51.120]  A necklace worn by infants contains a unique identification number on a short-range communication
[49:51.120 --> 49:52.560]  chip.
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.560]  Community health workers can scan the chip using a mobile phone, enabling them to update
[49:56.560 --> 50:02.200]  a child's digital record even in remote areas with little phone coverage.
[50:02.200 --> 50:07.960]  This sudden interest in digital identity was no mere passing fancy for the Vaccine Alliance.
[50:07.960 --> 50:12.800]  Gavi doubled down by becoming a founding member of the ID2020 Alliance, a public-private
[50:12.800 --> 50:18.240]  partnership dedicated to spearheading a global digital biometric identity standard.
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.640]  Other founding members of the Alliance include Gates' first company, Microsoft, and the
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.400]  Rockefeller Foundation.
[50:25.400 --> 50:31.680]  In 2018, Gavi issued a call for innovation in digital technologies for finding, identifying,
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.120]  and registering the most vulnerable children.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.480]  The call specifically requested technologies for capturing, storing, and enrolling the
[50:39.480 --> 50:45.040]  biometric details of infants on rugged biometric devices.
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.280]  Berkeley continued to follow up on this idea in public engagements as one of the new core
[50:49.280 --> 50:52.200]  missions of Gavi.
[50:52.200 --> 50:57.800]  What's interesting is that people tend to think of birth certificates as a major document.
[50:57.800 --> 51:02.800]  The most common, as I mentioned before, is not a birth certificate, is not a death certificate,
[51:02.800 --> 51:04.200]  is not a marriage certificate.
[51:04.200 --> 51:08.800]  The most common connection, vital registration for the population, is actually a child health
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.960]  card because we reach more than 90% of children with at least one dose of vaccine as part
[51:13.960 --> 51:14.960]  of routine.
[51:14.960 --> 51:16.400]  They're in the system.
[51:16.400 --> 51:20.200]  The challenge is that contact is not connected into the system.
[51:20.200 --> 51:25.440]  If you could connect it, then you have the ability to give them their basic identity papers.
[51:25.440 --> 51:30.160]  You have ability then, later on, if they want to own land or they want to have their rights,
[51:30.160 --> 51:31.640]  you're able to help them with that.
[51:31.640 --> 51:35.880]  But we're not currently taking advantage of that, and so the children get seen, they
[51:35.880 --> 51:41.520]  get enrolled in the health centers, but that information is not used for anything else.
[51:41.520 --> 51:46.680]  Although vaccines and identity may seem unrelated, Bill Gates has spent the last few years funding
[51:46.680 --> 51:50.080]  research that can bring the two ideas together.
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.000]  Late last year, Gates once again turned to Robert Langer and his MIT colleagues to investigate
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.640]  new ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[52:00.640 --> 52:04.560]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.760]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting
[52:09.760 --> 52:15.400]  microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin of vaccine recipients
[52:15.400 --> 52:20.840]  which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones.
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.000]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.240]  like a barcode tattoo.
[52:29.240 --> 52:31.760]  So who was behind this development?
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.760]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation came
[52:36.760 --> 52:42.840]  to us and said, hey, we have a real problem, knowing who's vaccinated.
[52:42.840 --> 52:46.100]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[52:46.100 --> 52:51.080]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered
[52:51.080 --> 52:54.240]  and give only the ones still needed.
[52:54.240 --> 52:58.080]  The microparticles that form the fluorescent quantum dot tags are delivered along with
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.280]  the vaccine, but they cannot be delivered by a traditional syringe.
[53:02.280 --> 53:07.200]  Instead, they must be delivered by a patch of microneedles made from a mixture of dissolvable
[53:07.200 --> 53:13.160]  sugar and a polymer called PVA as well as the quantum dot dye in the vaccine.
[53:13.160 --> 53:18.280]  It should be no surprise then that big pharma vaccine manufacturers, in their scramble to
[53:18.280 --> 53:24.120]  produce the coronavirus vaccine that Gates assures us is necessary to go back to normal,
[53:24.120 --> 53:27.240]  have turned to a novel vaccine delivery method.
[53:27.240 --> 53:56.720]  A Dissolvable Microneedle Array Patch
[53:58.160 --> 54:04.560]  As is becoming evident, this new vaccine delivered barcode-like tattoo is about much more than
[54:04.560 --> 54:09.360]  simply ensuring that children get all their Gavi-recommended immunizations.
[54:09.360 --> 54:13.840]  On a recent Ask Me Anything thread on Reddit, when asked, what changes are we going to have
[54:13.840 --> 54:19.320]  to make to how businesses operate to maintain our economy while providing social distancing,
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.000]  Bill Gates answered,
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.280]  Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently,
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.920]  or when we have a vaccine who has received it.
[54:29.920 --> 54:34.560]  In his answer, Gates fails to mention that he has himself been instrumental in kick-starting
[54:34.560 --> 54:38.840]  and funding the research into the very type of digital certificates for vaccination that
[54:38.840 --> 54:45.040]  he is speaking about, or that these digital certificates, likely, at first, to be a digital
[54:45.040 --> 54:47.040]  marker linked to a biometric ID.
[54:47.040 --> 54:49.280]  This is the end, my friends.
[54:49.280 --> 54:51.440]  My only friends, the end.
[54:51.440 --> 54:54.000]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.160]  Of everything that stands the end.
[54:57.160 --> 54:58.160]  The safety.
[54:58.160 --> 54:59.160]  The delusion.
[54:59.160 --> 55:06.200]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[55:06.200 --> 55:11.640]  partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[55:11.640 --> 55:16.600]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny, just like the history books show us, just
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.240]  like the Bible states.
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.480]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:22.480 --> 55:28.240]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[55:28.240 --> 55:31.240]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[55:31.240 --> 55:36.920]  We are repeating that again today, compliance, and going along with this system leads to
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.400]  absolute bondage.
[55:39.400 --> 55:43.480]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom, and info wars has had great victory thanks
[55:43.480 --> 55:48.200]  to your support and your prayers.
[55:48.200 --> 55:54.200]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[55:54.200 --> 56:00.160]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[56:00.160 --> 56:01.160]  comes up.
[56:01.160 --> 56:08.200]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[56:08.200 --> 56:10.360]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[56:10.360 --> 56:12.360]  DNA Force Plus.
[56:12.360 --> 56:17.520]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.000]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.520]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.360]  you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[56:30.360 --> 56:32.920]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[56:32.920 --> 56:35.800]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.080]  It doesn't make them grow, make some shrink, and slow them, which is basically the same
[56:40.080 --> 56:41.080]  thing.
[56:41.080 --> 56:49.640]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[56:49.640 --> 56:56.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[57:01.840 --> 57:06.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[57:06.640 --> 57:11.320]  In his answer, Gates fails to mention that he has himself been instrumental in kickstarting
[57:11.320 --> 57:15.560]  and funding the research into the very type of digital certificates for vaccination that
[57:15.560 --> 57:21.800]  he is speaking about, or that these digital certificates, likely, at first, to be a digital
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.920]  marker linked to a biometric ID, could very well one day take the form of vaccine-implanted
[57:26.920 --> 57:29.640]  quantum dot tattoos.
[57:29.640 --> 57:34.840]  But as in so many other aspects of the unfolding crisis, Gates' unscientific pronouncement
[57:34.840 --> 57:38.840]  that we will need digital certificates to prove our immunity in the new normal of the
[57:38.840 --> 57:51.320]  post-coronavirus world, is now being implemented by a number of governments.
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.320]  It is now being reported that on FIDO, a tech startup specializing in AI-based biometric
[57:56.320 --> 58:00.640]  ID verification, is in talks with the British government to provide the type of digital
[58:00.640 --> 58:05.040]  certification Gates mentioned, dubbed an immunity passport.
[58:05.040 --> 58:09.360]  The proposed system would require would-be workers to use the on FIDO-provided app to
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.760]  scan their face or other biometric data, link that information to a SARS-CoV-2 antibody
[58:14.760 --> 58:20.600]  test, or, eventually, proof of coronavirus vaccination, and then have their picture taken
[58:20.600 --> 58:27.120]  and immunity verified every time they wish to access a restricted space or work environment.
[58:27.120 --> 58:31.640]  Last month, on FIDO announced that it had raised $50 million in a round of investments
[58:31.640 --> 58:35.440]  led by Bill Gates' old company, Microsoft.
[58:35.440 --> 58:39.800]  But this is not Gates' first experience with the field of biometric identity.
[58:39.800 --> 58:44.480]  A decade ago, the government of India began what has been called the largest social experiment
[58:44.480 --> 58:49.960]  on Earth, enrolling over one billion people in the largest biometric identification database
[58:49.960 --> 58:51.880]  ever constructed.
[58:51.880 --> 58:56.180]  The project, involving iris scanning and fingerprinting the entirety of the Indian
[58:56.180 --> 59:00.880]  population, recording their biometric details in a centralized database, and issuing them
[59:00.880 --> 59:05.720]  a 12-digit identity number that could be used to prove residents and access government services,
[59:05.720 --> 59:11.040]  all within the span of a few years, presented an incredible societal, legal, and technological
[59:11.040 --> 59:12.040]  challenge.
[59:12.040 --> 59:16.040]  It's no surprise, then, that the person who was brought in as the chief architect of the
[59:16.040 --> 59:20.760]  ADHAR project when it was launched, Nandan Nilakani, co-founder of Indian multinational
[59:20.760 --> 59:26.000]  Infosys, is also a longtime friend of Bill Gates and a partner with Bill and Melinda Gates
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.840]  on a philanthropic venture called Co-Impact, which supports initiatives to address major
[59:30.840 --> 59:33.920]  social challenges at scale.
[59:33.920 --> 59:37.840]  Nilakani's involvement in ADHAR has even made him one of Gates' heroes, featured in
[59:37.840 --> 59:43.240]  slick video promotions produced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[59:43.240 --> 59:48.560]  My friend, Nandan Nilakani, is one of India's best-known entrepreneurs.
[59:48.560 --> 59:53.200]  He led the creation of the world's largest biometric ID system.
[59:53.200 --> 1:00:00.000]  Now, he's working to promote his platform to improve the lives of the world's core people.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:04.200]  There are more than a billion people around the world who don't have any kind of ID.
[1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:08.840]  You can't do anything in life without an ID, because people are mobile, they're migrant,
[1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:12.600]  and wherever they go, whether they want a job, or whether they want to go to a train,
[1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:16.080]  or whether they want to get a bank account, or get a mobile connection, if the person
[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:20.920]  has no way of proving who they are, then they just won't get access to these services.
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:24.680]  So the challenge we had was, how do we give a billion people, many of whom don't have
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:29.120]  birth certificates, how do we give them ID?
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.240]  And Gates has personally praised the ADHAR scheme as a huge asset for India.
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:39.040]  Well, ADHAR is a huge asset for India.
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:42.600]  It was designed very well.
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:48.680]  The fact that you can make digital payments so easily, you can open a bank account.
[1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:49.720]  India is a leader in that.
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:57.000]  ADHAR Foundation worked with the Reserve Bank, a non-Nanil and Connie and a group of people
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.760]  that he pulled together, did a great job.
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:06.240]  But Gates is not merely an arms-length admirer of the ADHAR experiment.
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:10.440]  He is not only personally connected to its chief architect, he is also connected to one
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:16.560]  of the key companies that spearheaded the technology that underlies the project's biometric database.
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:21.160]  The company that provides the iris recognition technology at the core of the ADHAR system,
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:26.360]  IDEMIA, also provides facial recognition systems for the Chinese government, and is currently
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:30.640]  developing digital driver's licenses for use in the United States.
[1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:35.480]  IDEMIA even created the cushy baby identification necklaces with embedded microchips that Gavi
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:39.160]  CEO Seth Berkley touted in his Nature article.
[1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:43.280]  Unsurprisingly, the company received support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:47.000]  through its involvement in the GSMA Inclusive Tech Lab.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:56.240]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.880]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:01.800]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.680]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:06.880]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:13.120]  With all of the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:18.520]  praising communist China for their response, and if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:22.840]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well, then gee,
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:23.840]  we've got to do that.
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:28.400]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:29.400]  virus.
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.760]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:37.960]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.920]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.040]  power grab.
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:47.360]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:51.400]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:03:04.320]  their operation that much quicker.
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:10.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:17.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Harrison Smith.
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:23.080]  I am joined here by fellow infowars reporter Greg Reese, and I know I'm personally honored
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:29.040]  and I feel quite a bit of pressure sitting behind this desk, especially at such an important
[1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:34.680]  time period in the history of humanity and where we are now, the crucible, where truly
[1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.720]  what happens in the next few days, the next few months, will decide the fate of all of
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:39.720]  humanity.
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:45.000]  So what an honor it is to be with you here today on the 19th of May, 2020, so many stories
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  to get into.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.880]  Greg, what are you looking at?
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:49.880]  Basically, COVID.
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:57.160]  I've been looking at for several months as COVID, Bill Gates, COVID, or vaccinations.
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:04.160]  Yeah, those Corbett reports on Bill Gates are pretty good.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:07.760]  I recommend everyone checking them out, and they're all on band.video right now, I believe.
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:10.360]  Yeah, they're on band.video and infowars.com.
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:15.040]  James Corbett does just incredible work, so definitely get those and spread those.
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.680]  Bill Gates is a supervillain.
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:20.280]  This is my realization.
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:21.480]  He's a literal supervillain.
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:27.280]  I actually went through and started to look at some of the most famous supervillains around
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:30.600]  these days, and they literally sound like Bill Gates.
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.720]  You have, of course, from the Marvel series, you have Thanos.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  His whole point is, I'm going to save people by killing half the people.
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:38.720]  There's too many people.
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.280]  Over a population, we have to cull the population, which is just literally, it sounds like a Bill
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:46.000]  Gates TED talk.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.160]  And then, of course, you have this story here, Harvard scientists begin an experiment to
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:50.920]  block out the sun.
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:54.120]  This is something that Bill Gates is involved with.
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:58.920]  In fact, we have a video of this, I think we can go to this.
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:04:59.920]  This is clip number two.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:06.640]  This is Bill Gates explaining his plan to save the world, clip number two.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:12.320]  Do we have that?
[1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:13.640]  We'll get that in just a second.
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:16.520]  The engineers are hard at work.
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  But how do you describe the person who wants to block out the sun and cull the population
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:28.440]  in order to save the population and is involved in vaccine catastrophes that just do terrible
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:33.360]  things to people all over the world, and then goes on TV and celebrates himself?
[1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:35.040]  He is literally a supervillain.
[1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:39.680]  In fact, I think one of the Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor in one of the new Superman
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:40.680]  Batman movies.
[1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:43.920]  And if you go to the Wikipedia, it's like the author was like, oh, I based this off
[1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:44.920]  Bill Gates.
[1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:47.560]  I wanted a Bill Gates-like character.
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:48.560]  So I don't know.
[1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:54.920]  Why do you think people don't recognize the just a supervillain of Bill Gates?
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:56.480]  I honestly think that some people do.
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:02.600]  I think that there are a lot of people out there that have bought the whole population
[1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:04.760]  control global warming thing.
[1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:10.240]  I remember reading a document about 10 years ago that was a leaked document that was basically
[1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.800]  saying the world is now ready to be told about population control.
[1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:16.080]  They've been conditioned enough to accept it.
[1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:21.560]  So I think there are a lot of people out here that think that this is a good thing.
[1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:22.560]  You know?
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:23.560]  Well, here's the amazing thing.
[1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:24.560]  You can watch.
[1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:29.680]  There's an interview with Mike Wallace and the creator of Planned Parenthood, whatever
[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:35.800]  her demonic name is, and this was in the 1950s, and she was pushing population control because
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:36.800]  of overpopulation.
[1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:38.200]  They were terrified of overpopulation.
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:41.840]  You know, it's going to double in this long, and of course, what actually happened was
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:46.320]  that the global population far exceeded their most dire predictions.
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:50.440]  We have way more people on earth than they ever thought was possible, and yet we have
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:53.400]  less poverty, less starvation than we ever have had before.
[1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:58.880]  Of course, if we'd followed their suggestions back in the 1950s, maybe, you know, the person
[1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:04.160]  who invented the, you know, crop technique that allowed people to be fed and allowed
[1:07:04.160 --> 1:07:06.520]  the population to grow, maybe they would have never been born.
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:10.680]  You just can't manipulate the human race in the way these people think that you can,
[1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:13.400]  including Bill Gates, who I'm told now we have this video.
[1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:14.760]  This is Bill Gates.
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:20.000]  What they call it is stratospheric controlled perturbation experiment.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.480]  That's the scientific term for it, but here's what it looks like.
[1:07:23.480 --> 1:07:28.880]  Here's Bill Gates trying to block out the sun.
[1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:37.640]  Oh, sorry, you've certainly vanquished all your enemies.
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:40.360]  The elementary school, the local tavern, the old age home.
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:42.040]  You must be very proud.
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:48.040]  No, not all my greatest nemesis still provides our customers with free light, heat and energy.
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:55.040]  They call this enemy the sun.
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:08:04.440]  Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun.
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:07.280]  I will do the next best thing.
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:10.280]  Block it out.
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:14.960]  Good God.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:15.960]  Imagine it, Smithies.
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:19.320]  Electrical lights and heaters running all day long.
[1:08:19.320 --> 1:08:21.760]  But sir, every plant and tree will die.
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:24.080]  Owls will deafen us with incessant hooting.
[1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:27.160]  Just the town sundial will be useless.
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:29.040]  I don't want any part of this project.
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:31.640]  It's unconscionably fiendish.
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:33.440]  I will not suffer your insubordination.
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:37.240]  There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadieing, Whelan, and
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:40.200]  you will fall into line now.
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:41.200]  No.
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:42.760]  No, Marty, I won't.
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:45.440]  That's Bill Gates.
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:52.480]  And I mean, literally, you go from cartoonish supervillain like C. Montgomery Burns to the
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:55.920]  literal manifestation of this in Bill Gates.
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.520]  Harvard research team intends to spray tiny chalk particles into the stratosphere in a
[1:08:59.520 --> 1:09:01.160]  controlled experiment.
[1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:06.000]  Computer models can only go so far in predicting the impacts with this geo-engineering technique.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.280]  But don't worry about that.
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:09.120]  Don't worry about predicting the effects.
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.040]  Don't worry about trying to figure out whether this will actually be a long-term positive
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.040]  solution.
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:15.040]  Don't worry about that.
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:16.920]  Just go ahead and block out the sun.
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.720]  It is time for a real-world test, they say, with funding in part by Microsoft co-founder
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:25.600]  Bill Gates, the Harvard team will begin to answer the remaining questions as early as
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.280]  the spring of 2019.
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:33.040]  So yes, this has been going on for a year, the Harvard scientist experimenting to block
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:36.000]  out the sun with help from Bill Gates.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.280]  And that's just the beginning.
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:44.080]  You go on to talk about the population control, the coaling of people in poverty.
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:45.480]  It's like these people in charge.
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:50.320]  They literally think that you would rather be dead than be poor and sickening.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:55.400]  Yeah, and in the matrix, that's how the humans tried to beat the machines was to block out
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:56.400]  the sun.
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.200]  And that ended up giving AI the upper hand and breeding people as batteries and stuff.
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:01.200]  It's just insane.
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:07.480]  The solutions that they come up to are just as draconian as the problems that they think
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.040]  that they're solving.
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:14.320]  And again, it's like you just type in supervillain, go find some lists, top 25 supervillains of
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:17.720]  all time or whatever, and just read through what their plans are.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.320]  And they all sound exactly like Bill Gates' plans.
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:22.320]  It really is a simple of that.
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:27.320]  And then, of course, there's the greatest supervillain of them all, Satan, right?
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:31.440]  The old school, the classic, the doctor doom of the Bible.
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.080]  His whole plan, of course, as we know from revelations, is to microchip everybody, track
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:38.640]  everyone, keep everyone in a one world government.
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:43.680]  I mean, this stuff is laid out in that wonderful book known as the Bible.
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:47.480]  And that's exactly the team that these people are on.
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:53.760]  You just have to look at some of the old James Bond movies with Blowfield on Her Majesty's
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:59.120]  Secret Service, Lex Luthor, Thanos, Scarecrow, of course, one punch man, if you're a fan
[1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:04.040]  of anime, there's one punch man, one of his nemeses is a vaccine man who literally wants
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:07.720]  to vaccinate the earth in order to protect the environment.
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:11.960]  I mean, there's a reason that all of this stuff sounds familiar.
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:14.720]  It's because we've heard these stories that we're now seeing play out in real life.
[1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:19.440]  We've heard them over and over and over again in fantasy and in fiction.
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  And yet here we are.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:25.280]  So how do we stand up against a literal supervillain when they aren't wearing tights and a metal
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:29.480]  helmet and coming out and saying, wow, I'm doing this for evil when they couch everything
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:31.680]  in, oh, but it's for your own good.
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:33.480]  It's for your safety.
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:36.320]  You're hurting everybody if you don't let us do this.
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:41.040]  How do you fight back against a supervillain who seemingly has all of the media on his
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:42.040]  side?
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  How do you fight back against this?
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:44.040]  I'm looking at you, Greg.
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:47.480]  Greg's like looking over his shoulder like, oh, am I supposed to know the answer to this?
[1:11:47.480 --> 1:11:50.160]  Well, no, you're, you're, it's interesting because you're talking about these supervillains
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:53.120]  and it's making me think of The Watchman, which is a great movie.
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:55.960]  I never read the comic, but the movie, I really enjoyed the movie.
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:58.680]  And I can't think of the villain's name in that.
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:03.840]  It was, I think he named himself after an Egyptian pharaoh or something like that.
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:09.800]  But the character that was trying to expose the plan, Rorschach, was sort of painted as
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:16.480]  like a low life villain scum for, as if the message of that movie that I thought when
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.920]  I watched it was, was keep your mouth shut and don't try to expose this because it's
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:21.920]  a necessary plan.
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:22.920]  Right.
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:23.920]  You don't understand.
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.080]  You're just a little, a little cretin down there that doesn't understand the big brain
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:30.640]  plans that we have to eliminate life on earth.
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.040]  It's, it's emblematic, right?
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:36.360]  But everything Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, any, you know, major work of fiction that
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:39.760]  captures the imagination of mankind has this in it.
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.160]  People just don't recognize that, you know, in the matrix, the machines are, are the bad
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:45.160]  guys.
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:46.160]  You know, do you, do you not realize this?
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:47.640]  The orcs are the bad guys.
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:49.520]  Hopefully we can realize this.
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:50.880]  Many videos on the other side.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:52.880]  Don't go anywhere, folks.
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.040]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:59.640]  economy to where it is.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:05.400]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:10.120]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:14.480]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.480]  mega banks.
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:18.720]  They're not going to have medical ID cards forced inoculations.
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:25.560]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:32.200]  backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:36.880]  uncover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.600]  moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:46.200]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:49.640]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.760]  your lives and our lives.
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:52.760]  Congratulations.
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:55.320]  I'm always excited about Info War's live products.
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:56.320]  They're amazing.
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:57.320]  They're cutting edge.
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:58.320]  You love them.
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:13:59.320]  I love them.
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:01.360]  And they find the Info War in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:07.960]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:15.720]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:18.040]  And there's another innovation.
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:20.040]  It's the spray cap.
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:26.240]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:27.600]  it in a really great way.
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:32.120]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face, it's got organic alcohol in
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:36.280]  it, so spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it personally as something that's
[1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:38.000]  a moisturizer as well.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.760]  So this is a real innovation.
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:43.840]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:47.680]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out, smells great.
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.600]  It's so refreshing.
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:56.560]  This is a big winner.
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:16.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:18.320]  We are back.
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:24.360]  Your co-hosts for today while Alex Jones is out, myself, Greg Reese and Harrison Smith
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:28.200]  here in the Alex Jones live studio.
[1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:34.640]  Just to show that this is happening all over the world right now, there is a massive move
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:41.440]  by the New World Order, whatever you want to call them, to bring some type of global
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.680]  communist government throughout the entire world right now over this whole COVID thing
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:46.680]  that's going on.
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:51.880]  So let's go to clip six, global police state right now, just for a couple of minutes of
[1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:58.400]  highlights of what's going on with these police all over the world taking on these protesters
[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:27.240]  that just want to open things back up and work and live their lives.
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:57.160]  The four-year-old's son is scared, they're ripped apart, his son, kicking at the door
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:03.080]  and screaming, held back by two officers.
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:08.160]  First protestor of the day to get arrested for violating the public health order.
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:35.160]  He was arrested another man after this protestor got on the beach.
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:57.240]  We're seeing just clip after clip of police just haul people away, throwing them to the
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:06.440]  ground, headlocks, I mean complete police state behavior.
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:11.760]  What you're seeing right now on Bandod video is a link to an article whistle blower reveals
[1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:19.600]  state run media mind control in the UK and this is a full episode from UK column news
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:24.920]  in the UK that just came out within the past week and it's very interesting if you have
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.400]  a long attention span I highly recommend checking out the full video because they really break
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:34.680]  this down but I just sort of did a quick edit right here for the segment and I'm going to
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:40.240]  go over it and I'm also anticipating a short video report on this as well.
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:47.120]  It's very revealing and it should be no surprise to a lot of our audience but I mean now we're
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:48.440]  getting the actual documents.
[1:18:48.440 --> 1:18:53.280]  So basically before we play this short edit I did of the UK column I'm just going to go
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:55.800]  over basically some of the stuff that they cover in this hour.
[1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:02.240]  One of the things they cover is this article called Mindspace and this is a very big article
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.840]  this is from the Institute for Government the cabinet office of the UK you can download
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:15.040]  it online it's a PDF Mindspace influencing behavior through public policy and it goes
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:22.040]  on to say use applying Mindspace to public to policy making traditional ways of changing
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:27.440]  behavior such as legislation regulation and incentives can be very effective Mindspace
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:32.200]  does not attempt to replace these methods rather it extends and enhances them adding
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:37.440]  new dimensions that reflect fundamental but often neglected influences on behavior in
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:42.280]  basic terms Mindspace represents the tools for changing behavior and it basically just
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:51.120]  goes on to show how people can be manipulated psychologically into being more compliant.
[1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:57.560]  Now the main document that they mentioned in this video this is a released a leaked document
[1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:05.160]  from the scientific advisory group for emergencies in the UK SAGE SAGE is an interesting organization
[1:20:05.160 --> 1:20:10.640]  in that they are secretive like they're not allowed I mean they're allowed to keep secret
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:15.400]  as to the members on the board the members on the board can volunteer who they are such
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:20.320]  as Professor Chris Whitty chief medical officer for England has revealed that he is on the
[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:27.320]  board of SAGE and we also know that in 2008 Professor Chris Whitty received 40 million
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:33.440]  dollars by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for malaria research in Africa which is very
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:40.240]  interesting and so a document that came out of SAGE that's dated March 22nd 2020 it's
[1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:46.720]  called options for increasing adherence to social distancing measures increasing adherence
[1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:51.600]  increasing adherence and so that's the background for the video and let's play the video number
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:55.520]  eight UK column right now and that should basically give you an overview of what's going
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:21:03.200]  on in the UK and that covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number
[1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:10.320]  of coronavirus cases and in turn that covid alert level will tell us how tough we have
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:15.960]  to be in our social distancing measures the lower the level the fewer the measures the
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:22.280]  higher the level the tougher and stricter we will have to be there will be five alert
[1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:31.960]  levels level one means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five is the most
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:38.600]  critical the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed over the
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:44.560]  period of the lockdown we've been in level four and it's thanks to your sacrifice we're
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:52.840]  now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three and as we go everyone will
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:58.640]  have a role to play in keeping the order the little swingometer or no there was a little
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:04.800]  thing moving down the number of numbers and it hesitated it didn't even move down a whole
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:11.800]  degree it hesitated this is deliberate mind manipulation and in a minute we're going to
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:18.120]  show you how real this vicious attack by the UK government on the minds of its population
[1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:27.760]  is several times now Chris I've said to you I can tell you that number because the experts
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:32.040]  tell me it's not possible to save a certainty what that is so the experts have told Nicola
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:37.480]  Sturgeon that it's not possible to know what that number is so how are they going to run
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:43.720]  their traffic light system if they don't know what R naught is they are still after getting
[1:22:43.720 --> 1:22:50.120]  Bill Gates vaccines to everybody in the country before we're free but this is the bit we need
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:55.960]  to concentrate on the scientific advisory group for emergency sage and what have we
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:03.480]  got to report well we were given two days ago an internal document from sage so here's
[1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:10.480]  the government talking about persuasion per perceived threat a substantial number of people
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:17.400]  do not feel sufficiently personally threatened it could be that they're reassured by the
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:22.920]  low death rate in their demographic group although levels of concern may be rising and what does
[1:23:22.920 --> 1:23:28.840]  it go on to say they're in bold the perceived level of personal threat needs to be quote
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:35.640]  increased amongst those who are complacent using heart-hitting emotional messaging to
[1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:41.240]  be effective this must also empower people by making clear the actions they can take
[1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:46.360]  to reduce the threat now that last statement Mike is not about the action we'll be back

[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.720]  all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:09.600]  distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:16.040]  you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:20.600]  the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:27.000]  the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:32.720]  it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:38.280]  straightjacket on us before they carry out their in game which is global depopulation
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:44.880]  so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:52.960]  hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die we are 170 days
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:59.640]  out from the 2020 election it is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:04.160]  and Obama Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:09.360]  Trump's election and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:14.440]  now they've been pushing COVID-19 shut down the economy and created depression well China
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.960]  has already been open for business for more than a month this is an ongoing globalist
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  attempt to punish the American people wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.080]  that it is they the new world order that have orchestrated this and not President Trump
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:33.240]  they know their crimes are coming out they know the chickens are coming home to roost
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:38.920]  so now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[1:26:38.920 --> 1:26:45.520]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19 the entire COVID-19 system is a giant hopes and
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:53.800]  must be exposed if America has any hope so get out there and expose this fraud you're
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:27:17.600]  listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:26.160]  Alex Jones Harrison Smith and Gregory sitting in for Alex Jones on this 19th of May 2020
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:31.000]  we watched a video in that last segment about the color coded charts that they're now rolling
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:37.880]  out for you know whatever COVID coronavirus threat levels like they did with the terrorism
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.320]  chart I mean this is all about programming people to be able to accept complete control
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:47.480]  and being dictated when they can leave their house when they can't so now we have a nice
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:52.400]  a nice color-coded little chart course Austin Texas is coming out with one a couple places
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:57.880]  in the United States is also coming out with this one of the craziest clips in that I'm
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:02.200]  not sure how clear this was but they say okay we're gonna make this chart it's based on
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:07.720]  our which is the rate of transmissibility or whatever they said and then they're asked
[1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:11.200]  so what exactly is you know do you know what the value of our is and they say well the
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:16.560]  scientists say there is no possible way to know what the value of our is okay so you're
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:20.040]  shutting down the government based on this chart that's based off this value that you
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:24.880]  would make you don't know how to calculate just what is going on did was I missing something
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.480]  here Greg or did I hear that correctly no that's true and if you watch the full video
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:34.000]  they get into to asking the question why are they calling it are because the actual mathematic
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:39.440]  equation is are not and that and they're not saying are not so they're in this full hour
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:45.400]  they're actually saying are they just abbreviating it or are they creating a new definition but
[1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:50.440]  it doesn't matter if it's if they either way they're like you said they're announcing
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:55.440]  that there's no way for us to know what are is so you just have to trust us and you can
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:00.840]  see if you got a document cam if you have time you can see here that you know Boris Johnson
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:06.240]  who after he got allegedly got COVID and came out he seemed to have a whole new outlook
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:13.200]  on life and how great the the the Ministry of Health or whatever it's called there in
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:17.400]  England is doing a great job and he's all behind him and he's side by side with our
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:23.840]  professor Chris Whitty who received 40 million from Bill Gates just like our President Trump
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:30.600]  is side by side with Fauci so we see Gates all over the place in this funding the whole
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:34.600]  thing in the break I just asked you recently because there's some reports out about how
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:39.120]  the Chinese Army is now in South Africa his consultations helping them with the whole
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:44.600]  COVID thing so this is happening worldwide and we can see now what the game is in this
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:48.560]  last video of this leaked document from Sage because it's happening in here in America
[1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:52.920]  too for example I would argue that this is exactly why they're trying to silence all
[1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:57.600]  this talk about you know alternative cures and stuff because they want people afraid
[1:29:57.600 --> 1:30:02.040]  they want to amp up the fear so that they can then shut things down more they want
[1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:07.440]  to compliant public that obeys these color scheme charts absolutely and and of course
[1:30:07.440 --> 1:30:11.520]  you know the hydrochloroquine you know when that comes out you just look at the difference
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:15.960]  of reporting with that where it's just it's this dangerous untested unproven sort of
[1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:21.000]  thing and then you know some big pharmaceutical company comes out with a proprietary supposed
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.400]  preventative measure and all of the articles are could this be the miracle cure we've been
[1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:29.840]  waiting for and you know is is this going to be the vaccine that saves us all it's
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:34.360]  like alright it's untested they just came up with it in the last month it's not proven
[1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:40.800]  at all and yet the way it's being covered is is so hopeful and energetic and yet when
[1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:45.200]  you come out with something that has been shown to be able to help with the coronavirus
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:52.040]  it's completely crudded on let's just say since we are over the radio now and you also
[1:30:52.040 --> 1:30:57.120]  talk about the difference between America and Europe and how the European lack of free
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:00.960]  speech is sort of making its way over to America but it is you know it's videos like that it's
[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:06.200]  videos like the Canadian couple who was taken out of their home for for their own safety
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:10.960]  right you heard that a bunch because basically they stand up stood up against the hand the
[1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:15.320]  local Hamilton Ontario government and they were dragged out of their homes for mental
[1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:19.960]  health evaluations and it really makes you value the first amendment and remember that
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:23.640]  as bad as things are getting here as much as the private companies will do everything
[1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:28.960]  they can to destroy free speech and we'll be getting into a twitch and some other big
[1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:34.240]  tech companies on that front in just a little bit it still makes you realize we at least
[1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:37.280]  have that first amendment so at least we're starting off on a better place we at least
[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:41.880]  just have to protect the first amendment where places like England and Canada basically
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:46.680]  everywhere except America I guess you could say are starting off on on much farther back
[1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:50.040]  in their attempts to just speak freely and get the truth out there and I want to play
[1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:55.080]  this video this was and this just shows some of the anger that's being felt around the
[1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:59.840]  world this is from Ireland this video is actually tweeted out by Michelle Malkin and she tweeted
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:04.080]  out saying that the account that originally posted the video was deleted off Twitter
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:08.640]  and the video is quickly deleted off Twitter so figure hey if Twitter's deleting this video
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:12.360]  it's probably something that our audience would want to know about and it gives you
[1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:16.400]  a little taste of exactly how people around the world the regular people you know the
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:20.960]  people who the governments are supposed to represent how they feel about the just absolute
[1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:25.920]  travesty of freedom that that the travesty of representation you'll see this is locked
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:29.000]  down Ireland the breakout begins at 5 p.m. tonight apparently
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:37.680]  okay so the judge has gone to make his judgments we've asked him could he please given that
[1:32:37.680 --> 1:32:43.040]  we are effectively in a state of martial law in this country that there has been an effective
[1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:51.640]  coup by an unelected government a government firmly rejected by the Irish people in February
[1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:56.560]  and at least three ministers who do not even have seats in the door given all of this we've
[1:32:56.560 --> 1:33:02.160]  asked the judge could he please make his order quickly so that we could get to the substantial
[1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:08.920]  hearing so look we feel that a lot of games went on today and he said that we were making
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:17.240]  a full frontal attack with his exact terminology wasn't it on the separation of powers effectively
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:24.320]  well we would say very differently that this is a full frontal attack on Bonrock, Nihara
[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:31.080]  and on our most basic fundamental freedoms we really believe given that the people of
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:37.880]  Ireland are under house arrest but the children of Ireland cannot go to school that the elderly
[1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:43.840]  of Ireland cannot get the health care that they need they cannot see their families
[1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:52.400]  many of them are dying alone so many citizens that the people who pay the tax pay the extreper
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:34:00.280]  to keep everything moving the parents of these children the sons and daughters of these elderly
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:06.880]  people that they are stopped from earning their livelihoods are small businesses who
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:14.040]  are the backbone of our economy are broken they are broken well here we are at the end
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:19.760]  of the process the idea that they serve the Irish people just like RTE they are forgotten
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  they are forgotten and that's what we need to do and that's part of what we're doing
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:30.120]  with this case to say we can risk everything we're not afraid to risk anything because
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:37.320]  no matter what we have as human beings now it will be worthless if they succeed in doing
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:44.400]  to our country what they want to do to it so that spirit that you see on display there
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:50.360]  is exactly why the globalists of the world are intent on destroying the American people
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:55.880]  and the European people that unwillingness to submit to absolute control this unfair
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:34:59.640]  house arrest but the beginning of that clip what she's talking about is you know there
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.280]  are people that have run for office in Ireland they weren't voted into office people of Ireland
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:08.520]  rejected them but they get around this by appointing them to unelected positions under
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.080]  the guise of well it's an emergency we have to do this and we're seeing this in America
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:19.160]  to even a more extreme extent we're in places like New York the governor Andrew Cuomo tweets
[1:35:19.160 --> 1:35:24.120]  out you know I've invited Bill Gates and the Bill Gates Foundation to come in and redo
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:28.960]  our entire education system and oh because of this coronavirus we've invited Eric Schmidt
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:34.520]  of Google to come in and be a board you know to create a committee to redesigning every
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.640]  aspect of life in New York and it's like okay nobody voted for Bill Gates nobody voted for
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:45.760]  Eric Schmidt these people are technocratic billionaire industrial monsters essentially
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:50.040]  complete supervillains and they don't have to appeal to the people they don't have to
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:55.160]  lay out what their plans for the people are in order to get approval for that they simply
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.600]  get in through the back door you have Andrew Cuomo just inviting them in just saying hey
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:05.440]  come install your technocracy there's from Andrew Cuomo as we prepare to reopen we have
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:09.760]  the opportunity to reimagine and build back our education system better we will work with
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:15.440]  the Gates Foundation and develop a blueprint to do this why why does the Gates Foundation
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:21.960]  get carte blanche why do they get a blank check to rewrite the education system in New York
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:28.360]  and what does the coronavirus have to do with that at all it makes no sense at all and there's
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:32.080]  this from Andrew Cuomo as well the federal government must develop fair rules now to
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:36.800]  ensure any future vaccine is available to all and he also goes on to literally invite Eric
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:43.360]  Schmidt of Google to take over just take over life just let's redesign life from the ground
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:48.240]  up because we're not happy with all this all this freedom everyone seems to enjoy it's
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:53.520]  sickening the America that we've known and loved the America that was the land of the
[1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:58.920]  free home of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about
[1:36:58.920 --> 1:37:03.960]  domesticating us shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:08.760]  begun the depression is going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too
[1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:12.840]  late now to even turn back Trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working with
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:18.840]  the tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else has to get prepared now do
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.360]  not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed

[1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.080]  blowing off the hook I can't walk in a grocery store now where I'm instead of a few people
[1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:48.760]  shaking man here and there I'm being mobbed by everyone saying it's all a hoax you're
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:53.760]  totally right it's crap it's BS it's New World Order Bill Gates is a demon you go to any
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:42:00.560]  video ABC News CBS NBC CNN and every comment is Bill Gates is a eugenicist here's a link
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:05.760]  to him saying depopulate the planet the next clip the next link is to somebody else exposing
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:12.200]  him what's exciting is the people are all telling me in the street or I'm seeing it online
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:17.680]  that they're researching and they're finding stuff I never found you'd think I know everything
[1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:23.160]  about Bill Gates I don't devastating new videos are coming out of them in a ward bank what's
[1:42:23.160 --> 1:42:28.680]  going we're here to depopulate giving awards for eugenics just 15 years ago I mean it's
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:34.400]  insane in fact I can hardly even sleep at night now so much stuff's coming in we're
[1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:40.320]  airing it all on the show or as much as we can but here's the problem I'm not stupid
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:45.720]  neither are you they're punching us they were on top of us we got pissed got them off of
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:52.060]  us politically gave them a big right hook knocked them down they're getting up we just knocked
[1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:55.720]  their ass on the ground these people don't give up so the fight starting right now like
[1:42:55.720 --> 1:43:00.400]  when we invaded Europe to free Europe from the Nazis and the Battle of the Bulls they
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:06.060]  had their big counter offensive that they launched and just I'm telling you get yourselves
[1:43:06.060 --> 1:43:13.200]  ready spread the word pray to God and just absolutely understand that this is crunch
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.120]  time because they are going to launch their counter offensive there listen they fell with
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:21.520]  Russia gate they fell Ukraine gate they fell to totally smashed economy so far people are
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:25.240]  waking up to the COVID-19 hoax now it's leading right back to Gates and Fauci running the
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:31.120]  Wuhan facility they're going to launch something really big really really quick we should all
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:36.960]  be debating now what's the next big hoax I said in October November I think it'll be
[1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:41.880]  a bio attack and that's why I use the whole image of the spaceman on earth because things
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:46.920]  would be biologically you know so dangerous that humans couldn't live on the planet that
[1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:51.360]  was what I was seeing in their pre-programming and then we had event 201 and lockstep and
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:55.800]  all the rest of it so we need to now cogitate and really meditate really focus really pray
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:02.200]  and seek God and a discernment to see what the next attacks going to be separately I've
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:06.600]  been so busy fighting the globalist and working on some inside baseball stuff that I'm taking
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:10.560]  off the next few days to work on the Bill Gates film and to get a bunch of other projects
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:15.840]  completed and major investigative journalism and so I've been so busy we haven't had time
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:18.760]  to come up with a new special we have to end this big mega cell in a couple days we've
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:22.680]  extended it because a bunch of our best-selling items are selling out vitamin mineral fusion
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:27.960]  by the time you watch this will be sold out bodies will be sold out in a couple of days
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:33.760]  X3 tri iodine is about to sell out 60% off ultra 12 40% off about to sell out pollen
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:38.760]  bought so solid a day or two they're still major league discounted but ultimate krill

[1:44:45.080 --> 1:44:49.000]  plus that's the one you should really get or the eye down they're both incredible that's
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.760]  what it was all living defense for the first time I'm out of time I want to get back to
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:57.120]  Harrison Smith I want to get back to Paul Joseph Watson I want to get back to all the
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:02.640]  great host like Greg Reister taken over the next few days with Owen shroyer but I'm going
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:06.960]  to be here in the ATX fighting hard but take action find the info or get great products
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:13.600]  you need an info or store dot com you only lose by not taking action exactly right it's
[1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:18.720]  an apathy that will end us in the end Harrison Smith and Greg Reese here on the Alex Jones
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:23.120]  show will be taking you through the remainder of this hour and into the next hour and then
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:27.440]  in the fourth hour Paul Joseph Watson will take over to close out the show before the
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.240]  war room begins at 6pm central standard time now I want to play this video this video has
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:36.280]  been making its rounds on Twitter I believe it originally came out of eight channels just
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:40.720]  that you know an anonymous video that somebody edited but it is very good it's excellent
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:47.120]  it has Tucker Carlson and features many of the Republican neocon rhino traders that
[1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:53.400]  have kept us in this mess and he makes a great point about how the blame is there to go around
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:59.080]  it's not all the Democrats we've been failed by those who claim to stand up for us so we'll
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:05.920]  go to this video and then discuss all of the new multitudinous you know new news with with
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:10.840]  obama gate is literally today there's been like today and yesterday there have been like
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:15.080]  12 new advancements in this story so we'll discuss all that after this video from an
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:19.920]  anonymous editor somewhere out there in the Internet here it is do you know anybody who
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:23.800]  trust the government anymore there's a reason for that and by the way such as Democrats
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:27.640]  you should blame the vast majority of the Russian collusion investigation occurred during the
[1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:31.880]  first two years of this administration who ran the government then at the time Republicans
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:35.480]  control both houses of Congress and every single committee by definition they had the
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:40.960]  power to expose this hoax and to shut it down but they did not is Lindsey Graham and Mitch
[1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:45.680]  McConnell and Richard Burr and so many of the other useless Senate Republicans total
[1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:52.320]  phonies they didn't really do anything Richard Burr he is calling Don Trump Jr. back Senator
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:56.080]  Burr who's well respected he doesn't want to be lied to he wants to get to the bottom
[1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:59.640]  of what happened and Republican Senator Richard Burr had served the president's son with
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:04.240]  a subpoena can you explain why the Republican would want to do that gaudy disputes Trump
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:09.120]  spy claim I think gaudy's appearance was disgraced according to gaudy the FBI ran it by the
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:12.320]  block how the Americans would have wanted them to run the investigation really didn't
[1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:16.720]  give me a break you said I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what Americans would
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.920]  want them to do there was no spy have you seen any evidence of that I have not that
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:25.200]  we think you would want the FBI to find out whether or not there was any validity to what
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:29.400]  those people were saying the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to
[1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:33.760]  do he says the FBI did exactly what we should want them to do the number one question I
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:38.200]  get asked from Americans is why no one's gone to jail and been held accountable it was Paul
[1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:42.040]  Ryan and Trey gaudy that wouldn't give us that subpoena power we didn't send out a single
[1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:48.160]  subpoena not one I supported the Mueller investigation because I didn't know senator we're talking
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:55.360]  about a shredding of constitutional law due process that we would ever have you say that
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.960]  Mueller is a good guy right that's been my experience yes and you'll do anything necessary
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:05.760]  to protect him from being interfered with absolutely well where's director Ray though
[1:48:05.760 --> 1:48:09.640]  I've got a lot of people yelling at me tonight he's not doing his job and you'll do anything
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:16.880]  necessary to protect him absolutely somebody that every American should trust Mr. Mueller
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:22.320]  of Mueller he was an excellent appointment he will go wherever the facts lead him he
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.000]  will have great credibility people want you to move on this senator are you gonna do it
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:31.400]  yeah but I've told you that I'll tell you again total phonies can tell you they're representing
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:36.760]  you but don't explain why they didn't really do anything to stop the derailment of America
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:43.240]  while it was in progress is exactly right and that video makes it abundantly clear to the
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:48.320]  failure of the so-called Republicans the so-called conservatives there in Washington and their
[1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:53.600]  absolute inability to mount any sort of effective resistance against the Democrats who are just
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:49:00.480]  hell-bent on destroying everything we have grown to love here as Americans now I think
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:04.960]  some of the neocons are finally sensing the the pushback you've ran Paul calling out a
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:09.560]  bunch of them of course you've talked Carlson calling out all of them you have a groundswell
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:15.200]  of disdain for these people and I think they're they're kind of feeling it here just some
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:19.320]  of the updates from the last few days from the House judiciary GOP Twitter account breaking
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:24.760]  after failing to hear from FBI director Christopher Ray Jim Jordan and Mike Johnson invite Bill
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:31.640]  pre-strip and Joe Piant Piant to appear before the judiciary committee so of course Bill
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.880]  pre-stap was the FBI agent who was the author of that memo talking about trying to get
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:43.040]  general Flynn to lie so they're making some moves to try to get some of these criminals
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:47.960]  in front of them to answer some questions Lindsey Graham also again seemingly finally
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:53.800]  after you know so long far too late he starts to make some moves Lindsey Graham sets to vote
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:58.840]  to subpoena Comey Brennan and dozens more in oversight of crossfire hurricane so that
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:04.080]  vote will take place on June 4th as to whether to authorize subpoenas for documents and testimony
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:08.920]  from more than 50 current or former government officials so don't get your hopes up they'll
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:13.160]  probably throw a wrench in the works you know when it comes down to it but you know at least
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:18.040]  there's at least it seems that they're at least in some small way hearing the anger
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.200]  and the fury coming out of the American people of course AG Barr is again you know once again
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.800]  just being this almost Sphinx like a enigma as to whether or not he's a good guy and so
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:34.400]  AG Barr downplays Obama gate he says I don't expect Obama and Biden will be criminally
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:39.960]  investigated which personally is a mistake in my opinion we know these people we know
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:43.720]  their names we know what they've done we know when they do did it and how they did it and
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:49.120]  how they justified it and how they lied about it so there's a list of people who are traitors
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.200]  who are criminals who are anti-American scum and need to be called out for it so William
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:59.520]  Barr is now in the position of either you know executing warrants and and bringing
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:04.320]  justice to these people on the list or being on the list himself so that's the position
[1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:11.720]  he finds himself in as we move further into obama gate there's a great article on yahoo
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:17.440]  news obama gate is not a conspiracy theory re breaks down just the overwhelming evidence
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:22.120]  for obama gate compares it to rush a gate and the lack of evidence there and just lays
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.040]  it out quite clearly look this isn't a conspiracy theory these are the facts here are the facts
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:31.720]  that we know do you think that sounds like a conspiracy maybe you're one of us maybe
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:35.520]  you need to come on over and join the good side we'll be right back Gregory Harrison
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:42.600]  Smith on the Alex Jones show don't go anywhere folks what info wars has been able to do thanks

[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:55.760]  and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:03.680]  is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:10.080]  the globalist are being externalized you must decide which side you're on living in denial
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:16.360]  having mass Stockholm syndrome learned help us will only deliver you into misery destruction
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:21.800]  and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:28.880]  death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all we have come so far
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:33.040]  by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order decided to join it
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:42.760]  out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls this is the end my
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:50.120]  friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:57.520]  end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen because there was only

[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:10.680]  caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history
[1:53:10.680 --> 1:53:15.400]  book show us just like the bible states every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:22.320]  away from God they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:27.600]  and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:34.600]  today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars
[1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:39.240]  has decided to fight for freedom info wars is a great victory thanks to your support
[1:53:39.240 --> 1:53:46.240]  and your prayers you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:14.660]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the alex jones show we are into the third hour i'm
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:18.760]  harrison smith i'll be joined by greg rees momentarily and we'll take you through this
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:25.040]  hour and then handed off to paul joes of watson but while i'm here and since this is my first
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:29.720]  time hosting the alex jones show i thought i'd take a moment to make a little personal
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:35.160]  aside hopefully you can indulge me in this because i was in sixth grade when september
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:40.280]  eleventh two thousand one took place by the time i was out of middle school i had seen
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:46.160]  videos of this guy alex jones bullhorning about nine eleven being an inside job i'd
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:52.440]  seen his breaking into the bohemian grove i'd fully had the scales lifted from my eyes
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:58.560]  and realized the level of insanity that governed this world and it was a really an awakening
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.880]  and suddenly i was in conflict with my george bush loving parents because i knew the truth
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:08.600]  and you know it took them a little bit longer to to come around to it but that's fine because
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:13.360]  by the time i was eighteen nineteen i moved to austin from houston and i would be driving
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:18.560]  down the street and i'm a very clear memory of driving down guadalupe guadalupe as we
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:24.280]  say here passing lamar and there's a man standing on the corner holding a sign he was a well-dressed
[1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:30.560]  man glasses and the sign said something like here the truth info wars tune into ninety
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:35.640]  point seven or whatever it is or you know open your eyes alex jones ninety point seven
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:39.920]  i remember i mean so clearly i just moved to austin i i do i do what the sign says i
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.040]  tune it to the radio station and they're i i'm i'm in the midst i'm at the i'm at the
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:50.480]  tail end of the legendary alex jones monologue where he's talking about the power of freedom
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:56.120]  the strength of the american people and the resoluteness and you know unconquerable spirit
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:00.720]  that we embody and i just remember you know thirty seconds into listening to alex jones
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:05.240]  and i'm just something like punching the steering wheel and i'm fired up with that with that
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:11.200]  spirit myself so to me sitting here behind this desk is that the fulfillment of really
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:16.680]  a lifelong not even ambition or goal i was hired here as an editor and a cameraman and
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:20.960]  luckily they've this is a true libertarian sort of space and they allowed me to get
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.480]  in front of the camera and so here i am now so i'm honored and humbled and i think of
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:30.360]  course everybody at info wars everybody and especially alex jones for putting the trust
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:34.200]  in myself and greg and all of us here at info wars i know i speak for all of us when i say
[1:56:34.200 --> 1:56:38.560]  it's it's a fantastic place to work but most of all obviously the people i want to think
[1:56:38.560 --> 1:56:43.920]  are you the audience for going out there and supporting info wars for so long going to
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:48.680]  the info wars store making purchases supporting yourself and your own health but also keeping
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:54.480]  this ship afloat so now i you know here i feel like a petty officer you know sat behind
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:58.840]  behind the wheel of a battleship while the captain is doing other important business
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:04.920]  and hopefully i just don't end up on on the shoals here as we guide our way towards a
[1:57:04.920 --> 1:57:10.320]  better future but truly this is a wonderful experience and i have the audience there the
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:17.120]  info warriors out there to thank for this because without you this entire operation

[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.480]  behind and i thought this is an organization i need to support i need to put my money where
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:45.360]  my mouth is and throw these guys some bones because without info wars alex jones and
[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:49.680]  the whole crew out here spreading the truth i can't imagine that the world that we live
[1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:54.400]  in today would we definitely wouldn't have trump we wouldn't know that all of this corona

[2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:14.640]  we are back harrison smith and myself greg rees sitting in for alex jones at the info
[2:00:14.640 --> 2:00:20.560]  at the alex jones live show you know in the past three years we've experienced being
[2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:28.360]  divided by political reasons a lot of people think that like we're republicans for example
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:32.680]  right and we're really just truth seekers but we've been successfully divided for years
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:36.200]  right now there's a different divide and i would say the divide right now is the one
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:42.560]  that the the actual authentic organic one and the divide right now are the people that
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:47.440]  are seeing through all this nonsense and the people that are just falling for it and it's
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:52.200]  sad to see the people falling for it but it's very encouraging to see awakened people seeing
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:57.800]  right through it you know it seems like to me finally the all of the accoutrements are
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:02.400]  being shed away and what we're left with is humanity versus the machine right humanity
[2:01:02.400 --> 2:01:07.680]  versus the beast and i think that's becoming apparent i hope people recognize that because
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:11.080]  i completely agree with you we're finally seeing people sort of recognize oh we're
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:15.760]  not this isn't a political divide this is a divide between people who basically hate
[2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:20.000]  humanity and want and think we're a nuisance and a virus and a bug and want to control
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:25.840]  or eradicate us and serve a machine serve the the technocratic inhuman future and those
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:31.040]  of us who love humanity love freedom love a little bit of chaos like all of the little
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:35.120]  things that make life worth living i think you're exactly right that's the that's the
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.960]  new distinction that we're seeing and that group includes a very large amount of the
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:43.400]  population that don't care about politics that don't want to be bothered about politics
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:49.240]  people that just understand how the body works people that understand you know basic fun i
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.200]  think a lot of people have known that our modern medicine in the western world is extremely
[2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:58.880]  medieval and people have been for the past hundred years people have been uh you know
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:03.880]  holding on to holistic medicine bringing back holistic medicine how many times did we hear
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:09.840]  the term big pharma come up in the democratic election election debates in a negative fashion
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:15.040]  right big pharma right and then it's like these same people are like stay inside until
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:19.180]  you let big pharma do whatever they want to you stay inside until big pharma has his
[2:02:19.180 --> 2:02:23.680]  way with you and injects you with his vaccine so there's a there's a cognitive dissidence
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:29.000]  there that hopefully the just sheer arrogance of these people is is finally breaking through
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.080]  but who knows yeah and anyone who's actually starting to look is now seeing this and that's
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:36.920]  going to wake people up too so there is hope so this next video i just saw a couple days
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:42.160]  ago this is from massachusetts this is from the capital of massachusetts and the uh i think
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:45.600]  you'll enjoy the woman who took the video she's one of the awakened one she's seeing
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:54.240]  right through it so if you go to clip four please what are you guys doing for people
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:59.160]  to walk in one direction okay there's spray painting arrows on the sidewalk you know this
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:22.120]  is crazy who's the um town manager for swanscott and i bet he supports charlie baker oh my god
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:27.280]  so people now what happens if i don't walk in what if i do this and i will because this
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:34.760]  is what i'm going to do what do i what happens if i do that what are they doing to me i know
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:40.240]  you guys are doing your job but this is insanity you can cut it short there actually you know
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:45.560]  so these city workers here you know they're obviously embarrassed this this woman is is
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:49.680]  asking them you know what are you guys doing this is crazy and they're a little embarrassed
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:56.280]  they know it's crazy but they're spray painting arrows on the street to uh corralis like sheep
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:04:00.280]  telling you where to walk i i love that woman she was here and what if i do this what if
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:03.320]  what if i walk the wrong direction what are you gonna do what are you gonna do just pointing
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:07.760]  out how utterly pointless this is but hey they they gotta do something i guess you know we're
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:12.760]  seeing this pop up over and over everywhere here's actually another person from Massachusetts
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.560]  this is a bostonian angry about losing his business this is a clip seven and you really
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:23.520]  just fear the feel the fury coming coming out of this guy hopefully this is one of those
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:27.360]  things that all these people that are just like just stay inside you don't need to go
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:31.600]  to you to the gym just sacrifice yourself this is what they're asking people to do this
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:35.120]  is the sacrifice they're asking people to make as you listen to this guy so here is
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:40.480]  a bostonian angry about losing his business i have to give up my business that i worked
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:47.960]  25 years sacrifice my life for okay for corona virus i'll take corona virus over losing my
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:55.880]  business okay and i guarantee you 99% of people who i hear will do the same thing you know
[2:04:55.880 --> 2:05:00.320]  somebody put out on twitter the other day i saw it was like this this whole lockdown
[2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:05.520]  thing is really showing us who has never heard the word no in their life and it's like that's
[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:10.240]  such a strange way of interpreting this me it's you know now we're seeing the divide
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:15.920]  between who has actually had to work for themselves for their whole life who it has spent their
[2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:24.040]  whole life being dependent on and obedient to higher powers and who is actually an american
[2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:28.360]  and stands up and wants to run their own life make their own decisions make their own money
[2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:33.000]  support themselves and who is just willing to be a complete leech on the system i think
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:38.280]  that's the divide that we're seeing and people like that man in that video are the real the
[2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:42.840]  real americans i don't know how else to put it those are the people that actually made
[2:05:42.840 --> 2:05:47.360]  this country made this country and continue to keep this country working whereas all the
[2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:51.320]  people telling you to stay home they were home already they weren't doing anything already
[2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:56.960]  so and the people that are complicit or compliant and think that there's some kind of utopia
[2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:04.400]  coming it's just evidence of the brainwashing because there has never been like a you know
[2:06:04.400 --> 2:06:09.120]  a no one's ever come out and said here's what's coming here's what's coming next we're
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:12.820]  gonna replace all this and we're gonna give you this the closest we've come is the green
[2:06:12.820 --> 2:06:16.840]  new deal which is so loose and ridiculous that but that's probably enough for a lot
[2:06:16.840 --> 2:06:20.320]  of these people to just cling to and think oh utopia is coming thank god i don't have
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:25.760]  to work anymore and that's what really drives me crazy are seeing the people out there that
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:30.640]  enjoy getting this check every month and enjoy just sitting around doing nothing because what
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:35.560]  on earth is the point of this life if it's not to go out and create things and produce
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:41.080]  things and to experience struggle and challenges and become more independent more responsible
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:45.560]  oh it's to play video games Greg that's the answer the answer is to get all of those to
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:51.840]  achieve all of those things digitally you know in ones and zeros that's seemingly what
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:57.280]  a lot of people my age feel i mean and honestly you can't really blame them when their entire
[2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:02.120]  lives have been you know any of their dreams any of their ambitions have been utterly stifled
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:07.640]  and cranked back and no just behave just obey just do as you're told just get a job at a
[2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:12.120]  big company don't try to start your own thing it's too hard there's too many regulations
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:16.200]  there's too many red tape you know too much red tape to get to oh so of course they retreat
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:20.600]  into a video game where they have all the power in the world and can do whatever they want
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:26.360]  because they've been robbed of that in real life so it's pretty sickening and sad and
[2:07:26.360 --> 2:07:30.840]  i was reading an article today about just the sheer number of people whose unemployment
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:36.760]  checks are larger than their checks were for working i have friends myself who worked for
[2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:41.720]  catering companies and got furloughed as a result of coronavirus and is now making more
[2:07:41.720 --> 2:07:47.760]  than she made when she was working full day you know full time job so what do they of
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:52.320]  course they're gonna choose that if given the option what you can you can slave away
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:57.760]  for somebody else for eight hours a day and be paid a pittance or you can spend all day
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:02.080]  in the park with your dog and playing video games and be paid even more it's the we're
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:08.400]  being set up to where the easiest path is submission the easiest opportunity for us
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:13.520]  is uh is just submit to control and uh and that's the paradigm that they're trying to
[2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:21.400]  erect in my opinion yeah 100 percent i just saw an article two uh covid 19 data sharing
[2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:27.120]  with law enforcement sparks concern and this is here in the united states you don't say
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:31.520]  and uh a lot of people are concerned about this if you have covid or if your friends
[2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.240]  with someone have covid now you're on a list with law enforcement and i mean we've seen
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:40.800]  what's happened in canada law enforcement showing up at your house and stuff and you
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:44.800]  know we do have the first amendment still but i mean this is being rolled out all over
[2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:49.160]  the place and there are a lot of people in this country that are cheering for it well
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:53.640]  and you know what happened just before coronavirus maybe just as it was uh starting to break out
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:59.120]  in china and stuff uh you have google and amazon both being given access to medical records
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:04.000]  for entire states just given for free here have all of the medical records for everybody
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  in our state and i'm with google as i said in amazon and now google is trying to buy
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:13.200]  fitbit so everybody's got a fitbit everybody's got a little watch on their hand uh you'll
[2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:17.400]  be being tracked in real time every uh you know heart monitor anything like that and
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:21.360]  once you extrapolate once you understand the power of technology and what they can do i
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:27.600]  mean if you have a uh a heart monitor on your wrist and you're watching a video and you
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:31.920]  like the video your heart rate goes up are they gonna start using this and go oh man this
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:35.800]  guy watched this video and his heart rate went up his expression on his face as we were
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:40.560]  watching him with the facial recognition cameras he was gleeful as he was watching this video
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:45.000]  that's a hate crime right or well uh face crime i think they called it it's all coming
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:51.200]  true folks one after another the united states is not communist china we don't have three
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.600]  million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:02.040]  dissidents and sell their organs but all of the news we see the un billable indicates
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:08.040]  w h o mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response and if
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:12.200]  communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:16.840]  robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:22.120]  san antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in
[2:10:22.120 --> 2:10:27.560]  new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:32.400]  they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:37.320]  and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and in
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:42.360]  full wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:48.760]  be able to defeat their operation that much quicker feudalism in the ancient world from
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:53.800]  asia to europe from africa to latin america was the most common form of government you
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:59.000]  had a ruling class the nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:05.760]  the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control in fact in most cultures
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:09.800]  they called the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:16.320]  shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:20.960]  were so busy trying to survive they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:25.600]  well now all the big google owners and the rockefellers and the Rothschilds the jeff
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:29.760]  bezos is the world they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:36.760]  and private jets living the life laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the third
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:43.240]  world starving to death their religion is power and control and they are pressing that advantage
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:50.240]  against us we must break free from these monsters you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:13.240 --> 2:12:18.840]  my children aren't going hungry i'll do it i'll drink your blood and i'm starting to think
[2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:25.440]  about having to eat my neighbors you think i like sizing up gonna haul him a fat chain
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:31.640]  drop his ass up sizing up gonna haul him a fat chain top top top top i will eat your
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:39.920]  leftist ass like pouring upon the cob i'm ready i will i will eat your ass i will eat your
[2:12:39.920 --> 2:12:51.480]  ass i will eat your ass i will eat your ass i'll barbecue your ass flat i will cook

[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:40.520]  That's why I want the globalists to know, I will eat your ass first.
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:44.120]  I swore to God it's the last thing I do, I'm going to get my hands around your throat.
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:45.120]  What do I do?
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  There you go ladies and gentlemen.
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:50.800]  That's where I woke up to this morning.
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:51.800]  Someone sent me that this morning.
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:52.800]  That was the first thing I saw this morning.
[2:13:52.800 --> 2:13:56.720]  It got me a good way to wake up, got me tapping my toes.
[2:13:56.720 --> 2:14:04.160]  As we enter the crucible, as we find ourselves in the center of this firestorm of totalitarianism
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:12.560]  and the slow creep, the slow boil of authoritarianism is finally starting to boil over.
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:14.560]  You got to keep a little bit on the bright side of life.
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:17.720]  You got to laugh a little bit because they're getting desperate.
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:18.720]  They're flailing.
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:23.880]  They are, like that image Al Shunze did an interview with an Orthodox guy in Hawaii one
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:27.240]  time where he talks about stepping on the head of a snake and the snake's body just
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:28.240]  going insane.
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:30.600]  It's the death rattles of the New World Order.
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:37.160]  I have a collection of headlines just from the last few days that will elucidate the
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:43.360]  insanity that we are uncovering, the lengths of cognitive dissonance that we're forcing
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:48.880]  the New World Order into just to try to maintain its insane control.
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:52.760]  I remember reading 1984 in high school and I didn't really like it because I thought
[2:14:52.760 --> 2:14:55.000]  it was too unbelievable.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.440]  There's a scene where people make signs to protest and then they're told in the middle
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.080]  of protest that somebody has sabotaged their signs and they start ripping up their own
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.240]  signs and I just thought, there's no way.
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:06.960]  There's no way people can be controlled like that.
[2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:12.440]  There's no way they could be forced to completely flip an opinion and truly believe it and not
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:13.760]  even have to be forced to do it.
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:15.400]  They truly believe it.
[2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:23.560]  But then you go on New York Times and you see this headline, believe all women is a right
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:25.560]  wing trap.
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:27.840]  That's what they say in the New York Times.
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:32.120]  Believe all women is a right wing trap.
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:34.120]  This is insanity.
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  This is insane.
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:36.120]  This is unhealthy.
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:37.120]  Right?
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:46.960]  I mean, this is like mental illness on such a scale that it's beyond fiction.
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:47.960]  It's insane.
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:53.840]  I mean, to go through the years that we've gone through where conservatives have continuously
[2:15:53.840 --> 2:15:56.160]  said, no, you need an investigation.
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:15:58.240]  No, you can't just believe all women.
[2:15:58.240 --> 2:15:59.560]  That makes no sense.
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:02.600]  You have to have fairness.
[2:16:02.600 --> 2:16:06.840]  You have to have due process for them to turn around and say that believe all women is a
[2:16:06.840 --> 2:16:09.520]  right wing trap.
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:10.840]  I'm speechless.
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:12.280]  I don't even know what to think.
[2:16:12.280 --> 2:16:14.280]  Greg, help me.
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:17.600]  No, I mean, you're right.
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.240]  It felt like just, it kind of actually felt like we were just winning, winning, winning
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:26.680]  up until around March, whenever this COVID thing came down, then everything changed.
[2:16:26.680 --> 2:16:34.480]  And all of a sudden I realized how terribly, tragically brainwashed so many people are.
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:41.320]  So I would say almost the majority of my friends and family that I grew up with are complying
[2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:45.800]  without question, think that I'm crazy.
[2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:48.440]  And it's astonishing to me.
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:49.440]  You were talking about 1984.
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:50.440]  Yeah.
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:55.120]  I mean, if you were to describe what's happening now, just six months ago, I would have lost
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:01.280]  interest in the conversation and thought you weren't that bright, but here we are.
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:03.000]  No, it's insane.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:11.640]  And it's, which you have to understand is that the plans that they enact, the schemes
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:14.920]  that they manifest don't happen all at once.
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:20.040]  They have very long multi-step processes with contingency plans.
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:22.480]  So what we are in now is a contingency plan.
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:26.640]  What they originally wanted was plan A, they wanted everybody in the world to succumb to
[2:17:26.640 --> 2:17:30.960]  their brainwashing and to willingly go along with globalism.
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:33.400]  Now they basically had that in the can.
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:36.320]  They basically would have been home free if they could have only gotten Hillary Clinton
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:37.320]  into office.
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:39.880]  She would have ushered in the censorship on the internet.
[2:17:39.880 --> 2:17:44.280]  She would have gone to war with Syria, gone to war with Iran.
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:47.640]  The endless war would have accelerated and expanded.
[2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:53.000]  They had it in the can and it was Brexit and Trump that derailed that train.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:56.200]  So they had to go with plan B. Well, we're living through plan B right now.
[2:17:56.200 --> 2:18:02.000]  Plan B is coronavirus and basically forcing people, basically eliminating people's ability
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:06.440]  to protect themselves by using the secret weapon of fear.
[2:18:06.440 --> 2:18:07.640]  Fear is the mind killer.
[2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:12.200]  Fear is what is needed in order to control and dominate people.
[2:18:12.200 --> 2:18:15.920]  Whether that fear is real or based on a real threat or a fake one, it doesn't matter.
[2:18:15.920 --> 2:18:17.160]  The fear is what's necessary.
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:21.680]  So they've put all of these plans in place and then, as Alex was talking about, as we've
[2:18:21.680 --> 2:18:24.480]  been talking about, they won't stop here.
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:30.560]  Even if we defeat them here, they will continue to try to enact their devious machinations,
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:37.280]  but we can identify them and fight against them and know that when the mysterious spaceship
[2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:41.760]  from aliens comes and we all have to make a global governance to fight them, we'll all
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.200]  go, yeah, we know.
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:44.200]  We know what you're doing.
[2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:45.200]  Great.
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:46.200]  Very good job.
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:47.200]  Great.
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:48.200]  Bluebeam.
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:49.200]  Whatever.
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:50.200]  Screw you.
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:51.200]  We're not doing global governance.
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:52.200]  Hopefully we can be in that position.
[2:18:52.200 --> 2:18:57.600]  When plan C comes about, when they fail to enslave us through coronavirus, we have the United
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:02.360]  Nations claiming it's politically incorrect to say husband or wife and tweeting out a
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:08.920]  bunch of weird, again, Orwellian, completely Orwellian, double-speak level stuff.
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:13.960]  But it's a weird, you know, I like to call the modern world an apocalyptic or a dystopian
[2:19:13.960 --> 2:19:14.960]  smorgasbord.
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:15.960]  Right?
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:21.280]  It's a dystopian buffet and the world controllers have gone down the line and picked all the
[2:19:21.280 --> 2:19:26.040]  most authoritarian treats that they desire and put them all in together, right?
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:31.640]  So with this United Nations tweet, you have the 1984 level, don't say policemen, say police
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:35.880]  officer, don't say landlord, say owner, don't say boyfriend, say partner, right?
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:41.280]  This weird language control that we see in double-speak in 1984, but at the same time,
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:44.340]  you have the genderless aspect of it.
[2:19:44.340 --> 2:19:48.800]  You have the husband and wife, oh, they're just your spouse, right?
[2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:53.160]  Of course, you can extrapolate that to mother and father, and that's where you get into
[2:19:53.160 --> 2:19:56.040]  the brave new world territory, right?
[2:19:56.040 --> 2:19:58.760]  They, you know, to them, mother and father was like a curse word.
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:01.040]  It was like disgusting, the idea of mothers and fathers.
[2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:03.000]  So it's a smorgasbord.
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:04.160]  It's a buffet.
[2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:12.360]  It's a variety platter of all of the most oppressive and, you know, mind-destroying aspects
[2:20:12.360 --> 2:20:17.240]  of dystopian novels all rolled into one with this lovely tweet from the United Nations.
[2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:21.920]  That's why I call them, I think world controllers is like the best possible thing to call them,
[2:20:21.920 --> 2:20:25.040]  like New World Order, Illuminati, whatever you want to call them.
[2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:29.160]  They are the people that are in positions that are unelected, and yet they pull the
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:30.160]  strings.
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:34.680]  They're the controllers, the world controllers, as foreseen in brave new world.
[2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:38.240]  All right, we really will get to that vice video on the other side.
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:39.760]  It's a, want to have a long segment.
[2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:44.680]  We need a lot of time to destroy the lies, misinformation, of vice news.
[2:20:44.680 --> 2:20:48.560]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:53.720]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism.
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:58.120]  And Obama, Hillary, and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:03.000]  Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  president.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:07.640]  Now they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression.
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:11.200]  Well, China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[2:21:11.200 --> 2:21:16.760]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:20.440]  hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:23.160]  this and not President Trump.
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:24.880]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:27.400]  They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[2:21:27.400 --> 2:21:32.920]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:35.920]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:42.440]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:44.920]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.320]  Now it's official.
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:51.960]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years.
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:57.160]  And the UK government said, you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:01.280]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of
[2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:03.680]  10 people that you visit.
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:07.880]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:12.480]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order where they let the criminals out
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:18.760]  of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:19.960]  and a prisoner.
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:23.520]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:25.080]  anti-human group.
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:30.360]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:32.600]  which is global depopulation.
[2:22:32.600 --> 2:22:36.120]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:42.080]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:43.520]  mortal enemy.
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:45.160]  Wake up or die.
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:50.320]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:51.880]  to where it is.
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:57.680]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:02.360]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:06.360]  for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt
[2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:07.360]  to the megabanks.
[2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:10.360]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculations.
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:17.800]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:24.120]  backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[2:23:24.120 --> 2:23:29.080]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this
[2:23:29.080 --> 2:23:33.800]  moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:38.400]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:41.840]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed
[2:23:41.840 --> 2:23:48.280]  your lives and our lives, congratulations.
[2:23:48.280 --> 2:23:59.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:04.080]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show, Harrison Smith and Greg
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:09.760]  Reese sitting in for Alex Jones for the next 30 minutes, and then Paul Joseph Watson will
[2:24:09.760 --> 2:24:14.240]  take over, so don't go anywhere, and we're going to spend this segment talking about
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:21.560]  our old friends at Vice News, Vice News, right, now they're failing as always, right, every
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:25.760]  year or so they get injected with half a billion dollars from some multinational, and yet they
[2:24:25.760 --> 2:24:28.640]  can't keep the lights on, can't keep the doors open.
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:35.880]  Like many of their compatriots there in the leftist media, Vice Media lays off 155 employees
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:40.040]  with deepest cuts in their digital group, the Economist lays off 90, Quartz is laying
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:45.880]  off 80, Condé Nast is laying off roughly 100 and furloughing 100 more, the Young Turks
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:50.800]  of course is constantly having to beg for money because they are failing utterly, maybe
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:55.800]  you shouldn't have spent that 20 million dollars you got two years ago as a gift for free from
[2:24:55.800 --> 2:25:01.000]  some giant millionaire investor, maybe you shouldn't have spent that million dollars
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:05.320]  getting fifth place in a special election, Cenk, I don't know, maybe these are things
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:06.640]  you could have done.
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:11.080]  Now he's writing opinion pieces for the Wall Street Journal, but Vice, I was looking into
[2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:15.080]  Vice just seeing what they're coming out with lately and I found one of their latest videos,
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:19.600]  it's a documentary claiming to debunk conspiracy theories about 5G.
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:25.640]  So let's go through this in segments, and basically I'm not even really going to address
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:31.920]  many of the 5G technical aspects, really we'll just pay attention to the propaganda tactics
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:33.680]  used in this documentary.
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:39.440]  So here's the first clip where they lay out the claims that are made by conspiracy theorists,
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:40.840]  here it is.
[2:25:40.840 --> 2:25:44.360]  This movement had become a phenomenon with conspiracy theories being spread through
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:47.760]  Facebook groups, political parties and protests.
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:49.240]  5G she had to kill.
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:53.120]  It's members claim that 5G was threatening to kill off their families causing mental
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:58.840]  health issues, cancer, infertility, Alzheimer's and autism.
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:26:02.040]  So a couple things right off the bat, right?
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:03.320]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:07.240]  This is a public health awareness campaign, right?
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:10.200]  Nowhere in this video will you hear about there are these people that are doing this
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:11.200]  on purpose.
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:15.600]  It's simply people who are saying this is untested technology, 5G could potentially
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:18.920]  be dangerous and we don't appreciate being your guinea pigs.
[2:26:18.920 --> 2:26:19.920]  That is the protest.
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:23.880]  It is a public health awareness campaign, no conspiracy.
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:27.720]  But they have to name it a conspiracy theory in order to try to discredit it.
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:29.920]  Now he named the concerns that they have.
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:34.800]  They say, he says they make some ill, killing off their family, mental health issues, it
[2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:40.640]  can cause cancer, infertility, Alzheimer's, autism and they say it can be linked to COVID-19.
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:43.800]  As we go through this video, what do you think the likelihood is that they address a single
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:44.800]  one of these?
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:45.800]  It's zero.
[2:26:45.800 --> 2:26:46.800]  They don't.
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:47.800]  They don't.
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:48.800]  They absolutely do not.
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:50.760]  So just keep that in mind as we continue to watch these videos.
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.560]  They don't address a single concern.
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:55.960]  They don't try to debunk anything whatsoever.
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:57.400]  They simply mock.
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.920]  So pay attention to the scary music that will be under this.
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.600]  Also notice that they refer to people who don't like 5G as impassioned disciples.
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:17.120]  So every opportunity they have to strip you of your personality, strip you of your intellectual
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:22.000]  ability to come to a conclusion, no, no, you are just a brainless, mindless, scared disciple.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:23.320]  That's what they're trying to drive home.
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:24.320]  So here's clip two.
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:29.000]  Now, they even claim that it's linked to the coronavirus pandemic and impassioned disciples
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:33.960]  are burning down mobile phone masks around the world and spreading misinformation, encouraging
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:40.080]  people to ignore safety measures and interfering with vital communication services, endangering
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  people's lives.
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:42.080]  Oh, no.
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:45.280]  You know, in the, it's just projection.
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:49.760]  Once again, impassioned disciples because these are just people questioning it.
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:52.760]  The impassioned disciples are the ones rolling it out without any question.
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:53.760]  Yeah.
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:55.760]  But of course, and again, you'll see this over and over.
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:01.120]  They frame it as these people are very dangerous and they're risking people's health by burning
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:02.120]  down these towers.
[2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:05.720]  It's like, it's like you have a machine gun up on a hill looking down at a village and
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:07.200]  the villagers come up to dismantle it.
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:11.360]  It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you got to follow the safety procedures as you dismantle our
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:12.360]  machine gun.
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  It's absurd.
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:19.680]  But here we have the clip of the expert they bring in to talk about the fears that these
[2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:20.680]  people have.
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:21.680]  They're so scared.
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:22.880]  Let's go to this clip.
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:27.960]  To understand how the 5G conspiracy theory has spread so quickly, I spoke with Dr. David
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:32.800]  Robert Grimes, an expert on how science and society interact.
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:36.640]  What are the concerns around implementing 5G across the country?
[2:28:36.640 --> 2:28:41.720]  It's really interesting because a lot of the fears that are surrounding 5G at the moment
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:43.600]  are actually echoes of previous fears.
[2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:47.680]  A lot of them have a superficial or indeed quite deep resemblance to stuff that was said
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:50.480]  about Wi-Fi networks 15 years ago.
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:54.960]  What is interesting now, I suppose, is that the fears we're hearing have gotten a lot
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:55.960]  more traction.
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:29:00.360]  It's like, well, it's because it's the same concerns.
[2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:03.640]  Because it's a device that gives off radiation.
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:09.120]  Now the amount of radiation that it gives off is way higher, so the fear is multiplied
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:11.800]  by that much.
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:15.960]  But of course, they're framing it as, ah, if you're scared of Wi-Fi, you know, if you're
[2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:18.680]  not scared of Wi-Fi, then you shouldn't be scared of 5G.
[2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:19.680]  They're not exactly the same thing.
[2:29:19.680 --> 2:29:24.080]  In fact, he goes on to explain, and this, I mean, to me, this is the craziest clip of
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.080]  the whole thing.
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:26.080]  And this just gives you an insight.
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:29.080]  Again, they don't actually ask, well, but does it make you infertile?
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:30.880]  Oh, but can it give you cancer?
[2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:36.280]  Don't worry about actually addressing the concerns that the public health awareness
[2:29:36.280 --> 2:29:37.680]  activists are bringing up.
[2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:41.720]  No, no, just tell everybody that they're stupid and scared, because that's the message that
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:42.920]  they're trying to get across.
[2:29:42.920 --> 2:29:43.920]  So here he is.
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:49.880]  He makes a little glib remark at the end here as he explains the wireless spectrum.
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:51.560]  Here it is, clip four.
[2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:56.840]  Essentially, at the moment we're using between 2 and 5 GHz as the kind of frequency we operate
[2:29:56.840 --> 2:29:59.000]  in, that's become very, very congested.
[2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:04.760]  The idea of 5G is to go a little bit further up the spectrum between 6 and 25 GHz.
[2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:09.200]  That sounds like a huge increase, but on the scheme of the electromagnetic spectrum, that's
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:10.200]  nothing.
[2:30:10.200 --> 2:30:14.640]  This powerful photon or particle of light that could be a 5G particle would still be
[2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:20.200]  about 17,000 times less energetic than the weakest possible visible light.
[2:30:20.200 --> 2:30:24.920]  So if you're really, really concerned about 5G, you should be terrified of light bulbs.
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  Isn't that funny?
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:27.920]  Isn't that funny, Greg?
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:32.680]  If you're scared of 5G, you should be terrified of light bulbs.
[2:30:32.680 --> 2:30:33.760]  Address the concerns.
[2:30:33.760 --> 2:30:34.760]  Answer the questions.
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:36.160]  But no, he's just going to be glib.
[2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:37.880]  But it's an absurd statement anyway.
[2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:42.400]  It relies on the ignorance of the viewers, right, to say, oh, well, light is also just
[2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:43.880]  an electromagnetic wave.
[2:30:43.880 --> 2:30:48.600]  OK, you know what's in between these two spectrums that he's laid out for us?
[2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:51.160]  Heck, let's go even backwards, right?
[2:30:51.160 --> 2:30:57.440]  So before you even get to the power that he's talking about, 5 through 25 GHz, microwave
[2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:04.120]  ovens operate at ultra-high frequencies, which is actually below that, up to 3,000
[2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:06.480]  MHz or 3 GHz.
[2:31:06.480 --> 2:31:09.000]  So what, are you scared of being microwaved?
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:13.080]  Well, just let me microwave you, because you're not scared of light bulb.
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:17.400]  I mean, it makes no sense, the propaganda that they're trying to spread here.
[2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:18.400]  But what else do we have here?
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:26.000]  We have high-frequency microwave radio relay, microwave remote sensing, direct energy weapons,
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:31.160]  millimeter wave scanners, x-rays, of course, or you have to wear the big lead apron to
[2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:33.120]  prevent the radiation from getting to you.
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:39.240]  All of these are in between the spectrum of light bulb and extremely high frequency,
[2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:44.840]  which is what, I'm sorry, super high, not extremely, I'm sorry, let's get that right,
[2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:48.120]  super high frequency that 5G operates in.
[2:31:48.120 --> 2:31:51.960]  So again, they're not addressing any of these concerns, they're literally just mocking the
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:55.040]  people that have them.
[2:31:55.040 --> 2:32:03.040]  So let's go to one more clip, let's go to clip 7 here, this is the, just pay attention.
[2:32:03.040 --> 2:32:07.480]  So you know what, I don't know if we have time for this clip, we'll have to carry this
[2:32:07.480 --> 2:32:08.720]  on into the next segment.
[2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:14.560]  You know, my father was a radar operator in the Vietnam War back in the late 60s, and
[2:32:14.560 --> 2:32:19.980]  he would tell me stories about how when they were bored, they would aim their computer
[2:32:19.980 --> 2:32:24.240]  guided radar or whatever, they would find a bird and they would trail the bird until
[2:32:24.240 --> 2:32:28.600]  the bird would die, and that was something they would just do for fun back in the 60s.
[2:32:28.600 --> 2:32:34.400]  The radar microwaves back then could kill birds at a distance, you know, and so this information
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:39.760]  has been out forever, and basically all this piece is doing is just telling you to shut
[2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:41.120]  up and trust us, you know.
[2:32:41.120 --> 2:32:45.440]  Yeah, and that's it, and we'll play some more clips on the other side, because again, it's
[2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:50.480]  not once in the piece do they actually address any of the concerns that are being made, and
[2:32:50.480 --> 2:32:55.000]  they don't even, it's this dishonest way of editing, and we'll show you in the next
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:33:00.160]  clip where they don't, it's like this guy will say, oh yeah, there's a 5G transmitter
[2:33:00.160 --> 2:33:04.280]  up on that light post, and the host of the show is just like, oh, you think it's up there,
[2:33:04.280 --> 2:33:05.280]  huh?
[2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:06.280]  Oh, mmm.
[2:33:06.280 --> 2:33:10.360]  And it's like, it is, there's a 5G transmitter up there, everybody knows this, they're open
[2:33:10.360 --> 2:33:11.360]  about it.
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:16.480]  The man sued the council where the city that he lives, and he won, he won the court case.
[2:33:16.480 --> 2:33:20.440]  So it's like, but these people don't know that, they're not going to do any more research,
[2:33:20.440 --> 2:33:26.720]  all they know is the cool, funny, vice news anchor rolls his eyes when the guy says that,
[2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:31.720]  so it must be false, and it just leaves you with this, with this idea, a feeling, right?
[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:37.320]  A feeling of if you don't like 5G, you're a loser idiot conspiracy theorist, if you're
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:40.200]  into 5G, you're one of the smart, cool guys.
[2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:44.320]  Forget the facts, it's about developing a spirit.
[2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:48.800]  What Info Wars has been able to do, thanks to your support, and your prayers, and your
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:54.240]  word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic, and truly epic.
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:34:01.600]  This is the battle for the future of humanity, and now, open world government is being established
[2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:08.400]  with an end game to depopulate the planet, now the internal operations of the globalist
[2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:14.480]  are being externalized, you must decide which side you're on, living in denial, having
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:20.440]  mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction,
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:25.760]  and finally, death, and this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical
[2:34:25.760 --> 2:34:32.320]  death, the delusions must end now, Info Wars was correct about it all, and we have come
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:36.400]  so far by exposing the enemy, most people that are aware of the new world will decide
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:44.120]  to join it out of fear, they are truly fools, we must fight this, or lose our souls.
[2:34:44.120 --> 2:34:50.080]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the globalist media and the chai comms is going
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:55.720]  to now trigger a worldwide depression, in fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:00.520]  and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to understand that the longer
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:07.240]  the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be, a month of shutdown will destroy decades
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:11.200]  of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy, that's why we've always said it's
[2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:15.600]  important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self sufficient, because the globalists want
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:21.560]  to make us all dependent so that we're under their control, they've admitted all of this,
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:27.640]  so remember how does Info Wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:32.560]  things before they happen, because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:37.520]  plan, and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary, but denying it and letting them carry it
[2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:42.520]  out is a thousand times more scary, it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:45.120]  happening.
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:49.680]  Hollenblock has really been a sleeper product for us, we got it in a few years ago, it's
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:55.120]  an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs, they discovered this more than
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.400]  30 years ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail, that it
[2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:05.400]  had an anti histamine effect and people saw their allergies and seasonal discomfort knocked
[2:36:05.400 --> 2:36:10.600]  way way down, well now this is available in the United States, it's proprietary, it has
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:15.280]  rave reviews, it's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:20.280]  reordering and has become a best seller, we're very close to selling out Hollenblock right
[2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:25.400]  now, it'll take 8 weeks to get more in, but despite that I'm gonna sell it at 50% off
[2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:30.080]  until it sells out, so for those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:37.080]  and have seasonal discomfort, experience Hollenblock for yourself right now at m4store.com for 50%
[2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:42.240]  off, Hollenblock, I want people that haven't tried it for themselves, so it's the lowest
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:44.520]  price ever even though it's selling out.
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:49.240]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying, our economy slowing down and shutting
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:54.240]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:59.280]  it finally dies, she said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:03.840]  was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man
[2:37:03.840 --> 2:37:08.480]  that got shot in the head had blood pouring out, a huge hole, he was holding it, he walked
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:14.200]  around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead, well
[2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:19.040]  that's what's gonna happen with our economy, it is in cardiac arrest, this has been done
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.880]  by design and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:29.600]  to keep the economy closed, so remember, the depression that's coming and the third world
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:36.320]  collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:40.880]  the Democrats, we tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:47.720]  to wreck America and the world and now you've done it, congratulations.
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:55.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:38:08.920]  Alright folks, time flies when you're destroying the New World Order with an information barrage,
[2:38:08.920 --> 2:38:14.040]  but here we are in the final segment of the Alex Jones show, the final hour of the Alex
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:18.600]  Jones show, I should say, will be hosted by Paul Joseph Watson at 2 p.m. Central Standard
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:19.600]  Time.
[2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:25.040]  We're gonna finish out with this Vice News propaganda piece, trying to just impart the
[2:38:25.040 --> 2:38:34.160]  spirit unto you that questioning 5G, having concerns about the health impacts of these
[2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:39.520]  incredibly powerful wireless transmitters every 150 feet covering the entire country,
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:45.880]  oh and why not throw up 20,000 satellites to bathe the whole earth in this frequency.
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:50.000]  If you're concerned at that, you are a dumb loser, okay?
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:55.520]  If you just obey and listen and don't question, you are a genius and you probably are beautiful,
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:00.080]  so that's the spirit that they're trying to get across and as you watch this clip, the
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:05.120]  guy points out a 5G lamp post and I encourage you to go watch this video because it's a
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:10.760]  master class in propaganda, he asks him at one point about a court case that he was in
[2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:16.480]  and then they do like a hard, immediate cut to him talking about birds, this activist talking
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:20.880]  about how there are no birds around and it's like he goes from them standing to then walking
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:25.760]  but they act like it's the same conversation, they just manipulate people's words to literally
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:29.920]  make them sound like they're rambling and crazy by cutting together two different pieces,
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:33.640]  so you'll notice that a little bit here, but here is the activist pointing out the 5G lamp
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:40.240]  post and notice they don't dispute it, but notice the facial expression, the idea of
[2:39:40.240 --> 2:39:43.600]  just like, oh, you're crazy, that's what they're trying to get across, so here it is, clip
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  7.
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:48.160]  In fact, there was one of the free papers where they said they went on holiday, well
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:53.600]  I'd like to know where the sparrows go on holiday because they're an indigenous spurt,
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:57.120]  the 25 milliwatt transmitter on the top of that street light.
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:39:58.120]  Where's that?
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  That's it there.
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:05.480]  It's a scenario on top of a lamp and you're saying this is what sends the 5G signal?
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:12.600]  It's called a due, D-E-W, direct energy weapon, that's what's underneath that small black
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:19.920]  cover, the antenna that's in that street light, that's just a cover.
[2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:20.920]  Did you see it?
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:21.920]  Did you notice it?
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:24.760]  Do you notice the subtleties that they're, oh so you're saying, oh so that's where the
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:25.760]  5G comes from, huh?
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:28.480]  The street light, okay, the street light's trying to kill you.
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:33.920]  Okay, you're crazy, it's just like, this is not up for debate, this is, that's where
[2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:37.800]  they install the 5G, just type in 5G lamp posts, you get headlines.
[2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:44.040]  The new trend of 2019 LED lighting is 5G smart street lights from Philips, Philips team with
[2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:49.280]  working with wireless giant on 4G and 5G light poles.
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:54.080]  Smart LED street lights become a 5G connection platform, this is not up for debate, but they
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:59.040]  don't say that, they simply insinuate that you're crazy if you believe the light post
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:00.520]  is trying to kill you.
[2:41:00.520 --> 2:41:04.480]  Okay, and of course in the Guardian they have it as well, he asks them about this court
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:09.880]  case, he doesn't point out the fact that the man actually won the court case from Metro,
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:16.120]  the headline, nobody, oh that's not it, headline from Chronicle Live, Judge refuses to gag
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:21.200]  anti 5G street light campaigners stating, quote, the public have a right to know.
[2:41:21.200 --> 2:41:26.760]  And it's not just one crazy guy from the UK concerned about this, Brussels has made 5G
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:31.880]  illegal, and they're pausing their rollout until they can confirm that it's actually
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:37.760]  safe, Switzerland is doing the same thing, there's lots of places that have made it
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:42.360]  illegal to put wifi transmitters in preschools because of the effect it has on children.
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:47.880]  There was a elementary school in California that had a cell tower removed because over
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:52.720]  five, I think it was between five and eight children had brain cancer in this one elementary
[2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:57.040]  school because of the cell tower located above the campus.
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:02.620]  So this is not, these are legitimate concerns, but vice is doing its best to propagandize
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:06.920]  and make it all sound crazy, right, and even from, this is from International Business
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:11.800]  Times, right, one of the most globalist publications you can find, they say, admit 5G concerns,
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:16.040]  the US and Europe need safer technology for children, a bunch of conspiracy, what do you
[2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:20.480]  think, well, do you scare the light bulbs, International Business Times, don't turn
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:23.400]  on light bulbs, you know, these people, they're fools.
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:28.000]  So here's exactly what they think about you, this is clip eight from, again, this vice
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  propaganda piece.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:34.760]  People who often will confidently assert conspiracy theories really when they are tested, often
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:39.000]  have the lowest level of knowledge about the thing on which they opine.
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.800]  I think that belief is a strange thing, I think you can convince yourself you believe
[2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:44.840]  something if it makes you feel good about yourself.
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:49.400]  One of the biggest motivators of people spreading these conspiracy theories is the idea of them
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:51.280]  having special knowledge.
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:53.880]  So it doesn't matter if you're an expert in that field, they know more than you because
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:42:58.560]  you're part of the conspiracy or you're just an idiot, so that's called illusory superiority
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:02.840]  or illusory knowledge, and it's very, very alluring to certain people.
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:06.560]  Narcissism is a factor behind this, when people spread conspiracy theories, they get a sense
[2:43:06.560 --> 2:43:09.920]  of satisfaction out of it, they feel like they're special.
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:14.440]  So sometimes the people perpetuating this are doing it for their own gratification,
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:19.760]  but at a long-term cost to public understanding of science and medicine, and ultimately sometimes
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:20.760]  to public health.
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:26.520]  You're dangerous, you're actually a danger to the public health, if you question.
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:27.520]  Yeah.
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:31.680]  And once again, that's obvious projection right there because anyone who starts learning
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:37.080]  about all the stuff we talk about doesn't feel good about themselves, they start actually
[2:43:37.080 --> 2:43:40.840]  feeling a little bit scared, a little bit uncomfortable, and they want everyone else
[2:43:40.840 --> 2:43:45.360]  to know so that we don't end up in some type of kill box someday.
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:49.980]  And the people that don't question it and accept the comfortable eyes, they feel good
[2:43:49.980 --> 2:43:53.960]  about it, they feel special, they are given the special information, like you said, they
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.920]  think they're beautiful, they think they're smart because this is what the feedback is
[2:43:57.920 --> 2:43:59.880]  they're getting from the TV.
[2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:01.960]  It's astonishing how good projection works.
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:07.480]  Yeah, I mean it's literally the mirror image of reality, it's a fiat reality dictated to
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:11.760]  us that there's no resemblance to the real world, and it's absurd.
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:17.640]  But you know, so you're not just crazy, you're not just a danger to society if you question
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:23.320]  the rule out of 5G, you're also kind of a narcissist, that's what Vice News wants you
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:24.320]  to know.
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:26.840]  Stop questioning things, okay?
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:34.160]  So Brussels, you're just full of stupid, dangerous narcissists, Switzerland, chock full, stupid,
[2:44:34.160 --> 2:44:39.800]  dangerous narcissists, anybody that is concerned about the proliferation of this incredibly
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:45.960]  powerful technology, well you're just a dangerous, stupid narcissist.
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:50.760]  And thank goodness Vice is there to tell us, stop questioning things, stop questioning
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:52.560]  things, we're Vice.
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:58.120]  So it's just, you know, the level of propaganda that we are up against is, again, it's evidence
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:02.720]  that they're getting desperate, it's evidence that they have nothing else.
[2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:08.240]  And I got to get to this, you know, before we go, I just got to drop this, and California
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:12.400]  says give us money or we'll fire cops and firefighters, and so they're saying, we're
[2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:18.960]  running out of money, we'll have to fire police officers and firefighters if you don't bail
[2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:24.040]  us out, government, while at the same time, California undocumented immigrants can apply
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:29.960]  for relief funding, starting on Monday, it's just like, oh, hey California, I got an idea
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:31.600]  where you can get that money.
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  I know, I'm a genius, hire me, and I can find money for you so you don't have to fire the
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:39.080]  firefighters and police, you don't have to hold them hostage, you don't have to hold
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:44.200]  the people of California by extension hostage to your demands, just stop giving your money
[2:45:44.200 --> 2:45:46.920]  to Mexicans, it's literally as simple as that.
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:53.240]  Yeah, and that vampire doctor for Los Angeles, who isn't even a doctor, she gets paid $500
[2:45:53.240 --> 2:45:56.040]  million a year, so, why not?
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:57.800]  Yeah, take that money.
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:45:58.800]  Skeletor.
[2:45:58.800 --> 2:46:04.160]  There's so much other news to get to today, it's like, I could sit here for 10 hours and
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:07.680]  still not cover everything I want to cover, thank goodness, we pretty much do that, from
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:12.120]  the David Knight Show to the War Room to the Alex Jones Show, how many is it, 12 hours
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:18.640]  of programming, 10 hours of programming, not to forget American Countdown with Robert Barnes,
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:22.880]  really just a full day of incredible information coming from Info Wars, and you can support
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:26.760]  all of it, you can support everything we do, including our incredibly talented and hardworking
[2:46:26.760 --> 2:46:33.360]  crews by going to InfoWarsStore.com and making a purchase of some of the really great specials,
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:37.760]  which I believe have been briefly extended, but that will not go on forever, the special
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:42.600]  going on right now is really absurd, I'd say at any time I'm hosting, I'm just like,
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:45.840]  I'm not a part of the financial side of Info Wars, because I don't understand it, I don't
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:50.360]  understand how you can sell everything at 60% off, and that's a good business move,
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:53.520]  but I leave that up to the smarter people, and you can just take advantage of it, maybe
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:59.240]  it is a bad idea, but hey, all the better for you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and make
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:04.120]  a purchase, save a bunch of money on this mega sale, which has been extended two days,
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:10.520]  ladies and gentlemen, two days you have to take advantage of the 32, 60% off all of those
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:14.520]  incredible products, my favorite is Turbo Force, Greg, what's your favorite product?
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:19.560]  Oh, I think my favorite's probably the Bone Broth, I mix it with my coffee every morning,
[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:27.720]  it's fantastic, I also love the iodine, I love the DNA force, and vitamin mineral fusion,
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:32.640]  my favorite thing about this job is that we sell these great products, we can't make
[2:47:32.640 --> 2:47:36.160]  any claims because we're no experts, but we're human beings and we understand how our bodies
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:39.760]  work and we understand that if you just take care of the body and if you get it, give it
[2:47:39.760 --> 2:47:45.720]  the minerals and the vitamins and the supplements that it needs because we've deprived our food
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:50.680]  source of all these things, then the body will thrive and take care of anything that
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:55.320]  nature throws at it, it seems like, that's how I feel, I feel very, very happy that I'm
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:47:59.520]  stocked up on my products and taking care of my body and being healthy.
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:03.520]  Yeah, absolutely, you notice the difference, you take the products and there's a reason
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:06.760]  people come back and buy them over and over and over again because they put them to the
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:12.120]  test and the products pass test with flying colors, well once again it has been a complete
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:15.800]  honor to be with you here on The Alex Jones Show, my name is Harrison Smith, to my right
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:22.320]  is Greg Reese, you can find our videos at band.video, you can follow me at Harrisonthegood on Twitter,
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:28.600]  at Greg Reese on Twitter, that's right, please follow us, stay in touch and enjoy the last
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:34.840]  hour of The Alex Jones Show with Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:41.800]  This is the end my friends, my only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:49.880]  everything that stands the end, the safety, the delusion, it's all over ladies and gentlemen,
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:56.640]  because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and partying and living like children,
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:01.680]  never growing up, never caring about other people, this delivered us into the hands of
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:06.360]  tyranny, just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states, every time
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:11.880]  Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity
[2:49:11.880 --> 2:49:17.480]  because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies and then they
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:23.160]  were enslaved, we are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:30.120]  system leads to absolute bondage, Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom, Info Wars
[2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:36.400]  has said great victory thanks to your support and your prayers, I've hunted a lot of big
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:43.520]  game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards,
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:49.640]  even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:54.280]  got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all
[2:49:54.280 --> 2:50:00.240]  of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die, then
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:05.040]  you go bag them and haul them back in, well that's what's going to happen to the entire
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:11.280]  world now and that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the
[2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:16.200]  heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot
[2:50:16.200 --> 2:50:20.480]  of death, well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:25.400]  to UN and I believe they're numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:29.160]  to depopulate the third world, so to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution
[2:50:29.160 --> 2:50:32.680]  to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.800]  what Hitler did.
[2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:54.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's
[2:50:54.920 --> 2:51:11.400]  Alex Jones, it is important for us, American people want the economy to open up, we all
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:18.160]  do, we want our societies to open up, we all do and in order to do that we have testing,
[2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:25.000]  tracing, treatment and isolation and that is the path, it's what the scientists advise,
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:28.240]  that is what we do in the heroes act.
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:35.120]  Pelosi's Legion of Doom called for a second round of the 1800 plus page $3 trillion coronavirus
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:41.200]  relief package, the largest in history, Pelosi says the broadly written second stimulus will
[2:51:41.200 --> 2:51:47.240]  focus on recovery while her neglected district in San Francisco plunges into a third world
[2:51:47.240 --> 2:51:48.240]  of biz.
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:52.360]  Well San Francisco has a new plan to keep COVID-19 from spreading through an at risk
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:58.800]  community, part of the solution could be these white boxes being painted on some city streets.
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:02.400]  More tents taking up sidewalks with hardly any space to get through.
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:06.760]  It's the kids, there's schools around here, you know there's women and families I have
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:08.200]  to go through here to get to work.
[2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:12.040]  The mayor's announcement comes on the heels of a new lawsuit filed this week in federal
[2:52:12.040 --> 2:52:17.840]  court by UC Hastings law school and residents demanding the city clean up the crowded streets.
[2:52:17.840 --> 2:52:22.240]  You've been there longer than a year, things should not get worse under your control, things
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:25.200]  should be getting better and they're not getting better, they're getting worse.
[2:52:25.200 --> 2:52:28.840]  And the U.S. national debt hovers around 25 trillion.
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:33.400]  The Democrats have wrapped this bill up in disinformation, titling the legislation the
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:38.920]  heroes act, creating the illusion that the relief is geared completely towards supporting
[2:52:38.920 --> 2:52:44.080]  those on the front lines of the pandemic, which some of it is, as they vote from their
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:48.600]  homes after approving proxy voting, literally phoning it in.
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:52.360]  And what's more important to the Democrats than the American people?
[2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:54.400]  That's right, un-American people.
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:59.840]  As the Washington examiner explains, a provision in the bill would allow people to receive
[2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:06.360]  stimulus funds if they file taxes with a taxpayer identification number, which is issued by
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:10.080]  the IRS to those without a social security number.
[2:53:10.080 --> 2:53:15.440]  While 10 holders, including unauthorized immigrants, were ineligible to receive funds under the
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:22.080]  CARES Act, the HEROES Act would retroactively provide funds to those using TINs under the
[2:53:22.080 --> 2:53:27.040]  CARES Act, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Health and
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:33.440]  Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions, or HEROES Act, also includes a provision that
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:39.280]  would protect banks that service marijuana businesses from being penalized by federal
[2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:40.280]  regulators.
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:45.800]  The measure includes language requiring research on minority-owned and women-owned marijuana
[2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:46.800]  companies.
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:51.760]  Who and what are the Democrats fighting for at a time when the average American faces
[2:53:51.760 --> 2:53:55.000]  an economic cliff steeper than the Great Depression?
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:59.680]  As Senate Majority Leader McConnell pointed out, the word cannabis appears in the bill
[2:53:59.680 --> 2:54:06.240]  68 times, more times than the word job, and four times as many as the word hire.
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:09.720]  The bill will likely die in the Senate, but it shouldn't go unnoticed.
[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:14.520]  It is the representation of the decadent aloofness of the Democratic Party.
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:16.880]  What are you going to share with us from your home?
[2:54:16.880 --> 2:54:17.880]  Chocolate.
[2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:18.880]  Really?
[2:54:18.880 --> 2:54:19.880]  Chocolate.
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:20.880]  Chocolate.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  Chocolate.
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:22.880]  Candy.
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:23.880]  Oh, wow.
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:24.880]  And?
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  Oh, my.
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:26.880]  Wow.
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:32.320]  Other people in our family go for some other flavors, but chocolate, and then we have some
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:34.400]  other chocolate here.
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:39.400]  A party only interested in building its own caste system and strengthening its twisted
[2:54:39.400 --> 2:54:43.320]  resolve to destroy American prosperity and freedom.
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:55:02.680]  John Bowne reporting.
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:07.120]  And we are live about 30 seconds left in this segment, so we're going to come back in the
[2:55:07.120 --> 2:55:10.520]  next segment and get into the full raft of news articles.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:16.120]  We were told that we needed to go through the social distancing to get back to normal,
[2:55:16.120 --> 2:55:21.840]  but now we're being told that we have a different normal, a new normal that's going to be characterized
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:30.080]  by ritual public humiliation, specifically in one case by wearing silly foam hats and
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:34.520]  bumper tables like children's tables at the playpen in McDonald's.
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:37.720]  This is the new normal, the social distancing society.
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:41.440]  We'll be right back to talk about it on the other side of the break, summit.news.gov.
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:42.440]  Go away.
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:48.640]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020, and within a week or so, many of the best-selling
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:52.680]  items that we're selling at infohorsetour.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[2:55:52.680 --> 2:55:56.640]  In fact, last year I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:57.640]  enough.
[2:55:57.640 --> 2:56:00.360]  The press people didn't have profit to operate this operation.
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:03.240]  But I want you to get the ultimate creole oil.
[2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:05.280]  I want you to get vasobites.
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:07.440]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:10.000]  I want you to experience X2.
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:12.920]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:18.200]  They're all in stock right now, and they're 30% to 60% off.
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:23.400]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on
[2:56:23.400 --> 2:56:27.040]  most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:30.360]  out like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Vasobites.
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:31.520]  So take action.
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:32.520]  Be healthier.
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:35.320]  Boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the Info War.
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:42.320]  Get in these great products, and at 4store.com.
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:59.000]  Well, I'm getting to think that one of the methods by which the elite, the authorities,
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:05.520]  the controllers want to make us stay indoors is by making operating in society as cringeworthy
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:10.760]  and difficult as possible, you know, the petty enforcers with their masks, barking orders
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:15.920]  at you if you don't sit properly social distance, because I had the clip in my video a few days
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:22.680]  ago of the woman in a park holding out a stick, and whenever joggers got within six feet
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:28.320]  of her, she chastised them, I actually saw the same thing right where I live in the park
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:34.040]  the other day where a mother, probably called Karen, was encouraging her child to hold out
[2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:40.160]  this six foot long tree branch to enforce proper social distancing.
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:42.280]  This is the new normal, apparently.
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:49.480]  We had the headline yesterday, public humiliation cafes make customers wear stupid hats to enforce
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:56.920]  social distancing, and it got me to think, and of course now that in the year 2020, humans
[2:57:56.920 --> 2:58:01.600]  apparently no longer have properly functioning immune systems, this is going to be our new
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:06.200]  normal, you know, scientists across the world for the past two, three months, have been
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:10.320]  working day on day and night to put a stop to coronavirus.
[2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:13.880]  Little did they know that the solution all along was right in front of their faces, and
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:20.600]  it was straw hats taped with swimming pool noodles, who knew, right?
[2:58:20.600 --> 2:58:26.080]  The cafe in Germany is making customers wear the hats to enforce proper social distancing.
[2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:30.400]  When he talked to one of the customers at this cafe in Germany, he said, quote, it's
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:35.600]  totally uncomfortable, of course, like all of this stuff is, but the bottom line is that
[2:58:35.600 --> 2:58:41.240]  we put a lot of effort into it so that we can go to our cafes in public, because supposedly
[2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:48.960]  a deadly virus that spreads so easily is surely going to be stopped by a novelty, foam hat.
[2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:54.240]  And then there's also the question of these hats being passed on to the next customer
[2:58:54.240 --> 2:58:59.520]  whenever these people leave the cafe anyway, potentially passing on the infection if you
[2:58:59.520 --> 2:59:01.520]  believe it's that deadly.
[2:59:01.520 --> 2:59:08.160]  Absolute genius idea, genius, but again, it got me to thinking, is this just a gimmick?
[2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:12.680]  Is this just a ridiculous temporary thing that we're going to look back on in two, three,
[2:59:12.680 --> 2:59:15.520]  four months time, laugh and shake our heads?
[2:59:15.520 --> 2:59:18.960]  Or is this going to go on for years and years and years?
[2:59:18.960 --> 2:59:24.480]  Again, are they making it so uncomfortable and so cringe worthy to operate in the outside
[2:59:24.480 --> 2:59:27.600]  world that that's how they make us stay indoors?
[2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:33.840]  I was watching a video out of Australia, Sydney, Australia yesterday, a guy walking
[2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:39.320]  through a mall, one of those giant indoor malls with a video camera, basically the mall is
[2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:44.800]  almost completely empty, announcements on the public address system every five minutes about
[2:59:44.800 --> 2:59:51.160]  social distancing, stickers every 20 meters on the ground, barking orders at you about
[2:59:51.160 --> 2:59:56.160]  social distancing, this is already being put in place, doesn't look like it's going to
[2:59:56.160 --> 3:00:00.120]  be very temporary to me.
[3:00:00.120 --> 3:00:05.880]  This is the new normal and there's an element, of course, of ritual public humiliation.
[3:00:05.880 --> 3:00:10.280]  Now I was looking at this story out of the cafe in Germany, because we also have the
[3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:16.360]  story out of Maryland, where they've got people prancing around, literally wearing
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:22.120]  bumper tables, like they're in a McDonald's playpen, and they don't want anyone to get
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:26.400]  near the kids, so they literally imprison them within the table itself.
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:34.800]  And this whole idea of the mandating of wearing things, wearing the table, wearing the silly
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:42.280]  hat, this swimming pool noodle hat at the restaurant, wearing the visor, they're now wearing visors,
[3:00:42.280 --> 3:00:48.200]  wearing masks, the idea of the state or the authorities enforcing the wearing of silly
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:54.560]  hats and other attire in order to ritually humiliate the public, to either punish them
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:00:56.920]  or keep them in line.
[3:00:56.920 --> 3:01:02.000]  Now is there any historical precedent for that, well yes there is, remember the dunce
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  cap.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:11.160]  Now since the 1600s, of course the word dunce has meant a particularly stupid person.
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:16.440]  People were made to wear dunce caps so they could be marked for their idiocy, and of course
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:23.560]  up until I guess about 50 years ago in schools, definitely at a turn of the 1900s the kids
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:28.000]  were wearing these hats, and there's an image of one there.
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:35.440]  Then were punished for doing or saying something stupid by being made to stand facing the wall
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:42.800]  while wearing a silly dunce's cap, treating people like naughty children by making them
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:47.280]  wear silly hats to enforce good behaviour.
[3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:51.840]  Some kind of connection there, there's some kind of similarity I'm picking up on, can't
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:57.800]  quite put my finger on it, and of course then if you look at communist China, they employed
[3:01:57.800 --> 3:02:04.760]  the same thing, the dunce cap was used during the cultural revolution in communist China,
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:09.480]  dissidents were forced to wear the dunce cap on which their crimes against the state were
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:15.840]  announced, and in fact there's a BBC news article, headline, rare Chinese cultural revolution
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:22.280]  photos on display, and it shows one of these dissidents with his crimes against the communist
[3:02:22.280 --> 3:02:29.480]  regime written on the dunce cap, and he stood there being ritually publicly humiliated.
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:34.200]  Those who were charged with betraying the communist cause were marched through the street during
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:40.720]  this era, they see the picture there, wearing the dunce cap as they were spat on and verbally
[3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:41.720]  abused.
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:48.720]  Now I'm not comparing the wearing of silly swimming pool noodle hats in German cafes
[3:02:48.720 --> 3:02:54.320]  to Chinese dissidents being tortured, but there is a spirit of the authorities making
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:59.600]  people wear silly attire to go about their business, to go about their normal day and
[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:02.600]  people accepting it.
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:09.800]  You could also look at the shaved heads, of course thousands, probably millions of men
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:15.120]  in the western world at least over the past few months have decided to shave their heads
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:19.840]  because they couldn't get a haircut, in the UK they're saying we won't be able to get
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:27.560]  a haircut until August, there's been one coronavirus death in London, now in fact I
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:34.920]  think there's one coronavirus case, one, a single case in London on Saturday, and yet
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:38.680]  where they're saying we're going to be locked down for the next two and a half months at
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:43.440]  least we won't even be able to get a haircut until August, I'm going to have to fly to
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:51.000]  Spain to get a haircut because they've already opened up largely, but this idea of men having
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:55.200]  to shave their heads because they can't get a haircut, of course shaving someone's head
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:04:02.000]  is another form of ritual public humiliation and in fact disgraced dissidents who had displeased
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:08.160]  Chairman Mao would also be publicly shamed by having their heads shaved, of course you've
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:13.600]  probably seen the footage out of France at the end of World War II where women who had
[3:04:13.600 --> 3:04:18.960]  slept with or being informants for Nazis were dragged out into the street and publicly
[3:04:18.960 --> 3:04:25.240]  humiliated by having their heads shaved, of course head shaving is a common thing when
[3:04:25.240 --> 3:04:31.600]  you enter a prison and it's partially done as a demeaning gesture so now everyone's wearing
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:39.520]  silly hats, everyone's shaving their heads and this is all an act of ritual public humiliation
[3:04:39.520 --> 3:04:45.360]  then of course you have the classic archetype of the court jester also known as the Fool
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:51.320]  or the Bafoon who was basically a medieval clown under the ownership of the elites,
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:56.880]  the royals, the jester's job was to keep his masters entertained and of course a lot
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:01.520]  of these jesters that we know from history had mental illnesses and were basically kept
[3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:08.400]  as pets for the amusement of the elite, they wore hats called Fool's hats and if you do
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:13.920]  a comparison of a jester's hat and a swimming pool noodle hat that we see there in the cafe
[3:05:13.920 --> 3:05:22.240]  in Germany also some similarities there so this entire idea of the state or the authorities
[3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:28.240]  forcing you to wear silly attire to go about your daily business or to punish people for
[3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:34.080]  not being obedient enough there's very much a strain of that that we see going on right
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:39.960]  now and of course it's all largely pointless because the latest data that we've seen has
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:46.120]  shown that social distancing has no real impact on stopping the spread of Covid, Sweden which
[3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:51.080]  didn't lock down has a lower death rate than the UK which did lock down from the end of
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:56.600]  March and we're increasingly beginning to understand that this disease which by the
[3:05:56.600 --> 3:06:02.960]  way spreads mainly in hospitals can only be spread when in very close prolonged contact
[3:06:02.960 --> 3:06:11.920]  with an infected person. Wearing a foam hat made of straw and swimming pool noodles foam
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:16.200]  really think that's going to stop a disease if it's that deadly if it's that easy to
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:21.920]  transmit or is this about something else I'm going to get on to the mask wearers because
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:28.160]  now we have more examples of Karens exploiting this coronavirus paranoia and femurongering
[3:06:28.160 --> 3:06:33.880]  to enforce their petty mandates in terms of controlling the personal behaviour of other
[3:06:33.880 --> 3:06:38.880]  people they're having a whale of a time don't go away we'll be right back summit.news.
[3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:44.840]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history the
[3:06:44.840 --> 3:06:49.280]  globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like yeah you're
[3:06:49.280 --> 3:06:54.440]  taking implantable chips yeah we're in the pedophilia yeah we're in the world government
[3:06:54.440 --> 3:07:01.000]  yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are shutting your ass down yeah we told
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:05.200]  you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore you're
[3:07:05.200 --> 3:07:09.400]  going to be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that there's no
[3:07:09.400 --> 3:07:14.760]  more service economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:20.800]  pens income so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now we have
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:25.080]  to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you understanding you were
[3:07:25.080 --> 3:07:30.240]  right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now
[3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:35.960]  while you still can now is the time for action now is the time for you to shine and be the
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:46.640]  Paul Revere's you know you are as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality
[3:07:46.640 --> 3:07:54.560]  energy and overall wellness and that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to

[3:08:33.480 --> 3:08:36.840]  waiting for go to the info or store never been a better time than right now super male
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:53.400]  vitality at info or store dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:09:12.640]  so you see this process of ritual public humiliation going on across the west with the new normal
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:19.000]  the new social distancing normal of course attendant to this we have the new high priest
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:25.280]  class which is the mask wearers and in the United Kingdom we have a weekly religious
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:31.040]  cult initiation ritual where everybody goes outside the front doors onto their balconies
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:36.440]  and applause the NHS some people who don't applaud the NHS because either they choose
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:42.760]  not to or they just forget or being richly publicly humiliated there was one case where
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:49.320]  a woman forgot to applaud the NHS because she was trying to put a kid to sleep he was
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:54.000]  being unruly so she was tired she fell asleep she forgot to applaud the NHS the next day
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:10:00.520]  she was shamed by her entire community for not publicly applauding the NHS of course
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:09.080]  we've got flags Catholic flags outside churches in the UK being replaced with NHS flags these
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.560]  are the frontline heroes actual frontline heroes of people who go to war but apparently
[3:10:13.560 --> 3:10:17.560]  we've dispensed with that notion people just doing their jobs in empty hospitals making
[3:10:17.560 --> 3:10:24.720]  TikTok dance videos they're the new frontline heroes and of course the general public wants
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:31.960]  to adopt the look the bizarre to the aesthetic of the new high priest class by wearing the
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:39.360]  masks and I go out in the park running every day the people in the park where I live people
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:44.760]  wearing the masks they're not elderly people I see elderly people out in the park the ones
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:48.920]  most at risk they tell us from coronavirus and it would be perfectly understandable
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:57.000]  if they were wearing masks they're not who's wearing the masks women aged 40 to 50 named
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:05.120]  Karen I'm going to get into that and another story about that in a moment and young people
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:13.160]  when I'm out in the park it's all people aged 18 to 30 wearing the masks 33 people in the
[3:11:13.160 --> 3:11:19.280]  UK under the age of 40 have died from coronavirus now obviously in every case for the families
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:26.960]  affected that's tragic but the risk of people aged 18 to 30 dying from coronavirus is minimal
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:33.000]  there was one new case of coronavirus in London on Saturday they're all wearing masks they're
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:40.640]  not at risk at all in fact somebody did a comparison they found that if you're under
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:48.560]  the age of 21 this is in the UK you're equally as likely to die from falling over while putting
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:57.800]  your pants on as coronavirus yet these people are wearing masks it's absolute brainwashed
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:04.840]  mind control but again they're wearing the mask because it's a status symbol of obedience
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:11.400]  and it means they can lecture you if you're not being similarly obedient in fact we had
[3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:18.920]  a protest in Hyde Park on Saturday people protesting against the lockdowns about 300
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:25.800]  people there police turned up arrested I think more than a dozen of them extinction rebellion
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:30.040]  the climate change action group they had a massive protest nobody went near them that's
[3:12:30.040 --> 3:12:34.400]  fine as long as you're protesting the right thing the police won't harass you and there
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:41.720]  was a case where as lockdown skeptics.org reported quote one cyclist deliberately accelerated
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:47.120]  towards some protesters who managed to avoid a collision by the skin of their teeth so
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:54.680]  literally one of these lockdown cult members on a bike broke his social distancing rules
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:02.160]  to try and plow into this group of anti lockdown protesters no doubt he was wearing a mask
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:07.000]  no doubt plenty of Karen's across the United Kingdom are wearing their masks too and we
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:13.840]  have an article about that right here video Karen takes her family to the beach complains
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:19.520]  other people are at the beach the video of a British woman has gone viral after she took
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:23.160]  her entire family to the beach and then complained that there were too many other people at the
[3:13:23.160 --> 3:13:29.400]  beach who were not social distancing now of course under the easing of the lockdown which
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:34.960]  came into force last week you're allowed to go to the beach she's allowed to go to the
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:39.680]  beach she took her entire family to the beach she drove an hour and a half away from where
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:46.280]  she lives to get there but still complained about other people not social distancing she
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:51.320]  said it's lovely to get out but I'm quite shocked at how many people are here they're
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:55.840]  not paying attention to social distancing I find that quite annoying to be honest it's
[3:13:55.840 --> 3:14:04.360]  like being in Tesco okay Karen you're in Tesco too you're going to the garden centers you're
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:08.560]  going to the beach and then lecturing and pointing your finger at other people for doing
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:16.840]  exactly the same thing Karen's daughter Karen said it's nice to get out of quarantine but
[3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:20.800]  I think it's going to peak again because everyone's going to go mad and go anywhere they can
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:25.920]  which again they keep saying oh there's going to be a second wave there's going to be a
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:31.480]  second wave despite the fact that this is dropping off exponentially in Germany in these
[3:14:31.480 --> 3:14:37.800]  other places where they've eased lockdown now a couple of weeks ago there's no second wave
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:43.520]  in fact every time the R rate of infection goes slightly up in Germany it's the top headline
[3:14:43.520 --> 3:14:49.080]  in the UK next day it goes down even more it's not even in the news so they keep repeating
[3:14:49.080 --> 3:14:54.880]  this threat of there's going to be a second infection so they can just re-implement all
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:15:01.520]  this lockdown tyranny on a win Twitter users hold up in their tiny one bedroom city flats
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:08.920]  without gardens or fresh air immediately poured forth their disgust at anyone being outside
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:13.400]  somebody responded to Karen by saying for someone who is engaging in selfish irresponsible
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:18.560]  behavior to criticize others for selfish irresponsible behavior is the height of hypocrisy don't
[3:15:18.560 --> 3:15:23.040]  go to the beach or other beauty hotspots don't drive one and a half hours ago anywhere just
[3:15:23.040 --> 3:15:31.920]  stay at home now also in the UK we have people not not sending their kids to school we have
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:38.440]  people getting paid by the government to sit on their arses sunbathing while the future
[3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:44.840]  of their country turns to crap in the UK we have this furlough scheme where 80% of people's
[3:15:44.840 --> 3:15:50.640]  wages are paid by the government now if you factor in the fact that they don't have to
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:56.720]  travel to work which is incredibly expensive in the UK you factor in that they're not going
[3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:01.800]  out socializing after work which is what a lot of people do obviously in major cities
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:07.320]  that extra 20% they're probably saving a chunk of that money too so they basically getting
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:13.040]  paid what they would anyway to sit on their backsides all day and sunbathing and they
[3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:18.320]  don't want to go back to work you look at the polls out of the UK the support for the
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:24.680]  government went down after they ease the lockdown they wanted the lockdown to become even more
[3:16:24.680 --> 3:16:30.160]  intense because they're getting paid almost all of their wages to sit on their backsides
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:37.040]  and sunbathing I mean that is Stockholm syndrome if ever I heard of it we also have a debate
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:43.920]  about kids going back to school article here out of lockdown skeptics says the row over
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:48.200]  school openings rumbles on the mail sites evidence from 22 countries on the continent
[3:16:48.200 --> 3:16:53.840]  that an EU briefing which suggests that reopening schools has not been harmful to children and
[3:16:53.840 --> 3:17:00.280]  teachers so in 22 other countries they've reopened the schools of course children almost impossible
[3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:05.640]  for them to catch coronavirus anyway yet we have a massive debate in the UK where trade
[3:17:05.640 --> 3:17:10.840]  unionist activists are given platforms on BBC and Sky News to say how dare the government
[3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:16.240]  want to send kids back to school at the beginning of June despite the fact that the data shows
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:21.440]  the risk of them getting covid is infinitesimal despite the fact that keeping kids out of
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:28.120]  school harms the poorest kids in society because they can't afford their parents can't afford
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:34.280]  or are incapable of homeschooling get into that and more on the next side of this break
[3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:42.760]  summit don't use to go away the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed
[3:17:42.760 --> 3:17:49.640]  to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny
[3:17:49.640 --> 3:17:56.840]  led by the WHO and the Bill and the Gates Foundation in full control many will submit
[3:17:56.840 --> 3:18:02.320]  through fear others will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit they're building
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:08.760]  a post human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:16.600]  into its end game submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next
[3:18:16.600 --> 3:18:22.720]  generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:28.840]  actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul your future being poured inside
[3:18:28.840 --> 3:18:35.200]  out this is a scientific dictatorship to full control of humanity for its own selfless
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:40.200]  disgusting power trip I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:44.440]  that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things but you notice
[3:18:44.440 --> 3:18:49.480]  almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning everybody to
[3:18:49.480 --> 3:18:54.880]  try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it if
[3:18:54.880 --> 3:18:58.200]  you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and
[3:18:58.200 --> 3:19:02.880]  drown people don't listen they go out their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.880]  this is the death of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century
[3:19:07.880 --> 3:19:13.520]  warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's
[3:19:13.520 --> 3:19:17.920]  quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make
[3:19:17.920 --> 3:19:23.200]  us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post human technocracy I know all
[3:19:23.200 --> 3:19:28.200]  this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:33.560]  it's their operations manual I wish this wasn't the case but there really are evil psychopaths
[3:19:33.560 --> 3:19:39.920]  in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them as I record this announcement
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:47.000]  there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020 we will not have this sale that's
[3:19:47.000 --> 3:19:53.360]  coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes up all of our best selling supplements

[3:20:40.440 --> 3:21:00.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show live from the summit.news headquarters it's Paul
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:11.400]  Joseph Watson so this whole lockdown debate has been completely politicized in the UK
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:14.160]  as it has been in the US and many other countries we have a big debate over when to send kids
[3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:19.320]  back to school they've missed months and months of education of course the left grandstands
[3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:23.560]  and says we have to protect the kids from the deadly disease which doesn't really affect
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:28.880]  them all infinitesimal risk of them actually getting and spreading covid now they're saying
[3:21:28.880 --> 3:21:33.360]  that the government shouldn't send kids back to school because that is putting the kids
[3:21:33.360 --> 3:21:40.440]  at risk and they claim to be wanting to protect the poor in urging them not to do so even
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:46.760]  though the kids who will be harmed most are the poorer kids in society because their parents
[3:21:46.760 --> 3:21:53.120]  can't afford or are incapable of providing them home school facilities so once again
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:58.880]  they don't care about the poor they only care about obtaining power now they're saying oh
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:03.920]  because of the lockdown we need to stop Brexit because of the lockdown we need to throw out
[3:22:03.920 --> 3:22:10.240]  the government it's been completely exploited and politicized and as I was talking about
[3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:15.360]  before the break we now have this new high priest class of mask wearers who get to enforce
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:22.440]  their petty decrees at every level of society that's why many people support this because
[3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:28.600]  if they display enough obedience they will get rewarded and in fact there's a little
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:35.000]  story here out of a again lockdown skeptics of a guy who visited a garden centre I'll
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:39.240]  read what he said here he said coming back today my wife and I were faced by a young
[3:22:39.240 --> 3:22:46.360]  chap in the car park wearing a surgical mask your new leader even though I understand the
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:51.640]  risk of infection in the open air is negligible inside the garden centre we were greeted by
[3:22:51.640 --> 3:22:58.120]  the usual tape on the floor to keep us the required distance apart but again everyone
[3:22:58.120 --> 3:23:05.120]  sported the sinister masks and this is the truly bizarre part several also wore plastic
[3:23:05.120 --> 3:23:11.120]  visors of the type of groundsmen might wear for streaming duties because again they've
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:17.080]  now gone beyond the mask they're wearing like almost Darth Vader helmets one single
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:21.640]  new case of coronavirus in London and people are out on the streets wearing Darth Vader
[3:23:21.640 --> 3:23:28.680]  helmets this is absurd he said the reason for this flummox me when it was time to pay
[3:23:28.680 --> 3:23:34.120]  there was a single till with a checkerboard area marked out in front we were instructed
[3:23:34.120 --> 3:23:39.480]  to deposit our trolley in this area and move away the lady on the till then emerged from
[3:23:39.480 --> 3:23:45.960]  behind a plastic screen reached for the trolley arms length and after drawing it back to safety
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:50.960]  totted up our purchases he said the reason I think this rather odd experience is important
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:54.600]  is that for most of his shopping should be a pleasure and this is what I was talking
[3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:59.160]  about at the start of the show if they make everything so cringe worthy and difficult
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:04.160]  like little squares where you're allowed to sit in the park equally spaced out nobody's
[3:24:04.160 --> 3:24:08.760]  going to want to go out it's going to be hell he says if it isn't who will go supermarkets
[3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:14.480]  and similar will survive as we all need provisions but what of the others will we really be piling
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.480]  in and kickstarting the economy if the experience is anything like mine today I suspect many
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:25.640]  will either do without or shop online that's a terrible thought and I hope I'm wrong and
[3:24:25.640 --> 3:24:31.240]  again it's all about this remoulding society around this prison pod planet with the high
[3:24:31.240 --> 3:24:37.240]  priest class mask wearers barking instructions at you if you get too close to anything meanwhile
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:41.400]  while you're out in the park they literally just drive straight into you they don't care
[3:24:41.400 --> 3:24:47.120]  because it's about power they don't actually think they're stopping the spread of the disease
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:55.080]  another article in relation to that psychotherapist lockdown zealots are behaving like cult members
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:59.760]  this is psychotherapist doctor he will born who says lockdown zealots are displaying all
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:05.280]  the classic signs of cult members by doubling down on their beliefs despite having been
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:10.600]  proven wrong and he highlights the work of a respected social psychologist called Leon
[3:25:10.600 --> 3:25:16.880]  Festinger this was back in the 50s who analyzed the belief of a UFO cult who believed that
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:22.720]  flying saucer would rescue them from the apocalypse however after the catastrophic earthquakes
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:26.680]  and floods they expected to hit the United States never arrived and their beliefs were
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:32.600]  totally disproved the cult members would become not less but more convinced of their beliefs
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:38.680]  which is kind of why even though these we've reached the plateau and in fact we've flattened
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:43.520]  the curve and these coronavirus cases are starting to fall off a cliff especially in
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:50.120]  cities like London the mask wearer seemed to be increasing and increasing in their paranoia
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:56.400]  because they're doubling down on it now he identified five conditions that needed to
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:02.360]  be met in order for the cult members to double down on their beliefs and he noted this is
[3:26:02.360 --> 3:26:07.880]  the hue will born the doctor how terrifying predictions of how many people COVID-19 would
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:12.320]  kill had fallen massively sure and that the models that produce these numbers have been
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:18.080]  thoroughly debunked despite warnings that coronavirus would kill half a million people
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:24.360]  in the UK alone that was what our lockdown model was based on the disease has only claimed
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:32.600]  318,000 so far worldwide again that is tragic but it's massively massively less than what
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:36.640]  we were told would happen right at the start and people say oh well it's because we locked
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:41.880]  down that's why we that's why we came in way below the numbers Sweden didn't lock down
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:48.840]  they have less deaths than the UK per capita will bond says to put this figure into perspective
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:53.040]  the number of people who have died off or with COVID-19 in about four and a half months
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:58.360]  is the same as the number who died in five days from cardiovascular disease and of course
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:27:05.880]  as we know as illustrated by the classic man bitten by shock dies of coronavirus meme
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:11.280]  many many of these coronavirus deaths were people in hospital with serious illnesses
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:17.640]  many of whom would have died anyway or the coronavirus merely shorten their lives by
[3:27:17.640 --> 3:27:23.440]  a matter of months the doctor notes how experts are still doubling down anyway warning of
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:28.560]  mass death if lockdown is lifted too early and a second wave of infections in reality
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:32.400]  research suggests that the lockdowns had a minimal impact on infection numbers and Sweden's
[3:27:32.400 --> 3:27:38.080]  per capita death toll is lower than the UK's and numerous other countries despite the Scandinavian
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:44.080]  country having imposed no hard lockdown and in fact if you compare Sweden to a country
[3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:51.120]  like the Republic of Ireland similar land mass similar population similarly spaced out
[3:27:51.120 --> 3:27:56.200]  population the Republic of Ireland locked down Sweden didn't again Sweden's per capita
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:28:03.160]  death rate an infection rate was lower than the Republic of Ireland Toby Young says is
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:08.880]  this starting to sound familiar as Wilburne points out the sequence that Festinger wrote
[3:28:08.880 --> 3:28:15.080]  about more than 50 years ago is eerily reminiscent of what's happening today an apocalyptic prophecy
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:21.040]  was delivered from on high the science those who believed it radically altered their behavior
[3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:26.040]  the prophecy turned out not to be true but instead of abandoning their doomongering the
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:31.160]  believers have become even more fervent attacking anyone who points out the gap between fantasy
[3:28:31.160 --> 3:28:39.080]  and reality as dangerous heretics fake news misinformation conspiracy theories because
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:45.160]  now we have actual doctors getting banned on YouTube simply for questioning the experts
[3:28:45.160 --> 3:28:51.000]  the same experts who have been proven wrong and in fact given out contradictory information
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:58.160]  time and time again young continues the difference of course is that Festinger's UFO cult had
[3:28:58.160 --> 3:29:04.600]  a few dozen members whereas the COVID cult seems to infected half the world if Festinger's
[3:29:04.600 --> 3:29:08.440]  right the bad news is we won't be able to persuade people to stop social distancing
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:15.200]  if we prove that the danger posed by COVID-19 has been dramatically overstated on the contrary
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:20.040]  people's opposition to returning to normal will intensify rather than diminish as the
[3:29:20.040 --> 3:29:26.600]  evidence mounts that they were wrong and of course that's made a lot easier if the government's
[3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:33.180]  paying 80% of your wages and you're making up the rest of the 20% with you know avoiding
[3:29:33.180 --> 3:29:38.800]  travel costs social costs all that kind of thing very very tempting to sit on your backside
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:44.960]  on a balcony as I see every day from my window when your wages are being paid of course the
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:49.120]  economy's gone to total pot millions of people are going to be unemployed there's probably
[3:29:49.120 --> 3:29:54.360]  going to be a little economy to go back to but they get to sunbathe and they get to watch
[3:29:54.360 --> 3:30:00.840]  Netflix and that's what's important spin reports Travis McCready played first socially distant
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:08.520]  concert if you look at the pictures it looks completely boring and invasive and nobody
[3:30:08.520 --> 3:30:14.080]  would want to go to these kind of concerts they've taped off six of the toilet stalls
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:20.200]  with caution tape and they've taped off one of the sinks with caution tape for this socially
[3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:26.040]  distant concert because taping off one sink in a bathroom is surely going to stop the
[3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:32.720]  spread of deadly COVID-19 don't go away summit dot news final segment coming up we'll be back
[3:30:32.720 --> 3:31:01.720]  the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persist the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy
[3:31:01.720 --> 3:31:21.720]  that's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen
[3:31:21.720 --> 3:31:36.720]  because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's just open and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening
[3:31:36.720 --> 3:31:57.720]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all of the news we see the u n billable indicates w h o mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response
[3:31:57.720 --> 3:32:10.720]  and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus
[3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:24.720]  well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab
[3:32:24.720 --> 3:32:35.720]  the resistance lives at bandot video and in full wars dot com spread those links and channel it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker
[3:32:54.720 --> 3:32:56.720]  when you need a little help
[3:33:24.720 --> 3:33:49.720]  it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months
[3:33:49.720 --> 3:33:59.720]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:25.720]  we are now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut your life down it will save lives
[3:34:25.720 --> 3:34:36.720]  no it's caused millions to already starve to death tens of millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations

[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:38.720]  sweden sweden got one thing right in the past 30 years of its history but they continue to get a lot of things wrong sweden 19 year old man killed while trying to stop migrant rape of woman 19 year old swedish man was stabbed to death while trying to
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:56.720]  prevent a Sudanese migrant raping a woman at a party what happened is there was a party in the town of hornow sand in eastern sweden a group of migrants broke in and one of them a Sudanese migrant tried to rape a girl while a 19 year old man tried to stop him the
[3:36:56.720 --> 3:37:10.720]  teenager did not expect the migrant to have a knife with him I don't know why didn't expect him so he stabbed him easily the the migrant finally raped the girl twice more the individual who tried to stop the rate was later named as 19 year old
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:26.720]  Thomas Lind he was a supporter of the populist alternative for Sweden party and his friends said he had a strong sense of justice and always tried to come to the aid of those in need the culprit the rapist was named as 22 year old
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:47.720]  Abu Bakr Mohammed a Sudanese migrant who was granted Swedish citizenship in 2011 and surprise surprise had a long criminal record including a 2015 conviction of raping a girl under the age of 15 for some reason a guy who raped a child was out on the streets
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:38:04.720]  four or five years later what's the explanation for that we're in Sweden that's the explanation but this goes even worse after the story got a national media attention a group calling itself the Nordic resistance tried to hold a protest in hornow sand the same town
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:22.720]  but authorities denied the application the protest went ahead anyway and was subsequently described as a Nazi demonstration by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT so a group of people basically tried to go out and protest against the fact that
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:38.720]  this migrant was out on the streets despite having raped a child he raped another girl at a party the guy who tried to stop the rate was viciously stabbed to death they wanted to protest that they went out on the street and they were subsequently demonised as Nazis by Sweden's
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:54.720]  tax payer funded public broadcaster because of course they were this is Sweden the article the SVT article also completely failed to mention that the demonstration was against the migrant rape of the woman and subsequent murder of the 19 year old man
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:39:11.720]  and I've read the article they just say how dare these Nazis show up to protest in our town we need to kick them out don't even mention what they were protesting as we have exhaustively documented Sweden has a massive rape problem due to its total failure to integrate migrants after sustained years of mass immigration
[3:39:11.720 --> 3:39:26.720]  of course they have grenade attacks which have now become commonplace across the country and it's all still derided as a conspiracy theory by the media just as no go zones are still called conspiracy theories in France
[3:39:26.720 --> 3:39:41.720]  headline migrant youths in riot migrant youths riot in Paris attacked police with fireworks migrant youths rioted in Paris yet again last night attacking police with fireworks in response to the death of a teen motorcyclist again they did the exact same thing
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:58.720]  last month after there was a confrontation between police and a motorcyclist the same thing happened again the disorder began after the death of 18 year old Sabri Chubby who was killed after ramming into a pole while not wearing a helmet on the northern outskirts of Paris on Saturday evening
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:14.720]  of course the migrants immediately blamed the police and used it as an excuse to riot burn cars throw fireworks and other missiles at the police because that's what they like to do police responded by firing tear gas at gangs who had gathered near public housing
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:29.720]  estates before arresting six people the migrants then set three cars alive burned 20 dumpsters and apparently tried to set a local police station on fire by bombarding it with Molotov cocktails when this happened the exact same thing
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:47.720]  happened last month for four nights in a row in Paris and in other areas of France the media described the unrest as anti lockdown riots it wasn't anti lockdown riots it was something that happens in Paris time and time again because they failed to integrate huge
[3:40:47.720 --> 3:41:05.720]  communities of migrants who live out on the edge of the city meanwhile in London UK judge rules 14 year old boy is safer living in Sierra Leone than London a judge in the UK is ruled a 14 year old boy is safer living in Sierra Leone then London due to the English
[3:41:05.720 --> 3:41:25.720]  capital's problem with crime gangs this was a guy who was excluded from school in 2019 after going off the rails having become involved with crime gangs in south London and the judge ordered him to be sent back to Sierra Leone because he said he would be safe there
[3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:40.720]  and as I've documented many times before we also have Somali immigrant parents who live in London who are now sending their teenage sons back to Somalia because they believe they'll be safer there than in London
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:56.720]  according to metropolitan police figures 73% of knife offenders and 53% of victims are from a black or ethnic minority background of course we've had problems with violent criminal gangs in London for decades but the violence has definitely ticked up as a result of mass
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:12.720]  migration because you get gang members coming in from even more violent countries in Africa so then all the local gangs have to up their level of violence to compete with them but now it's gone so bad that immigrant parents are actually sending their kids back to Africa back to
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:28.720]  Sierra Leone and Somalia because it's just become too much that kind of tells you everything you need to know the independent reports grooming gang characteristics research to be published after government U-turn research on the characteristics of grooming
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:44.720]  gang is to be published by the government following a U-turn of course the left didn't want this research to come out because as we've known from other studies in the past 86% of grooming gang members people who abduct children rate them sex traffic at them in the United
[3:42:44.720 --> 3:43:04.720]  Kingdom or from Bangladesh and Pakistan that is a hate fact 86% in response to a freedom of information request by the independent home office previously said releasing the paper would not be in the public interest again because it's going to be a little bit too honest about the situation
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:20.720]  the response sparked a government petition that's so far been signed by almost 126,000 people demanding the release of the official research on grooming gangs undertaken by the government in full so the conservative government tried to sit on this report for months and months and months
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:36.720]  finally after massive pressure the truth is going to come out I don't think people are going to like the results UK police force humiliated for launching manhunt for trucker who kissed a woman on the cheek this is the same police force by the way Derbyshire police
[3:43:36.720 --> 3:43:52.720]  who previously faced heat for bragging about using a surveillance drone to identify publicly shame there is again ritual public humiliation dog walkers in remote countryside during the early days of the lockdown they were also ridiculed after they died a blue lagoon black
[3:43:52.720 --> 3:44:08.720]  in order to deter people from gathering there yes they actually did that they went out into a remote part of the countryside because some people were sitting next to a lagoon spaced I don't know half a mile apart from each other that's not acceptable
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:24.720]  they died it black to put people off going there well now they're facing more humiliation after trying to enlist the public's help in a manhunt for a trucker who committed the dastardly crime of kissing a woman on the on the cheek how dare he
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:40.720]  they put out a tweet appealing for help to identify the man who kissed a woman on the cheek to thank her for helping when his lorry became stuck under a low bridge they got absolutely rinsed on Twitter for that yet still despite deleting the tweet came out and said
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:45:00.720]  no we're actually still looking for the public's help in identifying this dastardly culprit cartoon network teaches kids about intersect non binary gender identities this is the show Stevens universe written by a bisexual non binary woman surprise surprise her Wikipedia says page says
[3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:18.720]  she's encouraged her she encourages the importance of LGBT representation in art especially in children's entertainment and of course exposing children toddlers to sexuality to this gender identity crap as young as the age of 304 is definitely
[3:45:18.720 --> 3:45:34.720]  awesome and good I'm sure you'll agree it's gonna wrap it up coming up next war room with our inch Royer summit don't use don't go away
