[02:07.900 --> 02:12.240]  Couch shot some of the balloons with a BB gun to lower himself to the ground.
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.360]  I would say the best thing is just the piece, the serenity of the trip.
[02:16.360 --> 02:17.360]  It's just so quiet.

[03:58.260 --> 04:03.740]  I never felt very happy about my ground strokes here, but my serve I felt like any time

[07:24.540 --> 07:27.300]  I have got five big stacks of important news
[07:27.300 --> 07:30.900]  I'm gonna mention some of that now and cover it throughout the next two hours, but I
[07:31.580 --> 07:35.820]  Want to take a lot of calls today and that means have your question your comment ready
[07:35.820 --> 07:42.340]  If you have a question for me about the private Federal Reserve or about why gas prices are up or you disagree with something
[07:42.340 --> 07:45.060]  I've said or you want to add something to a point
[07:45.060 --> 07:46.780]  I'm making or you want to mention
[07:46.780 --> 07:51.100]  Something that you saw in your local news that you think is important or international news

[08:36.380 --> 08:43.300]  It is 836 0 590. Okay. Here are the stacks of news. I have let me just read you some of these headlines
[08:43.940 --> 08:47.380]  High gas prices threatened to shut down rural towns
[08:48.140 --> 08:54.380]  USA today and I have a lot of family that lives in the country and he's Texas and
[08:54.700 --> 09:00.140]  I knew a year ago that it was really hurting a lot of local businesses and people that have to commute a
[09:01.060 --> 09:03.660]  Lot of people aren't going on vacations now
[09:03.660 --> 09:08.100]  You know working-class folks because of the gas prices and that was a year ago
[09:08.100 --> 09:13.220]  It is crippling our society because like it or not. We're a sprawling society
[09:13.220 --> 09:18.420]  We are distributed across the land more than say Europe where they have these highly compact urban centers
[09:18.580 --> 09:21.080]  that we are a new world country and so
[09:21.420 --> 09:27.020]  It's more spread out built around the automobile and I'm gonna tell you the gas prices are hurting every business out there
[09:27.060 --> 09:32.900]  Not just people selling gas because it's costing everyone in the economy and they have less discretionary income
[09:32.900 --> 09:36.820]  So we'll talk about that really big news. I interviewed congressman Ron Paul
[09:37.620 --> 09:44.700]  Thursday and it ended up getting picked up by some newspapers and other publications. I had no idea. I got back
[09:45.660 --> 09:49.320]  This afternoon was checking the web and saw that his interview
[09:49.660 --> 09:53.380]  Got some headlines with me Thursday and it should have Ron Paul
[09:53.380 --> 09:59.980]  I hear members of Congress saying if we could only New Kairan the congressman warns of imminent confrontation
[09:59.980 --> 10:06.140]  Confrontation so I want to go over that secondarily today and stress how serious that is
[10:06.820 --> 10:12.180]  Also stories like this one London cops use knife crime as an excuse to conduct random
[10:13.020 --> 10:19.340]  Searches that violate due process that the British also have under Magna Carta similar to our fourth amendment to the US
[10:19.500 --> 10:21.500]  Bill of Rights and Constitution
[10:22.060 --> 10:24.340]  Now you can type in
[10:24.340 --> 10:30.380]  Britain proposes registering knives and they've been proposing registering knives as
[10:30.940 --> 10:36.660]  If that's going to cut back on crime you can't stop criminals and only restricts good citizens
[10:36.980 --> 10:42.420]  Speaking of violations of the fourth amendment Texas lawyer takes on bloodthirsty cops from prisonplanet.com
[10:43.140 --> 10:49.100]  The feds have federal grants out and some areas they take blood without warrants and others. It's a kangaroo
[10:49.100 --> 10:50.020]  I
[10:50.020 --> 10:54.380]  Interviewed the head of the Texas Bar Association a few weeks ago about this. Clearly. These are kangaroo
[10:55.340 --> 11:00.300]  Warrants, they're just blank check warrants and they've been losing in court on this, but they don't care
[11:00.620 --> 11:07.020]  But the problem is is that police are sticking hemophiliacs. They start bleeding everywhere because they have thin blood
[11:07.660 --> 11:12.140]  They're also trying to get take blood from diabetics and then aren't able to get it
[11:12.700 --> 11:18.420]  It's just a major threshold. They're passing. Why do the feds want this not about stopping drunk drivers folks?
[11:18.420 --> 11:24.220]  Prescription drugs kill 300,000 people or more than 10 times with drunk drivers kill every year
[11:24.220 --> 11:30.820]  Why aren't they talking about shutting that down? Also, you can't make this type stuff up news channel 10 CBS
[11:31.060 --> 11:33.060]  out of Amarillo, Texas
[11:33.660 --> 11:37.700]  And I'm just gonna play a few seconds of this. I'm not gonna play the whole newscast
[11:37.700 --> 11:41.500]  You we've got links to their site up on prisonplanet.com if you want to watch it
[11:41.500 --> 11:46.900]  But but when I read headlines like this, I think some of you may not believe me. It's so incredible
[11:46.900 --> 11:51.500]  So let's go ahead and just play 10 seconds of the FBI could investigate you
[11:51.980 --> 11:57.820]  Without a warrant without probable cause without even thinking you've done anything wrong. Go ahead and play that. Oh
[12:00.140 --> 12:03.980]  The they put new password systems on the computers that relaunch every 10 seconds
[12:03.980 --> 12:08.780]  Oh, we can't play it. We got to start putting those on disk. We can't do this anymore because it's just these computers
[12:08.780 --> 12:12.540]  Okay, here it is go ahead and roll it for people out there that our
[12:12.540 --> 12:18.460]  FBI agents could soon be allowed to investigate Americans without any evidence of wrongdoing
[12:18.980 --> 12:27.460]  According to the Justice Department news channel 10's Kristen gilfuss joins us live in the studio with what FBI agents would be looking for
[12:27.580 --> 12:28.900]  Kristen
[12:28.900 --> 12:37.220]  Walt Justice Department officials say FBI agents would rely on a terrorist profile that could single out Muslims Arabs or any other
[12:37.220 --> 12:40.540]  Racial groups okay, that's a county just you can watch the rest of it now
[12:40.540 --> 12:44.340]  That's how to Amarillo, Texas. Now you hear that you think thank God
[12:45.300 --> 12:52.260]  We need to profile people because they search old ladies. They search and harass old men with oxygen tanks
[12:53.100 --> 12:59.340]  Going to World War two memorial events. I saw him harassing old Pearl Harbor vets about four years ago in a San Francisco
[12:59.500 --> 13:01.340]  Airport when I was flying out
[13:01.340 --> 13:07.340]  I saw them getting on planes to Hawaii and they were really going over people that were on walkers that look like they were on the edge of
[13:07.340 --> 13:12.540]  Death and people say it's just mindless. They treat us all like terrorists. Well, you've been trained now
[13:13.060 --> 13:15.420]  To live under that it's been used as a pretext
[13:16.100 --> 13:20.780]  But when you actually look at the profiling federal marshals last year
[13:20.780 --> 13:24.620]  The fact some senior ones with their union to the Denver Post first broke it are
[13:25.180 --> 13:29.900]  Ordered to put millions of Americans in these databases a year for ordering
[13:30.660 --> 13:32.660]  vegetarian on an airplane or
[13:32.820 --> 13:36.420]  Taking a photograph out the window of the plane, which I thought everybody does
[13:36.420 --> 13:44.660]  Small children are put in terrorist databases for life and now it's swollen to several million people in the terrorist database
[13:45.260 --> 13:51.540]  You have all the major banks uploading your financial information guilty until proven innocent all of that violates
[13:52.140 --> 13:58.420]  The fourth amendment that has nothing to do with quote keeping you safe from terrorism
[13:58.540 --> 14:04.220]  They're using terrorism as a pretext to take our liberties and freedoms also
[14:04.220 --> 14:09.700]  We have another little clip we'll play later where Homeland Security is proposing that everyone who gets on an airplane
[14:10.780 --> 14:16.940]  Be fitted with an electronic shock bracelet now a company was proposing this a few years ago
[14:16.980 --> 14:23.380]  But now Homeland Security says yes, you'll all be guilty until proven innocent and you will wear taser
[14:24.220 --> 14:29.260]  Bracelets on your arms, which makes you all criminals all guilty until proven innocent
[14:29.260 --> 14:35.100]  I mean that's something out of the running man, but even the running man. It was only prisoners that wore bracelets around their necks
[14:35.220 --> 14:41.620]  Now it's going to be everybody just like in England. They're proposing making anyone who's even on probation
[14:41.980 --> 14:48.420]  Have an implantable microchip source on that British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC. So
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.980]  on this
[14:50.980 --> 14:57.580]  post-july 4th as we're thinking about our liberties and freedoms, you know, I was visiting family in
[14:57.580 --> 15:04.100]  Around Buffalo, Texas. We went to a nearby rodeo in Tig, Texas. I love those amateur rodeos
[15:04.100 --> 15:09.940]  I mean sometimes it's a lot better than even the star of Texas or some big professional one because it's brutal
[15:09.940 --> 15:16.180]  But the cow mugging the cow milking the the rope in the bull ride and it was crazy and when you and we get back
[15:16.180 --> 15:17.740]  I'm gonna briefly tell you
[15:17.740 --> 15:24.740]  Their idea of patriotism on July 5th when I was there last night watching the rodeo with my children and I mean
[15:24.740 --> 15:26.740]  It was like 10 minutes of indoctrination
[15:26.740 --> 15:33.380]  But never anything about what this country stands for. That's what we fight and die for and that's what's being destroyed
[15:34.300 --> 15:37.900]  We'll be right back with your phone calls a ton of other news
[15:39.180 --> 15:41.180]  right here on
[15:41.340 --> 15:43.340]  the Sunday edition

[19:55.140 --> 20:00.220]  This is the GCN radio network home to hard-hitting talk radio
[20:00.220 --> 20:12.300]  Okay, we're back live. So it's the July 4th. I'm visiting family off in northeast Texas
[20:13.660 --> 20:17.660]  And last night I took my children to a local rodeo
[20:18.940 --> 20:24.540]  The teague, Texas rodeo was there 79th year beautiful night sky out there the moon
[20:24.540 --> 20:29.180]  And for 10 maybe 15 minutes. I know in more than 10 minutes
[20:29.660 --> 20:34.620]  The announcer got up there and talked about how great America was in the red white and blue and they
[20:34.940 --> 20:39.900]  Played Johnny Cash this old flag and they rode, you know had girls ride around
[20:41.100 --> 20:45.260]  with American flags people on their hands on their hearts for more than 10 minutes and
[20:45.660 --> 20:49.180]  showing how great our troops are now they sacrifice everything and
[20:49.180 --> 20:55.180]  That's what America is all about is spreading our freedom in Iraq and everywhere else and
[20:56.140 --> 21:01.740]  How we've got to support the president and how it's not good to ridicule and criticize the government
[21:02.460 --> 21:07.500]  And it went on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[21:08.540 --> 21:11.580]  And uh, it it it looked like fascism to me
[21:12.220 --> 21:16.380]  You see the flag symbolizes we're also on tv right now
[21:16.380 --> 21:20.940]  Uh shooting for the local tv show here in Austin. I'm holding up the bill of rights
[21:21.180 --> 21:27.740]  You see it symbolizes these and the declaration of independence and that is about resistance to tyranny
[21:28.300 --> 21:36.140]  And it's about defending hard-won basic freedoms that are innate to to to human beings who aren't in bondage
[21:37.180 --> 21:40.300]  And talking to people in the country talking to family and others
[21:41.260 --> 21:44.380]  They they're all griping about why gas prices are up
[21:44.380 --> 21:51.100]  But even when you tell them well, it's because the government made the decision to devalue the dollar
[21:53.340 --> 21:59.660]  They just don't compute or when you explain to them that both parties are dissolving our borders publicly
[22:00.060 --> 22:05.900]  And bringing in the north american union and and and and overturning much of our bill of rights and constitution
[22:06.220 --> 22:10.140]  They just don't compute to them. It's just I just say i'm patriotic
[22:10.140 --> 22:14.540]  I love the red white and blue and that's the end of it. Well, I love the red white and blue
[22:15.260 --> 22:20.700]  Uh more than most people it's just I love it because I know what it symbolizes and what it means
[22:20.700 --> 22:22.700]  in fact, they had a series of uh
[22:23.340 --> 22:26.620]  Short films that they would show on newsreels before movies
[22:27.420 --> 22:33.740]  During world war two and it was why we fight those happened to be on youtube and google at least last time I checked
[22:33.980 --> 22:39.100]  I challenge everyone listening tonight or on the podcast in the next few days or when we refeed it
[22:39.100 --> 22:41.100]  until I'm live tomorrow afternoon
[22:41.660 --> 22:43.660]  On the stream at info wars.com
[22:44.300 --> 22:47.580]  I'm challenging you to write a note right now. You're driving in your 18 wheeler
[22:47.660 --> 22:52.780]  You're out of the at a shindig got the radio on or you're at home listening or you're doing gardening
[22:53.420 --> 22:58.940]  Just please if you've forgotten or nobody ever told you or you never researched what this country's about
[22:59.340 --> 23:04.380]  Go watch what the government when it wasn't as corrupt and bad put out about why we fight
[23:04.380 --> 23:11.260]  And it's the short films about because other governments want to take your guns because other governments want to take your property
[23:11.420 --> 23:13.900]  Because other governments spy on you without warrants
[23:14.460 --> 23:16.460]  because other governments
[23:17.500 --> 23:19.500]  Violate the will of the people
[23:19.500 --> 23:23.580]  I mean when you look at the fact that every major gallop pull some of the most scientific
[23:23.660 --> 23:25.660]  But they all are 85 to 92 percent
[23:25.980 --> 23:30.620]  But on average they're around 90 percent of americans including hispanics the vast majority of them
[23:30.620 --> 23:36.860]  want to control our borders and slow down the legal and control the illegal immigration
[23:37.820 --> 23:39.820]  But you notice both parties
[23:40.220 --> 23:48.060]  Want open borders push forward and act like you have got seven heads and are from pluto if you want to control our borders
[23:48.620 --> 23:49.740]  I mean there are
[23:49.740 --> 23:52.220]  600 and something million people south of the border
[23:52.860 --> 23:55.260]  Who want to come here from latin america?
[23:55.260 --> 24:01.020]  And we can't allow that driving down the wages bankrupting the welfare system. I hear this line about well
[24:01.980 --> 24:05.820]  The illegals they pick the brodish and you'll be paying a hundred dollars for a tomato
[24:05.900 --> 24:11.820]  No, uh, in fact less than 10 percent of a crop whether it's tomatoes or corn
[24:12.460 --> 24:14.220]  Or even a watermelon
[24:14.220 --> 24:17.580]  When you get it at the store was paid to who even grew it
[24:18.220 --> 24:24.220]  And less than half of that is the cost of whoever picked it picking the food is a microscopic
[24:24.220 --> 24:28.540]  Amount of the cost and the illegal aliens aren't taking the
[24:29.580 --> 24:35.180]  Crop jobs. It's driving down the wages and meat packing in custodial services in construction
[24:35.500 --> 24:38.620]  The quality it's all unraveling and then while the man works
[24:39.020 --> 24:43.420]  They have federal studies on this most of the women are then on welfare under fake names
[24:43.740 --> 24:49.660]  And so an illegal alien on average and these are government's own numbers congressional budget office numbers california's got the numbers
[24:50.140 --> 24:53.100]  takes three times as much money in services
[24:53.100 --> 24:56.060]  As they generate for the economy
[24:56.780 --> 25:01.900]  Three times. So I don't want to hear that anymore. Okay, also when we take on
[25:03.180 --> 25:09.020]  As much as 10 times a year what we did at the last peak of immigration in the 1900 about 100 years ago
[25:09.660 --> 25:15.900]  These people are virently anti-american. They are nationalistic and we won two wars with mexico
[25:16.140 --> 25:19.580]  And they teach them in their textbooks that we stole the southwest
[25:19.580 --> 25:25.500]  Texas, oklahoma all the way out to california into oregon and they're taught to hate this country now
[25:25.580 --> 25:29.740]  I am not going to sit here and play along with this huge fraud
[25:30.540 --> 25:35.900]  And just have somebody flap an american flag in my face and tell me that america is about flying
[25:37.660 --> 25:42.540]  8000 miles away and blowing the living daylights out of iraqis that did nothing to us
[25:42.540 --> 25:51.500]  Our country is falling apart right now our country is literally disintegrating into third world them. Do you know what it means?
[25:52.220 --> 25:54.220]  The peso has been
[25:54.860 --> 25:56.860]  In some I looked it up last night
[25:57.100 --> 26:01.740]  Has been as much as 50 to 1. It was 30 to 1 in the late 80s
[26:02.780 --> 26:07.580]  For much of its history. It's been about 12 and a half to 1. Guess what the peso is versus the dollar right now
[26:07.580 --> 26:12.380]  5 to 1 the peso is nearing parity. The dollar is dropping
[26:13.420 --> 26:16.780]  The dollar has dropped so much that it's almost lined up with the peso
[26:17.740 --> 26:19.740]  Now the united states in its
[26:20.300 --> 26:24.780]  235 years has never had a currency devaluation
[26:25.420 --> 26:31.740]  These wreck countries generally for good a currency devaluation wrecked the roman empire
[26:32.700 --> 26:34.700]  Hundreds of years
[26:34.860 --> 26:36.860]  Into its republic
[26:36.860 --> 26:39.100]  So again, I love this country
[26:39.180 --> 26:44.700]  So I will come on air and instead of giving you a bunch of fluff and stuff that feels good and playing
[26:45.260 --> 26:53.980]  I'm proud to be an american. We're at least I know i'm free and i'll gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
[26:54.700 --> 27:00.140]  Well, what does that mean? Because there ain't no doubt. I love this land. God bless the usa
[27:00.140 --> 27:06.140]  My family lives here. My roots are here. I'm dedicated to texas. I'm dedicated to the united states
[27:07.260 --> 27:12.380]  I can't even help myself even though they were using it for propaganda purposes and expropriating it meaning well
[27:12.460 --> 27:14.860]  They weren't doing it in an evil way. They're co-opted
[27:15.260 --> 27:18.460]  But I still get a little tear in my eye during the star spangled banner
[27:19.260 --> 27:24.060]  Even though I knew it was being expropriated and being used by the new world order and our flag now
[27:24.060 --> 27:31.420]  Worldwide is a symbol of evil and the globalists have seized our country with corporate donations and control and think tanks
[27:31.740 --> 27:38.620]  And they have now used us as an engine of terrorism corruption murders payoffs. The whole world knows about it
[27:39.980 --> 27:44.380]  And so the globalists have used our credit to buy up the planet to buy off nations
[27:45.100 --> 27:50.080]  The global corporations have used corporate welfare to to to fund themselves. They've now moved offshore
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.800]  Halliburton all of them. They're all moved offshore literally almost all of them
[27:55.040 --> 28:02.400]  And then they still prance around saying they're pro us when they've left the country and set up policies that devalued our dollar
[28:02.560 --> 28:04.560]  And robbed what's in your bank account
[28:05.600 --> 28:07.600]  So when we get back
[28:07.600 --> 28:15.360]  Tyler gary charles matt hidey ed dawn i'm going straight to your calls and later. I'm going to read through the first
[28:15.360 --> 28:18.800]  10 amendments to the bill of rights

[28:24.160 --> 28:30.320]  Is this what is happening in our country? Is the government destroying this or are they defending this?
[28:30.720 --> 28:35.200]  Because the founding fathers said anybody that attacks those amendments is traitors
[28:35.200 --> 28:45.840]  And it's not your right to resist them. It is your duty. So we are resisting them in the info war. We'll be right back

[33:35.600 --> 33:38.880]  I was going to go to tyler because he's first in line from british columbia
[33:38.880 --> 33:47.360]  But we'll go to him second because don in texas says he disagrees and people that disagree go to the head of the line
[33:47.520 --> 33:49.520]  You're on the air. Welcome don
[33:49.520 --> 33:58.880]  Howdy, alex. I wanted to let you know I agree with you on 99% of what you say, but you made a point a few days ago regarding
[33:59.520 --> 34:03.200]  The storage of precious metals that I disagree with
[34:04.400 --> 34:08.720]  And that you recommended the use of a safe deposit box
[34:09.280 --> 34:14.480]  And that's the worst place you can put it because when the administration declares
[34:14.480 --> 34:22.080]  A national emergency they're going to require a federal agent to be present when you get into your safe deposit box
[34:22.400 --> 34:24.400]  Well, let me add that
[34:24.880 --> 34:30.960]  I probably was speaking so fast like when I get excited and I was saying spread it out
[34:31.440 --> 34:34.240]  Uh, and I was saying maybe something in a safety deposit box
[34:34.880 --> 34:41.200]  You know part of your metals somewhere else because just like with a great depression there are thousands of times
[34:41.760 --> 34:43.120]  paper
[34:43.120 --> 34:48.160]  False assets garbage assets that have been triple a rated and now that's what's causing the real
[34:49.920 --> 34:52.560]  Crisis not just in the housing markets, but as you know
[34:53.360 --> 34:57.040]  With the global economy not just us markets
[34:57.520 --> 35:03.520]  And so you're absolutely right in fact governments have now from san francisco to dallas texas. I've seen it in the last few months
[35:04.400 --> 35:09.440]  england as well are just randomly going into banks and saying we're going to search a thousand
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.840]  safety deposit boxes and now in california. They have been seizing
[35:14.640 --> 35:15.840]  safety deposit boxes
[35:15.840 --> 35:23.200]  There's been some national news pieces on this and for quote the state's debt and so my grandmother
[35:23.760 --> 35:25.760]  Uh, who's I guess 83 years old
[35:25.840 --> 35:32.480]  She still remembers growing up in dallas when they had to all turn their gold in you were only allowed a wedding band or a small amount
[35:32.960 --> 35:36.960]  Because the government said we're going to give you paper for it and when they turned their gold in
[35:36.960 --> 35:40.880]  Uh, again the foreign european banks basically had control then as they do now
[35:41.360 --> 35:43.520]  That was then shipped to europe and one year later
[35:43.600 --> 35:49.680]  They doubled the price of gold and then started the devaluation that we're now at the end of today with the paper currency
[35:50.720 --> 35:53.200]  Well, I also had two other points if you got time sure
[35:53.680 --> 35:55.920]  Okay, most of my acquaintances
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.600]  Cannot comprehend an economy that is not based on federal reserve notes. I don't know how they're going to handle
[36:03.600 --> 36:07.040]  any economic significant change
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.800]  You know, it's just you know mind boggling that they cannot comprehend it beyond that and by the way
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.680]  We're already in the change folks over 70 percent. I've had the head of the new york business school
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.720]  I've had nobel prize winner joseph sticklets. I've had all these top economists on this show
[36:23.200 --> 36:29.360]  And they've said around 70 to 75 percent. They all debate that is dollar devaluation is why
[36:29.360 --> 36:37.600]  From corn to gasoline to gold is the reason we've seen doubling and tripling in those and and absolutely
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.160]  Now we're going to see an acceleration of that
[36:40.560 --> 36:46.800]  And I talk to people and they just can't get out of the stock market. They don't understand what we're telling them
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.480]  Next point
[36:50.720 --> 36:55.200]  Do you have you are you familiar with the last verse of the star spangled banner?
[36:55.200 --> 36:58.960]  Refresh my memory. Well, you want me to read it to you? Well, I know the stories
[36:58.960 --> 37:02.640]  He was out on the ship during the battle and wrote the poem. Yeah, but this is the verse the actual
[37:03.120 --> 37:06.080]  And you know, I could sing it or I could read it to you whatever you like
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.000]  Oh, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.080]  Between their loved homes and the wars desolation
[37:14.800 --> 37:18.560]  Blessed with victory and peace may the heaven rescued land
[37:19.120 --> 37:23.600]  Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.920]  And I forgot that in the last 100 years
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.600]  They have taken that out of all the events and they don't read that final verse. Well, it's conspiratorial and wicked
[37:35.120 --> 37:37.120]  Absolutely absolutely
[37:37.440 --> 37:43.600]  May I continue sure then conquer we must when our cause it is just of course right now it isn't
[37:44.320 --> 37:47.840]  And this be our motto and God is our trust
[37:47.840 --> 37:53.200]  And the star spangled banner and triumph shall wave
[37:54.160 --> 37:59.920]  Or the land of the free and the home of the brave so they took out the next the last line
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.160]  Well, I'm not sure what they took out, but that's the last one. Well, you never hear them sing that. Oh, no
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.880]  That's amazing instead of me interrupting read through that all again. Okay
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.880]  Oh
[38:17.680 --> 38:25.520]  Thus be it ever when freemen shall stand between their loved home and the wars desolation
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.640]  Blessed with victory and peace may the heaven rescued land
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.760]  Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation
[38:35.760 --> 38:42.960]  Then conquer we must when our cause it is just and this be our motto
[38:43.520 --> 38:45.520]  In God is our trust
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.160]  And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.720]  Or the land of the free and the home of the brave amazing call and now the globalist
[38:57.280 --> 39:04.320]  The the the the oligarchy the aristocracy has come in and taken over our government and uses as an engine of evil
[39:04.320 --> 39:07.520]  They're afraid that people may wake up and try to take this country back
[39:07.680 --> 39:13.760]  So they're putting in a police state to block it and we're in very serious waters. Okay
[39:14.320 --> 39:17.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call
[39:18.320 --> 39:20.480]  Go ahead and air tyler for me, please
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.200]  Tyler from canada. You are on the air welcome
[39:25.840 --> 39:29.360]  Hey, Alex. Uh, you really woke me up to a lot of things. Uh, thanks for your show
[39:29.360 --> 39:36.480]  Um, just like to say to our solutions. Yeah, I mean I got all my money in silver and gold and I'm encouraging others to do the same
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.000]  I'm growing my own food and I went to an organic festival yesterday
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.080]  And we're listening to this guy uh, percy smizer talk about how monsanto seeds blew into his organic farm and contaminated them
[39:46.400 --> 39:48.400]  You might have heard about it. Um
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.280]  But basically he was he knew was about control over, you know life in general
[39:53.280 --> 39:56.240]  But everyone else all the other speakers you just talk about, you know
[39:56.240 --> 40:02.320]  Just write write your representative get them to pass the law that says, you know labeling his mandatory or something like that
[40:02.560 --> 40:08.720]  Well for those that don't know about percy smizer, I've interviewed him several times in his case has been through court and it's been proven
[40:09.200 --> 40:13.280]  Monsanto, he had the bill of sale. He never bought their seeds for canola
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.160]  Up in canada and the same things happened in the dakotas in texas and everywhere else. I've interviewed a lot of farmers
[40:18.720 --> 40:21.200]  And then they fly over your land with aircraft
[40:21.200 --> 40:27.840]  And drop roundup bombs that then kill large areas of your plants violating your property rights
[40:28.080 --> 40:31.840]  And have even one or two don't die. They know those plants have
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.160]  Their terminator seed genetics and then they sue you
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.960]  Claiming that you have infringed on their patent when in court they admit it is their seeds
[40:43.680 --> 40:47.920]  That have blown and been carried by birds into your fields
[40:47.920 --> 40:54.560]  Yeah, and well anywhere after he was done doing his speech, you know some other guy came up and he was talking about how
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.480]  A meat eater riding a bike as a bigger carbon footprint than a vegetarian driving a car
[41:00.960 --> 41:02.960]  And you know, everyone's like, yeah, you know
[41:03.360 --> 41:09.120]  And even after you talked about control control control, they still don't see like all all of them exhale carbon dioxide
[41:09.200 --> 41:15.680]  And they just don't get that's what plants breathe and we have the club of rome and cfr and un documents where they say
[41:15.680 --> 41:21.200]  It's about a tax on human activity a way to socialize all of our wealth
[41:21.520 --> 41:23.760]  Absolutely, in fact, I have a story here out of the mail online
[41:24.240 --> 41:30.880]  The floating cities that could one day house climate change refugees and they have pictures of the devastated seashore and
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.920]  Everybody basically, you know, we're going into this huge emergency when carbon dioxide has been 14 times higher than it is now
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  And is a life-giving gas
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.360]  Yeah, and then just another thing i'm in vik 9 11 truth and we go out we just got back from the swapping shop
[41:45.360 --> 41:48.320]  It's just like this big a garage sale at the western speedway
[41:48.560 --> 41:53.280]  And like at least 50 percent of the people that walk by like already know 9 11 was an inside job
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.240]  But so we don't I think a lot of canadiens know but they just
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.320]  They're like it's like the brave new world already. They're just like yeah governments corrupt everyone's corrupt. Absolutely
[42:02.560 --> 42:05.840]  But let me guess you guys were there as 9 11 truth educating people
[42:05.840 --> 42:11.760]  Yeah, obviously. Yeah. Good job my friend. Yeah for those that for americans that are hiding under a rock and don't know
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.960]  There are hundreds of polls zogby mason dixon angerson reid new york times
[42:17.520 --> 42:18.880]  uh
[42:18.880 --> 42:26.880]  There are hundreds the average poll is around 55 percent because you can look at all the different ones believe 9 11's a total inside job
[42:27.600 --> 42:28.560]  um
[42:28.560 --> 42:31.840]  84 percent in angerson reid for the wall street journal
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.400]  Believe the government's covering up something so that shows the power of the people
[42:36.720 --> 42:40.880]  I was really the first guy the lone guy on the day 9 11 saying it was an inside job
[42:41.200 --> 42:43.600]  Because I'd seen the documents and knew they were planning something

[46:51.760 --> 47:01.760]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.200]  I've got a caller here, Harley from New Braunville, Texas
[47:17.360 --> 47:20.480]  He says, you're wrong about the peso
[47:20.480 --> 47:28.960]  Now they just told me about this caller about 60 seconds ago and I went on Google and went to X-Rates
[47:29.120 --> 47:34.080]  And I ran out of time before I got on air to try to check what it is today because it changed your day to day
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.240]  But I know I was reading the Associated Press about two weeks ago
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.200]  And it showed the peso at 5.3 for the dollar, so I went on air and said 5-1
[47:45.200 --> 47:53.520]  And while he's talking, I'm going to try to search around and because it doesn't just let you, it'll show you the peso
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.680]  But then the dollar's on another page, I've got to put the two in here and compute it
[47:57.840 --> 48:01.360]  But I'm wondering where he's getting his facts
[48:01.520 --> 48:10.320]  Look, there's no debate, the dollar has the euro opened at 84 cents to the dollar in 2000
[48:10.320 --> 48:19.040]  When the dollar was worth a dollar versus the euro, it had already dropped since 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over
[48:19.200 --> 48:21.680]  But it was a decade to decade thing, a slow slide
[48:21.840 --> 48:27.200]  But the dollar, at the current value it had, was a dollar to the euro at 84
[48:27.360 --> 48:34.800]  And then now the euro is $1.47 to each dollar
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.720]  So the swing is 60 plus percent, it's even bigger against the British pound sterling
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.560]  So I'm telling you what OPEC's saying, what's all over the foreign news is the dollar has been devalued
[48:46.720 --> 48:52.880]  And I have these debates with people, I have a lot of people who just tell me that it's not true, the dollar has not been devalued
[48:53.040 --> 48:58.320]  As if just saying it hasn't been devalued magically makes that be the case
[48:58.320 --> 49:17.680]  You see, I want to enlighten the public about this, but my megaphone I guess isn't big enough so that we can put political pressure on Mr. Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, to reverse the really 80 plus year policy of a week dollar
[49:17.680 --> 49:29.280]  Now they can say, well, we had Bretton Woods a half century ago and we've had other agreements that the dollar would be the world reserve currency, yes
[49:29.440 --> 49:33.440]  So it's a strong dollar globally, but overall the dollar has been losing its value
[49:33.600 --> 49:38.320]  I mean, it's hard to explain this, I guess, it's so simple, sometimes simple things are hard to explain
[49:38.480 --> 49:45.040]  You can pull the numbers up, but what, a three bedroom house in the 60s was like $3,000, $4,000
[49:45.040 --> 49:52.480]  A new car was a couple thousand dollars, now how much are things? I mean, there's massive inflation
[49:52.640 --> 50:00.880]  The Fed says inflation is at about 7% right now, they were saying last year when every other private group was saying about 12, 13%, they were saying 2.5
[50:01.040 --> 50:10.480]  I mean, the government puts out all these different fake numbers so you can debate things all day long, the dollar is devaluing, are you paying more for things?
[50:10.480 --> 50:23.280]  And by the way, it's devalued more overseas, okay, because that always happens, when a currency is devalued, the last place the full devaluation takes place is inside the country
[50:23.440 --> 50:29.840]  And that's the big secret they want to keep from you until it's too late, now why would the government want to do that?
[50:30.000 --> 50:39.200]  They've run up so many tens of trillions in debts, they've bought through other corporations and through all these scams, real assets, now they're going to leave us holding the bag
[50:39.200 --> 50:47.600]  Let's go ahead and go to Harley in New Braunville, Texas, who says I'm wrong, go ahead Harley
[50:47.760 --> 51:00.000]  Yeah, Alex, listen, I'm certainly not going to defend the dollar, everything you just said was true, but you had a caller last week say that he was down in Mexico and he got five pesos to the dollar
[51:00.160 --> 51:01.840]  And then I just heard you repeat it
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.920]  No, that's not where that came from
[51:03.920 --> 51:12.080]  I was saying five to one, I was in the news, 5.3, and then the caller called in and agreed, so I didn't get that from a caller
[51:12.240 --> 51:19.360]  Well, you might not have gotten it from a caller, but I heard it over the air by a caller last week, and he's full of it
[51:19.520 --> 51:25.520]  I'm looking right now at xrates.com, the peso is sitting at 10.36
[51:25.680 --> 51:32.560]  Now, everything you said about the dollar is true, but when you said it's been devalued to the peso five to one
[51:32.560 --> 51:37.440]  Brother, that's way wrong, and I got friends in Mexico, I used to live in Monterey
[51:37.600 --> 51:44.800]  Like I said, I went to shock when I heard that, and I checked it out, and it was not true, and it's not true now
[51:44.960 --> 51:53.120]  And just for your information, I showed the euro sitting at 1.57 today, so it's even worse than what you just said
[51:53.280 --> 51:54.960]  So, the fiat currency
[51:54.960 --> 52:02.960]  Stop right there, stop right there, I keep all the news I get in big giant stacks, and I'm telling you about two weeks ago
[52:03.360 --> 52:07.360]  I believe it was associated press, now it may have been some currency spike
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.120]  I mean, I know all the currency markets are going crazy up and down, and so
[52:13.920 --> 52:18.080]  Certainly now that may be the case, I mean talking to you and sitting here
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.120]  It's hard to talk and chew gum at the same time, as they say I'm on the same site
[52:23.120 --> 52:25.120]  You're able to sit there and do the calculation
[52:25.520 --> 52:29.520]  My whole point is, is that me saying that and the caller calling in and agreeing
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.480]  You know, whether it's 10 to 1 or whatever, if you know the history of this, because I was asking family about it last night
[52:34.720 --> 52:39.120]  Has it the peso been, at certain times when they've had crashes, like 100 to 1?
[52:39.520 --> 52:45.840]  Well, yeah, I've been down to Mexico when you could get 350 to 1, and then it changed overnight
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  I mean, that's the Mexican peso problem
[52:48.000 --> 52:53.920]  And was it 12 and a half to 1, what it was in the 60s and 70s for a long time? It was it was at 12 and a half to 1?
[52:54.080 --> 53:00.080]  When they had the olympics in the 60s, it was 8 to 1, and it spiked up to 300 and something at one point
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.760]  Well, just my uncle did a lot of work down there, he was saying it was 12 to 1 for more than a decade
[53:03.920 --> 53:09.920]  But that's Mexico's pesos problem, I mean none of us are putting our money in pesos, I guarantee you
[53:11.040 --> 53:14.960]  But look, look, we're sitting here debating apples and oranges, I know I saw that
[53:14.960 --> 53:20.960]  Currently, does it go up and down? Yes, the bottom line is, as you said, it's been, I haven't seen that
[53:21.680 --> 53:27.040]  The most I found online in a history was 100 to 1, but you're saying 300 and something to 1
[53:27.280 --> 53:32.720]  My whole point is, the pesos, 10 to 1, 5 to 1, whatever it is right now, because it goes up and down each day
[53:33.040 --> 53:38.320]  My point is, see, I just gave you a conservative number from the last time I checked last week
[53:38.320 --> 53:45.680]  At, you know, 147 euro to the dollar, and you're saying you just looked and it's worse
[53:45.920 --> 53:51.520]  My point is, we can, it's like we ran up to a burning house and there's flame shooting out the window
[53:51.760 --> 53:55.760]  And we're arguing whether every room's on fire, only 80% of them
[53:55.920 --> 53:56.880]  Hell, man, I don't know
[53:57.120 --> 54:03.600]  Alex, I, like I said, I'm with you 90%, when you said 5 to 1, it scared the heck out of me, I checked it out
[54:03.600 --> 54:08.240]  Okay, I'm not saying it, I can't say it never went there, I don't know
[54:08.240 --> 54:13.360]  Look, I'm just saying, I read, it's either AP or Bloomberg, I mean, I can't remember every story I covered two weeks ago
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.600]  I remember people freaking out, I remember actually Trey, my producer, he runs in with stacks of interesting stuff
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.080]  Because I had Bob Chapman on about the dollar, and I saw that, now whether that was a one day spike
[54:26.240 --> 54:29.440]  Look, regardless, it used to be 101, now it's 10 to 1
[54:29.440 --> 54:36.720]  Yeah, and that's what I had seen a few weeks ago was 10 to 1, that's why I freaked out when I saw 5 to 5.3 to 1
[54:36.720 --> 54:38.000]  Okay, anything else?
[54:38.000 --> 54:44.320]  I just want to tell you, keep it up, I really appreciate what you're doing, so much so I'm close enough to try to go to work for you at some point
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  What I'm telling you is, when you said that
[54:47.200 --> 54:53.200]  Sure, sure, I understand, look, listen, I, the problem is, during the next break, I'm gonna try to search around and find out what it is today
[54:53.600 --> 54:59.200]  Okay, uh, it doesn't matter, 10 to 1, 5 to 1, the point is, as you said, the peso used to be 100 to 1
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.600]  You're saying 300 something to 1, I never saw that
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.960]  I mean, I know, uh, Salinas, their president had to run and leave when he basically looted the economy
[55:07.760 --> 55:09.760]  That's happening now to us
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.880]  And I didn't know that, my god, has the euro gone over 150 to the dollar?
[55:15.360 --> 55:18.320]  I mean, you know, that's, I mean, this stuff, it's impossible to keep track of all this
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.960]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call. I mean, it's kind of like arguing about, did you cut off
[55:23.600 --> 55:25.600]  Five fingers or one? I mean, I
[55:25.600 --> 55:28.560]  And the point is we're in a lot of trouble here, ladies and gentlemen
[55:29.120 --> 55:32.720]  It's like if somebody knocks five of your teeth out and you say, oh, he knocked all my teeth out
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.360]  You know, but you got a lot of teeth knocked out here
[55:35.920 --> 55:40.480]  Okay, let's go ahead and uh talk to matt in austin. You're on the air. Go ahead matt
[55:41.120 --> 55:43.920]  Hey, alex. It's uh, nice to talk to you. Nice talk to you
[55:44.560 --> 55:47.680]  My question or what I was hoping you could do is outline
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.960]  The top three reasons in your opinion
[55:51.520 --> 55:53.520]  Because I don't necessarily understand why
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.520]  I ran is now al qaeda and we need to invade
[55:58.960 --> 56:04.240]  Well, number one, we all know iran is a islamic republic under the shiaite
[56:04.880 --> 56:09.120]  brand there's two big arms of islam and the uh, the
[56:09.520 --> 56:15.120]  Largest one is the wahhabiist out of saudi arabia. I believe uh, and then the the subgroup
[56:15.520 --> 56:21.360]  But the second largest is the shia and iran is a shiaite republic
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.600]  Uh, and run by the imams and i'm not defending it. It's very corrupt
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.720]  They're by the way in all the polls their population completely hates them and has been pro america until we attack them
[56:30.720 --> 56:32.000]  Then they're gonna hate us
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.360]  Uh, then you've got uh, what's going on?
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.240]  Uh, with the united states as cyhurst reported new yorker magazine five years ago as bushes admitted now
[56:42.640 --> 56:48.800]  They're running four different wahhabiist al qaeda groups out of saudi arabia real al qaeda number three in al qaeda is the
[56:48.800 --> 56:51.360]  You know mainstream news headline just google that
[56:52.080 --> 56:59.200]  attacking iran blowing up mosque attacking schools police stations and iran is suing the us and the us admits
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.000]  That is people running our government admit the criminals
[57:02.560 --> 57:09.360]  Uh demonizing our name admit. Yes. We're running al qaeda attacks against iran and then they have such disrespect
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.560]  For the general public that they then turn around and tell us on the news that iran runs al qaeda
[57:14.720 --> 57:16.720]  You want to hold over and ask the other part?
[57:16.720 --> 57:18.720]  Here. All right. I'll put you on hold
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.120]  I mean the lies
[57:21.120 --> 57:23.120]  are so incredible
[57:23.680 --> 57:26.320]  That it's even hard for me to get my mind around
[57:27.200 --> 57:31.920]  iran fights al qaeda. It's like mohammed karzai the installed puppet in afghanistan
[57:32.400 --> 57:34.400]  Was over in the us a few months ago
[57:34.560 --> 57:40.160]  And the president bush said iran's with al qaeda and he said no they're not because he lives there. He knows it's not true

[1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:36.160]  On the iran front
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:40.640]  Just have the french news agency iran warns of gulf blitzkrieg
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:48.400]  And a closure of the straits of ormuse of attack iran's military chiefs warned saturday the islamic republic would shut down
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:56.160]  Straight of ormuse vinyl for oil exports and use blitzkrieg tactics or lightning war tactics in the gulf if it came under attack
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:01.760]  And they have medium range missiles more than 11 000 of them that can just
[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:08.640]  Destroy the three different fleets carrier task force groups they have there in the persian gulf
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:14.400]  But i guess that's the plan if there's an attack and then the us will see our ships sinking the people will say nukem
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:18.560]  And then it's off to the races. It's off to eight dollar a gallon gas even if you don't care about
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:23.600]  Attacking a country that's done nothing to us and been overthrown twice by our government
[1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:28.800]  Um just absolutely amazing that that is going on and ron paul is in congress
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:34.000]  I interviewed him thursday congressman ron paul. He said he hears a lot of members in the halls talking about
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:37.120]  If we could only nuke iran i'm gonna get into that
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:39.040]  also
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:41.040]  I'm not sure he's calling about this
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:47.200]  It just says uh on my screen here that he he mentioned as a heating and ac guy something about registering with the feds
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:50.480]  Uh, but i do have a report here out of
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:53.600]  A computer magazine
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:57.360]  And then it even has links to the state of texas
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:02.000]  This uh website with the bill i couldn't believe this when i read it even though it was in a reputable
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:04.400]  source
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:06.000]  computer magazine
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.440]  and
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.440]  I read the bill and couldn't believe it
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:15.200]  Anyone repairing computers in texas will have to get a three-year law enforcement degree
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:21.360]  And violate your fourth and fifth amendment and spy on the entire contents of your computer without being paid
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:27.280]  The government's telling computer repair shops that it's also indentured servitude violates another area of the bill
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:29.280]  of rights and constitution
[1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:32.720]  Where you're where they're not allowed to tell you to do work without paying you
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:37.280]  And saying you're going to spy on everyone. So i want to go over that report
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:44.960]  Going back to matt in austin. Uh, he had a question about why is the news saying iran is al qaeda
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:47.280]  And running al qaeda attacks in iraq
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:52.880]  When iran is run by shiites. Um, did i answer your question matt?
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:59.440]  Actually, i was i was more wondering what's the going to be the ultimate benefit to us is it greater
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:05.840]  Um, control of the region. Is it control of oil production? Is it to make israel happy?
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:11.040]  What what exactly is the outcome that we expect to get out of this? Well, it's a cocktail of reasons
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:13.600]  They do cost benefit analysis
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:19.360]  Why did they go in against iraq? Well before we were even attacked on 9 11, which they falsely blamed on iraq and
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:24.720]  The president vice president now admit that's a lie and we have white house and the downing shirt memos where they admitted
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:27.120]  In memos in the minutes that they were lying
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  uh secretary of treasury
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:32.080]  uh
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.480]  O'neill the first day was at the white house. This is in january of 2000
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:38.960]  Uh and one
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.320]  Shows up and they have the energy task force. He wrote about this with maps and they were saying how are we going to get it?
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:46.240]  And shaney says you'll see
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:49.920]  And it was all about shutting down oil exploration
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:59.120]  That then jacks up prices remember that iraq had quote been over pumping in 1990 and opec was mad because we were paying
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:03.280]  I don't know 89 95 cents during that period you can go look it up
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:08.400]  And that was making opec and the oil companies mad because we weren't getting charged enough
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:12.480]  so by shutting down iraqi flow during that war
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:20.080]  And then having saddam signed deals under sanctions where he could only sell a reduced amount that jacked up prices then you understand
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:22.080]  It's artificial scarcity
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:28.800]  I mean, let's talk about watermelons. It's watermelon season driving in from seeing family across texas. I saw trucks everywhere full of watermelons
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:33.200]  Uh, let's say i'm a big watermelon magnum who wants to sell them to all the grocery stores
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:39.760]  Well, you see I don't want more watermelons getting grown if I could get a law passed where only I could grow watermelons
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:46.080]  I would you know do that if I was a bad guy so that people pay $50 for a watermelon instead of $2
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:50.320]  Okay, so it's artificial scarcity kind of like diamonds are semi precious
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:56.720]  But the oppen hire family and the company to beers has a world monopoly and that's public knowledge pbs did diamond empire
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:00.400]  Documentary on and I actually interviewed the British lady
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:03.360]  Uh, she's a royal who who made the film
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:09.840]  About that and they got very mad about that and visited her at her yacht and they're in London and beat her half to death
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.840]  And told her never make another film about it
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:12.960]  It's just amazing stuff
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:16.400]  But the point is it is artificial scarcity
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.720]  So that was one reason to shut the oil off
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:23.920]  Then it's hundreds of billions a year in no bid contracts going into a black hole
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:27.440]  $15 million for a blue tarp haliburton puts up. That's a real case
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:31.040]  Uh, it's about a domestic police state when we're in a war
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:34.800]  They can tell the people shut up when you're in a war you shut up and don't ask questions
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:39.040]  Which is the opposite of liberty and freedom and what a true patriot is supposed to do
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.440]  And yes, israel has said they want these wars. They want these countries taken down
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:49.280]  They want client countries that will give them oil. The the us has now built a pipeline out of uh
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:52.880]  Out of iraq into jordan and then down into israel
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:59.600]  Uh, that's going on. So there's a whole cocktail of reasons, but they want to go into iran
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:03.360]  Uh, really is a political diversion for the plunging dollar
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:06.960]  Uh, because they had people that were
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.960]  You know, basically more pro uh more pro us than akmed denigy before they were moderates and the and the us didn't want to work with them
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:19.200]  But it's this psychology and i do it too of saying we why are we doing it?
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:26.240]  What do we get out of attacking iran the american people's interest aren't those interests of quote the national security interest
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:30.960]  Because the our government is owned and controlled and dominated and steered by foreign
[1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:33.840]  institutions that have other interests
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:40.240]  Absolutely great. Alex. Hey listen, uh, I love your show. I listen all the time. Good luck to you. Thank you my friend
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:40.960]  I appreciate your call
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:45.120]  Okay, I want to go ahead and start going to this caller now and see what he's talking about specifically and then
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:49.520]  I'm going to get into this report about how basically every service company in the us
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:55.680]  On a state-by-state and federal basis is being co-opted into spying on you when they're in your home
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:58.160]  So, uh, let's go ahead and
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:02.880]  Go to joe in austin who wanted to talk about that joe. Go ahead
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.320]  Hey, Alex. How's it going brother? Good. I only got a little bit that it was something about that. Is that what you're calling in about?
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:14.640]  Oh, yeah, yes. Yes. I'm the ec tech. Uh, I just got it with this last week. So this is kind of new to me
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:16.080]  uh
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:21.440]  I'm just wondering what your take is on this is that uh, we have to register with the state now and
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:26.240]  You do a yearly fee like 20 25 bucks. I don't know what the cost is yet
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:29.840]  I mean that they haven't told me yet. They think it's like 20 to 25 bucks
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:37.840]  So is this a money graph or is this a double-edged sword where it's going to be that's the start of regulation the start of control
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:41.520]  The bigger air air conditioning construction companies and others
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:47.760]  Want to come in and start kind of like it is in england and in europe where you have to have a whole bunch of licenses to do
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:54.400]  Work so that uh, they can cut out their competition. No, what you're talking about is not the other issue
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:56.960]  Uh, that i'm about to get into
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:02.400]  Okay, well, I appreciate that you bet my friend. Thank you. Yeah. Now. Listen. This is in um
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:06.400]  Several different publications computer mag
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:14.240]  Uh extreme tech others have reported on this and there's a story out of gear log on this as well
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:19.440]  But you can link through uh at info wars.com. We posted this friday
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.400]  Texas pc repair shop now requires
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:26.240]  PI license and when I read this I did not believe it
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:31.760]  But just google that texas pc repair now requires private investigator license
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:36.480]  Google that and then this is a great article because when you read it
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.800]  It's got links to the texas legislature
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:45.440]  In fact, the second paragraph the word texas is a hyperlink and you go right to the legislature's website
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:50.000]  And I couldn't believe it. I mean, there's a lot of things you that even shock me folks
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.320]  And it says uh from its texas rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:00.640]  Lone star state has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:02.880]  What is whatever that means?
[1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:07.520]  Uh, what the illegal aliens are above the law. What are you talking about? Uh, thanks to a strange new law
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:13.680]  Uh, it's a sting that may soon be felt by a number of texas computer repair people
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.640]  I recently passed law requires that texas computer repair technicians have a private investigator license according to a story posted

[1:19:49.120 --> 1:20:05.040]  Thank you for listening to gcn. Be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:22.160]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. We're going to be going to gary sam hidey edd charles
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:24.800]  Many many others
[1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:28.480]  Already got a caller here. Mike and hueson saying you're wrong about pc tech
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:31.520]  Look, I went and read the bill
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:38.000]  And it's in what five different publications that I've seen I I couldn't believe it either
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:41.840]  The way this is written if they interpret it to enforce it
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:45.200]  This won't be if you want to be a tattletale spy
[1:20:45.760 --> 1:20:50.000]  You can be this will be you have to basically do it
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:54.240]  And everybody's heard the stories about 60 minutes shows about it
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:57.840]  Where the people at the you know airport
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:04.720]  You know ticket takers who who enter your information check your driver's license the famous 60 minutes piece where this guy would
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:10.640]  Fly down from north carolina to houston to buy tens of thousands of dollars of trees to be shipped back each year
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:13.600]  And he walked up and paid with cash. This is like a decade ago
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:19.600]  And they seized this cash under asset forfeiture seizure people can't believe this when they hear it till you look it up
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:25.280]  And they said yeah, we're not going to indict you. We're not going to arrest you. We're just taking your money. No judge. No jury
[1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:31.040]  Uh and everybody now has heard about asset forfeiture seizure where they pull you over and you got $4,000 in your wallet
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:33.280]  Or in your purse and they just take it
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:36.000]  Uh saying well, it's up to you to prove it wasn't for drugs
[1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:41.440]  And this happened to me folks. Um, I guess it was about nine years ago
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:46.640]  I had a shotgun before I had children in a rack and my radio studio was in my house
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:49.440]  Not at my office or here in these radio studios
[1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:54.320]  And the guy walks in and he's saying he's saying is that gun legal? I said well, of course it's legal
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:57.600]  There happened to be myself on the front page of the metro in state
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:01.920]  Had a second amendment rally and I said see we have rallies about the second amendment. It's no big deal
[1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:07.680]  And then he left and then I had a bad feeling so I called the carpet cleaning place and they said no mr. Jones
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.520]  Yes, we understand. Yes, he did. There was some discussion of calling the police
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:16.320]  We understand that guns are legal. Uh, but see these people watch tv shows
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.000]  And they're most of them are set in new york or chicago or where they have highly restrictive gun laws
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:28.320]  And they see the cops pull somebody over in a drama or they watch real cop shows based in la in places and hope
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.840]  He's got a gun. He's going to jail or we found guns in his house
[1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:33.680]  He's going to jail
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:36.720]  And so they then move here to austin or they watch tv
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.120]  And the public's pretty dumbed down and they think a gun in your house is illegal
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:42.720]  um
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:44.720]  I mean here's an example the austin pd
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:50.560]  Looks at your occupancy how many people live in your house and how much power you're using
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:55.520]  And if it looks like you're using too much power that then is quote probable cause
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:02.880]  They believe of course it isn't to swat team your house and see if you are growing marijuana because the lights pull a bunch of power
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:05.280]  They also fly around with these helicopters
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:10.320]  That see you know heat residents and oh it looks like you've got grow lights in your house
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:15.360]  Uh, so the point here is well, here's an example. I lived in an apartment complex
[1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:20.560]  This is before I was on the air about 14 years ago and my buddy was going to ut his girlfriend was going to ut
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:22.560]  They lived together about two doors down
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:28.640]  straight lace folks didn't even you know spoke pot and uh didn't even drink and I remember
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:34.480]  That they got a swat team visit now. They actually knocked on the door. They opened it and came in
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:40.160]  And because they had had some repair guy there and he had seen she was taking botany at ut
[1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:42.800]  The grow light little grow light and some orchids
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:46.080]  And then they saw that it wasn't drugs and left the point is
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:52.000]  People need to know that repair people in your home are spying on you
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:55.200]  You need to know that
[1:23:55.200 --> 1:23:59.760]  I was uh visiting family and they had a may issue of national geographic in it
[1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:04.000]  And it had a picture. It was a whole issue on china
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:08.480]  And it was a fascinating issue. I read the whole thing
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:14.880]  I think friday night and in it it had a photo of what looked like about a eight-year-old boy
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:18.720]  Who was swimming
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:24.080]  In a river and he came out and he was naked
[1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:28.400]  now if you take a photo of your
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:32.320]  Two-year-old in a bathtub
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.520]  And you take it to one of the major stores to get it developed a drug store one of the big super stores
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:41.440]  You're probably going to have the police come and arrest you or swat team
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:48.240]  But see national geographic can put that in there. So see you're saying I have nothing to hide having my computer being looked through
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:52.160]  Oh, yeah, there's a baby picture with a picture with a with your baby's hind in it
[1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:55.760]  And see the government the system wants to enforce on the public
[1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:59.440]  Here's another example a woman in chicago pulls up
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:08.160]  She's got her 14 and 10 year old daughters in the car. It's nine feet away. The salvation army can the donation can
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:13.680]  She puts 875 in it is out of the car 30 seconds locks the car has the keys. It's running
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:18.400]  It's freezing cold throws the money in the police arrest her on the spot taker to jail taker kids
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:23.040]  That was in the news or there's a guy in detroit. No criminal record top archaeologist
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:29.360]  I think his son was eight years old. They ordered lemonade. They bring them hard lemonade looks like lemonade
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:32.480]  Hard lemonade his son takes one drink
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.000]  Arrested cps takes his kid because they brought the wrong lemonade. He didn't look so my point is
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:44.800]  The government's growing the police state system's growing it is looking for people to grab
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.000]  You say nothing to hide let the repairman spy on me. You have privacy
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.280]  See the privacy is on your side to protect against tyranny
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:59.840]  And so you read a bill like this texas pc repair now requires p. I license
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:04.880]  From its texas rangers to its enthusiastic take on the death penalty
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:10.640]  The lone star state has long been known for its aggressive stance on law enforcement. Thanks to a strange new law
[1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:17.520]  It is a sting that may soon be felt by a number of state computer repair people
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:22.960]  A recently passed law requires texas computer repair technicians and I read the law. That's what it says
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:28.320]  Have a private investigators license according to a story posted by the dallas fort war cw affiliate
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:35.040]  Then he goes on in order to obtain a license technicians must receive a criminal justice degree or participate in a three-year apprenticeship
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:38.160]  Those shops that refuse to participate will be forced to be shut down
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:44.640]  Violators of the law can be hit with a four thousand dollar fine and up to a year in jail penalties that apply to customers
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:50.560]  Uh who seek out their services some of the areas larger companies already employ technicians with p. I licenses
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:53.680]  A fact which generally doesn't apply to small computer repair shops
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:56.320]  now
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:02.400]  All I know is I have the austin newscast and and and it's in my film road to tyranny ads
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:07.440]  They run on tv where the kids get 200 dollar credit cards and they have them report on their parents and ask them
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:09.440]  What's in the medicine cabinet? I mean so
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:13.280]  The extent of this is growing and getting worse
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:18.000]  And they recruited half a million truck drivers to spy on everybody in anti-terror training
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.960]  But then it's anti-terror and crime they've hired 26,000 preachers to spy on people and give sermons that say submit to the government
[1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:31.440]  They've got the infraguard 23,000 executives spying on people and been given shoot to kill orders of their order to be
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:37.120]  Deputized secret police all of this is going on now. Will this be enforced?
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:41.360]  Uh, can we debate the interpretation of this law? Yes
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:48.640]  But that is how it reads. Uh, Mike in houston says that I'm wrong and we'll find out why I'm wrong
[1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:53.120]  I certainly hope I am Mike. Uh, how are we wrong here reporting on this?
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:54.800]  Oh, hey, I wasn't going alex
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.680]  You know, I read all the articles and stuff and I got very concerned because i'm a pc tech here in houston, texas, okay
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:02.240]  Uh, so I sent this over to my attorney
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:04.880]  I sent the actual house bill over to my attorney and he read through it
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:11.920]  He said there's only two sections that pertain to people that deal with computers as far as the pi license holders law
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:18.880]  And one of those, you know, for data security specialists, uh, that are, you know, working on the larger enterprise networks
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:25.600]  The other one, uh, it has to do with if you're actually collecting information for a civil or criminal trial
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:28.720]  All right, stay there. I want to hear about this on the other side. Hold on
[1:28:29.040 --> 1:28:31.040]  I want to specifically hear about this when we get back
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:34.480]  We'll be right back with his call and then i'm going to really try to hurry through your calls
[1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.880]  Mike, uh, gary, sam

[1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:30.000]  I can't read them. Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve? No way
[1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:34.320]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in the credit cards and passports Clyde
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:39.360]  We should get some of those secure sleeves. I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports

[1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:09.040]  Well, the floods in the heartland of america have all but assured this will happen

[1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:45.840]  He's saying it's a limited groups of computer repair people and yes, I I see that language
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:50.400]  And that's how they're interpreting it, but if you read the full language
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:52.960]  This is
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:54.560]  basically them now
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:59.680]  Recruiting large numbers of computer snoops and in trying to force large cadres
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:03.520]  Of pc repair people computer repair people
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:05.920]  Into this but you're saying you disagree
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:10.240]  But I don't know five different publications that are computer publications disagree with you
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:16.400]  I read the bill and I and I could certainly see the angle you're at but I know how government operates go ahead and finish up Mike
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:18.720]  Oh, yeah, hey Alex
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:19.680]  Well, hey again
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:22.320]  Yeah, I sent it over to my attorney man had him look it up and down
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:25.760]  You know because it really concerns me it affects my business, you know very heavily so
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:30.880]  I had him look at it and he's like no there's nothing there to compel me for what I do as far as repairing
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:33.360]  You know hardware and software to do anything like that
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:37.040]  Um, you know, so basically if I get put into into a role of
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.640]  Security, uh, you know as far as you know for non-public data that I would then have to be licensed or
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:46.320]  If I was to actually start doing like, you know review and analysis of you know
[1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:49.440]  Uh computer information for criminal or civil
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.840]  Uh court cases, but other than that, you know, it's it's not enough. Well, let me ask you this
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:57.520]  Uh, I mean that do you own your own company or do you work for a company?
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:34:59.040]  Both
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:04.240]  I do both I do on the side of my own company and I work for a business. Well, I mean
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.480]  How does it work because you see in the news all the time people take their computers in for repair and
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:11.920]  They get in trouble for gambling or they get in trouble for a picture of their
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:16.080]  Two-year-old walking around with their diapers half down. I mean, how does that work?
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:20.480]  Well, you know, you know part actually part of that law part of the law that we're actually discussing
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.960]  protects individuals a little bit more
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:28.720]  Uh, when they're bringing their computer to the repair shop because that repair technician if they go and snoop on your computer
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:31.280]  They're actually engaging in illegal
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:33.840]  Review and analysis of data
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:39.360]  So they would actually be charged with a criminal offense for not having a PI license when they're reviewing and analyzing data
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:46.480]  Um, and the fourth of them it should actually protect those people to bring their computer in because they're they're not asking to
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:55.280]  Relieve any privacy unless they start giving up passwords much, but you see the cases you see the cases uh, where they're going through everybody's computers
[1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:57.760]  I mean, that's all over the place
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:03.760]  You know, they they put out so much. You know, I mean exactly but but I mean you know that uh
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:10.480]  Law enforcement a longer peace officer, but law enforcement agencies recruit all sorts of service people to spy
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:14.960]  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I'm sure they do, you know, I've never been approached for but I'm sure that they do
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:18.880]  You know, especially at higher levels, you know, when you have big companies, you know, I'm sure that they do
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:20.720]  All right. Good to hear from you
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:25.440]  I'm going to get some expert guests on about that and and we're going to the bottom of this because I find it
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:30.160]  Bizarre that what five different publications would say one thing. I read it and uh,
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:34.000]  It looks like they could interpret it for that, but we're certainly going to find out
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:39.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to ed in new york. You're on the air ed welcome
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:42.720]  Hello, Alex. How are you sir? Good. Thanks for calling
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:47.920]  Uh, first of all, I just want to thank you for all your work. I want to thank you for personally, uh,
[1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:53.840]  Breaking me a breaking me away from this. Uh, this this huge matrix that that that we exist in
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:37:00.800]  Uh, truth-rising. I saw it yesterday incredible film. Everyone needs to see this film. Uh, I actually bought a couple of tears in my eyes
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:02.320]  um
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:03.920]  You touched on uh
[1:37:03.920 --> 1:37:10.240]  On this global warming scam earlier with a previous caller, um, Al Gore. What uh, as far as you know, you know
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:15.520]  You know with your research, what is what does he stand to gain? Why was he pushed to the forefront as his uh,
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:19.680]  You know the so-called uh high priest of uh, this uh
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:25.520]  This you know guy of worship, uh, well number one Al Gore owns a large oil company
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.800]  Uh, has the controlling stock in it given to him by his father albert gore senior the former senator
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:37.200]  Al Gore has also bought in to the carbon credits global exchange. It's a private group
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:40.480]  You will buy your carbon credits for being a human for breathing
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:44.880]  They are saying the gas you exhale that plants breathe is a toxic waste
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:50.160]  And and and as the club of rome documents written by richard and haas head of the cfr state
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:54.880]  That is then a way to regulate and control your life. Also. It takes over the larger
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:57.680]  environmental movement that means well
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.360]  I mean, I don't like the fact that uh, lawn fertilizer
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:05.360]  Uh, they are allowed under uh, law. They passed 10 years ago
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:07.840]  I didn't know about this. My dad told me about this weekend. I looked it up
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:11.520]  Uh to dump toxic waste basically into the fertilizer
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:14.880]  I mean just hundreds of horrible things and then that's put on your lawn
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:18.640]  Your pets absorb it you absorb it it runs off into aquifers
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:25.360]  I mean, there's there's thousands of serious environmental things that are happening or or coal fired plants burning dirty coal
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.320]  Fill with mercury that we then breathe that hurts us
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.200]  But see you're not going to hear about any of the real environmental things that are going on or cross species
[1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:35.440]  genetic engineering that causes major problems
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:41.280]  It's all no let's have a global tax and we'll buy credits from the private central banks
[1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:45.280]  Which now just doesn't let them control the fiat currency
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.960]  Which they can then debase and control us with what they're doing now now they
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:55.200]  trade in what humans breathe what all animals breathe and and and then they falsely list
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:58.400]  One of the four life-giving elements of the planet
[1:38:58.400 --> 1:39:05.120]  Uh and and by elements. I mean ingredients sunlight solar radiation. Okay, uh water
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:10.320]  oxygen and carbon dioxide those are the four ingredients
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:16.880]  And uh, I mean have you seen the tv programs where they walk up to citizens and give them the scientific name of water?
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:23.360]  Yeah, and then say should we ban this and all all of them almost all say and I've done this myself. Yes, ban it
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:27.200]  Because you're giving them the scientific name for water
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:33.920]  Right. Oh one last question just switching gears. Uh living in new york. I have a 10 year old daughter and this concerns me greatly
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:38.640]  Uh, new york's trying to pass. Uh, you know trying to make it law
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:42.720]  Uh to you know to make vaccines mandatory. Do you ever happen to have an update on that?
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:49.040]  Well, let's be clear now see listeners everywhere new listeners are whether listening in austin or kansas city right now or
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:55.280]  Places like kcaa and you know in san diego. They're saying well, I thought vaccines are the law
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:58.000]  I hear it on the news every year before school starts
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:03.520]  No, there is no law anywhere in the u.s. That anyone has to take inoculations
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:10.560]  Okay, but but but then if you don't have them they'll kick you out of school and then arrest you for truancy
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:13.360]  But that's a fraud because the school
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.520]  By law can't kick you out for that. So they're fraudulently kicking you out of school
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:26.800]  And then triggering criminal penalties penalties to go after you so you're right new jersey and new york are trying to pass laws
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:30.000]  To make over 50 plus vaccines
[1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:35.840]  The law and and they're just completely criminal. I mean the government can't make you put that in your body
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:40.400]  Then the cattle public says oh, but you'll make my child sick if you're not inoculated
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:44.800]  Hey, if you think that those inoculations are protecting you then your child's already had it
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:50.400]  So that's a pop out to claim that other people's kids have to have it again. It's it's a basic fraud
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:54.160]  But the public doesn't have any knowledge of science anymore
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.440]  And so it is very serious
[1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:03.840]  Absolutely. Thank you, sir. I just want to I just want to thank you again and keep up the good fight. Thank you very much
[1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:08.240]  Thank you and and folks don't believe me. There's no law you have to take vaccines check into it yourself
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:12.400]  Let's go ahead and take some more calls here
[1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:14.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:18.720]  Gary in New Orleans. You're on the air Gary
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:20.560]  Hey, Alex
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:23.600]  Yeah, I'm a prison planet subscriber and um
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:28.320]  Me and my girlfriend a couple of girlfriends of hers are watching it last night and towards the end
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:30.400]  They had sort of like tears in their eyes
[1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:35.120]  And then you grab your bullhorn and they all jumped up like you scored a touch it down and started screaming
[1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:39.680]  So I started playing guitar to be cool. So I might have to give me a bullhorn to be cool these days
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:41.600]  but
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  Anyway, that's a lot cooler than worried about your playing. So, you know, yeah
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:51.520]  Well, um, what I wanted to um, I had a couple of questions about blackwater coming into our city and also the price of the
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:52.800]  um
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:53.680]  gas in mexico
[1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:59.360]  But something else I really wanted to talk to you about is I was in Dealey plaza about six months ago when
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:01.760]  Nellie Carly had passed away
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.840]  And I was standing on a triple overpass and I was taking a picture of this
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:08.720]  on texas state flag at half mass
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:10.640]  and
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:14.000]  It was kind of dark and when I developed it, I don't know if you know this or not
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  But there's totally a pyramid
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:19.280]  Overlooking Dealey plaza. Oh, yeah, the whole thing's masonic
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:24.640]  Whole thing's masonic. Yeah. So you knew about that. Yes. Well, it's hard to bring up something you might know about
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:31.200]  Send me the photo. We'll post it anything else. Um, I wanted to find out. Um, could you explain or elaborate?
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:35.680]  In other words, no one knows that it was blackwater came into our city during, um
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:38.400]  You know Katrina. Did you witness that?
[1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:42.000]  Um, I didn't but many of my people did I was in the heart of
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.760]  I'll tell you what stay there. I want to hear more about it. Put you on hold. We'll come right back and talk about that
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:49.120]  It's already the final segment hard to believe we must ban

[1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:20.560]  I was telling the story about black water. Yeah, they sent the FBI in video this was on the news
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.360]  ABC news announced. Yes, they're confiscating all the guns even in the unflooded areas
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:29.360]  They went into multi-million dollar homes and took their guns. They never got them back
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:34.320]  And black water was there with the FBI leading police
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  in for the gun confiscation
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:43.760]  They would stack the aid up to that family that was there outside of the
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:46.480]  Superdome and wouldn't let it in
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:48.240]  and then
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:50.240]  FEMA just basically sat there
[1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:54.560]  And then they said oh look we screwed up now. We need even more funding and power and that was by design
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:57.600]  So pretty amazing, but yes black water
[1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:02.000]  Blackwater worldwide they've they're now not a u.s company. They left the u.s
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:06.000]  But still there would red white and blue we need mercenaries. That's what's good
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  That's what made america great
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:14.480]  Oh, yeah, I love it. Let's go ahead and go back to gary anything else you wanted to add on that gary
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:19.520]  Yeah, um, it seems like our city was surrounded by um do-gooders on churches
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:22.320]  Walmart seemed like they could handle the whole thing on their own
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.440]  They were blocked they and the government had to show us that they need more power by screwing it up by design
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:32.080]  FEMA cut the communication lines our sheriff harry lee had to post guards there
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:36.400]  So shoot anybody that comes in and cuts them again, but I'm telling you today. I look out my window
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:39.360]  I'm in leg view. There's military police going by all the time
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:40.080]  Of course
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:47.280]  It is a model city a training city to train the military and police to work together and to get rid of posse commentatus
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:53.200]  We have all the documents. It's in my police state films on dvd available at info wars.com. Listen
[1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:58.800]  For those that don't know truth rising sound you can watch it in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:02.640]  Or go to info wars.com and get the film on dvd the highest quality
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:06.240]  But this is a cinema verite, which in french means the cinema of truth
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:11.200]  Uh, there is no voice over no nothing people are saying. This is my best film. What do you think?
[1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:16.320]  I no doubt about it. I mean the girls who were sitting on the sofa were just um riveted
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:19.760]  They just couldn't believe what was going on. They didn't know anything about the people being sick
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:21.200]  um
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:25.440]  There and like I said when you grab the bullhorn they were jumping they jumped up and yeah
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:32.400]  Who's almost like, you know, the super world touchdown. Awesome. We'll see those those instincts to get excited are misappropriated and
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:38.160]  I'm not saying sports are bad. I'm saying people get so warlike over sports
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:43.680]  Excitement is meant about standing up against tyranny. That's what all those primitive feelings are all about
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:49.120]  But yes, truth rising is out and it covers the first responders how they covered up the dust
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:55.360]  It covers how the attacks were staged bombs in the buildings police and firemen emergency workers admitting it on tape
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  That that they knew the feds did it
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:04.880]  The activism then bad police walking up and saying you can't protest in new york. We're gonna claim you have bombs
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:09.680]  We know you don't we're gonna set you up on video. I mean, this is an incredible film
[1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:15.280]  Okay, I'm gonna move really fast now here. Let me see charles in north carolina. You're on the air charles
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:18.400]  Hey, how's it going? Alex good
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:24.080]  Yeah, I just want to say man truth rising is definitely the best film yet
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:31.120]  Maybe the best film ever done about the 9 11 movement. I mean, it's incredible. Well, it's about 9 11 truth
[1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:34.720]  It's about the first responders and the government knew the dust was gonna kill them
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:37.600]  Thousands have died 50 plus thousand are dying
[1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:40.400]  And and it you know, that's about a third of it
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:45.360]  The another third is the activism taking over media events the people standing up and fighting
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:48.880]  And the other third is the proof of how the globalist carried out the attacks
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:55.680]  Hey, can I say the last caller he might have been lying man? Because it wasn't just a girl's crime, man
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:02.320]  I had a little tear in my eye myself man. It was it was rough to see uh, well, listen, you're awesome
[1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:06.480]  I got to move fast. Thank you sir. No, and it's meant to be upsetting because it's the truth
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:11.200]  And uh, that's the great part about it. It's such high quality on prisonplanet.tv
[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:16.720]  We ran it into our big screen television. We have for editing, you know, it's like a 40 something inch plasma screen
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:19.680]  So we can really check the quality of the films when we shoot in high-def
[1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:23.840]  You can run the computer feed of the highest quality and it looks pretty good
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:26.080]  I mean even on a big screen tv blown up
[1:51:26.640 --> 1:51:31.360]  It doesn't look like you know as good as you know regular high-def tv, but it looks good now the dvd
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:34.240]  It looks awesome folks. These are shot on high quality cameras
[1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:38.000]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to sam in germany. I would have gone to him earlier
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  I forgot we had somebody holding from germany probably on his dime sam. You're on the air
[1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:49.280]  Hey, alex, how you doing sir? Uh, I was calling uh, I wanted to kind of gather or know what you'd gathered from uh
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:55.120]  Maybe bob Chapman or ray mcgovern on how the effect of a collapse of the dollar
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:52:00.480]  And uh a collapse of the u.s economy how that's going to affect some of the economic strongholds here in you know
[1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:05.440]  Western europe per se germany for example a global dollar meltdown is already
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:12.320]  Causing see people say well, is it speculation driving up oil and gold and every other commodity corn wheat
[1:52:12.720 --> 1:52:19.600]  Cocoa or is it you know, is it speculation of the dollar the dollar imploding is the world reserve currency?
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:21.600]  So everyone's dumping dollars
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.720]  Into commodities because they're not sure which other
[1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:30.400]  Uh, uh currency is going to end up being the new dominant currency. So that then exacerbates it
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:34.720]  It makes it even worse and so it looks like what you're seeing now
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.040]  The collapse of the dollar looks like what you're seeing now just two or three times worse
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:44.800]  Right right and and I mean, I mean it's already hurting european manufacturing
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:49.600]  It's already hurting tourism because people in the u.s. Can't you know, it's twice as much or more
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:57.040]  I mean europe's already reeling the globe is going into a deep recession and if it continues for more than three quarters unabated
[1:52:57.200 --> 1:52:59.200]  That is called a depression
[1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:01.520]  Oh, man, that's not gonna be good. Uh
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:05.600]  Yeah, it's okay. Well, thanks. I just wanted to say real quick to uh, give you a shout out
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:09.200]  I give a shout out from info creak dot tv here and uh, you know

[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:20.640]  So thanks and keep it up patriot. You bet. Yeah, there's it's not my website, but it's a good website info creak. I believe it's dot com
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:23.440]  It means info war dot com in deutsch
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:25.920]  Appreciate that. Yeah, but no, there's
[1:53:26.160 --> 1:53:29.440]  I've seen tens of thousands of views of my films just on german youtube
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:33.520]  Let's go ahead and uh talk to lindsey in
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:38.480]  Idaho you're on the air lindsey. Oh, I went to the wrong line. No, that's right lindsey go ahead
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.480]  Hello, hi
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:44.320]  Yeah, I just wanted to say number one your new movie is off exceptional
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:49.760]  Do me a favor turn that radio off got it all all because I want to give you full, you know full, you know
[1:53:50.320 --> 1:53:55.280]  All the coverage here go ahead. It's off. Okay. Anyway truth rising exceptional movie
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:02.960]  Secondly, uh, you had one article about a thing that happened about an hour from where I live the rainbow festival
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:08.960]  Yes, you've got thousands of peaceful people being swat teamed and and I heard they were attacked again this year
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:10.960]  Oh
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:16.640]  It just it fascinates me that for 30 some odd years these people have been meeting together
[1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:20.880]  Not causing any trouble and now while of a sudden are they a problem?
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:25.200]  Well, the public has to be shown who's boss and that we're slaves
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.120]  And we've got to be bossed around and taught how to cow down and that the red white and blue means licking boots of a black
[1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:34.240]  uniformed officer and these people are
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:42.400]  Basically really good people. They have some good ideals some good ideas. No, no, they've never had problems at the rainbow gatherings
[1:54:43.200 --> 1:54:45.200]  And I'm told they're pretty neat
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:49.040]  And uh, I was invited to one. I've lived in Wyoming for several years
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:55.200]  Well, how dare citizens go out in the middle of national lands and and and and get together
[1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:01.520]  I mean how dare you you don't do that. That's not freedom freedom is about being taxed and regulated and bossed around
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:07.200]  And and it's about being a slave. It just like I said, I thought it was very sad
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:11.440]  But it was a great article to have to try and make people aware
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:15.920]  Of the fact that no matter how simple you are, it's just not good enough
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:19.760]  Yeah, the article is out of the Jackson Hole Star Tribune
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:27.280]  Yes, and the headline police attack rainbow family gathering in Wyoming and even the local paper admits they just attacked them
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:31.600]  Pointed weapons. I've seen online videos last year. They run up put guns to kids
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.440]  And fired rubber bullets and pepper spray balls at rainbow family members. This is from the local paper
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:42.400]  This is yeah, while making arrests Thursday evening according to witnesses. They were so violent
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:48.720]  Like dogs said robert parker told a reporter debra stevens of the libertarian oriented round rock texas based
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:53.280]  And uh, with people radio network and it goes on after the incident people yelled at them
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:57.120]  You're shooting children parker said during an interview of the
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:02.480]  Rule of law show. I actually heard that radio show. It was one of my friends called me and I listened over the phone
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:09.680]  About 7 000 people have arrived at the gathering near big sandy in wind river mountains when river reservation, correct?
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:14.560]  Yeah, and it says the camp on forest service land around the county every year
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:20.640]  But the rainbow family's non-hierarchical methods. No one could speak to the rainbow as much less sign of land permit often
[1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:24.800]  I have stymied their relationships, but rarely do tensions escalate into violence
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:30.400]  And it says the forest service incident command team and rock springs issued a press release friday morning saying officers
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:35.440]  We're trolling the main meadow gathering. So I appreciate your call. I got to get you know, I don't know if I get these final callers
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:40.880]  And we'll try uh, let's go ahead and talk to mike and ohio quickly mike
