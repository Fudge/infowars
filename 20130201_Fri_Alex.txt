[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:37.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready, strap yourselves in. It is Friday, the first day of February
[00:43.120 --> 00:49.040]  2013. We're gonna be here for the next three hours, and then we'll return, Lord willing,
[00:49.040 --> 00:56.000]  this Sunday, as I always do, 4 to 6 PM Central Standard Time, 5 to 7 PM Eastern for the Sunday
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.000]  transmission.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.440]  She hadn't been on in about four or five months. Rosa Corey, who's one of the best researched,
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.680]  well-spoken firebrands hailing from, where, San Francisco, and the author of Behind the
[01:08.680 --> 01:15.640]  Green Mask, U.N. Agenda 21. She will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk all
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.160]  things Agenda 21.
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.480]  Because that is the global treaty to bring in deindustrialization in a system designed,
[01:24.480 --> 01:33.280]  economies designed to implode in concentric rings down to a feudal system where we are
[01:33.280 --> 01:42.680]  under total social engineer control. And again, everything is Agenda 21, everything is eugenics.
[01:42.680 --> 01:49.760]  And as I do more and more research, it just slams me like a ton of bricks how accurate
[01:49.760 --> 01:50.760]  we are.
[01:50.760 --> 01:55.120]  And I'm not saying we're accurate, we're good people. I'm saying we know what we're talking
[01:55.120 --> 02:03.160]  about. We've got them, we have them. This morning, I was almost late to work, because
[02:03.160 --> 02:07.760]  in amongst my other duties in the morning, I ended up watching about 45 minutes of the
[02:07.760 --> 02:14.000]  video that is academic and very dry, but bone-shilling.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.180]  And the article is up at infowars.com. Population control propagandist, this is at Yale. We
[02:21.180 --> 02:28.400]  get very little opposition from the public through the sitcoms, drama, and TV. We get
[02:28.400 --> 02:34.660]  very little opposition of the public because of the very gradual evolution of the characters.
[02:34.660 --> 02:39.640]  And here they are admitting what we already know, that the dramas, the sitcoms, the soap
[02:39.640 --> 02:46.600]  operas, not just here, but worldwide, are globalist-financed. ABC, NBC, CBS all get
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.640]  Melba Melinda Gates money that ends up going to these shows.
[02:49.640 --> 02:55.000]  And it's the same thing in Africa, Asia, you name it, to demonize the family, to demonize
[02:55.000 --> 03:03.820]  private property, to demonize liberty. And it's the ultra mega rich on record doing this.
[03:03.820 --> 03:09.000]  And what's sick is, yes, you can argue there are areas that are overpopulated, like some
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.560]  areas of India are absolutely hellish, areas of China absolutely hellish. That's not debatable.
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.200]  It's that they use the pretext of dealing with population to bring in a total control
[03:21.200 --> 03:27.000]  grid and actually target the middle class and the nouveau riche and the real intelligentsia
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.480]  that are threats to the old robber barons.
[03:29.480 --> 03:34.840]  And they're using this whole population thing as a cover to bring in a new dark age that
[03:34.840 --> 03:40.920]  they're exempt from in their technological reservations. I mean, this is earth shattering
[03:40.920 --> 03:51.320]  key, key, key, key, key, key information. I mean, this is the real way the world works.
[03:51.320 --> 03:56.980]  This is why everything's happening. We have a socially engineered system where the general
[03:56.980 --> 04:02.080]  population is obsolete. They don't just plan to try to have clean industries put in where
[04:02.080 --> 04:05.680]  people end up only having two children on average or less. And population goes into
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.640]  a negative push, whether it's Japan, the US, Italy, Germany, every country is the same.
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.680]  You see, I've actually read the population reports. I've actually read Ehrlich's books.
[04:14.680 --> 04:20.000]  I've actually read Paul Ehrlich's books and the rest of them. And the Henry Kissinger
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.280]  documents memorandum 200, State Department memorandum 200, 7277, all of them. I mean,
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.160]  I see all of them, thousands. I mean, that's all I do.
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.140]  So much I can't even, I don't even remember 10% of what I've read. I mean, it's so mountainous.
[04:34.140 --> 04:40.200]  It's so congruent. It's so mechanized. It's so clear cut. It's so diagrammed. And I can
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.960]  walk out and see it in the billboards, the culture, the TV. I don't even need to, I can
[04:44.960 --> 04:45.960]  see what they're doing.
[04:45.960 --> 04:50.000]  Let me go type in and look for a white paper saying this. And I go type it in. I know their
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.740]  language. I find the exact white paper with the exact words I just envisioned of them
[04:54.740 --> 05:01.760]  talking about how they planned five years ago, what I'm looking at now.
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.600]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.200]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[05:11.200 --> 05:16.280]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[05:29.680 --> 05:35.340]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[08:19.880 --> 08:28.360]  Thank you for joining us, listening across the United States, whether it's on our 150
[08:28.360 --> 08:34.880]  plus AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave, the internet at Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[08:34.880 --> 08:41.180]  or watching us at Infowarsnews.com, the TV version of the radio transmission, or of course
[08:41.180 --> 08:45.080]  listening by the internet or shortwave all across the world.
[08:45.080 --> 08:52.720]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this Friday, the first day of February, 2013. Probably
[08:52.720 --> 08:59.460]  one of the most well-spoken, focused fighters against the eugenics, new dark age, global
[08:59.460 --> 09:05.000]  government system of Agenda 21. Rosa Corey will be joining us, hadn't been on in about
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  four months.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.440]  She was on the nightly news a few months ago, but hadn't been on with me in about four or
[09:08.440 --> 09:13.380]  five months. She's going to be joining us in the second hour and in studio. Pastor Steve
[09:13.380 --> 09:18.500]  Anderson is one of the people in an amazing new film that we're carrying. He's the preacher
[09:18.500 --> 09:25.160]  who lives in Arizona and has to drive through a border patrol checkpoint 100 miles in.
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.160]  They all know who he is and always want to search his vehicle. And he says, why don't
[09:28.160 --> 09:31.660]  you do something about the illegals? So they beat him up. That's not why he's joining us,
[09:31.660 --> 09:35.300]  but that video has been seen millions of times online. A lot of folks know him because of
[09:35.300 --> 09:36.300]  that.
[09:36.300 --> 09:43.580]  Also, he has prayed for the downfall of President Obama before, which is biblical, and he's
[09:43.580 --> 09:46.720]  been demonized nationally for that. That's probably how some of you will know him. But
[09:46.720 --> 09:52.400]  after the tribulation, Let No Man Deceive You, powerful new Christian film. And even if you're
[09:52.400 --> 10:00.080]  not a Christian, what are there? A billion, 200 million Catholics and another billion
[10:00.080 --> 10:02.560]  or so other sects of Christians.
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.580]  So that's two billion plus Christians out there. People who claim they're Christians,
[10:07.580 --> 10:12.500]  some estimates are 80% of Americans identify themselves as Christians, though not really
[10:12.500 --> 10:20.080]  practicing, but still believe in God and identify with Christ. Christians from the lion's den,
[10:20.080 --> 10:25.440]  and of course that was Jews, but that's what Christianity came out of right through to
[10:25.440 --> 10:34.500]  all the prophets, right through to 50, 60, 70, 100 years after Christ in Rome.
[10:34.500 --> 10:38.000]  The Christians said slavery was wrong, and it was mainly white slaves that were slaves
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.120]  from all over. You weren't Roman, you could be a slave. It was the Christians that helped
[10:42.120 --> 10:47.160]  phase out slavery 2000 years ago. It was Christians who wouldn't worship other gods and were thrown
[10:47.160 --> 10:53.380]  to the lions. And this is all on record. Why do Christians submit to tyranny today? Why
[10:53.380 --> 11:00.000]  did Christians found America by saying no king but King Jesus, King George is a tyrant,
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.260]  and led that rebellion, but today why do they submit?
[11:03.260 --> 11:10.000]  And the biggest issue is they teach a pre-tribulation rapture. So we're gonna examine that. And
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.400]  again, even if you're not a Christian, this is important anthropology, important sociology,
[11:15.400 --> 11:19.900]  important psychology. The globalists study all the groups out there, and then they manipulate
[11:19.900 --> 11:21.080]  us against each other.
[11:21.080 --> 11:26.440]  So I study Islam, I study Christianity, I study it all. I study Satanism, the occult.
[11:26.440 --> 11:36.120]  I am a Christian. I studied it all, animism, atheism, agnostics, Rosicrucianism, Aleister
[11:36.120 --> 11:43.540]  Crowley, baloney stuff, all of it. And I'm telling you, the globalists believe in God,
[11:43.540 --> 11:47.480]  and they believe in spiritual forces. I mean, how do you know when somebody's looking at
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.480]  you?
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.920]  You can be walking through the woods on your own property on 1,000 acres. I know I've been
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.820]  doing that before on my family's property in East Texas. And repeatedly, I know when
[11:56.820 --> 12:00.800]  somebody's looking at me, and I'm always right. You always know in the restaurant, you feel
[12:00.800 --> 12:03.860]  somebody staring at you, turn around and somebody's looking at you. And it's somebody you knew
[12:03.860 --> 12:10.640]  years before, they're like, I thought that was you, Bob, thought that was you, Carol.
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.000]  They've proven, that's how a monarch butterfly, four generations can fly to northern Canada,
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.880]  and then one flies all the way back using the sun and magnetic systems, windage, everything,
[12:21.880 --> 12:26.920]  flying at 10,000 feet all the way to Mexico. That's the incredible cells they found in
[12:26.920 --> 12:33.440]  fish, they found in birds, and they're in humans as well, that are electromagnetic,
[12:33.440 --> 12:40.920]  and that are picking up on all sorts of not just magnetic systems, but cells they don't
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.240]  know exactly what they do, but that are antennas.
[12:44.240 --> 12:50.440]  I mean, you're picking things up, the globalists know this, they're obsessed with it. And they
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.080]  want you to be dumbed down and unaware of it. Most of the major atheist movements, the
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.880]  low level atheist, think they know it all and are real intellectual, and they never
[12:59.880 --> 13:03.360]  believe it, even in government corruption, that couldn't exist. Things that are admitted
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.680]  can't exist, it's a very one dimensional, dried, stale perspective, I don't blame people
[13:09.680 --> 13:10.680]  wanting to be atheist.
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.480]  You look at establishment religion, boy, that would make me an atheist any day, or at least
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.920]  an agnostic. But the spiritual, it's definitely real, and humans for our entire history have
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.560]  known this, so there's always priest, a priesthood who tries to get between you and the universe,
[13:26.560 --> 13:34.360]  you and God. You and God's creation, the universe, there's always that priesthood that wants
[13:34.360 --> 13:42.160]  to get between you and your creator, you and the power that is God's creation.
[13:42.160 --> 13:52.040]  Because that's where the proof of the civilization, the proof of the intelligence is the civilization,
[13:52.040 --> 13:58.000]  is the creation, is the master builder. People say, that's Illuminati, master builder, great
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.780]  architect. God is called the great architect and the master builder in the Bible, the Luciferians
[14:04.780 --> 14:14.360]  take everything and they take it onto themselves, every symbol, every name, they take it and
[14:14.360 --> 14:18.120]  then there's no symbols left, there's no names left, they've taken them all, they've stolen
[14:18.120 --> 14:19.120]  them.
[14:19.120 --> 14:23.160]  Oh, you're talking about something that's the devil, no, you are looking at the counterfeit.
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.440]  Now, I'm not gonna preach cuz I got a bunch of news to cover, we'll get to that coming
[14:27.440 --> 14:30.680]  up with the pastor in studio with us today. He's also gonna be on the Nightly News with
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.120]  Darren McBrain for an in-depth commercial free, commercial free during the interview,
[14:35.120 --> 14:43.520]  as commercials, as bookends on the TV show of 7 o'clock central every night, Infowarsnews.com.
[14:43.520 --> 14:47.560]  But the new film is available, Let No Man Deceive You after the tribulation and it goes
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.000]  well with Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.680]  son Timothy Baldwin.
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.560]  Great to give to every preacher, filled with the, I don't know, it's gotta be a hundred
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.920]  Bible verses about it's your job to stand up against evil and corruption and bullies
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.920]  and thugs. And that if you don't, God will absolutely hate you more than anybody else,
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.480]  that you knew innocents were being hurt and you weren't evil but you were a coward.
[15:12.480 --> 15:18.280]  God hates a coward, you need to get that straight. Justice hates a coward, common sense hate
[15:18.280 --> 15:25.480]  a coward, women hate a coward, children hate a coward, and cowards hate themselves. A man
[15:25.480 --> 15:31.240]  who has courage only dies a single death. Cowards die thousands of deaths. Every day
[15:31.240 --> 15:34.680]  is fear, fear of people think, fear of what's gonna happen.
[15:34.680 --> 15:47.080]  I absolutely hate fear. I absolutely despise it, because it does kill your intellect. It
[15:47.080 --> 15:56.520]  is the mind killer, to quote a great writer and I'd say philosopher, Frank Herbert. Fear
[15:56.520 --> 16:02.520]  is the mind killer, fear is the little death. You let it pass through you, over you, around
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.400]  you, past you, behind you. Get behind me Satan, get behind me. People say, what does that
[16:07.400 --> 16:08.600]  mean get behind me?
[16:08.600 --> 16:15.320]  Get out of my way, get out of the road, get out of my way, stop it, get out, get out.
[16:15.320 --> 16:21.240]  The devil accuses, tells us all day how we're bad, we're evil, we're guilty. And we all
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.040]  are guilty one way or another, but are our hearts guilty? Are we doing it on purpose?
[16:25.040 --> 16:31.040]  Do we love evil? No, and that's why, that's why the system tells you you're bad so that
[16:31.040 --> 16:37.480]  you feel guilty, so you step aside. When you run into the devil on the road, there is no
[16:37.480 --> 16:43.560]  turning back, there is no turning back on the road. There is no turning back on the
[16:43.560 --> 16:46.160]  run.
[16:46.160 --> 16:57.920]  But we're not running from the devil, we're trying to run to God. Because it's a race,
[16:57.920 --> 17:03.600]  and the devil, whatever you wanna call it, doesn't want us to achieve that level of awakening
[17:03.600 --> 17:09.640]  and understanding. Consciousness, the system wants to keep you within this control box
[17:09.640 --> 17:15.960]  feeling small, feeling ugly, feeling powerless, feeling scared so that you don't break out.
[17:15.960 --> 17:22.840]  Climb to the surface, come out of the cave, Plato's cave, THX 1138, Robert Duvall climbs
[17:22.840 --> 17:32.640]  to the top, allegory of the cave and sees the world. Logan's run, climbs out from the
[17:32.640 --> 17:43.400]  subterranean system of control, the technocracy, and sees the open earth.
[17:43.400 --> 17:49.440]  An artificial system to control us. And again, there's an hour and a half video, excuse me,
[17:49.440 --> 17:58.320]  an hour and 50 minute video up at infowars.com right now. Population control propaganda,
[17:58.320 --> 18:01.920]  we get very little opposition from the public. And they go on to say, we get very little
[18:01.920 --> 18:05.040]  opposition from the public because of our television programs.
[18:05.040 --> 18:10.000]  They are a very gradual evolution of the characters. And what do they say, to end the family, to
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.040]  end fealty, to end any type of honor, where you're just a nobody that's programmed by
[18:16.040 --> 18:21.000]  the television, by the culture. And they say, by increment, we do it. And it's everything
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.140]  I've talked about, it's everything Alan Watts talked about, because it's all in Eber Bernays'
[18:25.140 --> 18:27.080]  three books.
[18:27.080 --> 18:32.220]  The father of modern propaganda, Sigmund Freud's nephew. When you go watch it, they're sitting
[18:32.220 --> 18:37.280]  around giggling and getting off on the fact that they're manipulating you because you're
[18:37.280 --> 18:45.440]  trusting. And you look at these men, these are weak, power grasping, shaking men who
[18:45.440 --> 18:52.260]  have a look of egomania in their eyes, that they are world controllers, that they are
[18:52.260 --> 18:54.840]  engineering you, that they have taken control.
[18:54.840 --> 19:01.560]  And they are world saviors, and they're there to all these PhD students doing their dissertation
[19:01.560 --> 19:05.200]  in this Yale hour 50 minute thing. It's a nightmare, I haven't even watched the whole
[19:05.200 --> 19:09.840]  thing yet. I watched about half of it, it was very painful. Cuz I already knew it 100
[19:09.840 --> 19:15.120]  times over, but just to see them smacking the lips and doddering around. These people
[19:15.120 --> 19:22.760]  are all cold and intelligent to one level, but they miss any depth or variety or versatility.
[19:22.760 --> 19:27.520]  Or they would absolutely run the other direction. And they talk about the Rockefellers, everybody
[19:27.520 --> 19:34.540]  funding them, and Maurice Strong, and Paul Ehrlich, and John P. Holdren, and all of it.
[19:34.540 --> 19:39.320]  And how I was just here 40 years ago like you, and I've led the worldwide program for
[19:39.320 --> 19:46.200]  the engineering program in television to break down the family, to help the family. And you
[19:46.200 --> 19:51.440]  will soon be in this force. I mean, it's all there, and you're just like watching soldiers,
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.440]  armies built, and they're not even actually trying to reduce population.
[19:55.440 --> 20:01.520]  I'll tell you about that when we come back and then get into all the other big news.
[20:01.520 --> 20:06.320]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[20:06.320 --> 20:10.280]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.520]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.600]  to those that have lost everything. My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every

[20:22.840 --> 20:27.320]  from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores
[20:27.320 --> 20:31.400]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[20:31.400 --> 20:35.520]  and my niece. Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day
[20:35.520 --> 20:36.520]  too late.

[21:07.440 --> 21:12.400]  Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.
[21:12.400 --> 21:18.160]  But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.800]  of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.
[21:22.800 --> 21:28.000]  I learned by taking RNA drops, I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.240]  the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a
[21:32.240 --> 21:38.080]  free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.

[24:19.840 --> 24:25.880]  in the US or North America, but worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones. And remember if
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.100]  you're a new listener tuning into us on AM and FM stations all across the country, those
[24:30.100 --> 24:32.160]  are precious affiliates.
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.840]  And the fact that this broadcast is exploding, even though we come from a smaller independent
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.800]  radio network, not one of the big three giants, is unprecedented in the history of modern
[24:41.800 --> 24:48.260]  radio. And it's because station managers, owners, and sponsors in your area understand
[24:48.260 --> 24:52.340]  that a lot of what I've talked about unfortunately is now coming true. They realize we're in
[24:52.340 --> 24:56.760]  trouble and they want to get this information out to you as a service.
[24:56.760 --> 25:00.800]  So be sure and spread the word about all the stations you're listening to. And be sure
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.560]  and sponsor the local station if you're a business owner. And be sure and support the
[25:06.560 --> 25:14.560]  sponsors and let them know you appreciate it. That is so important. That is so important.
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.720]  Because people at Yale, Yale's come out recently and said, let's kill babies, some of the professors
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.280]  up to age three, even if they're healthy. It's been in the Journal of Bioethics. That's
[25:24.280 --> 25:29.720]  the new death panel groups where they get their walking orders.
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.760]  They say, well, the death panel, the bioethics board, says it's okay, so now we can kill
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.020]  you. And then the police go, well, they're wearing a white lab coat, it must be okay.
[25:38.020 --> 25:41.680]  That's how Hitler did it. He got his first tyranny into the medical system. And I'll
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.800]  get more into this with Rosa Corey coming up on June 21. I want to get into all the
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.300]  other economic news that is incredibly important. Huge purges of gun owners have begun, legal
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.360]  gun owners.
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.480]  This is moving faster than I thought. More giant military drills on a stage. We've never
[25:55.480 --> 25:59.920]  seen anything. This is an order of magnitudes bigger. There's huge drills every day in major
[25:59.920 --> 26:06.520]  cities terrorizing people to acclimate the public for military occupation. It's all coming
[26:06.520 --> 26:07.520]  up.
[26:07.520 --> 26:10.500]  But here's what I want to explain to you. And we covered a lot in my film, it's been
[26:10.500 --> 26:16.400]  out six years, in game blueprint for global enslavement. Available on DVD at info wars.com
[26:16.400 --> 26:21.440]  but in higher quality or in prisonplanet.tv, but it's free on YouTube, folks. But don't
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.780]  have it be pearls before swine, okay?
[26:23.780 --> 26:29.480]  Go watch it. It has an online bibliography. What is the endgame.com? What is the endgame.com
[26:29.480 --> 26:35.040]  so you can double check every 30 seconds. We have it marked on the time code with a
[26:35.040 --> 26:40.400]  bibliography. Where the UN says they want to exterminate at least 80% of the public,
[26:40.400 --> 26:45.880]  where they state it's US government policy, the British Royal Commission on population.
[26:45.880 --> 26:50.220]  Anything we quote in the film, it's right there. Even if it's George Herbert Walker
[26:50.220 --> 26:55.360]  Bush calling for world government, new world order, everybody knows he did that.
[26:55.360 --> 26:59.160]  And we show the State of the Union, we still give the date, where they said it and where
[26:59.160 --> 27:07.640]  we got it. The date in Congress of the United States, State of the Union. I mean everything
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.880]  documented, it's like an online film book. Here's my basic indictment. We've had the
[27:13.880 --> 27:17.160]  different population associations on that have broken down the numbers. These numbers
[27:17.160 --> 27:20.460]  are fact, you can look them up.
[27:20.460 --> 27:29.480]  The eugenicist 150 years ago, well actually about 163 years ago now, by 1850, the robber
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.900]  baron British royalty and others, even the other financial elite were interbreeding.
[27:35.900 --> 27:41.520]  So they were having a lot of deformed children, mentally ill children. The reason they started
[27:41.520 --> 27:48.520]  marrying commoners by the 1930s or so was because Queen Elizabeth has a bunch of siblings
[27:48.520 --> 27:54.160]  and all of them had to get locked up, just completely insane and deformed and it's a
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.720]  very sad story.
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.420]  But that's why they've now been forced to marry commoners. See, they're so elite they
[28:00.420 --> 28:04.760]  can't even have kids because of the psychos inbreeding together. And I mean psychos, they've
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.080]  inbred psychopathic traits to create, certain breeds of dogs are overbred and completely
[28:10.080 --> 28:17.200]  insane and everybody knows that. It's many times worse with humans. I mean most Egyptians,
[28:17.200 --> 28:24.600]  that's why they would have a dynasties collapse over and over again.
[28:24.600 --> 28:30.640]  Because the oldest live would live to be about 20. And imagine these would be completely
[28:30.640 --> 28:38.640]  mentally retarded, king, sterile, unable to talk, totally deformed, and they would prop
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.400]  them up and worship them as God. And then whatever utterances came from their mouth,
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.600]  they would then follow immediately.
[28:46.600 --> 28:50.920]  And this is what we go through. So they were obsessed with, why are we dying? Why are we
[28:50.920 --> 28:54.800]  deformed? And so all their scientists said, we're gonna discover it. So they discovered
[28:54.800 --> 29:04.760]  genetics out of it, came eugenics, well, first eugenics, then genetics, then bioethics, biometrics
[29:04.760 --> 29:06.600]  is over 100 years old.
[29:06.600 --> 29:11.520]  Everything you know, the first computers, IBM was commissioned by the Rothschilds and
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.680]  Rockefellers to create computers to try to track why the elites were having, most of
[29:16.680 --> 29:21.640]  their kids were dying at stillbirth. And this is all on record, race studies, the Hollerith
[29:21.640 --> 29:25.440]  machines, it was IBM machines, the Nazis had to put the tattoos on people.
[29:25.440 --> 29:29.480]  I'm gonna come back and finish this. I say I'll do it simply, but it's just incredible.
[29:29.480 --> 29:33.920]  This is everything. This is why it's all like this. And they've made the decision to cut
[29:33.920 --> 29:40.440]  off the resources incrementally over time, cuz they've learned you can't resist that.
[29:40.440 --> 29:43.720]  I'm gonna explain it all when we come back and then get into why all this other stuff
[29:43.720 --> 29:50.440]  is happening. Because if you don't know this basic foundation, you won't know anything.

[33:21.760 --> 33:28.000]  going back over 160 years describing the problems, why they've done what they've done, why they
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.160]  made the decisions because they see the general public as absolute dumb animals.
[33:33.160 --> 33:39.520]  Really the general public just isn't lusting after power. The general public is a mix of
[33:39.520 --> 33:47.480]  good people, bad people, ugly people, evil people, sweet people, creative people, eccentric
[33:47.480 --> 33:54.160]  people. It takes all kinds to make the world go round. But hereditary power always ends
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.120]  up taking over whether it's North Korea, whether it's the kings of Europe, whether it's the
[33:58.120 --> 34:02.560]  kings of Japan, the emperors, whether it's been the kings of the Chinese.
[34:02.560 --> 34:07.520]  The communist always just end up turning the Politburo into an above the law hereditary
[34:07.520 --> 34:13.640]  royalty. You go to places like North Korea, they're now in some cases four generations
[34:13.640 --> 34:19.800]  into people who are given the seat on the government council or given the seat in the
[34:19.800 --> 34:26.360]  local government job. And given the house that their grandfather had that was given
[34:26.360 --> 34:29.560]  to them by the communist.
[34:29.560 --> 34:34.160]  And this is what they set up. And so imagine you've got inbred groups already inbreeding
[34:34.160 --> 34:40.320]  for being aggressive, being ruthless, being cunning, being smart. Let's say if your ancestor
[34:40.320 --> 34:46.320]  is William the Conqueror, who was particularly powerful king, obviously out of France, was
[34:46.320 --> 34:52.200]  France today, because he was from a commoner.
[34:52.200 --> 35:01.600]  A king in that area mated with a particularly aggressive barbarian woman. And so then you
[35:01.600 --> 35:08.720]  get William the Bastard, as he was known, and he then goes into England and takes over.
[35:08.720 --> 35:12.500]  So they weren't all psychopaths, but they were cunning, smart, aggressive. Then you
[35:12.500 --> 35:16.960]  inbreed psychopaths, control freaks, sadists, because they're willing to do the horrible
[35:16.960 --> 35:17.960]  things to stay in power.
[35:17.960 --> 35:24.920]  In fact, they enjoy it. So it's an attribute for their type of cancer to take control,
[35:24.920 --> 35:30.240]  to see the general public as cattle, the prey animal, they the Morlocks, we the Eloi. They
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.360]  use an H.G. Wells analogy, which he wrote nonfiction books admitting that was an analogy
[35:34.360 --> 35:39.600]  of the ruling class and the general population. That we were pure, that we were beautiful,
[35:39.600 --> 35:41.880]  that we were sweet, didn't matter.
[35:41.880 --> 35:47.960]  You won't rule things from the subterranean keep like the Morlocks. You're going to be
[35:47.960 --> 35:52.920]  fed on. And when one of you gets grabbed and drug away, the others will just run and hide
[35:52.920 --> 36:00.480]  in the bushes but come back out. And so that's what they do, that they see us like animals.
[36:00.480 --> 36:07.000]  They say we're animals. And the entire technological system, unlimited money, the unlimited stolen
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.880]  money of countries and peoples and tribes and other empires has all been poured.
[36:13.880 --> 36:20.040]  Imagine you're the elite. You say all my kids are dying. My royal line is dying. We've got
[36:20.040 --> 36:27.580]  massive mental illness. That's why this whole government system, this train that's already
[36:27.580 --> 36:33.160]  been built, that we've been put on, that's a self-oiling mechanized perpetual motion
[36:33.160 --> 36:34.260]  system.
[36:34.260 --> 36:40.240]  That's why it just continues forward because thousands of trillions in the aggregate and
[36:40.240 --> 36:47.460]  that's conservative, has been pumped into it in the last 160 plus years. And a melding
[36:47.460 --> 36:52.800]  of the ancient empires, a melding of the ancient royal systems, the corruptions, all the corrupt
[36:52.800 --> 36:57.960]  minions that served and climbed into the ranks to become lords.
[36:57.960 --> 37:04.080]  And then to add their genetics to the pool of the super shark, super aggressive cancer.
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.600]  It's a cancer cell in a body system. They're right, we are a collective, but the individual's
[37:09.600 --> 37:14.560]  what makes us strong. An individual operating correctly is the opposite of the collective
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.000]  but is within the collective.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.780]  They create a false collective where a cancer program is overlaid. And they know it's a
[37:20.780 --> 37:25.520]  cancer and know it will destroy the old system, which they live off of. So they decided to
[37:25.520 --> 37:31.400]  fully re-engineer the entire old system where everything else is eradicated and it's only
[37:31.400 --> 37:37.520]  cancer. And this is not going to work. It's never worked, but they believe technology
[37:37.520 --> 37:40.240]  is going to allow them and they all talk about this.
[37:40.240 --> 37:47.000]  Bertrand Russell and Ted Turner and Paul Ehrlich, they all write these papers. I've listed them
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.720]  here, I've made films about them where they sit and talk about this. It just thinly, thinly
[37:51.720 --> 37:57.920]  in many cases not even failed. And so that's why they've gone to a system now where they're
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.040]  gonna shut off the resources incrementally to bankrupt you and make you go under their
[38:02.040 --> 38:07.680]  control so they can then sterilize you, so they can then death panel you, so they can
[38:07.680 --> 38:09.040]  then euthanize you.
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.920]  And that's why they brag that they fund and run most of the big sitcoms, movies, dramas
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.720]  with product placement, propaganda placement, that they're now, you hear it on the shock
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.640]  radio. You see it in the movies, making fun of old people, making fun of babies, saying
[38:24.640 --> 38:30.440]  children are gross, being married is stupid. Men are all dumb, women are in charge, not
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.200]  to empower women to isolate them and to make them be under state control and only trust
[38:34.200 --> 38:36.600]  the state as their husband.
[38:36.600 --> 38:42.040]  And that's what they say, the state will be the husband. And so they're taking control
[38:42.040 --> 38:46.960]  of the human system at a subconscious level. And they even write about this, they realize
[38:46.960 --> 38:54.000]  it because they hate the strength of the unwashed masses. They hate the vigor, they hate the
[38:54.000 --> 39:01.100]  hybrid power. They hate it to the ends of the earth, it is a glaring light to them.
[39:01.100 --> 39:05.040]  And they want it blotted out. So really, this is why I indict them and I'll give the rest
[39:05.040 --> 39:10.520]  of the news. The globalists know that once you industrialize a country and even bring
[39:10.520 --> 39:15.960]  in clean industry, that the population, I said goes down to about, for every two adults
[39:15.960 --> 39:17.480]  they have on average two children.
[39:17.480 --> 39:23.260]  That's not actually accurate. In the entire industrialized world, it's about 1.5. The
[39:23.260 --> 39:28.820]  US is right at two people for every two, but that's because of the 10 million or so immigrants
[39:28.820 --> 39:33.340]  brought in every five years. We're actually imploding as well. I mean, it's different
[39:33.340 --> 39:38.000]  numbers every year, but it's about 1.3 children for every two children in Italy, about 1.3
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.480]  to 1.2 in Japan.
[39:40.480 --> 39:50.240]  It's about 1.5 in Germany. It's about 1.3, 1.4 in Russia. It's about 1.3 in Britain,
[39:50.240 --> 39:57.320]  if you cut out the immigrant influx. So the West is dying. And this was done through social
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.000]  engineering, done through the 50s and 60s, social revolution sold as empowerment but
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.840]  actually destroyed the family, to get both people working.
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.840]  So now the state raises your children, very diabolical plan. Now, that's the plan they're
[40:10.840 --> 40:17.080]  going with in the West. They have a surface plan in Africa, Asia, Latin America claiming
[40:17.080 --> 40:21.840]  that through the sitcoms and dramas and conditioning. And they admit it's all conditioning and laugh.
[40:21.840 --> 40:25.200]  Look at the little animals, they don't know we're doing this. And they stand around. I
[40:25.200 --> 40:27.640]  mean, I got a video posted at info wars.com.
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.200]  Top professors, top globalist, the head of the UN program, and they just sit there and
[40:31.200 --> 40:35.080]  laugh at you that this is all public. And they talk about how they're gonna incrementally
[40:35.080 --> 40:40.080]  do this. And they've got all the PhDs out there, all the people about to get their PhDs
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.560]  in the graduate program, sitting there listening to this getting off on it.
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.420]  And they go to TED TV events and they have the intelligentsia there, the technocrats
[40:49.420 --> 40:53.060]  there, the mid-level technocrats. And they say, yeah, we're gonna reduce this number
[40:53.060 --> 40:58.760]  and show an equation of humans with carbon dioxide and show it going to zero, which means
[40:58.760 --> 41:04.180]  zero humans. Everybody laughs and Bill Gates laughs. See, it's all a laugh because that's
[41:04.180 --> 41:05.480]  gang sign.
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.560]  It's like they speak another language. It's an equation, very simple equation. But they
[41:09.560 --> 41:13.760]  know people watching that, how are they even gonna know an equation? They don't know what
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.560]  the three branches of government are. They show an equation that they're going to kill
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.740]  us. And he actually says, we've gotta get this number down to zero, using vaccines to
[41:22.740 --> 41:24.060]  lower their population.
[41:24.060 --> 41:31.320]  He even says it, shows the equation, and then they all laugh. Yeah, it's funny to them,
[41:31.320 --> 41:36.320]  cuz they're not really trying to save the planet. That's how they get the low-level
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.920]  people into this. They're a bunch of inbred psychopath sadists up top. And you read the
[41:41.920 --> 41:47.000]  1949 Royal Commission on Population, that's the blueprint of all the modern stuff we followed.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.800]  Ehrlich, the UN, agenda 21, UNESCO, all of it.
[41:50.800 --> 41:58.560]  You read all of that, Biological Diversity Assessment 96, all of it. They say, well,
[41:58.560 --> 42:04.040]  if we go in and do clean industry, or even give them basic horticulture, and drill wells
[42:04.040 --> 42:11.720]  for them, water wells. They talk about how the Christian missionaries are going in and
[42:11.720 --> 42:14.080]  actually helping people, and that's gonna be a problem.
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.000]  They go, we've gotta come in claiming we're helping, but we've gotta block all this development,
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.720]  even though it'll lower their population. And they'll start having less than two kids,
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.000]  because they'll be informed, they'll wanna have some more wealth. They won't need ten
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.560]  kids, cuz half of them are gonna die to take care of them in their old age.
[42:30.560 --> 42:34.360]  Plus, the only wealth you have as being really poor is children. By the way, it is the real
[42:34.360 --> 42:39.520]  wealth. But the point is, is that the globalists all know they've all got five, six, seven,
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.680]  eight, nine, ten kids, they all know that. Ted Turner's got five, biggest landowner and
[42:44.680 --> 42:50.840]  15 jet airplanes, all the rest of it. You're a useless eater, he's not, according to his
[42:50.840 --> 42:52.340]  mindset.
[42:52.340 --> 42:58.240]  So you've got all this going on, they blocked, and they say this in the 1949 Commission on
[42:58.240 --> 43:03.480]  Population. You can pull up the synopsis online, you've gotta go to a big library to find it.
[43:03.480 --> 43:07.440]  We've done it, we've shown it in film, shown the screenshots. They admit, they just say,
[43:07.440 --> 43:09.640]  we're just gonna keep them from industrializing.
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.800]  That'll cause a population explosion, but we'll then just mitigate that. And of course,
[43:15.800 --> 43:20.560]  that's the vaccines and programs at a certain point, but we wanna use that cheap labor pool
[43:20.560 --> 43:27.040]  in select development zones with a mercantile model, that's globalism, 2.0 is globalism
[43:27.040 --> 43:28.040]  of mercantile.
[43:28.040 --> 43:33.760]  A selective system, a selective insider crony system where they pick the winners to leverage
[43:33.760 --> 43:39.920]  out the West so we can then social engineer them. So they wanna social engineer the West
[43:39.920 --> 43:47.120]  cuz we're the real target. Highest education, highest IQ, genetically in the studies, whatever
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.880]  issue you wanna look at, that's the main target.
[43:50.880 --> 44:01.600]  Of course, these are all averages. And they're also targeting the Chinese, again, they're
[44:01.600 --> 44:07.640]  also targeting the Japanese, but they're targeting every other country, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.860]  And countries like Africa are just slated for extermination. That's why some countries
[44:11.860 --> 44:18.340]  have lost half their population in the last 30 years. I mean, this is so diabolical.
[44:18.340 --> 44:23.820]  To grow a giant people bomb, point out the problem, offer your solution, globalism, which
[44:23.820 --> 44:28.320]  is really blocking clean energies that are developed while claiming you're promoting
[44:28.320 --> 44:29.320]  them.
[44:29.320 --> 44:32.760]  And then only using that as wealth transfers in boondoggles that aren't even supposed to
[44:32.760 --> 44:40.860]  work on record. Solyndra and others where they don't even build anything and fake electric
[44:40.860 --> 44:46.280]  cars while blocking carburetors in the 70s that got 100 miles to the gallon on record.
[44:46.280 --> 44:56.120]  I mean, this is so evil, ladies and gentlemen, because they're cheating. They're not smarter
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.160]  than us that they're in control. These royals in almost every dynasty, no matter which group
[45:02.160 --> 45:04.800]  they were, African royals, and there were plenty of those.
[45:04.800 --> 45:07.520]  There was a King of Africa that ruled the Middle East for a while, probably richest
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.980]  man in history. So you can look that up and show that richest man in world history was
[45:12.980 --> 45:18.760]  African. The Asians had their kings, all of it, it's the same system that they are willing
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.960]  to then always kill whoever became the king or the queen would then kill or lock up their
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.200]  family members.
[45:28.200 --> 45:33.680]  Meet Manza Musa, the first of Mali, the richest human being in all of history. And there's
[45:33.680 --> 45:38.880]  an example and a painting of him. Okay, so this is the type of stuff that goes on and
[45:38.880 --> 45:43.440]  they all operate the same. So just like a grizzly bear will go and smell, a male grizzly
[45:43.440 --> 45:50.520]  bear will go and smell a male baby and try to kill it.
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.860]  Because he sees it as a threat later in territory and food and mates, just like lions and tigers
[45:55.860 --> 46:01.940]  do that. The system is doing that, but to all of us in a power grab, they see us as,
[46:01.940 --> 46:07.880]  and we can show the article out of the UN just last week, as locust, as a horde of locust.
[46:07.880 --> 46:15.160]  Grasshoppers coming and eating all the plants down to the roots. They see us as a disease
[46:15.160 --> 46:17.700]  because this is their world they've conquered.
[46:17.700 --> 46:23.520]  But then the sick thing is they actually increased populations, kept them from stabilizing as
[46:23.520 --> 46:30.600]  a people bomb to leverage out the West and sell the West on eugenics ideas. Cuz most
[46:30.600 --> 46:33.920]  trendies will tell you, of course there's too many people, of course, yeah, of course
[46:33.920 --> 46:35.360]  they're putting stuff in the water.
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.040]  What do you think we've got to do this for the Earth? They're not even doing it for that.
[46:39.040 --> 46:45.640]  They're doing it to just control everybody and their main target. It's come out a decade
[46:45.640 --> 46:49.200]  ago or more. They have school study tests where they give them to sixth and seventh
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.920]  graders and the boys that show the highest aptitude, black, white, doesn't matter, and
[46:53.920 --> 46:55.600]  who show the leadership traits.
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.320]  Those are the ones that get flagged. You get called into the principal's office or the
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.280]  nurse's office and they say, you're a troublemaker, we wanna put you on Ritalin. Even when the
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.620]  people aren't troublemakers, they try to put them on it because it's targeted to cause
[47:08.620 --> 47:13.300]  neuron death, brain shrinkage, and also organ problems.
[47:13.300 --> 47:17.480]  The heart gets larger and has ventricle issues. That's just a few of the side effects. This
[47:17.480 --> 47:24.520]  is a scientific program laid out in grids like we're animals in a coyote extermination
[47:24.520 --> 47:31.480]  program or something. They're trying to wipe people out, dumb down their opposition, neutralize,
[47:31.480 --> 47:37.100]  put the public in a trance, and then carry out the orderly, gradual, ambient extermination
[47:37.100 --> 47:38.760]  of the general population.
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.140]  Now there's Margaret Sanger quote, the most merciful thing that a family does to one of
[47:43.140 --> 47:49.740]  its infant members is to kill it. She was talking about kids period. This is a death
[47:49.740 --> 47:56.160]  cult. And so these people stand around like they're saviors of the world. They're not
[47:56.160 --> 48:00.560]  saviors of the world, they are stealing the world.
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.760]  And by the way, it's the globalists doing open air genetic planting all over the planet.
[48:04.760 --> 48:09.200]  They're the ones with thousands of laboratories, thousands firing gene guns into random plant
[48:09.200 --> 48:16.760]  animal, bacterial, you name it, organisms to create mutations. They're the ones releasing
[48:16.760 --> 48:21.160]  the ingredients to mousepox for humans that kills over 90% of those that come in contact
[48:21.160 --> 48:22.880]  with it, and it's airborne.
[48:22.880 --> 48:28.160]  They're the ones, these UT professor Pianca and Dr. Peter Singer, what at Princeton, go
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.360]  look up any head of a biology department, type in eugenics population control. You're
[48:33.360 --> 48:38.940]  not let in to the club unless you're for this. That's why Pianca, remember this famously
[48:38.940 --> 48:43.280]  five years ago, gave a speech to the Texas Academy of Sciences. He got their highest
[48:43.280 --> 48:44.280]  award.
[48:44.280 --> 48:49.240]  It's been to Europe. And he said, I look forward to the airborne Ebola being released and 90%
[48:49.240 --> 48:54.040]  of us dying, including my family. It's sad, but it's for the better. And there was a standing
[48:54.040 --> 49:07.720]  three minute ovation. Photos were taken, newspapers reported with crying. Even my family's gonna
[49:07.720 --> 49:15.000]  die. And everyone was so moved by it. Yes, all the top Texas Academy of Sciences people.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.640]  I talked to the reporters that were there. They were taking photos and covered it. And
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.960]  they estimated 90% stood in the ovation and it went on for three minutes as he projected
[49:24.960 --> 49:33.440]  on the PowerPoint a giant screen of pile of red skulls, red skulls.
[49:33.440 --> 49:39.120]  He actually went and did a Google search later of that photo. It's a Rwandan pile of skulls.
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.520]  You can actually do the image search. Giant red pile of skulls and they're in their church.
[49:44.520 --> 49:53.760]  They're in their church standing ovation, standing ovation, standing ovation. It's their
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.120]  church. It's their time to cry. It's their time to have a sacrament. It's their time
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.500]  to take the blood of Satan, not the blood of Jesus.
[49:59.500 --> 50:04.840]  It's their time to take communion. It's their time, it's their time, it's their time, their
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.960]  time. And as your factory shut down, as your businesses shut down, as things bankrupt and
[50:09.960 --> 50:14.760]  rot, they see it as a victory. As Detroit falls, they see it as a victory. And then
[50:14.760 --> 50:20.360]  they all are building a Gen 21 compact subsystem districts that are openly known in the planned
[50:20.360 --> 50:26.720]  Opelis documents in all their statements as the governing corporate stakeholder zone.
[50:26.720 --> 50:32.280]  Those will be armored. Those will be lavished. The latest medical systems, the latest entertainment,
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.040]  unlimited power. Those areas are exempt from the rolling blackouts already globally going
[50:37.040 --> 50:41.760]  in. They turn our power off now on rolling blackouts in Austin to the point we have to
[50:41.760 --> 50:42.760]  have generators.
[50:42.760 --> 50:46.760]  They're talking about taxes on those, but the quote government district downtown and
[50:46.760 --> 50:53.000]  the key agenda 21 new high rises, they are exempt and they're exempt from the increased
[50:53.000 --> 51:01.840]  power prices. The city of Austin decides what you pay according to your needs. They decide
[51:01.840 --> 51:07.040]  food storage, check survival tools, check weapons and water filters, check. But what
[51:07.040 --> 51:11.640]  about a permanent source of cooking power that can run forever without buying fuel or

[54:16.880 --> 54:29.580]  Folks, I know I'm ranting. You should be ranting, too. You should be really upset,
[54:29.580 --> 54:35.820]  as well. I mean, this is all public. I mean, if you go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[54:35.820 --> 54:40.700]  in the featured news section, population control propaganda, we get very little opposition
[54:40.700 --> 54:46.920]  from the public because we are very gradual evolving the characters on the TV shows.
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.580]  This is going on all over the world. And it's got the quotes in there about how they're
[54:51.580 --> 54:57.200]  basically breaking up society and the family to save the earth from population and how
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.700]  it's all Paul Ehrlich's plan and how it's the UN plan. And this is at Yale. And there
[55:02.700 --> 55:08.820]  are literally thousands of these videos where they sit around and the Yale put this on its
[55:08.820 --> 55:12.720]  science section website. They're not hiding this, okay?
[55:12.720 --> 55:16.380]  Cuz they know the average person that watches TV, you tell them, hey, there's messages in
[55:16.380 --> 55:19.860]  there, there's messages in there. They're like, yeah, right, there's messages where
[55:19.860 --> 55:25.300]  we live in the Soviet Union. That's why you've got all the anti-gun messages, all the anti-founding
[55:25.300 --> 55:30.620]  father messages. I was last night up here working and I saw a clip of that Milwaukee
[55:30.620 --> 55:35.820]  sheriff on Piers Morgan, I guess on Monday, I'd missed it, or Tuesday.
[55:35.820 --> 55:41.900]  It'd been a few days ago and Piers Morgan was sitting there talking to him about, why
[55:41.900 --> 55:47.780]  aren't you for any background checks? Why don't you wanna close the loopholes? And the
[55:47.780 --> 55:53.060]  sheriff's like, because it doesn't work. Criminals are still gonna get guns. And that's the whole
[55:53.060 --> 55:56.960]  point. There's already background checks on law abiding citizens.
[55:56.960 --> 56:02.980]  But they're using that to come after us. And I've got gun purge news where that's happening
[56:02.980 --> 56:06.620]  of people with no criminal record, veterans and others, getting arrested and charged with
[56:06.620 --> 56:13.900]  felonies in New York before the law even went into effect. Checkpoints where it's a routine
[56:13.900 --> 56:21.940]  vehicle check. You have a 30 mag clip in a bag in your backseat and you're going to jail.
[56:21.940 --> 56:27.540]  That's to a veteran who's involved running a program raising money for other veterans.
[56:27.540 --> 56:31.020]  One big awards in the community and people are like, he's a veteran, he wins awards.
[56:31.020 --> 56:36.140]  Why is the sheriff's department, why is the grand jury throwing the book at him? You're
[56:36.140 --> 56:40.620]  the enemy. You're a robot that's now to be decommissioned. You've gone out and fought
[56:40.620 --> 56:44.580]  for the New World Order and shot up with the deadly vaccines and they're not killing you
[56:44.580 --> 56:45.580]  fast enough.
[56:45.580 --> 56:51.940]  The DU isn't killing you fast enough. You're supposed to come back here and die or go to
[56:51.940 --> 56:56.060]  prison. You're the number one enemy. You're what Homeland Security is targeting. I've
[56:56.060 --> 56:59.460]  got all these articles where vets are getting targeted. It's like it's weird, they're pulling
[56:59.460 --> 57:02.860]  vets over. The cops just say they're pulling me over for no reason.
[57:02.860 --> 57:07.660]  They've got your license plate scanned. You're in a database. It's telling them in many of
[57:07.660 --> 57:13.300]  these major cities to pull you over. See now it's not just warrants or priors with these
[57:13.300 --> 57:18.300]  scanners. It's now vet. That's a vet, pull him over. And they know when they're vets,
[57:18.300 --> 57:19.300]  they walk over.
[57:19.300 --> 57:26.900]  So you're a vet, got back from Iraq last year. Get out of the car. I'm gonna search it. Look,
[57:26.900 --> 57:31.380]  look, they're coming for everybody, okay? They're coming for us. They wanna start a
[57:31.380 --> 57:35.880]  civil war. They've got a purge going. I've got a stack of articles on that front. This
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.380]  is social engineering, where they hire cops now that'll follow orders and show they'll
[57:41.380 --> 57:42.380]  follow orders.
[57:42.380 --> 57:44.900]  And they put them on the street and a lot of them will do whatever they're told. You've
[57:44.900 --> 57:48.780]  either got departments run by good people that are saying, get guns, protect yourself.
[57:48.780 --> 57:52.700]  This is tyranny. You got 1,000 plus Green Berets signing a public letter saying they're
[57:52.700 --> 57:57.380]  gonna resist this and it's tyranny. You've got people showing whose side they're on.
[57:57.380 --> 58:01.340]  You're either gonna kneel to this or you're gonna resist it. And we better resist it in
[58:01.340 --> 58:09.340]  the Infowars right now. By the way, we go to infowarsstore.com. We are giving away 150,000
[58:09.340 --> 58:14.360]  bumper stickers free in groups of 50. Infowars.com bumper stickers, average sticker gets seen
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.820]  about 20,000 times a year they estimate, depending on where you live, 10 to 30,000.
[58:18.820 --> 58:23.900]  So I just say 20. Ladies and gentlemen, we're giving 150,000 away. How many tens of millions
[58:23.900 --> 58:30.100]  is that? They'll see it. Infowars.com stickers, save the Constitution. Infowarsstore.com,

[59:54.340 --> 01:00:06.020]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:13.060]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:24.660]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:34.780]  All right, Rosa Corey, firebrand, great research author. He's going to be joining us in the
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:39.780]  next segment. Give us an update on Gena 21, the latest info there. I haven't even gotten
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:45.860]  into all the news. I'll intersperse it in this hour and the next. Pastor Steven Anderson
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.740]  is going to be joining us in studio as well with a new film we're going to be talking
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.740]  about.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:56.540]  I haven't even gotten into all the other news yet. I mean, just look at this financial news.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.700]  It's just amazing. Another Harvard study finally getting attention out of the Huffington Post.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.580]  I thought it's a conspiracy theory, Huffington Post. Harvard study confirms fluoride reduced
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:14.980]  to children's IQ massively, reviewing more than 27 other studies by governments and major
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.620]  universities.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:21.620]  Reduces IQ, increases cancer. And of course, that's just sodium fluoride when they put
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:27.980]  in the hydrofluorosolic acid. Of course, Paul Ehrlich and the Lighthouse Science are John
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.240]  V. Holder, and I mean, they talked about that. It's an adjuvant to accelerate all the other
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.780]  soft kills. The bisphenol A's accelerates those, turbo charges them.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:44.300]  The aluminum dioxide they're spraying on us, all the other goody goods. And then of course,
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:50.140]  the globalist all religiously like the plague. On record, the Chinese elite, the US elite,
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:56.980]  you're appealing, they all literally obsess on purified water organics religiously. But
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:03.820]  they want you to have it, cuz they care about you and your family.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.220]  They're good people. Now, I started plugging this, but ten seconds does not have to plug
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:15.660]  it. If you go to infowarsstore.com, and you go to the bumper sticker area, you'll see
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:23.460]  it says free stickers. You can also buy them at cost, at cost, like 4.99 for 50 stickers.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:30.580]  But if you wanna get them totally free, no shipping, no money, 0, 0, 0, 0. Might be one-tenth
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:35.460]  of a cent the amount of computer energy you use, electricity, while you're on the website.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.180]  So I guess it may cost you about one-tenth of a penny. But that's your own money or electricity
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.900]  bill. I guess I lied, it's not totally free. But I'm not charging you anything. If you
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:47.260]  wanna start splitting hairs, how many angels can dance on the head of a possum?
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.860]  All of this type of stuff, how many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin? I've made
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.240]  that term famous now. You can go there and we've got, I don't know, like six or seven
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.940]  new bumper stickers that are also available for sale. But you can get these for free,
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:07.740]  50 of them. But you've got to copy the pledge and send it back to our email for our liability.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.600]  Cuz I already have homemade stickers where LA sends me a bill saying someone stuck a
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  homemade sticker up.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.520]  If somebody sticks an Obama sticker up in LA, do they send me $100 bill saying they'll
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.300]  arrest me? Of course, obviously, I'm not gonna pay it, it's made up. It's not even one of
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.800]  our stickers. Everybody gets to sell bumper stickers to put on people's cars. It's not
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:30.420]  my fault if somebody buys a can of Coca-Cola and goes and throws it at somebody.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:35.020]  Are we gonna blame the Coca-Cola company? I mean, again, that's an example of what we're
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:39.980]  talking about here. But you have to just be over the top, just wherever you want it sent,
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.660]  you just send the email back with the attached PDF, pledging to put it on your own property
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.740]  or to give it to others who wanna put it on their property.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.740]  And it's 50 stickers, that's easy to give out. It's a great conversation piece. It's
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.660]  all available at infoawastore.com. Now, I put it on YouTube last night, we can give
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:05.160]  out about 3,000 groups of 50. As of this morning, about 1,600 had already been given out. So
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.220]  by the time I plug this, everyone's gonna rush in there.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.980]  So that doesn't mean everybody's gonna get them free. We'll probably pull the offer by
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:18.140]  the end of the show. But youareindangerinfoawastore.com, that'll get people talking. It's a great conversation.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:26.100]  There are so many great new stickers. And again, we got 150,000 printed, another 30,000
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:32.860]  of the same stickers for sale at cost, at cost, at cost. You pay the shipping and 4.99
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.220]  or 4.95 for 50, and that is the cost.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.660]  I had them break it down. That is the cost. That is the cost. Bumper stickers at cost

[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:51.880]  and the money comes in, I'll start doing this every month. Cost is like $20,000, I think,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.900]  to get the stickers and ship them.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.940]  I think Weldon said 30,000, but the point is, it'll reach tens of millions conservatively.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.340]  It's part of Operation Paul Revere.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.600]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:12.300]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:17.460]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:20.180]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:42.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the first day of February, 2013, and we're going to
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:47.380]  be going to a very special guest, the author of Behind the Green Mask, U.N. Agenda 21,
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:56.020]  Rosa Corey, a book we sell at the mfowarstore.com online book video slash patriot bookstore.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:02.540]  Very important to get that book and get that out to county commissioners, sheriffs, police,
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:07.220]  city planners, cuz most people are following agenda 21. They just don't know because they're
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.660]  compartmentalized.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:16.660]  This is basically the red pill with a green cover. Okay, the green red pill. Now, before
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:23.260]  we go to her, this is the type of news that I have here in front of me. And this is all
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:28.540]  up at prisonplanet.com and mfowars.com. This is now every day. I've never seen the magnitude
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:34.340]  of huge invasions, practicing taking over government buildings, universities, facilities,
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:39.500]  public schools. They're now saying the army will respond to, quote, domestic terrorism.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.340]  And they're calling terrorism, quote, gun crime. The whole homeland security system
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.900]  officially to go after gun owners. This is a way to purge people. And speaking of that,
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:53.960]  also up at mfowars.com, and this is in the local news, decorated combat veteran arrested
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.540]  charged with five felonies for possession of an AR magazine.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:03.100]  Those are now illegal in New York State. And it turns out his family's just now speaking
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:09.340]  out, this happened before it was even officially implemented. They don't care. And it said
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:13.980]  a routine vehicle check. They have checkpoints all over New York now, folks. They now have
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:18.900]  them in Texas. They're gun checkpoints. They call them gang checkpoints, vehicle checkpoints.
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:23.960]  And they know you're a vet, it's in the computers, and they're going after you. And again, it's
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.740]  not every jurisdiction, but some of these jurisdictions have really evil police.
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.500]  They're now hunting the veterans, and that's on record. Department of Homeland Security
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.860]  targets gun collector. And the KRQE piece I wanna play later, they're like, well, they
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.140]  caught him by this. And then it goes on to say he hadn't done anything wrong, and then
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.500]  he's a firearms importer of decades.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:49.920]  And they claim a serial number might not have been properly on one rifle. And it's a local
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.540]  gun dealer. And they go, well, he might not have filled out all his forms right. And the
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.300]  news acts like he's the, and they have a neighbor woman. You gotta see the video at mfowars.com
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:04.780]  on the KRQE going, he's just so evil, I mean, my gosh, I saw the guns, I saw them bringing
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]  the guns out.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:12.780]  I hope something's done about him. I mean, just amazing. So we've got that, Newtown calls
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:20.740]  for armed school officers. Gun control officials set sights on ammunition and background checks
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:27.700]  now to take those guns. Teams shot at Atlanta school, but they had an armed police officer
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.020]  there, so it got stopped, so that's the answer.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:34.220]  Suspect suicide bombing kills two at US Embassy in Turkey. Well, that's really heating up
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:39.100]  over there. That's some of the news on that front we're gonna be getting into. DHS revamping
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:44.500]  immigrant welcome materials set to include Obamacare, how you don't just get your babies
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.720]  paid for now, free Obamacare.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:52.780]  But citizens have to buy the insurance, and the official IRS website says they may make
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:58.440]  families buy up to $20,000 a year as a new average within three years. This year, premiums
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:06.380]  are set to double from average of 5,000 to 10,000 per person. Within three years, 20,000
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:13.540]  per family, cuz it's mandated, written by the insurance companies, my gosh, unbelievable.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.940]  That's CNS news, Obamacare to soon cost average American family 20,000 a year, natural news
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:26.300]  story up at infowars.com by Mike Adams. Stocks jolted by jobs data, Dow briefly test 14,000,
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.940]  that's cuz of dollar devaluation, the real economy is going into free fall.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:39.380]  Excuse me, gas prices heading up again. Yep, now it's time for inflation, 8.5 million Americans
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:45.380]  left labor force in the last four years. 169,000 Americans drop out of labor force in January
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:49.540]  alone. Yeah, hey, listen, I was realizing I was about to hire some more crew members,
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.940]  but I just realized they're gonna force me to get Obamacare.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:57.180]  I don't know if I can keep who I've got. Anyways, all part of the agenda 21 shutting down the
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.840]  economy. You can have a coal power plant, but we're gonna bankrupt it. Again, this is
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.260]  the admitted program to bankrupt us because only the insiders are exempt from everything.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:14.680]  Now joining us is a lady that more and more, other than maybe myself or somebody like Glenn
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:21.540]  Beck is out there really exposing agenda 21, something I've been covering for 17 years.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.460]  And I'm proud of the fact that we forced this out in the open.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.660]  She wrote the best little book, cuz other books out there are like fiction and stuff
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:36.260]  about this, so really weird. Hers is nonfiction, it's only 168 pages long, great bibliography
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:42.500]  at the bottom of each page. Behind the green mask, you want agenda 21, all the information
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.260]  you need to understand what is happening in your town, why it's happening, who's behind
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.100]  it, and what you can do to stop it.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:53.720]  Awareness is the first step in resistance. She is a ASA forensic commercial real estate
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.100]  developer and appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation. Only 30 years of experience
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:02.860]  analyzing land use and property, now it's over 30 years, enabled her to recognize the
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:07.100]  planning revolution sweeping the nation while fighting to stop huge development project
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.100]  in her city.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.700]  She researched the corporate, political, and financial interests behind it and found Unigine21.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:20.100]  Rosa speaks across the nation and is a regular blogger on her website, DemocratsAgainstUnigine21.com.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:25.940]  Now again, we sell her book at InfowarsStore.com. My point here is, and we're gonna go to her
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:29.220]  and give her the floor for the first few segments, and I've got some questions and I wanna open
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.820]  the phones up for your questions.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:35.980]  We've gone every town around Austin, Austin's a command base of this, every town's being
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:40.980]  taken over by it. And what it means is, you can't build an office on your house you've
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:46.260]  owned for 30 years and got two acres. Your property taxes are gonna go up, your power
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.700]  prices are gonna double.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:53.460]  But the selective insiders who get waivers, their power bill gets cut. That's happening
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.180]  in Austin, that's happening in San Francisco. Government has the lowest rate. Next is groups
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.500]  that get certified by the local environmental council, but you can't get certified unless
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:08.520]  some payoffs get made. This is open criminal mafia, but they act like trendy liberals,
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]  so it's a cover.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.700]  But you go to their meetings, it's the Dallas Cowboys are there locally, retired ones, big
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.840]  bank heads, Republicans. That's why all the Republicans leadership's behind this, Mitt
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:26.360]  Romney, you name it. It is bipartisan, global screw job. Now, you can't cut a tree what
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.420]  ten inches around in Austin, even if it's an invasive cedar, they'll come and find you.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:35.860]  I know one guy got to find something like $50,000 in a week for cutting invasive cedars
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.140]  growing up under his fence at his wrecking yard.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:44.680]  So it's not even a plant from here, but they can cut down giant five foot around oaks if
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.820]  they wanna build something. So that's just the tip of the iceberg. I'll take you now
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.740]  to Rosa Corey joining us via phone cuz she's on the road. She's traveling the entire US,
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:16:00.180]  battling them. And she's been very, very effective because on many other issues, she's what you
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.660]  call a liberal.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:06.020]  But a real liberal, someone who's more like Thomas Jefferson, who wants everybody to have
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:12.140]  equality and freedom. The system that calls itself liberal, they are the globalist operatives
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:18.000]  using that as camouflage. And she joins us now, and we're gonna break in four minutes.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.100]  But roll through the basics of what it is, how they're adapting to our counter strike
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:27.520]  against them, and some of the biggest criminal actions they're engaged in right now, Rosa
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520]  Corey.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.860]  Hey, Alex. You know, what we're talking about here is the erection of a totalitarian state
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:41.020]  right in front of us. This is what globalization is. It's the standardization of all systems.
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:46.380]  And so you're seeing it in every possible element, every possible aspect of your life
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:53.060]  from healthcare to law enforcement to schools to land use, water use, restrictions. This
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:59.860]  is the way that corporations take over. This is the corporatocracy. So what do corporations
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:05.820]  want? They want low wage workers, global markets, standardized systems, and they want to destroy
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:11.140]  competition. And this is what we're getting here. This is artificial scarcity all over
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:17.740]  the world, whether you're in the UK or Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, EU,
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:24.580]  wherever you are, this is the globalization of all systems. And we're experiencing this
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:29.300]  now because we have a long way to fall in the United States in order to bring us to
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:35.220]  the same level as developing nations. So when you think about corporatocracy, it's about
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:41.140]  developing new markets. There's no loyalty to existing markets. So if we collapsed into
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:48.980]  poverty or slightly below the median for the entire world, that is of no concern to the
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:55.380]  huge corporations. What they're looking for is to bring up the very low third world
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:59.900]  nations so that they can buy their goods and work cheaply. This is what we're looking
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:06.420]  at. This is what we're dealing with here. This is a totalitarian state being erected
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:12.960]  because they need to control all system inventory and control. That's what this is about.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.020]  And the cover is it's for the earth. But I've been to the smart growth conferences as early
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:21.180]  as 97. In fact, we have some bombshell video that Mike Hanson has that he needs to upload
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:25.260]  to his YouTube channel, my camera guy at the time, where they were just admitting it's
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:29.860]  a takeover. They'd laugh when my camera was off and just go, of course, it's a takeover.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.940]  And I had some really mean Dallas cowboy guy. I forget his name. He's famous, big white
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.140]  guy with long, long gray hair. Just push me out of the way. Just like, yeah, you better
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.860]  get out of my way. I mean, they know what they're doing. Yes, they do know what they're
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.260]  doing. And that's, you know, this is really hard for people to believe. They think, well,
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:52.380]  you know, this can't be possible. How can this be going on, for instance, in the United
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:58.420]  States, the totalitarian, you know, dictatorship happening. But this is what it looks like.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.500]  People are not aware that this is what it looks like in your town. They're not going
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:08.660]  to call it agenda 21. They'll call it sustainable development. They'll call it regional plans.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:16.380]  You'll see it as water and land use restrictions, smart growth, wild lands project, common core
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:20.260]  in the schools, that standardization of your school. And they'll lie and say, we're going
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:24.300]  to give you park land. We're going to take this farmer's land is 5000 acres and not pay
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:28.020]  him anything. We're just going to take it. Then they turn around and build condos on
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:32.700]  it that that the mayor who takes it his buddy builds the houses. I mean, it's it's just
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.700]  unbelievable.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.380]  Yeah, this is about what they're doing is it's a completely unlevel playing field because
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:44.500]  they're using your taxes to subsidize low income development and high density transit
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.500]  oriented.
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:49.260]  So they can raise the general public's taxes even more. That's what Bloomberg says. Let's
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:52.580]  talk about that. You're going to live in a 250 square foot San Francisco is doing it
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:57.980]  to apartment. They're going to raise your taxes in an actuary to force you into that.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.900]  We'll be right back with the incredible social engineering.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:06.980]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common. The older
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:11.260]  one gets the progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally. The
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:15.580]  older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:21.180]  to nutrition. If the Hanselman can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:25.700]  in North America to experience a more youthful life as well. One key ingredient to warding
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:30.580]  off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed all protein
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.740]  foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damage, destroying 50 to 75% of your
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:41.140]  ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids. One world way is not heat damage and
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:47.400]  allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids. This feat no one else has achieved.

[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:04.940]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.940]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:14.780]  of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:19.140]  line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.260]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.700]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.920]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.500]  power. A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel. Hi,
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.340]  this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:49.620]  purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today. It's critical that the
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:56.960]  public be made aware of the system. Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:03.820]  1-800-686-2237. Hey there. Frank Bates here. Have you heard
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:09.540]  about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans? This is really scary
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.740]  stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:19.420]  known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:24.100]  op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat. I can't believe
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.460]  that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because the liberals and the government
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:34.560]  are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.660]  that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:45.620]  video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.620]  one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:24:05.900]  video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever. Again, that's
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:24.660]  all
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:30.760]  All right, Rosa Corey is one of these guests where I just find it so hard to shut up because
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.120]  everything she's saying is true.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.240]  Everything she talks about gives me flashbacks of 16 years, 17 on air.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.560]  But listeners were like, have you seen these UN documents?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.320]  Have you seen the Rio meeting four or five years ago?
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:53.600]  This is in 1996 or so, 1997, cuz they just had the Rio meeting in 1992.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.680]  And so I've been on this forever, and then I know how criminal it is.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.280]  I'm not up here with rhetoric, okay, calling them criminals.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:07.840]  It's diabolical mafia takeover through zoning, through government, all selectively enforced.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.320]  Let's go back now to Rosa Corey.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.760]  Rosa, we were getting into these new compact coffin apartments.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:18.200]  Continue, this is a short segment breaking down what we're facing.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.160]  Great, well, this stuff sounds great.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.160]  If it didn't sound so good, we wouldn't be falling for it.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.960]  I mean, who doesn't want walkable, bikeable transit neighborhoods, you know?
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:33.280]  Sounds so great, but smart growth is the hardscape for your future poverty.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.440]  It is for a failed economy and a loss of private property that they're designing these small
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.960]  apartments stacked in the center of your town so that you supposedly don't need a vehicle.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:49.320]  But the fact is that you will only be able to go where that train line that may or may
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.520]  not exist goes.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:58.760]  But the idea is that you will be restricted to city centers, mega-regions, mega-cities,
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.440]  and you will not be able to get out into the rural and suburban areas.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:09.320]  This plan is about bringing people out of rural and suburban areas into city centers
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.200]  where they can be more easily controlled, monitored, and surveilled.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.400]  That is what this is about, more eyes on the street.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.320]  Community-oriented policing is Department of Justice.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.240]  This is about creating more crime, calling it community crime, and then being able to
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.600]  jail more people.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.760]  Those prisons are public-private partnership.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:36.200]  So this is what we're looking at, is a combination of non-profits, corporations, and government.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.240]  This is how government has taken over.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:44.400]  And again, right here where I live in Austin, they now have TSA checkpoints downtown and
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.160]  at the train, and they admit, you're not going to have the money to have a car.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.320]  You're going to be on a bike or in these compact cities, and guess what they're doing out in
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.840]  Elgin and other areas?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.840]  They're going to use federal taxpayer money to build 10-story high-rises in the country,
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.200]  make everybody move into them, and they say they'll then be a factory off the back like
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]  China.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.840]  Yes, it's the Chinese model.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.200]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.480]  With the suicide nets, I guess.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:15.080]  And you know, the Walton Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation,
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.440]  many huge foundations are funding non-profits that then pressure your government and partner
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.280]  with corporations to make this happen.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.080]  This is what it's about, but we have power.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.640]  The people have power, and we can stop it, but we need to work together.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.400]  And by the way, for those that don't know, the globalist Al Bragg, China is the model,
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.760]  and it's an anti-human system, not meant to build up a civilization, meant to destroy
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.600]  it, to reduce population.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:46.280]  It's not that, oh, there's horrible labor in China before they get built up, like our
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:51.600]  industrial revolution 150 years ago, the globalist didn't get to fully take over.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.600]  The robber barons got beaten back in the 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.800]  This is their massive counter-strike.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800]  This is their move.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.800]  Mm-hmm, that's right.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:04.560]  You know, this is, if you look at who the large corporations are behind this, some of
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.280]  them, like Siemens and IBM, are a continuation of the Nazi plan.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.680]  This is exactly what we're looking at, control, management of information, and restriction
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:22.240]  on your use of land, water, and minerals, and every aspect of human life is going to
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.720]  be controlled, and it is in the process right now.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.440]  And by the way, they talk about once all the robotics is fully in and they have robots
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.320]  fixing the robots, which they're almost done with, a bunch of big tech companies see the
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.420]  ads on CNN bragging, soon robots will fix the robots that fix the robots.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.360]  They won't put suicide nets up anymore.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.600]  They'll tell you, go right on up and jump off.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.660]  We have so little value.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:50.720]  And the pig demon, Al Gore, the fake liberal, he's the guy on the board of Apple who's made
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.920]  sure they don't pay people a living wage in China.
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.480]  I mean, what a monster.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.480]  Mm-hmm.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.600]  Yeah, you know, if you take a look at what the largest job growth, what the largest industry
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.080]  growth is over the next 20 years projected, it's retinal scanning and imaging machines,
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:12.200]  secure data storage, satellite imaging, and of course, social networking, so none of your
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.520]  information is private.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520]  It's just incredible.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.860]  And I think about the Foxconn workers for Apple and just the devastating things they've
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.860]  gone through.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:27.400]  I've got an image up for TV viewers of these innocent young people, I mean, total slaves,
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.360]  absolute total slaves, and look how skinny they are, but it shows how powerful humans
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.360]  are.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.800]  They're pretty darn healthy despite the horrible, and they still have their human dignity.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.240]  They have pretty makeup on and stuff, the girls do, but they live in these facilities.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.560]  They have forced abortions inside.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560]  That's on record.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.440]  They do a scan every month.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.280]  These people, these poor people, pray for them, folks.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.960]  We'll be right back with Rosa Corey.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.240]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.640]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:30:01.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.440]  Coming back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.440]  through the year.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.160]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.320]  family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.320]  lost everything.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.600]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.760]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:27.200]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:31.200]  stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200]  sister and my niece.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.440]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.080]  Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:16.400]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:23.200]  convincing and that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.800]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.940]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.120]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:54.000]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.040]  scourge that is vaccines.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:01.320]  These titles and a lot more are all available at Infowarshop.com.

[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.800]  ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosolicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.320]  covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:11.600]  You've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:21.720]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:31.920]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go back to Rosa Corey here in just a moment.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.560]  I'm going to give the number out if you've got questions or comments for her, she'll
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.160]  be with us till about five after next hour, then we've got our next guest in studio.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:50.120]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, first time callers on this Friday.
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.920]  Your questions or your statements on agenda 21.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.240]  And this is global governance, it's all under UNESCO.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:02.480]  That's why it's global standardized training on every front, on every issue, social, cultural,
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.640]  religious, economic, it's so diabolical.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.440]  Now again, the book behind the green mask, UN agenda 21 is available, the lowest price
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:16.000]  you're going to find anywhere matching her price at Infowarsstore.com and your purchase
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.560]  supports our work.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:23.560]  You ought to buy these by the cases and give them to city planners and others to identify
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.440]  if they're a conscious operative or a lot of them read it and wake up and resist and
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.760]  Rosa can talk about that.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:36.520]  So the good news is, this is so diabolical and so on record that if we just expose them
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.280]  and resist them, we're beating them all over the place and that's why they are screaming
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280]  bloody murder.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.760]  A year ago they said this didn't exist, now they're going, of course it exists, it's good
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.440]  and you people are stopping us, we're gonna be talking about that in a moment.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:55.240]  Now the new issue, the February issue of Infowars magazine is out, the hard copy, 60 page big
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:35:02.680]  color glossy with an image of the 50 states forming a gun, why the tyrants want your guns.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.280]  And this is guaranteed to sell out, sometimes the magazine sells out in four or five days.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.720]  We put 70,000 on the streets in Texas and sell 30,000, we hold back some.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.080]  You can either buy them in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost or get a one year
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.040]  subscription.
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:24.920]  And when you get the one year subscription while supplies last, we are also able to then
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.240]  generally put in the last issue, a few that we hold back.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.320]  So you can subscribe at infowarsstore.com or you can buy them in bulk while supplies
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:45.880]  last at infowarsstore.com or you can call toll free 888-253-3139, again that's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:50.880]  An amazing magazine, people are blown away by it and it's a pamphlet, it's a 60 page
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:58.480]  color pamphlet that you can buy at cost to give to people to wake them up, it is an info
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480]  war.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:09.240]  And finally, four years ago, we sold the Obama Joker socialism shirt.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.160]  Really it's fascism, so we had both variants, but we only sold it for about a year and then
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.960]  I said I'm never gonna sell it again, we may sell a different design later.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:23.120]  Our great graphics designer Janee Meadows, she put together the Obama Tyrant shirt that
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:26.080]  I'm holding here in my hands.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.000]  And it is Obama the Joker and it says Tyrant, infowars.com.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.440]  When people then ask you what it's about, it's a great conversation piece to wake them
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.440]  up.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:40.800]  And on the back, we've taken our most popular t-shirt ever and put that on the back, infowars.com.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.500]  An AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed on the back and the
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.520]  words come and take it.
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.320]  So I think this is gonna end up being the best t-shirt most popular ever and that's
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.800]  how we fund our news operation and everything here and fight these globalists.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:00.200]  Now, before I go back to Rosa, I wanna say this about guns.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.120]  The NRA, I saw a statement they put out yesterday and in the past they were like, yeah, we think
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.980]  there should be background checks for everybody.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.400]  Get rid of private sales even to your neighbor of a gun.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.640]  And they were asked, why have you changed and said you're not against private sales
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.640]  now?
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.320]  Because the system doesn't work, criminals will still have guns.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.200]  Well, let me take that one further and then we're gonna go to our guest.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.880]  Let me take that one further.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.400]  We don't trust the system.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.760]  Yeah, it sounds reasonable to have a mental background check and a bunch of background
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.320]  checks to get a gun.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.280]  And if angels were running things, the good angels, then I would be for it.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:39.380]  The globalists have taken the guns everywhere in the world while they arm against us, they
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.640]  are taking our guns.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.240]  Australia took all the semi-autos, now they're taking the bolt action.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.920]  It's happened everywhere.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.480]  These globalists are on record saying they're going to have the abolition of our guns.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.100]  The UN is on record while they engage in atrocities worldwide.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:55.100]  It's the same thing.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.400]  I like bike lanes.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:04.040]  I like a city ordinance saying you get a tax discount if you put a garden on your roof.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.520]  I like things like that.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:12.120]  The problem is they take all this good stuff and make it global and selectively enforce
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.120]  it.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:16.080]  And that's just the window dressing for all the bad stuff that goes on.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.920]  I wanna give her the floor for about ten minutes before we go to calls.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.960]  I'll have to stick a sock in my mouth cuz information is so important because I know
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]  it's real.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:23.960]  I know it's a criminal takeover.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:29.760]  It's like if I saw a guy robbing my neighbors, I'd be like going, hey, Bob, somebody's in
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.600]  your garage.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.280]  But this is our liberty, our freedom, our economy.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.520]  They wanna wreck it.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.040]  They're on record wanting to wreck it.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.640]  And it's not that environmental stuff isn't reasonable.
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.880]  That's the sugar coating on the cyanide pill to make it taste good.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:48.840]  You can give somebody Kool-Aid, Jim Jones, but it had cyanide in it.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.100]  Tastes like grape Kool-Aid gonna kill you better than a hammer.
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.680]  Tastes real good like antifreeze.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:53.680]  It tastes good.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.840]  It'll kill you.
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.360]  And that's what's frustrating is that they all wanna sound reasonable and they want us
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.000]  to sit back and be nice and debate with them in a false paradigm.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  No, it's time to get aggressive to shake people out of their trance.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.920]  That's why they're now admitting Piers Morgan was a defeat when I blew up.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.080]  For him, they're now admitting, this is the way to get.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.400]  Being aggressive does work.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.560]  Of course it works.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.140]  They're aggressive.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.320]  Get aggressive or get overrun.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.720]  Now, Rosa, I'm gonna shut up for ten minutes, then we're gonna take a few calls for you.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:28.880]  But break down, again, the latest on what they're doing, our victories, how we beat
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.200]  them, where you see this going.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  Rosa Corey.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.280]  Well, you know, first of all, I wanna make sure that people know this is the hijacking
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.560]  of the environmental movement.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.920]  That's why I called my book Behind the Green Mask, because if it didn't look good
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.920]  and sound good, then we wouldn't be going for it.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:49.440]  So there is a political and social ideology that goes, you know, that's sort of overarching
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.280]  on this, and it's communitarianism.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:55.360]  And Dan Jones just called Obama a communitarian.
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.040]  He said that we've gone way too far in the individualistic direction, and we have to
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.240]  pull it back to rebalance towards communitarianism.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:12.160]  And what that means is that your individual rights are balanced with the so-called community,
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.600]  and the community can change at any time.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:22.120]  What this is about is about taking away your right to privacy, to your freedom, to live
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:27.280]  where you wish, to move freely, and to instate instead the power of the community.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:33.600]  So this is why it's about consensus and the Delphi technique, where you get invited
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:38.880]  to give your opinion on a new plan in the center of your town, but if you don't agree
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.000]  with what the direction of that plan is, what the goal is, then you're considered to be
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.840]  fringe, and you are ignored.
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.320]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.840]  It's about artificial consensus and giving the illusion of community buy-in.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:58.680]  So that's why I say awareness is the first step in the resistance, because people need
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.800]  to educate themselves about what this looks like in their town, because you're going
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.040]  to see it called many different things.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:11.760]  Your smart meters, you might see it as the international codes, you'll see it as whatever
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.320]  that plan is called, Vision 2025, or One Valley, One Vision, or whatever they're calling
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  it in your town.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:27.120]  It's the same plan all across the world, and Agenda 21 is the action plan to inventory
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:35.920]  and control all land, water, minerals, plants, animals, means of construction, education,
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:40.680]  energy, and information, and human beings in the world.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.720]  That's what this plan is about.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.240]  Now, we have a chance to fight this.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.680]  I believe that 2013 is the year of critical awareness all over the world, and we are really
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.680]  breaking through.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:58.200]  This is the year where people are understanding that this is a global, regional neighborhood
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]  plan.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.640]  It's global, designed to look like it's coming up from the grassroots, and it is not.
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.280]  So it's up to us.
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.360]  There's no heroes, nobody on the sidelines here.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:12.480]  You know, we've got to get out there and expose these public-private partnerships in
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:14.800]  our local communities and our towns.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.520]  We want to educate our local officials and let them know that we will support them if
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.720]  they refuse to take federal grants for partnership for sustainable community grants.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:30.480]  We will support them, but if they don't, if they don't listen to us, we will take
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.720]  them out.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:34.000]  We need to recognize that we have power.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.800]  So what we're doing is we are getting active in the resistance.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.000]  We're understanding that you don't wait until it gets violent.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.600]  You want to call a halt to it while you can.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.320]  So you want to stop redevelopment projects.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:53.580]  This is so-called urban renewal, which actually directs you into city centers.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:57.720]  You want to stop them from pulverizing your rural roads to gravel.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.600]  You want to get out there and protect those farmers that are out there being restricted
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.160]  and regulated to death.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.920]  They're putting monitoring on wells, private wells.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.000]  What is happening with your government is that you are looking at treason.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.800]  Treason is happening in every town all across the world.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.720]  There are people who think that they're doing the right thing.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:26.040]  It's up to us as the informed electorate to let our elected officials know that they
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:32.280]  are committing treason, and treason has no statute of limitations.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.960]  There is no statute of limitations, so these people will be held to account.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.640]  And this is our job.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.360]  There are way more of us than there are of them.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:48.040]  And we need to expose collaborators, speak out, anti-Delphi these meetings, and work
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:53.800]  together to break that left-right paradigm, because that terrifies those who are in power.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.800]  And we can do it.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.280]  We are doing it all over the world.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.760]  I'll actually be in Texas in March.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.640]  I'm traveling all across the country speaking out, and people are joining me.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.920]  This is tremendous.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:09.580]  We are really getting movement across the world.
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:13.560]  And by the way, the globalists operate like we don't read their own websites and white
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.560]  papers.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.560]  Talk about their panic button.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.400]  They're not just freaking out in the Washington Post, New York Times, admitting we're fighting
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.400]  them globally.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:25.040]  They are panicking in their own white papers right now.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.040]  What's hurting them the worst?
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.360]  I mean, I guess just exposure, people go to the meetings, no one's allowed to even talk.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.920]  They just tell you what to believe, or even if you do, they then certify it.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:38.120]  I mean, people understand what's happening here.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:44.280]  Well, you know, we have a series of videos online called Near Riot at Delphi meetings,
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.960]  which are really great.
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.760]  And the thing is that people now are beginning to recognize what it looks like, because they've
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:56.120]  been told, you know, these controlled opposition people will tell you not to talk about Agenda
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  21.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:01.640]  And, you know, you're being directed by people who are infiltrating your...
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640]  Exactly.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:07.680]  They'll say it's discrediting to talk about Agenda 21 and the UN biological diversity
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.680]  assessments.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.260]  It's just, don't do that.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:12.120]  That is how they're controlling people.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.240]  Yeah, that's what controlled opposition looks like.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:20.640]  So you need to show up and occupy those government meetings and talk about Agenda 21 sustainable
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:21.640]  development.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.960]  Let them know that you know what it is.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:29.600]  Those three pillars of Agenda 21 are economy, ecology, and social equity.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.240]  And when you see that together, you want to break that down, and you want to advise your
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.160]  elected officials that you are going to take them out if they don't drop this out.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:47.400]  You've got to remove yourself from this, what it is, is money coming from the federal government
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.160]  that is funding these plants.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.800]  And then that money is coming from corporations and nonprofits.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.760]  So what you want to do is break that cycle and refuse to participate.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.760]  You want to be the resistance.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:45:59.760]  That's right.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:00.760]  That's right.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.220]  All the big mega corporations, they put tiny seed money in to get the politicians.
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:08.520]  They conduit federal HUD money and others just like Acorn, but in a hundred other groups
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:14.840]  plus back to them to then let them take over the local government, take over the infrastructure,
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:20.640]  and then have their buildings subsidized and go tax-free while not letting you fix your
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:21.640]  roof.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.640]  You know, that's right.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:26.960]  And it's not only, hey, it's not only in land use, we're talking about education with a
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:33.120]  common core standards where teachers no longer can teach, where students are being restricted.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.720]  I'm sure, Alex, you know about those little kids, the 60-year-olds who got suspended from
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:40.640]  school for using their fingers like guns and saying, dang, dang.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.800]  It's total Soviet mind control.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.800]  Right.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.840]  So what we're talking about is actually social engineering and restricting human beings so
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.080]  that they literally don't know what is right and what is wrong.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:55.160]  And this is how you break down a society.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.160]  We want to talk about a hostile takeover.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.760]  That's what this is.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:04.200]  The authoritarians, I've read countless books, Bernays and others, they say we tell them
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.260]  ridiculous things are bad.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.600]  We tell them common sense things are bad.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.000]  We tell them good things are bad so they feel guilty and off balance and will do whatever
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.040]  we say.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.640]  They're giving them a guilt complex.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.840]  And again, the teachers don't know.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.360]  They're just given the programming, the handbooks, it is meant to prepare children to believe
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.360]  they're criminals.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.680]  It is pure evil.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.680]  That's right.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.640]  We need to refuse to participate.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:37.600]  Refuse to give your personal information, refuse to collaborate, refuse to pay nonprofits,
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.420]  refuse to give donations and refuse to volunteer.
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.580]  If you're a teacher, refuse.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.200]  We need to do this together.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.440]  There are so many of us who are becoming aware.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:52.040]  We need to stand tall, stand together and refuse this indoctrination that we're getting.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.040]  How freaked out is the enemy right now?
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.720]  They are so freaked out.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.720]  It's incredible.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.840]  They were thinking they were going to pull this off and be able to, they're in the end
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.840]  game.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:02.840]  But you know what?
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.240]  We are giving them a run for their money and we will prevail because this is not going
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.240]  to fly.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.200]  People are not willing to allow their entire culture to be destroyed in order to be moved
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:16.160]  into these mega units and centers of cities.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.560]  You know, your town, whatever your little town is, that is a collector feeder town and
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.240]  that will be closed down and you'll be moved into the huge city.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.600]  Take a look at mega regions on our website.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.280]  This is a project.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.840]  Oh, they've openly announced it.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:34.880]  I'm in this particular mega region and they admit that you're not going to live in these
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.420]  little towns unless you have special permits.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:41.280]  It's all under the original UN maps where half the country's off limits.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.600]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.720]  It's true, but you know what?
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.320]  We do have them on the run.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:50.240]  When you start seeing this, you know, they're vilifying me in the press.
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.640]  That's when I know I'm winning.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.160]  When they're actually out there talking about this and they're saying, oh, that agenda 21,
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.160]  that's a good thing.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:01.920]  When they wouldn't even admit that it existed for 20 years, you know, then you know you're
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.920]  winning.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.920]  We are out there.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.760]  We are bringing up the troops and nobody is going to be left behind.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.980]  Nobody on the sidelines, no heroes.
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:10.980]  We all work together.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.980]  That's another reason.
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:12.980]  You know what?
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.680]  My book is a great opportunity for you to get up to speed on this quickly and we've
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.520]  got 20 pages in the back on what you can do.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.560]  So you want to educate yourself and others as quickly as you can.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.560]  Absolutely.
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.260]  I want to come back and take two short segments of calls and we have a pastor, Steven Anderson
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:34.600]  in here talking about the police state in a new film and a lot more, but Rosa Corry
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.680]  is our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask, available at Infowarsstore.com or by calling
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.680]  888-253-3139.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.280]  We're about to go to break in about a minute.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.840]  Any other key points you want to relay to people right now?
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.840]  Yeah.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.720]  You know, this plan is predicated on sharing information.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:53.580]  That's part of agenda 21.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.600]  It's all about sharing our info through technology.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.080]  This is a technocracy.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.080]  It is.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.880]  So every part of your life is being shared.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.720]  You have no personal privacy.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:06.360]  You need to break that paradigm and refuse to cooperate.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.200]  That's why they want you in the mega-opolises with the face-scanning cameras, the controls
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:15.960]  where they can turn the taxes up to bankrupt anybody they want and literally render you
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.320]  down to people living in jail cells.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320]  That's their plan.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:23.160]  Turn the cities into giant, medium security prison grids.
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.560]  I mean, it's while the elite live in the country and are exempt flying there by jet copter.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:36.680]  This is about controlling populations, restricting ability to move freely and to speak out.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.980]  But they're going to have model, and Austin is it, model megacities where the elite lives
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:43.840]  that are quasi-exempt.
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  It's so incredible.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.160]  I mean, these people, it's a science fiction movie, folks.
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:49.240]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.600]  You've got to read her book.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.640]  You've got to see my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.220]  This is a stated on-the-record program.
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.200]  These are criminal authoritarians.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.740]  You've got to realize they are your mortal enemies.
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:06.380]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:15.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.360]  you to have.
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.360]  It's true.
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:22.040]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:33.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:37.580]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:42.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:46.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.500]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:51.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:52.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:59.240]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.480]  Lunch is ready.
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.840]  And it's an MRE Smorgasbord at longlifefood.com.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:11.600]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.280]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.320]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.200]  Because MREs are all we do.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.240]  Tasty varieties of chicken, beef, salmon, and pasta entrees, plus sandwiches and our
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.640]  easy-to-use pouches.

[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.800]  food to your real future.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.720]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.720]  Box.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.640]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:13.460]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:17.800]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:23.360]  Now 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:28.420]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:33.560]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:34.720]  normal cell.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.480]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.480]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:50.400]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:57.760]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:01.280]  Protect your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:12.200]  I read part of the Telecommunications Act in 96 and it said by October 1st, 2001, all
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:17.400]  cell phones had to have a trackership in them to track you via satellite triangulation via
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.040]  the cell towers and that the government would be able to dial in and listen to your phone
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.040]  even when it's off.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:28.280]  It was all there and that they would start sending you messages onto your phone and it
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.800]  described text messages and others, it described smartphones, they're like 30 years ahead of
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:33.800]  us.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:39.520]  Here's Fox News, text on missing kids startle cell users and this is out of Los Angeles.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.320]  They first tested on the East Coast, now the West Coast, now it's happening in Austin,
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:45.000]  my crew are getting these.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.680]  And they say now it's gonna be presidential announcements, your smartphone will break
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:50.720]  in and it'll be Obama.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:56.880]  I mean, people of Earth, we are the Glaxian Empire, I mean, it's total control.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.400]  The police are being trained to set up checkpoints to take your guns, it's already happening
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.480]  to veterans in New York, checkpoints.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.600]  They just randomly pull you over a checkpoint, search your car, 30 round mag, five felonies.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.960]  I mean, they're coming, this is how they're gonna purge us.
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:13.340]  And you're like, well, I'll just turn my guns in, they're still coming.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:20.360]  These are authoritarians, we're in so much trouble, I just can't believe it's actually
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:21.800]  happening.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:26.080]  And there are a lot of people that want power, here it is, FEMA implements special chip and
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.920]  cell phones to send out alerts.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.080]  I've told people about this 16 years ago, and they looked at me like I was a space alien.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:36.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're running army checkpoints all over the country, they're
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:41.640]  having hardcore army drills everywhere and saying the army's gonna respond to extremists
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.000]  now in America.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.720]  They're getting ready for the organized collapse where they'll pose as the saviors and try
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:50.280]  to then bring us under their control.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.240]  That's part of the plan, is a stepped process of collapses.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.640]  Rosa Corey, we're gonna take a few calls, but your comment on what I just covered.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:03.300]  Well, it goes worse than that because there's something called mandatory volunteering.
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:06.840]  And if you haven't caught on to that, it's basically slavery.
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:12.400]  This is the trend where you're going to be expected to do your mandatory volunteering
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.480]  if you wanna get anything from the so-called community.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.400]  So we're talking about restrictions on every aspect of your life.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.840]  It's not enough to pay 70% on average if you actually work for the government one way or
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.840]  another.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.960]  Well, Rahm Emanuel said you're gonna serve at least two months every year, up to age
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  65.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:29.960]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:32.960]  Lifelong learning and participation in your community.
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:33.960]  Which means brainwashing.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:34.960]  Giving back.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  Giving back.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:36.960]  That's it.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:37.960]  Yeah, we're not doing enough.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:40.280]  We're not doing enough.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:46.360]  Let's go ahead and take a call from a listener who's listening on KKGM up in Dallas-Fort
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.360]  Worth, 1630.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.080]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.080]  Go.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.080]  Hi.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:55.560]  There is two ladies that recently got arrested for their smart meters.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.560]  I wanna know, Rosa, did you hear anything about that?
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.960]  Cuz I have a similar story.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.960]  Yeah, sure.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:07.880]  That's in Naperville, and a very good friend of mine, Thelma Tarmena in Houston, actually
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:11.520]  held a gun on the guy who was gonna put one on her house.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.280]  So people are resisting and fighting smart meters.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:19.960]  Smart meters are, of course, part of United Nations Agenda 21.
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:25.040]  And for those that don't know, they admit that, and all the new appliances, and the
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.760]  CIA director admitted, Petraeus said, we're spying on you through your, quote, washing
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  machine.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.720]  And all the new ones, it dials in and monitors you.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.680]  I mean, they're putting a giant eavesdropper on your house.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:36.680]  Check this out, Alex.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:40.000]  I don't know if you knew this, but you know how they crushed the old cars?
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.160]  Well, they're going into, you know, like Goodwills and stuff and buying up old appliances and
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.520]  crushing those so that you can't get, you won't be able to get an old appliance that
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:51.000]  doesn't have a chip in it.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.520]  They know what they're doing, boy.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:53.520]  Mm-hm.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.520]  That's what the design is, so.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.160]  Think of the diabolical evil, folks.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:59.880]  I mean, this is a nightmare.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.640]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.240]  We are going to win this.
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.240]  We need to work together.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.240]  I agree.
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:06.240]  Let's get the information out to people.
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:07.240]  I agree.
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:09.640]  Ryan, what happened to you real fast?
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:10.640]  I had a sign.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.880]  I listened to the lady from Democrats versus Agenda 21, the lady that you have on.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.600]  Anyways, I put a sign on.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:21.560]  I wrote a bunch of letters to the proper officials.
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:25.640]  I even put a lock onto the smart meter.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:30.240]  They came through trespass, you know, with the sign said exclusively that you're allowed
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.920]  on my property, but not to switch out the meter.
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:36.520]  They ripped the sign down, took off the log, put in the smart meter.
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.200]  I called the lady, actually talked to the PR people.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:40.200]  Stay there.
[01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:41.200]  Stay there.

[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:11.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:12.280]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.400]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:18.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:22.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.280]  Oh, man, I want to go to more of your calls.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.280]  We're almost out of time.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:29.800]  We've got a powerful in-studio guest as well.
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:30.800]  But she's coming to Texas.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:33.600]  We'll get her in here for two hours at that time.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.320]  Rosa Corey is our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.760]  Ryan in Texas, yeah, no, it's illegal for them to come across your property and do this.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.360]  They could just turn your power off, I guess.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.760]  Then you've got to argue with them on that.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.440]  That's why they have laws trying to block real solar power you control, they want it
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.440]  in their grid.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.040]  And that's really the answer here, is to get out of the system.
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:58.560]  Real sustainability, their sustainability is the opposite of sustainability, it's slavery.
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.880]  But what happened when you said you violated my rights?
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.440]  They said, well, by law, that we can come in and do whatever we want, that's our property.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.120]  And I said, well, you know what, I want your property removed.
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:15.400]  And I'm gonna take it out, and I'm gonna go on eBay and buy myself a little analog meter
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.400]  and replace it.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.880]  And they say, well, if you even touch it, that's tampering and we'll have you arrested.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:21.200]  And I go, well, I want it out.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.240]  And they go, the only option is for you to go solar.
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:30.360]  And anybody that refuses to have the smart meter installed in the beginning quarter of
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.800]  this year, they're just gonna start turning people's powers off.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.160]  You know what, I say go dark, and then they're gonna send the health department saying you're
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:43.880]  unsanitary and stuff, and say, hey, get a civil rights lawsuit, and then bring out that
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.800]  they're dialing into everything you're doing, watching and listening to you, including jacking
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.800]  your computers.
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.920]  This is on record, folks, in the Google Patents and dialing into your camera and microphone.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:54.920]  God bless you, sir.
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:56.480]  Let's go get a quick comment from Rosa Corey.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.920]  Yeah, this is what the smart grid is about, is about controlling everything that is related
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.920]  to technology.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.960]  So your internet, your phone, your electricity, everything.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.520]  And also, it's about, as you said, Alex, it's about identifying people who are dissenters
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:14.640]  and then shutting off their power.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:19.640]  It's about being able to control, but you do need to resist, I agree, go dark, and then
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.640]  fight them.
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:23.920]  We need to do this as a nation, stop it, refuse to collaborate.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:27.440]  It's time to get back to that anyways, get the candles out, go dark.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.520]  Yeah, I lived like that for a long time in Mexico, it's great.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.520]  It's like camping.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.760]  I mean, go dark, folks, go dark.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:37.640]  We either fight, and it's only gonna get worse, okay?
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.000]  This is a scientific, in their words, technocracy.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.640]  They think they've got it all planned out, and they're counting on you to be lazy.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.200]  God bless you, sir.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.000]  Go dark, sue them, fight them.
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.400]  This is the new civil rights movement.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.240]  While they're busy saying, if you don't wanna turn your guns in, you're a cracker, and that's
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:56.500]  on MSNBC, Total Racism, to create racial division.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.000]  The real discrimination's going on against all of us by the globalist.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.400]  Mike in New Hampshire, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.920]  Hey, how are you, Alex?
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:05.920]  Good, sir.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.920]  How you doing?
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.920]  I got a quick question for you.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:09.920]  Geez.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.160]  You're almost out of time.
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:14.160]  Almost out of time.
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:15.160]  Yep, yep, yep.
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.240]  You know, I'm 36 years old, and I have three children up here, I'm very invested in what's
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.240]  going on.
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.440]  I would like some sort of brochure that I would commit to knock on every door in my
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.920]  town here in Epping, New Hampshire, and telling them about Agenda 21, which I find-
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.120]  Okay, look, let me tell you, we have those flyers for you on our website.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:42.480]  Democrats against UNAgenda21.com, those flyers are called What's Wrong with Sustainable Development,
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.240]  and Why Is Everyone Talking About Agenda 21?
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.800]  Make those flyers, you can make 100 flyers for six bucks, walk them around, get that
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:50.520]  info out to everyone.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.280]  Absolutely, it's time to hit them and hit them hard.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.620]  And you said you've got children, that's what this is about.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:00.560]  This is the Chinese communist slave model with a tiny elite on top that are free market
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.560]  and get the money.
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:07.880]  The globalist, the CFR admits, the deal they made with the Chinese communist is the plan
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:08.880]  here.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:09.880]  They've done this in China.
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  Rosa?
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  Yeah, and that's it.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]  This is what we're fighting.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.920]  One great thing is that this year, I am being invited to speak to governors, to Congress
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.280]  people, to senators, all across the country.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:26.200]  So people are getting through to their elected officials, we want to draw this down, we want
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:27.200]  to block it.
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:29.680]  This is an ideology and we will stop it.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:33.920]  Three people never submit to this kind of tyranny.
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.920]  No they don't.
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.200]  Rosa Corey, we're going to talk to you again soon.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200]  Callers, I'll get to you.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.320]  I get to talk to Pastor Williams, we can talk agenda 21.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:44.060]  The book behind the green mask, UN agenda 21, Rosa Corey available at infoawars.com
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.060]  right now.
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:49.520]  But go to her site, print off the flyers in your printer and get them out to people.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:51.880]  Give the website out one more time.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.160]  Democrats against UN agenda 21.com.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.160]  Great job.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:58.160]  Great job.
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:04:59.160]  We'll talk to you soon in studio.
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:00.160]  Thank you.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:01.160]  Thank you.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.160]  Thank you.
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:03.160]  Thank you.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:04.160]  Thank you.

[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.720]  Ben Soap Company.

[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.440]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:09.400]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.500]  arsenal for home protection.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:15.240]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:06.280]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.280]  through the year.
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:10.960]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:13.800]  family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.160]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.400]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.560]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:27.020]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:31.000]  stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.160]  sister and my niece.
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:36.280]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.920]  Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

[02:07:56.280 --> 02:08:14.160]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:27.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:32.280]  Thank you for joining us again on this Friday, February 1st, 2013 edition.
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:38.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and wow, we just had Rosa Corey on with Unigena21, the book,
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:41.200]  and everything she's saying is totally true.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.640]  I mean, we're calling them total eugenics, world government, population reduction, turning
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:52.960]  the cities into total prisons, where everything surveilled beyond 1984, forced abortions,
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:09:00.520]  suicide nets around the agenda 21 factories, all of it's true and then some.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:06.240]  And we've just had it so good because of liberty, they can point out the problems with America,
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:10.040]  but compared to other countries, 5% of the population, half the world's wealth.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:17.360]  Now as the liberty is taken, now as the Constitution is ignored, now as the Bible is ignored, everything's
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:19.000]  going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.440]  And you can't deny that, whether you believe in God or not, when you become decadent, when
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.360]  you don't care about other people, when you don't make a stand, when you don't take action,
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:34.520]  you are rudderless and a ship without a rudder just goes around wherever the wind blows it.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:40.720]  And that's why I have a article up at infowars.com, population control propagandist, this is at
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:43.280]  Yale with top UN officials.
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:47.680]  We get very little opposition from the public because via the television programs, we have
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:53.920]  very gradual evolution of the characters, it's an hour and 50 something minute video,
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:54.920]  you can go watch it.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:59.440]  Go do it, go watch them laugh about you, go watch them talk about how they're conditioning
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.440]  you with the television.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:06.000]  I mean, you go see those messages that are anti-man, anti-family, anti-liberty, that
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.560]  are savage.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:11.720]  That's because they want to screw you up, they wanna have you be alone.
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:15.520]  And they say that if you go after other groups, you hate them, no, no, no, no.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:19.720]  What's happening is they want to make us all under the state's control.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:24.920]  They want to bankrupt us and the Democratic Party officially has adopted by the 60s, the
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:30.800]  Cloward and Piven strategy that we've talked about for 15, 16 years that's become now widely
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:33.920]  understood just like agenda 21.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.100]  Where the top sociologists for the Democratic Party said we're gonna bankrupt things in
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:42.880]  the name of the poor, but it's meant to bankrupt things to bring in our socialist society,
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.040]  which isn't even socialist.
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:48.760]  When you hear socialism, that means get control of you so you can be under eugenics.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:53.800]  Now, I know we got loaded phones, we're gonna get to so many that are patiently holding
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.680]  like Sean in Australia, I didn't even notice we had a caller from Australia, William, Eric,
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.240]  and we'll probably go into overdrive next hour, cuz our guest is here all the way from
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:02.240]  Arizona.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:10.000]  I shot a video talking about this last night, Weldon Henson, a few weeks ago, who does research
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  over what we carry.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.420]  Either I watch and read something and like it or have an idea or he's going over stuff
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.720]  we're sent and brings it to me.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:20.080]  And he said, hey, I really like this after the tribulation, let no man be deceived.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:21.080]  Do you know who these guys are?
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:25.520]  And yes, I know who all three of the men are that are featured in it.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:30.120]  And it's a very well done film, and it's after the tribulation, let no man be deceived.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.160]  Now, I wanna explain something here.
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.060]  Let's say you don't believe in God, you don't believe in a sixth sense.
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:40.000]  You don't know why you know when you're walking through an empty place, you feel somebody
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.760]  looking at you and there's a guy behind you.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:46.800]  You don't know why all that happens, why a monarch butterfly can fly to Canada and back
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.880]  or whatever.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.160]  You just think all that is here, the TV is the reality, whatever.
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.400]  The elites are all very, very spiritual.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:59.080]  And let me tell you, they worship something that looks a lot like the devil of the Bible.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.320]  In fact, they say that's who they worship, they believe Lucifer is God.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:07.080]  And I was brought up a Christian and I have had spiritual experiences and we've got that
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.200]  part of our brain connected to our spirit.
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:12.740]  But you get a little bit older and you hear all this, but then when I went to Bohemian
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:18.840]  Grove and saw 1,000 plus world leaders in religious rapture that I'd experienced in
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.240]  Baptist and Evangelical churches I went to as a child.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.680]  But on a dark side, people really, in a religious experience, an average atheist goes, they're
[02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:32.260]  just having fun worshiping the big owl and doing a mock sacrifice to it.
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:35.720]  But you see, when you're there, you know it's not just a play.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:40.640]  Plays come from religious events thousands of years ago, the stage, the people watching.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.040]  The whole world's a stage, each of us, players upon it, you find out, man, there's something
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.040]  going on here.
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.960]  But I know this, it was Christians that said no to slavery in Rome 2,000 years ago, it
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:55.240]  got thrown to the lions, going to be technical about 1,960 years ago is what was really going
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.240]  on.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:59.200]  It was Christians said no to slavery in Europe and then finally here.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.400]  Now there's some Bohemian Grove footage from Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, we're
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:05.480]  showing TV viewers.
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:09.440]  The point is, is that if you're a new listener, yes, I snuck into Bohemian Grove where the
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.760]  big boys of Skull and Bones go when they're old men.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.240]  And the point I wanna make to everybody out there who's watching, who's viewing us right
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:22.440]  now is that even if you don't believe in a spiritual realm, you have to understand the
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:26.840]  New World Order's greatest tool is convincing you it doesn't exist.
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.880]  Because they don't want you looking into it because they believe all the power is there,
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:31.900]  whether it's real or not.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:36.280]  They don't want you knowing about it and have written that they have pushed atheism and
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.760]  agnostic stuff so that you don't even ever think about it.
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:46.260]  It's like the Screwtape letters, a demon talking to a low level demon was written by a great
[02:13:46.260 --> 02:13:51.400]  British writer, popped my head in a minute, C.S. Lewis.
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.000]  They don't even want you getting into the big evils, they just don't want you ever thinking
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.520]  outside the box and feeling that connection or they wanna misdirect it if you do discover
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  that.
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:08.120]  But regardless, it has been the rapture doctrine that's, what, 150 years old max or so?
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:10.540]  We got a theologian here who can break it down.
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:16.080]  No Christians ever believed, I guess there were a few small groups later in Rome who
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:23.420]  did for a certain period, that it was the end of the world or, don't worry about evil,
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:24.560]  it's the end of the world.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.040]  Our founders are now criticized by TV preachers who are getting government funding and clergy
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:34.320]  response team FEMA money to say, the Christians, I've got the clips, you can just go to YouTube.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.900]  TV preacher says that we shouldn't have, Christians should have obeyed and worshiped the gods
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.560]  and shouldn't have been thrown to the lions, twisting Romans 13.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:48.060]  They teach our founders were bad, they should have followed King George.
[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:51.300]  That's all diametrically opposed to everything in the Bible.
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:55.060]  So understand, if you wanna know why we got in this position where the government now
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:58.380]  runs the churches that violates the First Amendment and common sense, this country was
[02:14:58.380 --> 02:14:59.440]  founded on.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.640]  It's because the leadership got bought off by the World Council of Churches, the National
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:07.360]  Council of Churches, the same Rockefeller groups, go look it up.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:12.560]  And so from an anthropologist or sociologist view, you need to see after the tribulation
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:21.080]  because the Bible clearly states, the tribulation comes after the devil wages war on the saints
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.940]  and overcomes them and chops off their heads by the millions and all of this.
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:29.240]  And I understand why Christians go, no, no, I'm gonna get jet packed out of here, a golden
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:33.760]  rope's gonna come down, Scotty's up there on the enterprise, he's gonna teleport me
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:34.760]  out of here.
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.320]  Well, let me tell you something, the Bible from front to back, nobody gets teleported
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:42.100]  out except for one guy who'd been so good, God picked him up.
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:47.680]  But the point is, and he wasn't getting teleported out to escape something, he'd already gone
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.680]  through the fire.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.440]  Okay, so I wanna explain some, of course in Christ, of course he did as well, but that
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:55.200]  wasn't really a man, you can go back and forth.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:58.560]  The point is, is God in man's body.
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:04.100]  The point is, this is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
[02:16:04.100 --> 02:16:07.840]  And they hate Christians and they hate gun owners because they know we understand what's
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:08.840]  going on.
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:11.640]  That's the litmus test that we know they're authoritarians.
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:15.360]  Now he's with us for this hour and a little bit into the next hour.
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:20.320]  After the tribulation, a film that they even did an info war style trailer without us even
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:24.560]  saying it, so I went ahead and tagged on my own promo onto it, it's up at infoawars.com
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.560]  right now.
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.160]  But after the tribulation, let no man deceive you.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.960]  Everyone needs to buy this at infoawarsstore.com and go give it to their pastor, their preachers
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.040]  and others.
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:39.400]  And again, Pastor Steve Anderson is famously 100 mile in checkpoints, he's been beat up
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.600]  for asking questions, we'll play some of that later.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:46.200]  He's the guy that said he prays for Obama to be brought down, which is biblical, got
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:47.440]  demonized for that.
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:51.020]  The pastor of Steven Anderson was born and raised in Sacramento, California.
[02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:52.520]  He's married with seven beautiful children.
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:56.920]  At age 18, he traveled throughout Germany and Eastern Europe with Baptist churches studying
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.520]  foreign languages and getting experience in the ministry.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.920]  Pastor Anderson started a totally independent Baptist church, Faithful World Baptist Church
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:11.840]  on December 25th, 2005, so I guess seven, eight years old now and faithfulworldbaptist.org
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:12.840]  is the website.
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:14.200]  Okay, we're going to break in a few minutes.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:19.320]  Great to have you here, but let's get right in to this film and the scriptures and where
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:25.800]  this doctrine came that it's a pre-tribulation rapture, so nobody's got to worry about anything.
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:30.040]  All the other Christians had to go through the fire, but this generation, as it's all
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.800]  coming down, we're going to be left alone.
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.720]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:34.720]  Good to be here.
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:39.920]  I think this film is most important because if you want to know why Christians are asleep
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.160]  right now, if you want to know why the vast majority of Christians don't want to hear
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:46.920]  about the New World Order, they don't care when you warn them about global government
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.800]  or police state, it's because of this doctrine.
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:54.920]  This pre-trib rapture doctrine makes everybody believe that it doesn't really matter what's
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.920]  going on because we're all going to be out of here.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:01.280]  And there was a pastor in Arizona that I know who recently said to me, as soon as he found
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:06.140]  out that I didn't believe in this pre-tribulation rapture, he said, well, now I understand why
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:08.440]  you're so paranoid about government.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:09.440]  Because he'd seen all the stuff with-
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.640]  Yeah, that's sick that they don't care about, even if they were going to be teleported out.
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:15.240]  Don't they care about all the people now?
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:16.240]  No, they don't.
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.240]  They sit around at country clubs.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:21.040]  Yeah, so he said, now I see why you're so paranoid about government, but I'd like to
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.160]  turn that around on him and say, now I see why you don't give a rip about anything that's
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:26.160]  going on.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.120]  Now I see why you trust the government so much because you believe this fairy tale that
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:32.560]  we're going to be taken out of here before-
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.720]  Homeland Security is now saying the number one enemy of the groups is the Christians.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:42.680]  Remember Janet Reno said, a believer that believes in the second coming of Christ, that
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.280]  is a mentally ill cult member.
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.560]  Yeah, and this is all prophesied in the Bible.
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.240]  The Bible's real clear that eventually Christians are going to be-
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.760]  The smart meters, the chips, the face scanning, the hands, all of it, world government, the
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:56.640]  exact empires, the name of it, everything.
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:00.980]  It's all in the Bible, and the amazing thing is that people 100 years ago might have read
[02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:04.000]  the Bible and wondered, how could this be implemented?
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.120]  How do you stop people from buying or selling?
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:10.840]  How do you take this kind of global power over every single nation in the world?
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:12.280]  But now we can see it happen.
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.840]  The UN says 10 kingdoms, they call it 10 kingdoms.
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:16.840]  Right.
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:17.840]  It's all there.
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:18.840]  It's all, I mean, they're following it.
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:21.920]  The only other argument is, well, they're using it as a template of control, like it's
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:24.680]  a science fiction book and they go, ooh, this is a good plan.
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.080]  Oh, and they worship the devil on top of it?
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:29.320]  But that's a joke too, I guess.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.320]  There's no way.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:33.960]  I mean, obviously the Bible has been talking about this stuff since hundreds and hundreds
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:35.060]  of years ago.
[02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:36.060]  It's crystal clear.
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:40.760]  It's like reading a newspaper when you read the Bible about the one world government,
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:44.440]  global warfare, the engineered famines that...
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:45.880]  Bioweapons, weather control.
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:47.240]  All of it.
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:53.160]  Metal insects that drop things that turn into mountains of fire, columns, hydrogen bombs.
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.160]  I mean, it's all there.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.160]  It's all there.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.440]  I mean, the people having these visions were like, I saw metal giant insects, mountains
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:01.440]  of flame.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:02.440]  I mean...
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:05.680]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:10.680]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:11.680]  Here's why.
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.960]  Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:21.360]  run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:24.760]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.400]  Now here's the best part.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:31.080]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:36.260]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:37.260]  each year.
[02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:41.000]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.200]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:47.200]  Don't wait.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:48.200]  They go fast.
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:51.640]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:14.960]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine and laundry service awaits.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:18.360]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:25.560]  We're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:31.840]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar and the biggest
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:39.520]  stag deer in South America, all gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:44.860]  Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:50.360]  transportation included and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:55.520]  The adventure of a lifetime starts at goldenstagsafaris.com.
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:59.480]  The big game hunting ranch, goldenstagsafaris.com.
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:03.120]  Oh, great, now I've got to go to court.
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:05.760]  Meet Tina, now facing a future court date.
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:07.560]  I can't afford an attorney.

[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:35.920]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:36.920]  IRAs?
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:40.900]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:42.560]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:46.040]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:51.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:07.920]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:14.160]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.760]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent, lying crooks

[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:28.020]  Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up, and you will be
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:31.920]  shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:37.560]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:40.000]  and how you can beat them too.

[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:17.800]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:22.000]  Pastor Steve Anderson, who's one of the people in this great new film, After the Tribulation
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  is our guest.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  Okay, I'm ranting and raving.
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.080]  Starting with the points you were making during the break, and let's get into what the Bible
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:30.080]  really says.
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:33.940]  And again, even if you're not a Christian, this is what governs over two billion people
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:38.480]  on the planet who say they're one form of Christian or another, and they're all being
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:40.280]  told you're all gonna be raptured.
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.560]  Hollywood loves to promote it, it's what all the TV ads say, and it turns out they're all
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:48.080]  basically clergy response team federal agents.
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.080]  Go over it.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:53.380]  Yeah, let me just start out by saying that this doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:55.440]  is not found in the Bible at all.
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:59.760]  It's not derived from any scripture, and it's like the emperor's new clothes.
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.080]  Everybody goes around saying, of course we believe in it, all the pastors preach it,
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:07.960]  but nobody ever stops to ask themselves, wait a minute, is this even taught in the Bible?
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:13.200]  And it all is relying upon one key point, that they teach that Jesus can come back at
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.460]  any moment.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:18.540]  And you'll hear a lot of TV preachers saying, he may even come back before I'm done with
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:19.540]  this sermon.
[02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:22.840]  Come like a thief in the night, no man know the time.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:25.060]  Send your money now, you don't need it.
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:26.300]  We could be gone tomorrow.
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:31.600]  So this doctrine that says that Jesus is coming at any moment is not found in scripture at
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  all.
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:36.800]  And what they're twisting is where Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24, of that day and hour,
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:40.920]  he said, but of that day and hour, knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven.
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:44.280]  But what they forgot to tell you is that a couple of verses before that, he said it was
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:45.740]  after the tribulation.
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.800]  So he said after the tribulation, he's coming in the clouds, the trumpet's gonna sound.
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:50.800]  Then a couple of verses later-
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:53.480]  And he said no stone will be left unturned in this war.
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.840]  A couple of verses later, he says, but of that day and hour, knoweth no man, know not
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.500]  the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:02.160]  So they quote that one verse hoping that you're too ignorant.
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.840]  Yeah, quote the other voice, the earlier part.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:10.680]  Okay, it says in verse 29 of Matthew 24, immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:15.160]  the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:18.160]  the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:19.180]  You're gonna notice that.
[02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:22.620]  This isn't some secret, left behind, everybody disappears thing.
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:23.620]  It's talking about the sun and moon being-
[02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:25.160]  Stop's gonna be blowing up.
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:29.360]  And it says, then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.760]  Son of man is what Jesus called himself on this earth.
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:35.260]  And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man coming
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:38.820]  in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and he shall send his angels with a
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:43.140]  great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from
[02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:44.220]  one end of heaven to the other.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:47.720]  The elect in the New Testament is always referring to those that are believers, those that are
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:49.420]  saved, those who believe in Christ.
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:54.040]  So they totally skip over that part, and they jump down to verse 36, where it says, but
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:58.600]  of that day and hour, knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.580]  And again, I've read the Bible, the whole thing foreshadows in the Old Testament what's
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:03.580]  going to happen.
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:07.780]  It says in the New Testament, it says in Revelation, over and over again, it describes how the
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:11.440]  devil goes after God's people, and they have to stand against it.
[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.640]  Because it's not about what happens to their body, it's about their soul and having the
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:16.640]  courage.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:21.940]  It's ridiculous, it is the emperor's, is totally naked here.
[02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:24.260]  Exactly, and there's no basis for it.
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:28.640]  But anyway, the scripture that I just read for you, where it said, after the tribulation,
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.420]  Christ comes in the clouds, he gathers the elect, the trumpet sounds.
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:36.820]  When you try to show this to one of these pre-trib preachers, they'll tell you, well,
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.680]  that's not even about the rapture.
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:42.140]  But then these same people will turn around and quote you that no man knoweth the day
[02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:43.340]  or the hour all day long.
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:45.320]  No, I've had them do it to me in person.
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:48.800]  Even though it's just a couple verses later, so it's like they just take that one verse
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.800]  out of context.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:53.380]  Now, you brought up the part about the thief in the night, where they say, Jesus is coming
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:55.740]  as a thief in the night, he can come at any moment.
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:28:00.020]  But here's what's funny, if you actually go to that passage where it says that he's coming
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:02.940]  as a thief in the night, in 1 Thessalonians 5.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:08.540]  If you go down two verses, it says, but ye, brethren, are not in darkness that that day
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:10.180]  should overtake you as a thief.
[02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:13.060]  Ye are all the children of the light and the children of the day.
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:14.860]  We are not of the night nor of darkness.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:18.900]  Therefore, let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.140]  It's saying the dumbed down masses won't know what hit them.
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:23.140]  Exactly.
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:27.060]  He says that it's coming upon those that do not believe, those who don't know.
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:29.660]  We all know it's coming, we all see the freight train.
[02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:32.820]  Why would it come upon us as a thief in the night when he's telling us exactly what's
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:33.820]  gonna happen?
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:36.620]  He says you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you.
[02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:37.620]  Totally clear, totally clear.
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:38.620]  Exactly.
[02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:41.040]  That's why you gotta stop listening to preachers and read the Bible.
[02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.300]  It's gonna overtake them as a thief because the Bible says they're asleep.
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:46.840]  We're not asleep as others.
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:51.820]  He said wake up, watch, be sober, read the Bible, know this is coming.
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:56.100]  He says when you begin to see these things come to pass, then lift up your heads, look
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:57.980]  up, your redemption draweth nigh.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:01.180]  But there's nothing in the Bible that teaches that Jesus can come at any moment.
[02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:04.060]  He said, look, X, Y, and Z has to come first.
[02:29:04.060 --> 02:29:08.540]  And what's funny is the two main passages I encourage people to read are Matthew 24
[02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.660]  and 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:15.260]  And in both of these passages, he uses the term let no man deceive you.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:21.060]  And then he goes on to explain how his coming is not at any moment, and that first the tribulation
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:22.060]  comes.
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:23.100]  First the sun and moon are darkened.
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.020]  So that tells me something's out to deceive us.
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:27.540]  Christ is even saying now I'm gonna tell you when this is gonna happen, but people are
[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:28.540]  gonna try to deceive you on this.
[02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:29.540]  Exactly.
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:30.540]  Listen carefully.
[02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:31.540]  Right.
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:32.540]  And a five year old could tell what he's saying.
[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:33.540]  And these preachers twisted.
[02:29:33.540 --> 02:29:34.540]  I figured it out when I was 12.
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:40.100]  Well, we're gonna come right back and talk about, as you go back to this, this got pushed
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.940]  by the globalists about 150 years ago.
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:42.940]  Exactly.
[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:44.660]  Because they were sick of Christians always fighting evil.
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:49.580]  They said, don't worry about it, go have us go have some fun.
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:50.580]  Scotty's up there.
[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:51.580]  He's gonna beam you.
[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:52.580]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.900]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.900 --> 02:30:02.620]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:12.620]  What do you mean biblical?
[02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:17.900]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath of God type stuff, fire and brimstone
[02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:22.140]  coming down from the skies, rivers and seas boiling, 40 years of darkness, earthquakes,
[02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:27.340]  volcanoes, the dead rising from the grave, human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together,

[02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:01.900]  over from the last interview, but it all ties together this total control grid and we're
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:08.060]  not judging people out there who are Christians and think there's going to be a pre-trip rapture.
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:11.920]  You guys are getting freaked out by it because it's now doctrinal that you're going to hell
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:13.420]  if you don't believe in this.
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:17.840]  It's not about Jesus and the blood of Jesus, it's about the rapture happening before and
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:24.040]  this is universal now across the board, especially in the Protestant circles.
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:30.580]  This is it, it's not saved by grace alone, there's a pre-trip rapture because you've
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:35.420]  got to think this so you stand down and go along with it.
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:37.980]  And boy, are people in for a rude awakening.
[02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:41.340]  I want to talk about the history of this, where it came from, what happened to you as
[02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:45.600]  a Baptist preacher, you said you knew this when you were 12, reading the Bible, go through
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:47.320]  that and then we'll go to some calls.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:53.780]  It's all covered in the film After the Tribulation, available at Infowarsshop.com or Infowarsstore.com,
[02:34:53.780 --> 02:34:55.500]  both URLs will get you there.
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:00.820]  And you know what, it's important to talk about this and to look at it because Christ,
[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:04.020]  I know he's not the preacher so he doesn't really count, he's kind of the back of the
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:06.340]  bust saying that.
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:09.540]  And I know it says the beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them and all
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:10.540]  that.
[02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:13.900]  And then it clearly says at the end of the tribulation when Christ comes back, the dead
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:16.120]  are raised and all that, but that's the Bible.
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:20.260]  The Bible takes a backseat to the preachers who were the clergy response team on FEMA
[02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:23.900]  payroll, violating the First Amendment with the federal government controlling them.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:25.580]  But I guess they are my Pharisee kings.
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:26.820]  Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:28.740]  Okay, so here's the history on this.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:34.460]  Before the year 1830, every denomination, every type of Christianity taught that the
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:38.700]  rapture took place after the tribulation because that's what the Bible explicitly says.
[02:35:38.700 --> 02:35:40.820]  Why would anyone teach anything different?
[02:35:40.820 --> 02:35:45.300]  But in the late 1830s, a man by the name of John Nelson Darby started teaching a doctrine
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:49.740]  of what he called the secret rapture, which is this idea that people are gonna disappear,
[02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:54.820]  nobody knows where they went, nobody knows what's going on, it happens before the tribulation.
[02:35:54.820 --> 02:35:58.220]  Okay, he promoted and taught that doctrine throughout the 1800s.
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:02.620]  He put out his own version of the Bible, the Darby translation, where he tampered with
[02:36:02.620 --> 02:36:05.180]  key passages about the second coming of Christ.
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:06.380]  He's famous for that.
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:07.380]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.980]  And then later on, it was picked up by a guy named Scofield.
[02:36:10.980 --> 02:36:14.580]  And this guy Scofield put out a Scofield reference Bible.
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:19.080]  And that is what is responsible for getting it to all the Baptists, all the seminaries
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:21.420]  started really pushing the Scofield reference Bible.
[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:25.260]  I just got a call this week of people trying to sell me Scofield Bibles.
[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:30.620]  And so the Scofield Bible is all about getting the pre-trib rapture doctrine out to people.
[02:36:30.620 --> 02:36:34.860]  Now, because this doctrine is not found in the Bible at all, there's no clear scripture
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:39.020]  that anybody can point to that shows you, here's where it says before the tribulation,
[02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:41.300]  Jesus comes in the clouds.
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:45.960]  They have to rely on a lot of fear and intimidation to make sure that all the preachers walk in
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:46.960]  line.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.100]  Now, just in my own personal life, I started pastoring seven years ago, and I was sent
[02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:55.140]  out to start an independent Baptist church in Phoenix, Arizona, the church that sent
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:59.540]  me out as soon as they found out that I did not believe in the pre-tribulation rapture
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:03.800]  because I preached a sermon, you know, where I explained why it was false.
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:09.460]  They immediately cut all ties with me cut all contact with me disowned me effectively.
[02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:14.220]  And honestly, any pastor who preaches against the pre-tribulation rapture is going to pay
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:15.700]  a big price.
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:19.220]  They're going to lose their preacher friends, they're going to lose any kind of funding,
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:22.660]  because if you are not pre-trib, you are not in the club.
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:27.300]  And they have to rely on that blackballing of anybody who will question it in order to
[02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:33.820]  make sure that every Baptist and every evangelical is in lockstep teaching the preacher rapture.
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:40.300]  Let me tell you something, every single Baptist Bible college or Baptist seminary or evangelical
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:44.920]  Bible college that I know of teaches the pre-tribulation rapture and they demand that their graduates
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:45.920]  believe it.
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:49.020]  And they even have Hollywood movies where the aliens come and take the good people away.
[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:50.780]  Even the Hollywoods pushing this.
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:55.100]  And every single church I've ever been in had people who believed right on this.
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:57.660]  Because you know, there are people who believe it or not, there are some people actually
[02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:58.980]  read the Bible and believe it.
[02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:00.420]  You were saying when you were 12.
[02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:03.040]  When I was 12, I believed it right on this since I was 12.
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:06.560]  I grew up being taught the pre-trib rapture in every church I've ever been to.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:10.020]  But when I was 12, I decided to read the Bible or I'm sorry, the New Testament, I wanted
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.940]  to read cover to cover for the first time.
[02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:16.780]  I started in Matthew and by the time I got to chapter 24 and read what Jesus said, it
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.620]  was clear to me and I've never believed in the pre-trib rapture since since reading Matthew.
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:23.060]  Well what does your gut and spirit tell you?
[02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:25.500]  I mean God is going to put us through the fire.
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:30.500]  Now if we go halfway, God sometimes protects his people, but you just don't get out of
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.500]  the whole deal.
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:33.180]  I mean none of the prophets did.
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:39.980]  The Bible says ye and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:44.500]  And the Bible says, these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace.
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:49.800]  In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I've overcome the world.
[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:51.340]  The Bible warns us over and over again.
[02:38:51.340 --> 02:38:55.320]  I would just encourage anybody who's listening and skeptical about what I'm saying, look
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.820]  up in a concordance every time the Bible uses the word tribulation.
[02:38:58.820 --> 02:39:04.500]  90% of the time the word tribulation is used in the New Testament, it's referring to believers
[02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:08.980]  going through trials and tribulations and suffering and persecution because of them
[02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:11.100]  taking a stand for the word of God.
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:14.780]  Because if you take a stand and preach the word of God, you're gonna be persecuted.
[02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:18.400]  The whole book of Acts is people being thrown in jail.
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:19.400]  It's people being arrested.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.340]  Have you seen the big TV preachers, I played the clips now, saying the Christians were
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:26.100]  wrong to not do what Rome said and worship those idols.
[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:28.580]  Romans 13, do what they say.
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:33.000]  I haven't seen it, but I know from reading the book of Acts, the Jews were constantly
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.660]  persecuting the Christians.
[02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:37.420]  They were taking them out of the synagogues, they were beating them, they were putting
[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:38.420]  them to death.
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:42.500]  And all throughout the book of Acts, every Bible-believing preacher is getting arrested,
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:45.620]  he's getting beaten, he's getting persecuted, he's getting in prison.
[02:39:45.620 --> 02:39:51.420]  And yet we're taught that before the Antichrist comes, before the one-world governments in
[02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:56.140]  place, before they start this law that says that if you won't worship the Antichrist,
[02:39:56.140 --> 02:39:57.140]  you're gonna be killed.
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:40:01.020]  You know, we're all gonna be out of here because they say, God would never allow his people
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:02.380]  to go through something like that.
[02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:05.180]  God loves us too much to allow us to suffer.
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:10.880]  He would never allow us to go through tribulation, but yet every other generation of believers
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:11.880]  have gone through tribulation.
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:16.260]  Well, look at Paul, his job was to hunt down for the Sanhedrin, hunt down Christians.
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:20.460]  And let me make it real clear, I do believe in the rapture, I'm not saying that the rapture
[02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:21.460]  is a false god.
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:22.460]  I know, they'll spin that too.
[02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:25.440]  Yeah, this is what they'll do, you're saying there's no rapture.
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.940]  Or they'll say, well, here's people before 1830 teaching that the rapture existed.
[02:40:29.940 --> 02:40:32.100]  No, that's not what we're saying.
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:36.700]  Before 1830, there was not a person on this planet who believed that the rapture came
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:39.440]  after or before the tribulation.
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.300]  The Bible says that the rapture happens after the tribulation.
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.620]  That's when Christ comes in the clouds.
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:47.900]  I wanna go to some, the point is the film covers all this.
[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:50.180]  And again, even if you're not a Christian, you need to see it.
[02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:55.940]  It's very well done, because it explains why Christians will go along with anything now.
[02:40:55.940 --> 02:41:01.940]  Well, you know what, and the film is important for a Christian and non-Christian alike.
[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:06.380]  First of all, if somebody's not a Christian, they need to watch the film and become a Christian,
[02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:09.140]  because honestly, and that's explained at the end of the film.
[02:41:09.140 --> 02:41:13.060]  But honestly, I don't understand how you can look around and see all these things happening
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:16.940]  in the world today, and then look at the Bible and see that it's exactly what the Bible said
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:17.940]  would happen, and then see-
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:21.540]  Well, see, what I do is I just point out what the New World Order is doing, and I just say,
[02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:22.540]  hey, you wanna see it?
[02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:24.200]  And people will actually watch it.
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:28.100]  My experience is you're gonna see this or go to hell, and they don't watch it, you know?
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:32.460]  But here's the thing, even if you're not a Christian, I'm sure you have some Christian
[02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:37.900]  friend who just refuses to wake up and refuses to understand what's going on with the global
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:41.220]  government, the New World Order, the food supply, the water.
[02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:45.680]  This film is the ultimate film for waking Christians up, because it's packed with Bible-
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:46.680]  Well, look at Revelation.
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:53.040]  It talks about the different passages, how the kings of the earth and the sorcerers manipulate
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:42:01.380]  the pharmacia, the drugs, to drug the public and make us drunk on the blood of the innocents
[02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:04.900]  Pepsi puts the dead baby parts in.
[02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:07.940]  It's like the golden child, they're trying to get him to eat the bad things they can
[02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:10.060]  like spiritually get at him.
[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:15.100]  But the point is they're sitting there point blank saying that they traffic in our souls.
[02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:16.240]  That's what they want.
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:17.700]  The globalists want our minds.
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:20.460]  They're not after treasure and power, their minions are.
[02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:26.420]  The high-level Luciferians aren't even into materialism, they want our souls.
[02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:27.520]  Exactly right.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:33.300]  And this film, we spend about half the film just demolishing the pre-tribulation rapture
[02:42:33.300 --> 02:42:34.300]  lie.
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:38.620]  And that's like taking candy from a baby, because I mean, it's so clear in scripture.
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:42.460]  And then we spend the other half of the film just explaining how this is all going to play
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:49.060]  out and showing examples from now about the implantable chips, about the cashless society,
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:50.060]  about-
[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:51.060]  How are they going in?
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:52.060]  I mean, it's total control.
[02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:54.900]  They're having police checkpoints with scanners.
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:59.820]  I've got articles targeting, they know veterans off their license plate, scanned, no criminal
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:00.820]  record.
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:04.260]  The police are, this is a courtesy safety check, let me search your car without a warrant.
[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:09.380]  And then they're getting, in New York State, five felony counts facing 20 years in jail.
[02:43:09.380 --> 02:43:12.780]  And they're saying, I'm a decorated veteran, I didn't even know that the law said this
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:13.780]  was illegal.
[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:16.020]  They're like throwing the book at him saying, we're gonna get you.
[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:18.660]  I mean, they're going after good people now.
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:24.380]  Oh, yeah, and all throughout the Bible, going back to the very beginning, Cain killed Abel.
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:26.700]  All throughout the Bible, it's the bad guys killing the good people.
[02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.700]  And evil wants high office to abuse.
[02:43:28.700 --> 02:43:29.700]  Exactly.
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:33.860]  And again, the whole Bible's about don't trust the government, stand up against it.
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:38.700]  Romans 13 is totally taken out of context is why we sell the book, Romans 13, the true
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:43.120]  meaning of submission by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer's son breaks that
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:44.120]  all down.
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:49.620]  Every church I go to, it doesn't matter, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Baptist, my wife wants to go
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:50.620]  to church.
[02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:53.820]  You know, Christian friends, I go in, and at the end of the sermon, they go, we need
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:57.100]  to do what the government says, and they're of the Lord, and there's gonna be some times
[02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:59.940]  coming when the government needs to do some things, but it's of God.
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:03.140]  And I know their clergy response team, and I go up and say, were you told to do that
[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:04.980]  by higher ups for FEMA?
[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:08.580]  I'm not gonna talk about that now, sonny boy there.
[02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:13.340]  It's a federal agent there now, so devilish, so unconstitutional.
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:18.420]  And they're not even bad men themselves, but they are now agents of the New World Order.
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:23.100]  Well, you know, I actually used to attend a really big mega-type church, and when I
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:27.420]  went to that really big church, the pastor was literally called to a meeting with George
[02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:31.460]  W. Bush in Washington, DC, with a bunch of other big-time pastors.
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:35.460]  And they sat him down and told him, we're on your team, you know, but you need to help
[02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:36.660]  us, and here's what, you know.
[02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:40.300]  And basically, these pastors are literally getting their marching orders from the government,
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:41.580]  because the government's not stupid.
[02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:45.340]  You know, they know that these big pastors that pastor really big churches-
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:46.580]  It's over 100,000 now.
[02:44:46.580 --> 02:44:47.580]  It's little ones.
[02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:48.580]  I've got the manuals.
[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:51.780]  I'm sure you've seen our clergy response teams that we broke seven, eight years ago.
[02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:53.780]  And since then, it's been declassified.
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:58.260]  They've got them ready that when the time comes, turn your guns in, take the shots,
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:01.620]  go to the camp, let them take your husband, it's of the Lord.
[02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:02.620]  It's action.
[02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:04.140]  And you know what's sad about that is that-
[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:05.900]  By the way, I'm not just saying that.
[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:06.900]  That's in the manuals.
[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:07.900]  Go ahead.
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:08.900]  Oh, I know.
[02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:09.900]  They plan on taking us away.
[02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:10.900]  I've seen the evidence.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:14.260]  And the thing is, the thing that's sad about it, though, is that it turns a lot of people
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:19.300]  off away from Christianity, because they see how basically a lot of these pastors are these
[02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:24.620]  minions of the New World Order, and these minions of big government and global warfare
[02:45:24.620 --> 02:45:25.620]  and all these different things-
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.620]  Minions of the devil.
[02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:27.620]  And minions of the devil.
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:31.160]  And then they look at that, and it makes them turn against the Bible or turn against Jesus
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:35.260]  Christ or not want to hear about it, when in reality, that's not the Bible or Jesus
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:36.260]  talk.
[02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:37.620]  And these guys don't know the Bible, you know?
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:41.020]  And so if we could get some preachers that would stand up and preach what the Bible really
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:46.020]  says, and warn people about these things, then maybe people would, you know-
[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:47.020]  I agree.
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:50.560]  I'm going to go to, and again, people out there are Christians, like, how dare you even
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:51.700]  talk about this?
[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:52.700]  What's wrong with talking?
[02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:54.300]  See, this is the big taboo.
[02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:57.140]  Let me tell all the Christians out there something.
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:46:01.100]  In your life, if you've done the right thing and stood up against evil, God many times
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:03.940]  will protect you, unless it's part of a larger plan.
[02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:06.500]  I don't pray to God every day, hey, give me this, give me that, protect me.
[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:12.420]  I just say, look, I'm a sinner, I'm a dirty rag here, I'm trying to fight evil, my heart
[02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:13.420]  loves good.
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:14.420]  Will you help me be strong?
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:16.980]  Will you help me not be a bad person?
[02:46:16.980 --> 02:46:20.100]  There's all these Pharisees out there that want to make you obsess on the law, but not
[02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:21.140]  the heart.
[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:24.040]  And the issue is, I'm going to tell Christians something out there.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.900]  You are not going to make it through this evil that's coming, believing you're going
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:29.260]  to be teleported out of here.
[02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:31.460]  I assure you, that's just not justice.
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:36.660]  God is not going to let you sit there like a coward and be ejected out of this if you
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:38.260]  don't stand up against evil.
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:42.400]  I'm not saying God doesn't deliver people, but they have to go through the fire first.
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:44.340]  Is that not biblical over and over again?
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:46.560]  It's the same stories over and over again.
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:50.520]  It's definitely biblical that every single Christian, according to the Bible, is appointed
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:54.060]  to suffering, to go through trials, to go through tribulations.
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:55.420]  You know, yeah, he's going to see us through.
[02:46:55.420 --> 02:46:58.740]  The Bible says many of the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver them out
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.740]  of them all.
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:03.180]  But it's not saying, you know, we're going to be delivered before the afflictions come.
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.180]  You know, the Bible teaches...
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.180]  What about Job?
[02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:07.020]  You know, why did he just get delivered up front?
[02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:08.020]  Exactly.
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:09.580]  As Christians, we all have to fight.
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:12.220]  And it's said he was as near perfect as any man.
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:15.940]  He was the greatest man living on the earth at that time, is what the Bible says.
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:20.340]  He was an upright man, and he went through the most suffering of anybody in the Bible.
[02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:21.340]  Okay?
[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:26.300]  Because all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:31.380]  And Christians today, it's like you said, you know, the Christians today who don't see
[02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:35.420]  this coming, they're not prepared for it, you know, it's going to catch them unawares.
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:37.060]  It's going to catch them off guard.
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:38.060]  They're going to panic.
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:39.060]  They're going to be disillusioned.
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:43.320]  You know, what happened to the rapture, I don't know what to do, I'm scared.
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:46.700]  And you know, those of us that are awake, we're ready for it, you know?
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:52.140]  They're already setting up checkpoints nationwide where they're looking for veterans, Christians,
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:56.380]  landowners, second coming of Christ, believers, libertarians.
[02:47:56.380 --> 02:48:02.060]  They know, I mean, the main homeland security and the same in Europe is for us.
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:05.620]  I mean, there it is, these are really bad people.
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:10.220]  I mean, I want to go to calls, we got a caller from Australia, he's been holding the longest.
[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:12.940]  I promise I'm going to get to you after the break, Sean, I'm going to give you time.
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:19.540]  But John says he disagrees, he's listening on shortwave in Texas, WWCR World Service.
[02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:21.660]  John, what do you disagree with, brother?
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:22.660]  Hello?
[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:23.660]  Yes.
[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.660]  I'm approaching this conversation not hostile.
[02:48:25.660 --> 02:48:26.660]  It's okay.
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:28.660]  Tell us what you think, brother.
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:29.660]  Okay.
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:32.300]  I just didn't want you to understand I'm not coming at you hostile.
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:33.300]  I don't mind that.
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:34.300]  Go ahead.
[02:48:34.300 --> 02:48:35.300]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:45.500]  In Pastor Anderson, in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3, or I'm sorry, chapter 2 verse 3, have you
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:48.060]  ever read the Geneva Bible?
[02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:53.980]  In that verse, they changed it in the Geneva Bible, and when they changed it in the King
[02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:59.260]  James Version, they changed it to become a falling away.
[02:48:59.260 --> 02:49:02.420]  And originally, it was a departing.
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:07.940]  And that, to me, shows that there, you know, that there was, there has to be a departing
[02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:08.940]  of something.
[02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:13.660]  Okay, I've heard this theory that the falling away is actually a departure, meaning that
[02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:15.500]  Christians are departing this earth.
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:18.260]  The Greek word there is apostasia.
[02:49:18.260 --> 02:49:24.120]  You actually expect me to believe that the Greek word apostasia should be translated
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:27.300]  as departure, meaning departing in the rapture?
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:31.860]  No, apostasy is when people fall away from the faith or depart from the faith.
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:35.620]  The Bible says in the last days, some will depart from the faith.
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:40.540]  Everyone knows a falling away means look at Europe, look at America, people, you know.
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:45.780]  Look, I encourage you, the Greek word apostasia is where we get our English word apostasy.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:50.400]  And so when the Geneva Bible said a departure, it's talking about departing the faith.
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:53.200]  Falling away means falling away from the truth.
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.020]  And that's what we're seeing today, a lot of Christians.
[02:49:55.020 --> 02:49:58.380]  How does the beast wage war on the saints and overcome them if there's, the Christians
[02:49:58.380 --> 02:49:59.380]  are all gone?
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:05.260]  But look, I've heard this so many times, wake up people, apostasy, apostasia, that is not
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:06.260]  the rapture.
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:09.300]  And look, this caller, I'm not trying to be rude to the caller, but this subject just
[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:10.300]  gets me fired up.
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:14.620]  And let me tell you something, Christians today who believe in the pre-trib rapture,
[02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:17.500]  this is the kind of ridiculous reasoning they use.
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:20.380]  They're gonna take me to Second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3.
[02:50:20.380 --> 02:50:25.060]  My gut in studying the world, they're planning to bring in world government and kill.
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:26.980]  Their plan is over 90% of us, okay?
[02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:30.180]  They're planning to kill people and they're a cultist and they're using microchips to
[02:50:30.180 --> 02:50:31.180]  buy and sell.
[02:50:31.180 --> 02:50:32.540]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:35.860]  So I'm here to tell you, all the Christians out there thinking you and your kids are getting
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:36.860]  out of this.
[02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:41.140]  There's none of you are getting out of this unless it means you die early before this
[02:50:41.140 --> 02:50:42.140]  happens.
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:44.220]  Okay, I got a warning for you right now.
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:45.220]  You can put it in the bank.
[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:47.940]  Okay, you can put it in a pipe and smoke it.
[02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:52.100]  Nobody, and I mean nobody rides for free.
[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.700]  Nobody's going in the kingdom of heaven without showing their metal.
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:57.940]  The fire separates the garbage from the gold.
[02:50:57.940 --> 02:50:59.620]  I'm gonna go back to that caller.
[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:00.620]  Stay there, sir.
[02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:02.020]  I wanna give you a response back, John.
[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:05.780]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:10.700]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:11.700]  Here's why.
[02:51:11.700 --> 02:51:17.020]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:21.420]  run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:24.700]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:26.460]  Now, here's the best part.
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:31.140]  Every year, we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:36.320]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:37.320]  each year.
[02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:41.060]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:46.260]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:51:46.260 --> 02:51:47.260]  Don't wait.
[02:51:47.260 --> 02:51:48.260]  They go fast.
[02:51:48.260 --> 02:51:51.700]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:51.700 --> 02:52:01.660]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:03.900]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:04.900]  Answer this.
[02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:09.420]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes up burglars into thinking
[02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:14.360]  someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:17.940]  by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:20.580]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:24.980]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually
[02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:29.440]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:34.340]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:37.420]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:52:37.420 --> 02:52:40.420]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:45.140]  And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure
[02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:47.440]  house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:58.580]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV, that's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com.

[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:15.960]  By the way, everything we've talked about unfortunately is now starting to unfold.
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:19.240]  And all over the country, they're getting Homeland Security grants starting with New
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:20.920]  York and LA.
[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:25.240]  They now have naked body scanners that the police force people into on the street randomly.
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:30.420]  They're doing something like half a million a year random searches without warrants.
[02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:35.860]  Now that's up at infowars.com in New York, and now they're having warrantless checkpoints
[02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:36.860]  here in Texas.
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:39.040]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:45.880]  Engineer files lawsuit against New York Street body scanners, violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:46.880]  It's just incredible.
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:49.280]  MSNBC urges viewers to boycott gun manufacturers.
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:52.400]  I mean, this is a full racketeering operation.
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:57.680]  McCain and Schumer moved to force Americans to use biometric ID for employment.
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:01.820]  After the tribulation sneak peek, got the trailer up there, Department of Homeland Security
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:08.800]  targets gun collector, decorated combat veteran arrested, charged with five felonies for possession
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:11.700]  of AR-15 magazines in New York State.
[02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:12.700]  Now illegal.
[02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:14.600]  They say they're gonna throw him under the jail.
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:18.080]  This is how they're gonna come after us, folks, and it is pure evil.
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:21.960]  And we can be like Nineveh, I believe, and get a reprieve if we push this back.
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:26.680]  I had a sheriff on the one in Kentucky who's now got hundreds of sheriffs by his honor
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:30.000]  going public saying, I won't enforce this, I'm gonna stand against the gun confiscation.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.640]  Now hundreds, prominent ones are coming out saying they stand with him.
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:38.440]  He said, look, he said, we might have had all this happen in the 70s when people stood
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:39.440]  up.
[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:40.440]  It would have had to happen last year.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:43.040]  We're in the game, folks, and it's all in the Bible.
[02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:47.120]  Whether you believe it or not, it's amazing philosophy, amazing information.
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:50.840]  The media puts it down all day because they're scared of it.
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:54.400]  And read the Bible and tell me, how did it predict all this with such precision?
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:56.880]  I wanna go to Sean in Australia who's holding super patient.
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:58.360]  I promise I'm gonna get to you.
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:03.020]  But John in Texas who disagrees, the pastor got fired up there with you, you're very nice
[02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:04.020]  to call in.
[02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:06.160]  Do you wanna have a counterpoint back to him?
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:09.080]  Yes, yes, thank you.
[02:56:09.080 --> 02:56:15.880]  Pastor Anderson, have you ever read the book, Why So Many Churches by Dr. Noah Hutchings?
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:18.880]  The reason I'm bringing this up is because I believe that-
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:22.440]  I've read it, everybody fights over doctrine until everything splits.
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:23.440]  Exactly.
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:25.720]  And I don't have a bone to pick either way on this side.
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:29.560]  If we're raptured out of here, I'm happy, I just know I'm insecure in Christ.
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:30.560]  That's where I'm coming from.
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:34.060]  No, no, I think that's key, but we need to be fighting this thing.
[02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:36.440]  Because what matters is people's souls.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.440]  Go ahead, Pastor.
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:38.440]  Comments?
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.000]  Well, I appreciate the call and I'm sorry that I got a little fired up there, it's just
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:44.920]  I'm really passionate about this.
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:46.560]  Falling away means falling down, not up.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:48.760]  Yeah, if things fall, they fall down, they don't fall down.
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:50.400]  We're not gonna be raptured to the center of the earth.
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:54.780]  So the apostasia or falling away or departure is not the rapture.
[02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:58.360]  But as far as the idea of not fighting over doctrine, I disagree with that.
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:00.460]  I haven't read the book, I can't comment on it.
[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:04.840]  But I'm gonna fight over doctrine until I die, because I do want to fight over every
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:05.840]  little doctrine.
[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:08.360]  Because if it wasn't important, it wouldn't have been in the Bible.
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:12.080]  And let me tell you something, it's the New World Order that wants to unite everybody.
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:13.640]  Have you known World Council of Churches?
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:16.740]  Yeah, they want to unite all the churches, World Council of Churches.
[02:57:16.740 --> 02:57:18.400]  They want the Baptist- Ecumenical.
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:23.200]  Ecumenicalism, they want the Baptist, the Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Mormon,
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:24.200]  Jehovah's Witness.
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.920]  They want them all to join up.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:26.920]  That's the New World Order.
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:27.920]  Let's go to Australia real quick.
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.640]  John in Australia, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:32.640]  Alex, how are you?
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:37.800]  Look, I want to speak to another book, another book written by Carol Quigley that I'm sure
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:39.360]  you're familiar with, Tragedy and Hope.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:40.360]  Yes, sir.
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:45.440]  There's actually a passage in there that actually gives you the historical framework for understanding
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:51.840]  why weapons are needed in times of human civilization when there is enemies.
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:58.160]  Now, if you give me just five minutes to read it, you can use this against anyone who argues
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:57:59.160]  against you.
[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:00.160]  No, no.
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:02.680]  We're going to go to overdrive in a moment, but go ahead and tell people the passage,
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:03.680]  the page.
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:06.840]  We even sell Tragedy and Hope, it's like 1,100 pages long.
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:11.920]  This is top globalist admitting the whole program, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown.
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:15.520]  Give people the passage and page number, we'll come back and let you read it on air.
[02:58:15.520 --> 02:58:16.520]  No worries.
[02:58:16.520 --> 02:58:20.920]  Okay, I actually don't have the page number, I've just got to print it out right now.
[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:24.760]  No, I understand, but I'm saying if you give me the page number, I can actually go grab
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:30.880]  the book right over there on the bookshelf and then show people, give me a couple words
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:35.600]  out of it and then I can go to the, give me a name out of it and then I can go look up
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:38.360]  the page number in the back of the book.
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:39.360]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:40.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:56.840]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[02:58:56.840 --> 02:59:00.800]  through the year from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:04.360]  drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:06.700]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

[02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:17.560]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:21.560]  stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:22.720]  sister and my niece.
[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:26.800]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[02:59:26.800 --> 02:59:29.480]  Feed common sense as warning and do what I've done.

[03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:23.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:26.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I was talking to Pastor Anderson.
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:31.520]  He listens to us on XM 166, and they carry three hours that they come in at the second
[03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:33.760]  hour to the second, third, and fourth hour.
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:37.680]  For a while, I was doing four hours.
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:41.880]  And a lot of days, we do do the fourth hour, and here we are doing it.
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:45.440]  But we're talking to Sean in Australia.
[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:48.220]  This is about a five-minute segment, so you've got the floor.
[03:00:48.220 --> 03:00:51.480]  Go ahead and read from Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope.
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:53.000]  And then, guys, I don't see one over there.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.400]  Will you guys run me one in from the shipping department?
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:56.400]  Thank you.
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:57.400]  So, Sean, you've got four minutes.
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:00:58.400]  Start reading.
[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:02.840]  Okay, so firstly, Colin, you've got to understand that this book was actually intended for the
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.560]  intellectual community and for the elites themselves.
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:09.280]  They never actually, really, it was never targeted for the general population.
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:12.360]  So the general population can now use this as the weapon.
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:17.880]  Yeah, this was a control manual for globalists to understand why they were left and right,
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:19.880]  how they created the synthesis.
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:21.640]  Go ahead.
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:25.080]  Okay, so this is directly reading.
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:30.840]  It's on the military level in Western civilization, the 20th century, that chief development has
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:35.640]  been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:40.240]  Weapons are cheap and easy to get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after
[03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:42.120]  a short period of training.
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:46.400]  Armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers.
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:52.160]  Such weapons we call amateur weapons and such armies we might call mass armies of citizen
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:53.400]  soldiers.
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:58.800]  The age of Pericles in classical Greece and the 19th century in Western civilization were
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:05.080]  periods of amateur weapons and citizen soldiers, but the 19th century was preceded, as was
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:10.640]  the age of Pericles also, by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training
[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:12.200]  in their use.
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:17.520]  Such weapons we call specialist weapons, periods of specialist weapons are generally periods
[03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:20.200]  of small armies of professional soldiers.
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:25.200]  In a period of specialist weapons, the minority who have such weapons can usually force the
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:31.640]  majority who lack them to obey, thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:37.120]  a period of minority rule and authoritarian government, but a period of amateur weapons
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:41.000]  is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power.
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:46.960]  A majority can compel a minority to yield and a majority rule or even democratic government
[03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:47.960]  tends to rise.
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:52.880]  So what you've got to realize here in this passage is he refers to specialist weapons.
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:54.040]  Think about what we have right now.
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.880]  We have Skynet, total lockdown of the skies.
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:01.140]  We have specialist weapons, they're called drones.
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:05.920]  We have the specialist weapons against us against our health, it's called eugenics.
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:08.520]  So why do we need weapons?
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:13.440]  Because as we all know it's not for hunting, it's to actually equalize power.
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:21.120]  Now Carol Quigley characterizes that periods of specialist weapons which we are currently
[03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:27.520]  in today, the present, 2013, it's a period of specialist weapons, tend to give rise to
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:30.560]  a period of minority rule and authoritarian government.
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:32.920]  Now the term authoritarian is actually incorrect.
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:34.560]  Alex also uses it a lot.
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:38.880]  You should actually refer to it as totalitarian government.
[03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:44.920]  Now this totalitarian government is also in tandem with programs such as Agenda 21 and
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:50.000]  everything like that and the underlying ideology of this I would actually like to speak to.
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.400]  Alex was just talking before about how the elite or whatever you want to call them, worship
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:04:00.680]  a specific religion, they worship certain ideologies.
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:06.520]  They have basically, they recruit people into their organization through what I call the
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:12.280]  most extreme form of nepotism where they actually recruit people based on their ideologies alone.
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:18.840]  Now the undercurrent of ideology through all sciences, especially earth or environmental
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:23.360]  sciences is actually something called conservatism.
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:29.320]  The overwhelming belief from the scientific community is that the universe is entropic.
[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:35.960]  That means that with time, the universe eventually dies of a so-called heat death but if we look
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:40.640]  at anything, anything in history, we actually see counter-entropic development.
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:42.000]  Hey sir, let me stop you.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:45.600]  I've actually got the book here and its bibliography is big but not big enough.
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:49.240]  I'm not finding the, I remember reading this many years ago.
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:50.440]  Tell me where you found it.
[03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:55.200]  Send your link to showtipsninfoawars.com or give me the basic page number because I want
[03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:56.760]  to show TV viewers this.
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:57.760]  You're right.
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:58.760]  This is big news.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:04:59.760]  I'm going to come back to you.
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:00.760]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:09.760]  Myself, my family, the infoawars.com team want to relay to you and your families that
[03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:14.760]  we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:05:14.760 --> 03:05:20.400]  Infoawars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats but we can't do that without
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:21.400]  your help.
[03:05:21.400 --> 03:05:26.640]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infoawars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.640 --> 03:05:32.680]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:36.140]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:36.140 --> 03:05:42.360]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:49.800]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:51.360]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:53.720]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.720 --> 03:05:55.560]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.560 --> 03:06:01.840]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.840 --> 03:06:02.840]  My name is Steven Huir.
[03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:06.960]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions
[03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:10.280]  have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:14.140]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking or more serious
[03:06:14.140 --> 03:06:18.640]  matters like inability to focus, speak normally or remember things, the emphasis to getting
[03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:22.320]  one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:26.720]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione
[03:06:26.720 --> 03:06:27.720]  production.
[03:06:27.720 --> 03:06:31.760]  My name is Angie and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:36.200]  I got him on One World Way and in two months his constipation is gone.
[03:06:36.200 --> 03:06:40.680]  He has become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me and he has made
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:41.680]  his first friend.
[03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:45.720]  He's doing great and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:50.680]  You could offer him a present or a cake and he would prefer the One World Way.
[03:06:50.680 --> 03:07:02.800]  Go to Oneworldway.com, that's Oneworldway.com or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:06.800]  In this unpredictable world, disaster can strike anyone.
[03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:13.060]  That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove in a can.
[03:07:13.060 --> 03:07:18.000]  When power goes out and gas lines are down, the portable, safe, easy to use stove in a
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:23.320]  can cooks food up to four hours and boils water in as little as five minutes.
[03:07:23.320 --> 03:07:25.660]  Stove in a can comes with everything you need.
[03:07:25.660 --> 03:07:31.520]  The stove, fuel, even waterproof matches, all in a compact, durable, heavy-duty container.
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:38.160]  Plus the all-natural, non-explosive, 100% waterproof fuel source can be stored indefinitely.
[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:42.720]  Say goodbye to the hassle and danger of propane, lighter fluid, or gas.

[03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:10.120]  From his Central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.120 --> 03:08:16.160]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:18.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back to Sean in Australia.
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:23.560]  If you just joined us, he brought up a tragedy and hope written by the head of political
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:26.720]  science at one time at Georgetown University.
[03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:31.320]  That's where the globalists send their people to get the inside scoop.
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:36.840]  And only 1,000 copies of this book were originally printed back in the mid-1960s to be given
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:40.440]  to the CIA section chief, State Department people.
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:47.800]  It was commissioned over a decade by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations, Quigley later
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:50.160]  when this came out, had to admit that.
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:54.280]  And he brags in the book, actually, that he was commissioned and allowed into the Annals,
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:57.200]  the Bilderberg Group, and others.
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:08:59.560]  And he says, I believe this should be an open conspiracy.
[03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:02.840]  It's a great idea to have world government to engineer everybody.
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:06.240]  And the book is, let me tell you how many pages long.
[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:11.160]  It's over 1,350 pages long.
[03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:13.480]  Now the plates got out.
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:18.080]  And Patriot groups associated with the John Birch Society and others printed tens of thousands
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:20.280]  of these up in the 70s.
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:25.600]  And there were even threats of legal actions and things, but the point is they backed off.
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:27.480]  And we found the publisher that republished it.
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:31.400]  We do, I wasn't getting to sell the book today, but the caller from Australia called in and
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:37.360]  said, have you read what's on page 1,200, The Unfolding of Time?
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:43.640]  And I'm gonna show view, and it's also in chapter two, The Unfolding of Time, but also
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:47.340]  in chapter two, they say similar things.
[03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:51.920]  And yes, I read most of this book, I'm gonna be honest with you, it's 1,300 pages long.
[03:09:51.920 --> 03:09:56.680]  I read most of it back in about 1996, and a few years ago, I tried to read it again.
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:09:58.900]  I'm gonna be honest, I haven't read the whole thing.
[03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:02.440]  But the whole deal is how we control the left and the right, we want there to be the illusion
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:03.440]  of choice.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:06.960]  We wanna bankrupt people, make them dependent, only we'll be able to operate.
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:09.820]  We like fascism, we like socialism, we like communism.
[03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:14.600]  As long as it centralizes, we hate libertarianism, we hate freedom cuz it makes people uppity.
[03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:18.340]  And this caller was bringing this up, and I remember reading this when he was saying
[03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:24.120]  it, I knew he wasn't lying because I had the remnants of the memory of that.
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:25.960]  I guess that's what the beginning of wisdom is.
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:28.120]  You don't remember it all, you just remember pieces.
[03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:29.880]  You know the person's being accurate.
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:33.940]  And he says right here, we don't want the general public having arms because it makes
[03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:36.520]  it a free society and we can't stand up against them.
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:40.140]  We want specialized armies to basically oppress them.
[03:10:40.140 --> 03:10:44.480]  And he goes on to talk about how basically the founders wanted a citizen army in Western
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:48.040]  civilization and freedom, and they don't want that.
[03:10:48.040 --> 03:10:51.960]  And the caller's like, this will defeat the gun control debate.
[03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:54.960]  Point out the tyrants want our guns, well, that is what's defeating them.
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:58.640]  Sure, you could argue let's put mentally ill people in a registry so they can't own a gun.
[03:10:58.640 --> 03:10:59.640]  They already have that.
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:04.640]  Adam Lanza tried to buy guns five times, he failed, okay?
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:07.480]  So they don't care, they want our guns.
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:11.600]  They're gonna use anything reasonable to enslave us, they're not reasonable.
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:14.440]  So their reason to want our guns is to enslave us.
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:18.800]  They're arming to the teeth while telling us it's bad for us to have any guns.
[03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:25.740]  I wanna go back to Pastor, who's here in studio with us today, and he's got the new, well,
[03:11:25.740 --> 03:11:30.160]  he's part of the new film, Pastor Anderson, Let No Man Deceive You After the Tribulation
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:31.360]  film.
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:38.280]  What is your take on this Carol Quigley passage and what the caller was raising?
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:41.000]  Well, it's all part of the same agenda.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.080]  In order to totally enslave people, you're gonna have to take away their guns, you're
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:46.320]  gonna have to take away their weapons.
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:52.320]  The Bible clearly says that the Antichrist is gonna make war with the saints and overcome
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:53.320]  them.
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:54.320]  Well, how's he gonna do that?
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:12:00.760]  Obviously, he's gonna put us in a society where we have no freedom, where we're completely
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:04.000]  controlled, completely surveilled, we're not gonna have any weapons, we're not gonna be
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:05.440]  able to defend ourselves.
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:09.680]  And that's why the Bible tells us that Christians are gonna be beheaded en masse because of
[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:12.400]  the fact that the government's gonna have the control to carry out that.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:19.320]  The TV preacher told me that Scottie's on the Enterprise is gonna beat me up.
[03:12:19.320 --> 03:12:21.760]  That's about as true as Star Trek is true.
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:26.580]  You know, I mean, the idea of the rapture taking place before the tribulation is about
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:31.880]  as biblical as the Starship Enterprise picking us up before the tribulation.
[03:12:31.880 --> 03:12:32.880]  All right, I wanna go back-
[03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:33.880]  Number one is found in scripture.
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:37.080]  I wanna go back to the caller, but if you just join us, I'm gonna read the passage from
[03:12:37.080 --> 03:12:40.700]  page 1,200 that the caller was raising.
[03:12:40.700 --> 03:12:46.680]  When weapons are of the amateur type of the 1880s, as they were in Greece in the 5th century
[03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:51.640]  BC, they are widely possessed by citizens' power is similarly dispersed.
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:54.520]  So dispersed power is everybody being armed.
[03:12:54.520 --> 03:12:55.520]  And that sound good?
[03:12:55.520 --> 03:13:02.440]  No, the UN says they want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, quote, because
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:07.720]  it threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state, UN treaty on general, small arms
[03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:14.520]  assignment, ratified and accepted for full attempted passage at the full UN assembly,
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:16.600]  July 7th, 2001.
[03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:21.000]  I mean, this is their plan, they say, cuz they know people aren't reading what they're
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  saying.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.800]  I mean, they're like, we're gonna enslave these people, we're gonna cut their food off
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:26.040]  so we can sterilize whoever we want.
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:29.040]  Once we got them all on welfare, they'll all be social engineered.
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:31.080]  We can just give them shots to kill their butt.
[03:13:31.080 --> 03:13:34.080]  But we wanna kill them over a couple years, they don't know we killed them.
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:36.640]  But then the Africans know to run at the villages when the UN shows up.
[03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:37.960]  Let's continue.
[03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:40.640]  And again, let's show people from the actual book.
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:45.920]  If you guys can document Cam in on here, I wanna show people this right here, right here.
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:49.580]  When the weapons, thank you, when the weapons are of an amateur type as the 1880s, as they
[03:13:49.580 --> 03:13:54.200]  were in Greece in the 5th century BC, they are widely possessed by citizens' power is
[03:13:54.200 --> 03:13:55.920]  similarly dispersed.
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:03.320]  And no minority can compel the majority to yield to its will, globalist foreign bankers.
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:09.720]  With such an amateur weapons system, that's what he calls it, in other conditions are
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:12.000]  not totally unfavorable.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:16.800]  See that's saying it's a problem for the elite if people are armed.
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:23.740]  We are likely to find majority rule, this is a big problem, and a relatively democratic
[03:14:23.740 --> 03:14:24.740]  political system.
[03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:33.020]  But on the contrary, when a period can be dominated by complex and expensive weapons
[03:14:33.020 --> 03:14:38.160]  that only a few persons can afford to possess, robot armies, drones, or can learn to use,
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:43.680]  we have a situation where the minority who controls such specialist weapons can dominate
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:48.840]  the majority who lack them, and the minority is a eugenicist, Luciferian psycho group.
[03:14:48.840 --> 03:14:51.400]  You might not want them to be the only ones with weapons, just an idea.
[03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:56.800]  In such a society, sooner or later, an authoritarian political system that reflects the inequity
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:59.720]  and control of weapons will be established.
[03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:04.320]  At the present time, there are systems to be little reason to doubt that the specialist
[03:15:04.320 --> 03:15:07.960]  weapons of the day will continue to dominate the military picture in the foreseeable future.
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:10.740]  And I'm gonna do a whole piece on this, cuz it's so important.
[03:15:10.740 --> 03:15:15.440]  He goes on to say how terrible it is that in the United States, we have guns.
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:19.760]  That's right over here, cuz they're not gonna be able to have their social engineering system,
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:22.720]  because of the United States and the guns, and England.
[03:15:22.720 --> 03:15:24.640]  Well, forget that, they got the guns in England.
[03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:28.520]  I'm not gonna spend all day on that, Pastor Anderson, another comment there and then we'll
[03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:29.520]  go back to the caller.
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:34.000]  He talks about the distribution of power amongst a lot of people versus being ruled by a small
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  minority.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:38.440]  Well, when we look at the book of Revelation, we see the end of this is that all the power
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:41.960]  is gonna be concentrated in ten kings or ten leaders.
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:42.960]  And then all of those-
[03:15:42.960 --> 03:15:44.280]  Who give power unto the beast.
[03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:49.660]  Exactly, then those ten kings will further give all their power to one man, who's called
[03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:50.800]  the Antichrist.
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:54.640]  And this man's gonna be given all of the power, he's gonna rule over the entire world.
[03:15:54.640 --> 03:15:57.120]  And he's gonna have cures and diseases, life extension.
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:16:04.840]  It says his image will be projected into all places, a hologram TV, it describes that.
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:08.440]  Exactly, and so he is going to rule over everyone.
[03:16:08.440 --> 03:16:12.480]  And not only is he gonna have all the political power, but he's also going to be worshipped
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:13.860]  as God.
[03:16:13.860 --> 03:16:17.400]  And the Christians are going to declare him to be the second coming of Jesus Christ, the
[03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:19.080]  apostate Christians.
[03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:22.600]  That's because they believe this must be the rapture or something.
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:24.720]  Yeah, this is the second coming of Christ.
[03:16:24.720 --> 03:16:28.840]  And then the Jews are gonna say, this is our Messiah, we've been waiting for.
[03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:35.760]  And then the Islamic people, they will declare him to be the fifth Imam or whatever, or the
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:36.980]  Imam Mahdi.
[03:16:36.980 --> 03:16:41.080]  And then the Buddhists are gonna say, well, this is the new embodiment of the Dalai Lama
[03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:42.080]  or whatever.
[03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:43.080]  And so-
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:46.400]  That's why the UN already says, you can have your religion, but it's gonna worship this.
[03:16:46.400 --> 03:16:52.400]  Exactly, all of the major mainline religions, including apostate Christianity, are all going
[03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.400]  to be brought-
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:56.560]  Well, the Pope's been saying we need a one world religion and all the same.
[03:16:56.560 --> 03:16:57.560]  Exactly.
[03:16:57.560 --> 03:16:58.560]  And they're all lining it up.
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:03.880]  Exactly, and all of these major false religions, they're all looking for some Messiah, okay?
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:08.200]  Now, yes, we are looking for the second coming of Jesus Christ, but we know it comes after
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:09.200]  the tribulation.
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:11.560]  We know that the imposter comes first.
[03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:13.380]  Now think about how evil this is.
[03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:18.280]  The Bible teaches us that before the second coming of Christ, there's an imposter coming-
[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:19.660]  And a great delusion.
[03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:24.280]  A great delusion, and an imposter who comes first and claims to be Jesus Christ before
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:26.180]  the real Jesus Christ comes back.
[03:17:26.180 --> 03:17:28.840]  And what is this pre-tribulation rapture doctrine teaching?
[03:17:28.840 --> 03:17:33.120]  To expect Jesus to come at any moment, who's really coming, the antichrist.
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:38.220]  Now, exactly, now let's explain this here in overdrive, powerful information.
[03:17:38.220 --> 03:17:42.840]  If you're looking at this, this is the only argument that people can say to shoot this
[03:17:42.840 --> 03:17:44.320]  down.
[03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:47.640]  The elites looked at this science fiction book, the Bible, and said, this is a great
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:52.340]  idea, this hallucination, the guy on the Isle of Patmos had, John had, John the Revelator
[03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:53.340]  and stuff.
[03:17:53.340 --> 03:17:56.220]  This is a great idea, let's just use this.
[03:17:56.220 --> 03:17:59.500]  And then, let's go ahead and worship Lucifer, cuz I've studied the globalist, they do, they
[03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:01.120]  are into the occult.
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:05.160]  So they've just adopted it, they've just adopted the bad guy of the book as a self-fulfilling
[03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:06.160]  prophecy.
[03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:07.160]  What do you say to that?
[03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:10.480]  Well, I say the fool had said in his heart, there is no God.
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:13.620]  I'm a Bible-believing Christian, I believe every word of the Bible.
[03:18:13.620 --> 03:18:16.720]  And I think it's hard to look at all the evil in this world.
[03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:17.960]  And it's hard to look at that.
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:19.800]  Well, there is a design that's above humans.
[03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:20.800]  There's gotta be a design.
[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:25.500]  I'm sorry, but I do not believe that if we travel all the way to the top, we're just
[03:18:25.500 --> 03:18:26.580]  gonna get to the bankers.
[03:18:26.580 --> 03:18:27.580]  I know they're at the top.
[03:18:27.580 --> 03:18:31.580]  No, no, no, no, I've studied it, there is a spirit behind it.
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:33.920]  You can see it animating and working.
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:39.020]  This conspiracy is multi-generational, it's been going on for hundreds of years.
[03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:45.680]  And it is magic, I mean, the enemy has over the horizon radar, they've got a lot of tricks.
[03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:49.600]  It's not just one man or one group of men or one family, this has been going on for
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:53.380]  hundreds of years because Satan is at the top of that pyramid.
[03:18:53.380 --> 03:18:58.700]  And the bankers and Bill Gates and these high up globalists, eugenicists, they are working
[03:18:58.700 --> 03:18:59.700]  for him.
[03:18:59.700 --> 03:19:01.700]  They are getting their marching orders from him.
[03:19:01.700 --> 03:19:03.840]  And a lot of people who don't believe in these quote unquote-
[03:19:03.840 --> 03:19:07.760]  I've studied all these people, they're all into weird secrets and stuff.
[03:19:07.760 --> 03:19:11.360]  And a lot of people, the reason why they don't believe in so-called conspiracy theories,
[03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:14.440]  you can't tell me that these people have gotten together and orchestrated this.
[03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:18.260]  No, no, it's Satan that's directing them, not all of them might even know what their
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:19.260]  part is.
[03:19:19.260 --> 03:19:20.260]  No, no, they're compartmentalized, yeah.
[03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:21.260]  They're compartmentalized.
[03:19:21.260 --> 03:19:25.720]  And the Bible says, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
[03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:31.220]  against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
[03:19:31.220 --> 03:19:33.060]  wickedness in high places.
[03:19:33.060 --> 03:19:34.060]  Perfect description.
[03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:38.920]  Yeah, the Bible warns us, rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high
[03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:39.920]  places.
[03:19:39.920 --> 03:19:43.140]  That's what needs to be preached from the- And look at all, look at how they keep busting
[03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:44.960]  senators with underage kids.
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:45.960]  Exactly.
[03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:50.440]  I mean, you don't even get in the door unless you like to hurt children.
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:51.440]  Exactly.
[03:19:51.440 --> 03:19:52.440]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:55.800]  We'll be back, I promise we're going to go back to Sean in Australia, then a bunch of
[03:19:55.800 --> 03:20:02.160]  other people, XM listeners, you name it, we'll see the whole hour overdrive, get ready.
[03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:06.800]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:20:06.800 --> 03:20:11.140]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:20:11.140 --> 03:20:15.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[03:20:15.800 --> 03:20:16.800]  you to have.
[03:20:16.800 --> 03:20:22.480]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:20:22.480 --> 03:20:26.820]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[03:20:26.820 --> 03:20:30.840]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:34.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:20:34.360 --> 03:20:38.020]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[03:20:38.020 --> 03:20:42.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:20:42.600 --> 03:20:46.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[03:20:46.560 --> 03:20:47.920]  one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:13.480]  We have Steven L. Anderson, a pastor, and he's one of the very informative people in
[03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:16.800]  this amazing film, After the Tribulation, Let No Man Seem You.
[03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:24.480]  New film out available at InfowarsShop.com or link through at Infowars.com and also the
[03:24:24.480 --> 03:24:28.960]  book by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer son Timothy Baldwin, Romans 13, The
[03:24:28.960 --> 03:24:30.940]  True Meaning of Submission.
[03:24:30.940 --> 03:24:34.280]  Very important to get all your preachers out there, they'll probably curl up like snakes
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:38.140]  and hiss at you and pull out a pitchfork, but no, most of them don't know.
[03:24:38.140 --> 03:24:40.000]  It's our job to challenge them.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:44.440]  I'm not on some high horse either here, folks, I mean I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, I know right
[03:24:44.440 --> 03:24:49.480]  from wrong, I know deception from the truth, because I have discernment, I mean anybody
[03:24:49.480 --> 03:24:53.440]  who has discernment would just be freaking out over all this, especially when you integrate
[03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:58.600]  it with history and everything else and what the globalists are doing.
[03:24:58.600 --> 03:25:01.960]  The more I learn about the New World Order and then the more I go to the Bible, it's
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:08.500]  like oh my gosh, now I could only now, 38 years old, almost 39, 39 a couple days, actually
[03:25:08.500 --> 03:25:13.320]  understand the Bible and it's just so deep now, unlike anything I've ever read, once
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:15.480]  you understand that you know it is inspired.
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:19.560]  And it is a warning, I mean God wouldn't put us through this to test us if he didn't give
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:20.560]  us a handbook.
[03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:23.920]  Okay, and I'm not trying to preach here, it's just that you have to understand, ladies and
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:28.840]  gentlemen, we are facing an elite that believe they're being directed by spirits.
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:33.640]  Skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, the UN has this Luciferian Chapel in New York in it,
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:34.640]  it's real.
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:40.020]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Ed, Eric, Nick, Nick, and others, but Sean in Australia, you got
[03:25:40.020 --> 03:25:45.400]  us off on this thing about Carol Quigley's book, where they admit free peoples have weapons,
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:49.120]  but we want a technocratic elite with super weapons because we want control.
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:55.260]  Yes, amazing, here's one of their top statisticians, tacticians admitting this, but it's like admitting
[03:25:55.260 --> 03:25:59.940]  the sun came up this morning, but yes, they want our guns to enslave us, not to keep the
[03:25:59.940 --> 03:26:00.940]  children safe.
[03:26:00.940 --> 03:26:01.940]  Go ahead.
[03:26:01.940 --> 03:26:10.360]  Well, you see, this book, Tragedy and Hope, is an informed historical account, but what
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:17.120]  it lacks is the actual understanding of the proper framework for understanding human history,
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:21.520]  and that is looking at human history based on its developmental qualitative state.
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:26.080]  Now, let me give the readers an example just based on this.
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:30.200]  The point is they're saying we have the will to power, we're in charge, that gives us the
[03:26:30.200 --> 03:26:35.760]  right to be authoritarian, as if some moral authoritarianism, it never works like that,
[03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:37.340]  it always leads to total rot.
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:41.360]  But of course, some academic feeling good about himself because he's invited into the
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:44.160]  upper halls of power is delusional.
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:46.960]  This person is not spiritually smart.
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:49.960]  I gotta jump to other callers, go ahead and finish it up quick cuz we gotta go.
[03:26:49.960 --> 03:26:56.480]  Let me give the callers a quick example, now for example, I'm talking about organizational
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:26:57.480]  development in history.
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:03.360]  If we look at his passage, he says, the medieval period in which the best weapon was usually
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:09.300]  a mounted knight on horseback, clearly a specialist weapon, was a period of minority rule and
[03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:10.300]  authoritarian government.
[03:27:10.300 --> 03:27:12.400]  Once again, it should be totalitarian.
[03:27:12.400 --> 03:27:17.920]  Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete, along with his stone castle, by the invention
[03:27:17.920 --> 03:27:22.840]  of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so
[03:27:22.840 --> 03:27:27.720]  difficult to use until 1800, that the minority rule and authoritarian government continued,
[03:27:27.720 --> 03:27:31.880]  even though that the government sought to enforce its rule, by shifting from mounted
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:34.280]  knights to professional pikemen and musketeers.
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:37.960]  Now this shift is a qualitative upshift in development.
[03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:42.520]  You see, the new phase of technology, the gunpowder, is a higher-
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:47.080]  No, I agree, this is all gonna leak out everywhere, the bioweapons everywhere, and they're gonna
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:49.080]  kill everybody.
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:52.440]  And is that where you're going, the elite are creating their own destruction by a global
[03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:53.440]  arms race?
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:28:00.120]  Well, where I'm going is that, if you look at human history, we see these changes.
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:07.040]  Now, the scientists who actually have now taken the overall commanding, the overall
[03:28:07.040 --> 03:28:12.600]  directing ideological position in this global-
[03:28:12.600 --> 03:28:14.600]  Gotta finish up in 30 seconds.
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:18.240]  They believe in something called, they believe in the second law of thermodynamics.
[03:28:18.240 --> 03:28:23.520]  Now, I'll issue a challenge right now to every scientist worldwide who believes in the big
[03:28:23.520 --> 03:28:27.640]  bang in the context of the second law of thermodynamics, if you want to hold me on for another-
[03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:31.680]  Now I gotta go, listen, this is what I do with callers, I'll let one person on for a
[03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:34.120]  long time and then everybody else can get on.
[03:28:34.120 --> 03:28:36.920]  Sean, if I wouldn't have gotten to other callers, I never would have gotten to you, I gotta
[03:28:36.920 --> 03:28:37.920]  let you go.
[03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:42.560]  And we got a long segment coming up here, and I promise we're gonna get to Ed, Eric,
[03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:46.880]  Nick, Nick, and then that's gonna be it for calls, our XM listeners and shortwave listeners
[03:28:46.880 --> 03:28:47.880]  and AM and FM listeners.
[03:28:47.880 --> 03:28:51.200]  We're gonna get to you, and then we're gonna give him some time to finish up some other
[03:28:51.200 --> 03:28:53.600]  topics and some other news that I haven't gotten to.
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:56.760]  But do you wanna comment on where he was going with all that?
[03:28:56.760 --> 03:29:03.480]  Well, I mean, it's really interesting information and the Bible definitely is very clear that
[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:05.480]  every single person should have a weapon.
[03:29:05.480 --> 03:29:09.580]  All the way back to the book of Deuteronomy, he talks about every single citizen having
[03:29:09.580 --> 03:29:12.760]  a weapon and having a paddle on the back of their weapon and so forth.
[03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:13.960]  Because it restrains evil.
[03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:18.120]  And then also even Jesus Christ himself in the Garden of Gethsemane said, hey, if you
[03:29:18.120 --> 03:29:20.340]  don't have a sword, you need to sell your coat.
[03:29:20.340 --> 03:29:23.800]  And they try to spin that now and say it was misinterpreted.
[03:29:23.800 --> 03:29:25.840]  He was talking about a literal sword.
[03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:29.400]  They pulled out two literal swords and said, Lord, we have two swords, and he said it's
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:30.400]  enough.
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:33.200]  And so the disciples had swords.
[03:29:33.200 --> 03:29:35.600]  Plus somebody just had their ear chopped off with a sword.
[03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:36.600]  We're talking about swords.
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:39.520]  Yeah, Peter pulled out a sword and chopped the ear off.
[03:29:39.520 --> 03:29:41.320]  Don't tell me that was a metaphor for the Bible.
[03:29:41.320 --> 03:29:44.800]  He didn't pull out his Bible and chop that guy's ears off with a with a paper cut with
[03:29:44.800 --> 03:29:45.800]  a Bible.
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:47.800]  It was a literal sword.
[03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:49.400]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:51.560]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:52.840]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.840 --> 03:29:55.240]  The Empire's on the run.

[03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:06.240]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:32:06.240 --> 03:32:09.200]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:32:09.200 --> 03:32:14.000]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:18.320]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world class healer.
[03:32:18.320 --> 03:32:23.880]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[03:32:23.880 --> 03:32:28.960]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[03:32:28.960 --> 03:32:34.100]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[03:32:34.100 --> 03:32:35.240]  normal cell.
[03:32:35.240 --> 03:32:39.000]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:43.000]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:50.920]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora dot com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[03:32:50.920 --> 03:32:58.280]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit Carnivora dot com.
[03:32:58.280 --> 03:33:01.920]  That's your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[03:33:01.920 --> 03:33:10.920]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:19.000]  It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually
[03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:21.360]  mammals.
[03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:28.280]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:31.600]  environment, but you humans do not.
[03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:40.320]  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:51.000]  The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:55.720]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[03:33:55.720 --> 03:33:58.840]  Do you know what it is?
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:02.080]  A virus.
[03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:17.520]  Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague and we are the cure.
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:21.680]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:34:21.680 --> 03:34:23.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:34:23.680 --> 03:34:31.240]  Yep, that's what the globalists think of us, but then they try to block development, so
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:34.920]  it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that we are these dogs, they say we are, but I study the
[03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:35.920]  globalists.
[03:34:35.920 --> 03:34:38.240]  They're a bunch of inbred people that are psychopaths.
[03:34:38.240 --> 03:34:41.620]  We're going to go to your calls right now.
[03:34:41.620 --> 03:34:43.120]  We have a new t-shirt out.
[03:34:43.120 --> 03:34:45.360]  We haven't sold this for over a year and a half.
[03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:50.720]  We had a Obama joker symbol that went viral all over the world, and I said it was a limited
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:54.920]  edition t-shirt of it, and we haven't sold it in over a year and a half.
[03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:58.080]  So we've redesigned a new one because that was limited edition.
[03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:02.540]  Janae Meadows, our star graphics person, they're all stars, but she's amazing.
[03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:08.080]  She came up with this of a bunch that we did that is my favorite and it says, Tyrant Obama
[03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:10.240]  and him as the Joker.
[03:35:10.240 --> 03:35:13.840]  And Obama-noids will ask you what it means, others will, you can explain what a tyrant
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:14.840]  is.
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:19.560]  And in our most popular t-shirt and put it on the back, the come and take it AK-47 with
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:23.480]  the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, words inside of it.
[03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:26.200]  This I believe is the best t-shirt we've ever come out with.
[03:35:26.200 --> 03:35:30.720]  It is available at Infowars shop.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:30.720 --> 03:35:37.560]  Both URLs take you to the same place or by calling 888-25-33139, and your purchase of
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:41.400]  books and videos and materials funds our entire operation.
[03:35:41.400 --> 03:35:46.480]  And look, I got 50 people here, 51, I wanna hire five or six more to quite frankly do
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:48.440]  radio news cuz stations all want it.
[03:35:48.440 --> 03:35:52.360]  And that first five, six minute segment, we're getting ready to get the show cut down to
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:55.560]  its official version every day with the nightly news.
[03:35:55.560 --> 03:35:57.200]  It's all happening.
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:02.160]  It's all happening and we just put out 150,000 free bumper stickers in 50 packs with the
[03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:05.400]  free shipping to anybody that wanted them at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:09.440]  I think all those slots are filled now, 3,000 of them.
[03:36:09.440 --> 03:36:14.160]  I mean, I know it's coming down, it's in steps downwards.
[03:36:14.160 --> 03:36:18.280]  We're gone into another big step and now another, and it's gonna accelerate, boom, boom, boom,
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:19.280]  boom, boom.
[03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:23.880]  So I'm just like, fire everything, hit them, go, boom.
[03:36:23.880 --> 03:36:28.720]  My gut is what I follow, my spirit, and it tells me what to do off the intellectual things.
[03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:32.640]  But what my gut tells me is also picked up by everything in front of me.
[03:36:32.640 --> 03:36:36.160]  It's amazing, it knows what's around the corner and then boom, it's there.
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:41.440]  And I trust but verify my gut, this will sell out as well as 30,000 of them available, 70,000
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:42.440]  at the streets.
[03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:47.640]  In key areas in Texas is the Infowar, but the tyrants, why the tyrants want the guns,

[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:20.440]  We're putting a lot of old archive stuff, ten years of prisonplanet.tv in April, 17
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:23.280]  years on air, a lot of old stuff we're now putting there.
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:25.680]  But the goal is to reach people.
[03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:29.600]  So we're gonna start in the next few weeks on a limited basis, I wanna make sure it works
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:31.520]  well and doesn't bankrupt me.
[03:37:31.520 --> 03:37:35.720]  We're gonna have the three hour radio show in a medium quality, the high quality would
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:36.720]  be for subscribers.
[03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:43.360]  But the goal is to get the word out to people, prisonplanet.tv, the video feed of the three
[03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:46.300]  hour today, it's a four hour radio show.
[03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:51.680]  That will be fed out to everyone that signs up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:37:51.680 --> 03:37:58.180]  In a week or two, you'll get a link to the test beta streamed to make sure we can afford
[03:37:58.180 --> 03:38:00.160]  it and everything.
[03:38:00.160 --> 03:38:06.440]  And so we're definitely gonna test that out over a few months.
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:11.920]  So again, I want to encourage everybody to sign up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:18.620]  Now I promise to go to your calls and Pastor Steven Anderson is here also in studio with
[03:38:18.620 --> 03:38:20.660]  us today.
[03:38:20.660 --> 03:38:25.360]  But other points you'd like to add, you wanted to get into Plato's Republic, which is a key
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:26.360]  globalist model.
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:30.440]  You know, Tarpley will tell you that that's the model of the oligarchy in the New World,
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:31.440]  or Plato's Republic.
[03:38:31.440 --> 03:38:34.440]  We're gonna talk about that after we race through calls here.
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:41.880]  But it's important to read the globalist intelligentsia's own manuals to not just believe us, but that
[03:38:41.880 --> 03:38:45.600]  caller called in and said, hey, Tragedy and Hope says disarm the people to make them slaves,
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:46.600]  top globalist book.
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:50.880]  I go pull it off the shelf, sure enough, what he reads there, trust but verify.
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:54.480]  And again, it's hundreds and hundreds of books I've read where they admit their plan for
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:56.440]  global government and global enslavement.
[03:38:56.440 --> 03:39:01.560]  Ed in New York, thanks for holding, you're listening on shortwave, go ahead.
[03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:08.200]  Yes, I heard you describe that you have different products you have for sale just now for a
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:09.200]  while.
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:16.520]  And over the years, I thought that I had something to contribute to your show.
[03:39:16.520 --> 03:39:22.760]  I thought it was the technology that Pat Flanagan has described in the book by Nick Bejic, Towards
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:29.240]  a New Alchemy, where the neurophone he describes, I believe is miniaturized.
[03:39:29.240 --> 03:39:34.240]  Yeah, they're now selling neurophones, they've got all sorts of new products.
[03:39:34.240 --> 03:39:39.600]  The new Google Glasses have a neurophone and broadcast into your skull, into the middle
[03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:40.600]  ear.
[03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:42.560]  So that's the big technology they're going for.
[03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:46.760]  Yeah, do you have any comments on that?
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:50.080]  Neurophone only receives, it doesn't transmit.
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:56.640]  Well, I'm talking about, guys, just type it in right now, Google Glasses broadcast sound
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:39:58.480]  directly into the middle ear.
[03:39:58.480 --> 03:40:02.720]  The point is that 15 years ago they had Coke machines in Japan that projected you, nobody
[03:40:02.720 --> 03:40:05.280]  else can hear it, and it goes through to the skull.
[03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:10.040]  All right, I appreciate your call, I'm not sure we're talking about neurophone, write
[03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:11.040]  me a letter.
[03:40:11.040 --> 03:40:16.200]  Okay, about that, let's go to Eric in Wyoming, then we're gonna go to Nick listening on XM.
[03:40:16.200 --> 03:40:17.920]  Eric in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[03:40:17.920 --> 03:40:23.320]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones, my name is Eric Miller, I'm not hiding my identity.
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:26.040]  We had an incident here at 1006 Plum Street.
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:29.640]  Hold on, hold on, sir, sir, let me put you on hold.
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:32.920]  We don't like people, nobody does this to talk radio.
[03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:35.520]  Sometimes we get a lot of great calls, sometimes we get calls that are interesting, but they're
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:40.440]  all over the map, especially when I go into a fourth hour and people have been holding.
[03:40:40.440 --> 03:40:45.520]  Listen, you call in, you could be saying somebody else's name, I don't think you're a liar,
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:49.400]  you sound like a reasonable guy, but other people can spoof and call in and say, I'm
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:52.520]  this person at this address, this is happening.
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:56.040]  And then we can get in trouble for letting that information go out.
[03:40:56.040 --> 03:40:59.700]  You understand that's a dirty trick people do, so that's why we don't like people giving
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:01.160]  out their last name.
[03:41:01.160 --> 03:41:04.520]  Now they're a public figure and they call in and we think we recognize their voice,
[03:41:04.520 --> 03:41:06.760]  we put them on hold, call them back, verify who they are.
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:10.880]  Okay, now I'm not saying you're doing this, but just tell us about the incident, what
[03:41:10.880 --> 03:41:11.880]  happened to you?
[03:41:11.880 --> 03:41:17.640]  We got smart meters, we have Agenda 21 in the capital city of Cheyenne, Wyoming, we
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:22.720]  got smart meters, we have Agenda 21, we have international building codes.
[03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:29.720]  And we were forced, all right, by three Cheyenne Lightroom power workers and a deputy while
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:33.280]  I was away, they came and threatened my wife.
[03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:37.720]  Yeah, they put the eavesdropping that dowels into all your electronics on record and is
[03:41:37.720 --> 03:41:39.680]  gonna quote, control your temperature.
[03:41:39.680 --> 03:41:42.760]  They put the little, that's a little robot, it's a drone.
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:46.880]  It's a, they admit they're going to robots, it just hit me.
[03:41:46.880 --> 03:41:51.560]  The smart meter is a little robot that's plugged into the side of your house spying on you,
[03:41:51.560 --> 03:41:53.120]  it's a robot spy.
[03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:54.400]  Okay, what happened to you?
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:41:58.700]  We're seeing the videos of the police coming with the smart meters and some are saying,
[03:41:58.700 --> 03:42:02.280]  we don't care if you even turn your power off, you're going to have it slave, go ahead.
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:07.560]  Yeah, so anyway, they forced away and I referred to them as the four cowards while I was away
[03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:12.440]  from home, they came and intimidated my wife or else, all right?
[03:42:12.440 --> 03:42:18.600]  Now, no man wants to come home and see his wife staring out the kitchen window in tears
[03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:21.820]  and wondering what happened, just happened.
[03:42:21.820 --> 03:42:26.560]  Now we got our smart meter, they also put a lock on it, which they took off later on
[03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:29.640]  and two tags, a tag for the lock.
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:33.000]  In other words, they were trying to demonize us for standing up.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:37.400]  No, I know, it's so weird, you don't want a smart meter admitted to rip you off?
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:41.360]  It's on record, they use them to rip people off, that's San Francisco Chronicle, you name
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:42.360]  it.
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:47.720]  It dials into all new appliances, have digital wireless and your TV, this dials into and
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:50.280]  it's all these health issues, you're weird.
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:54.520]  You care what we're putting on your house, you're weird, it's weird to care about anything.
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:59.800]  You don't like the army checkpoints on your highways and drills in every major city and
[03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:05.720]  TSA, two miles from here, TSA runs checkpoints on the road now, but that's no big deal, that's
[03:43:05.720 --> 03:43:07.840]  freedom, Pastor Anderson.
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:09.880]  So how did this end, sir?
[03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:15.640]  Well this ended with them forcing their way into my home and putting in the smart meter.
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:16.640]  Into the home?
[03:43:16.640 --> 03:43:21.720]  Yeah, well, they had to go to my home to get to my backyard cuz we have a fence that has
[03:43:21.720 --> 03:43:25.360]  high privacy fence that's over six feet and it says-
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:30.960]  Excuse me, this is a major felony, you've got a file suit on, official oppression, civil
[03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:34.840]  rights violations, just sue them, okay?
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:40.160]  And sir, you know what, I can tell you're a real guy, you wanna give out your name and
[03:43:40.160 --> 03:43:45.240]  info for any constitutional lawyers that wanna stand up for you and your family in the state
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:46.240]  of Washington?
[03:43:46.240 --> 03:43:47.240]  Yes.
[03:43:47.240 --> 03:43:48.240]  Okay, give out-
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:49.240]  And Wyoming we're in.
[03:43:49.240 --> 03:43:50.240]  Okay, what?
[03:43:50.240 --> 03:43:51.240]  We're in the state of Wyoming.
[03:43:51.240 --> 03:43:52.240]  Oh, okay, Wyoming, sorry, go ahead.
[03:43:52.240 --> 03:43:54.920]  Most conservative state and Cheyenne is the capital.
[03:43:54.920 --> 03:43:57.360]  I know, but this is happening to everybody right now.
[03:43:57.360 --> 03:43:59.040]  So they forced their way into the house?
[03:43:59.040 --> 03:44:03.120]  Well, they said or else, I got the phone call while I was up at the farm-
[03:44:03.120 --> 03:44:04.120]  Or else, or else.
[03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:05.120]  Or else.
[03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:06.120]  That's free country.
[03:44:06.120 --> 03:44:07.120]  Or else, and-
[03:44:07.120 --> 03:44:10.280]  You know what the answer is, go dark.
[03:44:10.280 --> 03:44:14.280]  You tell them you come remove it, you send them a cease and desist cuz courts like that,
[03:44:14.280 --> 03:44:16.840]  then you sue them when they don't remove it, go dark.
[03:44:16.840 --> 03:44:19.720]  Make a stand in the local news, make a big issue out of it.
[03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:23.200]  Believe me, you're the new Rosa Parks, this is the new civil rights issue, they want us
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:26.200]  fighting over race and all this stuff, this is what's happening.
[03:44:26.200 --> 03:44:29.960]  Okay, how do people, do you have an email address or something so lawyers can help you
[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:30.960]  in Wyoming?
[03:44:30.960 --> 03:44:31.960]  Yes, I do.
[03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:32.960]  Give it to us.
[03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:45.160]  All right, it's ebmcat9msn.com, Echo Victor Motel Charlie Alpha Tango 29 at msn.com.
[03:44:45.160 --> 03:44:54.480]  Yeah, what happened is Halliburton, not Halliburton, though they're involved, Ken Lay, I'm so tired,
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:44:55.480]  Enron.
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:44:59.920]  Enron developed this in the mid 90s as a scam, they're convicted of scamming, and they can
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:05.480]  control the prices, manipulate, gouge, and spy, this is all their smart growth plan.
[03:45:05.480 --> 03:45:08.940]  And so you just get that together, you fight it in your local community, everybody has
[03:45:08.940 --> 03:45:13.080]  to fight this because it's diabolical, God bless you, and I appreciate your call.
[03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:18.000]  They're also using the smart meters that are up on polls that dial into your smart meter.
[03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:21.840]  Those are hacking in, just like Google's been caught doing with their cars.
[03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:24.160]  Pastor Anderson comments on what he was saying.
[03:45:24.160 --> 03:45:28.280]  Well, unfortunately, I think I might have a smart meter at my house already.
[03:45:28.280 --> 03:45:31.880]  No, no, that's what they do, they just show up, they come across your yard, they put it
[03:45:31.880 --> 03:45:32.880]  on.
[03:45:32.880 --> 03:45:34.680]  Yeah, they never even asked me about it.
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:37.680]  It's just something that I think has just been installed a long time ago.
[03:45:37.680 --> 03:45:38.680]  And there it is.
[03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:41.960]  I don't really, you know, I think what they do is they charge you more when they feel
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:42.960]  like it.
[03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:46.080]  They track everything you're doing, and they grab all your wireless data, and they hack
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:47.080]  your computers.
[03:45:47.080 --> 03:45:49.080]  Well, I already know that I've been under surveillance.
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:50.080]  No, I know.
[03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:52.880]  But the point is, is that it's this total grid, right?
[03:45:52.880 --> 03:45:54.880]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[03:45:54.880 --> 03:45:56.560]  And I mean, it has to be that way.
[03:45:56.560 --> 03:46:00.080]  You know, it's like the Bible says, all these things must come to pass, but the end is not
[03:46:00.080 --> 03:46:01.080]  yet.
[03:46:01.080 --> 03:46:02.500]  You know, it has to be in place.
[03:46:02.500 --> 03:46:06.720]  The control grid has to be in place in order to get all the power.
[03:46:06.720 --> 03:46:08.600]  But we have to resist it.
[03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:09.600]  Absolutely.
[03:46:09.600 --> 03:46:10.600]  Of course we can.
[03:46:10.600 --> 03:46:12.840]  I mean, folks, if you won't resist now, you're not gonna resist when they got a gun to your
[03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:13.840]  head.
[03:46:13.840 --> 03:46:17.800]  Look, the Bible verse I quoted earlier says, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[03:46:17.800 --> 03:46:22.560]  against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:26.360]  So it's saying we do wrestle against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[03:46:26.360 --> 03:46:29.760]  We do wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:33.880]  But wait, I mean, but they twist Romans 13 to say that we should have submitted to Hitler.
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:36.360]  You know, they now teach Hitler was of the Lord.
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:40.320]  Well, you know, you can twist, you can take little tiny bits and pieces of the Bible and
[03:46:40.320 --> 03:46:42.040]  twist them to say whatever you want.
[03:46:42.040 --> 03:46:45.620]  But earlier in the chapter, it's all about resisting tyranny and people are being arrested
[03:46:45.620 --> 03:46:46.960]  for not following orders.
[03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:52.180]  Not only that, Romans 13 is really clear about what the purpose of government is.
[03:46:52.180 --> 03:46:57.180]  The only purpose of government, which is the punishment of evildoers, evildoer meaning
[03:46:57.180 --> 03:47:00.120]  someone, evil in the Bible means harming someone else.
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:01.120]  So it's to punish people-
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:02.120]  It's a libertarian-
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:04.960]  Exactly, exactly right.
[03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:06.800]  And so God never gave the government-
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:08.120]  No initiation of force.
[03:47:08.120 --> 03:47:14.120]  Exactly, and so God never gave the government the authority to regulate our lives.
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:18.480]  But maybe Romans 13 and one of these mainline preachers say maybe the US senator caught
[03:47:18.480 --> 03:47:20.720]  with all these little kids, maybe he's the government.
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:23.000]  I mean, I don't agree with that, but I'm a devil.
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:26.040]  See, I don't think that senator should be having sex with little kids.
[03:47:26.040 --> 03:47:28.400]  I am now violating Romans 13.
[03:47:28.400 --> 03:47:33.920]  Well, they try to claim that basically every single governor or government official is
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:38.920]  ordained by God when what he's saying is that he ordained human government in general.
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:42.600]  The Bible is teaching that God ordained, you know, parents to have authority over their
[03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:47.520]  children and he ordained human government to be there to punish the evildoer.
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:49.480]  You know, thieves, rapists, murderers.
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:53.360]  But when it's an evil government, we have a duty to overthrow it.
[03:47:53.360 --> 03:47:54.360]  Absolutely.
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:56.600]  But wait a minute, that's of the devil.
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:00.560]  I mean, Dominican prostitute says Senator Bob Menendez likes the youngest and newest
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:01.560]  girls.
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:02.560]  I mean, he's a senator.
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:04.040]  I mean, maybe he's God.
[03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:05.960]  I mean, they already say Congress is above the law.
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:10.400]  According to a lot of these pastors, you know that guy, we need to submit to him and love
[03:48:10.400 --> 03:48:12.580]  him and pray for him and think he's wonderful.
[03:48:12.580 --> 03:48:13.580]  And bring him children.
[03:48:13.580 --> 03:48:18.080]  If you read the book of Judges, all throughout the book of Judges, there are all kinds of
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:21.480]  oppressive governments coming in, taking away the freedom.
[03:48:21.480 --> 03:48:24.920]  And then men like Gideon and men like Samson are standing up to him.
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:25.920]  Well, they were of the devil.
[03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:26.920]  No, no, no, no.
[03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:27.920]  They were devils.
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:28.920]  Samson was of the devil.
[03:48:28.920 --> 03:48:30.740]  Delilah was good.
[03:48:30.740 --> 03:48:32.360]  She did what the government said.
[03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:33.360]  Samson was bad.
[03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:34.360]  Right.
[03:48:34.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  And you know what?
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:36.360]  They were coming to Samson saying, look.
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:38.880]  The Pharisees were good and you know who else was bad.
[03:48:38.880 --> 03:48:39.880]  And you know what?
[03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:40.880]  They came to Samson.
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:45.360]  The Israelites came to Samson and said, listen, Samson, you need to understand these people
[03:48:45.360 --> 03:48:46.360]  rule over us.
[03:48:46.360 --> 03:48:48.240]  The Philistines rule over us.
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:49.240]  They're the government.
[03:48:49.240 --> 03:48:50.760]  You need to obey the government.
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:52.560]  And they're rebuking Samson.
[03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:55.940]  But the Bible says that Samson was filled with the spirit of God.
[03:48:55.940 --> 03:48:57.240]  And Samson brought freedom.
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:00.240]  Now, he made mistakes along the way, obviously.
[03:49:00.240 --> 03:49:04.040]  You know, his weakness was through women.
[03:49:04.040 --> 03:49:07.680]  And that's what the government at the time, the Philistine government-
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:10.360]  That was King David's weakness.
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:13.760]  They exploited Samson's weakness of women.
[03:49:13.760 --> 03:49:17.040]  But the Israelites are constantly telling Samson, you need to just shut up and do what
[03:49:17.040 --> 03:49:18.040]  you're told.
[03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:19.040]  These are our leaders.
[03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:20.040]  These are our rulers.
[03:49:20.040 --> 03:49:22.680]  And God's spirit was leading Samson to fight against the flu.
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:26.760]  It's the same thing in Ezekiel where he says, God, they're going to kill me if I keep speaking
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:27.760]  out.
[03:49:27.760 --> 03:49:28.760]  But I can't help it.
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:29.760]  It's burning in my bones.
[03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:30.760]  Right.
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:31.760]  Exactly.
[03:49:31.760 --> 03:49:32.760]  Jeremiah, actually.
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:33.760]  Yep.
[03:49:33.760 --> 03:49:34.760]  Exactly.
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:35.760]  Yeah, Jeremiah, you know, he finally-
[03:49:35.760 --> 03:49:36.760]  But I mean, I think that's in Ezekiel, isn't it?
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:37.760]  It's in Jeremiah.
[03:49:37.760 --> 03:49:42.820]  But Jeremiah basically got frustrated with preaching and finally just said, I quit.
[03:49:42.820 --> 03:49:43.820]  That's it.
[03:49:43.820 --> 03:49:45.040]  And everybody was telling him to quit.
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:49.040]  But then he said that the word of God was like a fire burning in his bones and he could
[03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:51.640]  not stop preaching.
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:52.640]  I believe you, I just-
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:55.280]  That's the kind of preachers we need today.
[03:49:55.280 --> 03:49:56.280]  We don't need-
[03:49:56.280 --> 03:49:57.280]  That's Jeremiah.
[03:49:57.280 --> 03:49:58.880]  Yeah, Jeremiah 20, verse 9.
[03:49:58.880 --> 03:50:06.880]  We don't need these milk toast preachers that are prostitutes of propaganda of the federal
[03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:08.780]  government lying to people.
[03:50:08.780 --> 03:50:15.320]  We need people to preach the actual Bible stories and to take stands even that are unpopular
[03:50:15.320 --> 03:50:16.860]  and to preach the truth today.
[03:50:16.860 --> 03:50:17.860]  Because I tell you-
[03:50:17.860 --> 03:50:18.860]  I just-
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:19.860]  It's the pastors that are leading-
[03:50:19.860 --> 03:50:22.680]  I just can't believe most people submit to evil just because they don't want to be looked
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:23.680]  at bad by the world.
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:24.680]  Right.
[03:50:24.680 --> 03:50:26.120]  I mean, who cares what a bunch of idiots think about you?
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:27.840]  Well, they crucified Jesus.
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:29.420]  They killed all the prophets.
[03:50:29.420 --> 03:50:34.280]  And you know, the thing about this movie after the tribulation is every Christian who's watching
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:35.420]  it is convinced.
[03:50:35.420 --> 03:50:36.420]  It's so clear.
[03:50:36.420 --> 03:50:39.200]  When you show it to pastors, they're scared of it.
[03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:40.200]  They don't want to accept-
[03:50:40.200 --> 03:50:45.160]  Because they want their comfortable Cadillac and going to the cafeteria with a little-
[03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:48.680]  And they're going to lose it if they take a stand on this because the pre-trib rapture
[03:50:48.680 --> 03:50:50.080]  is the popular doctrine.
[03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:53.920]  Well, what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:50:54.920]  Exactly.
[03:50:54.920 --> 03:50:55.920]  Yeah.
[03:50:55.920 --> 03:50:56.920]  We'll be back with some more calls.
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:50:58.560]  Nick and Nick lined up next.
[03:50:58.560 --> 03:51:00.560]  Stay with us.
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:03.800]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:51:03.800 --> 03:51:10.080]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:15.080]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:20.720]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:51:20.720 --> 03:51:21.720]  your help.
[03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:26.960]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:51:26.960 --> 03:51:33.000]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:36.460]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:51:36.460 --> 03:51:42.680]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:51:42.680 --> 03:51:50.120]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:51.680]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:51:51.680 --> 03:51:54.040]  The war is here.
[03:51:54.040 --> 03:51:55.880]  It's an Infowar.
[03:51:55.880 --> 03:52:06.400]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:52:06.400 --> 03:52:11.600]  In the US, one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[03:52:11.600 --> 03:52:13.680]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:15.240]  Police call it robbery.
[03:52:15.240 --> 03:52:17.140]  We call it avoidable.
[03:52:17.140 --> 03:52:23.240]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[03:52:23.240 --> 03:52:28.400]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[03:52:28.400 --> 03:52:33.240]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on
[03:52:33.240 --> 03:52:35.560]  to an easier target.
[03:52:35.560 --> 03:52:40.800]  At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plants and
[03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:43.360]  it's perfect if you're traveling or away from home.
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:50.440]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.
[03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:56.600]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[03:52:56.600 --> 03:53:04.680]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[03:54:16.560 --> 03:54:20.800]  We're going to go to Nick in California listening on XM 166 and one more Nick and we're out
[03:54:20.800 --> 03:54:21.800]  of time.
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:25.520]  But Pastor Anderson, you've been wanting to talk about Piers Morgan since you got here
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:28.760]  and your take on that and you have a Bible scripture about that event.
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:29.760]  Right.
[03:54:29.760 --> 03:54:33.840]  So somebody sent me a link to your video of Piers Morgan and I just wanted to say that
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:37.880]  I loved it because I know you were getting a lot of criticism, people saying you shouldn't
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:38.880]  have gotten angry.
[03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:40.680]  It was about 10%.
[03:54:40.680 --> 03:54:42.240]  But let me tell you something.
[03:54:42.240 --> 03:54:45.680]  We ought to get mad about evil.
[03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:47.040]  And that's righteous indignation.
[03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:48.920]  Jesus flipped over the tables.
[03:54:48.920 --> 03:54:53.360]  I mean, yeah, we ought not get mad because of something small that, you know, our wife
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:54.360]  squeezes.
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:56.520]  Conscious evil is needs to be dealt with.
[03:54:56.520 --> 03:54:57.520]  Read that verse.
[03:54:57.520 --> 03:54:58.520]  Yeah.
[03:54:58.520 --> 03:54:59.520]  So I found this verse for you.
[03:54:59.520 --> 03:55:00.520]  Ecclesiastes 7-7.
[03:55:00.520 --> 03:55:06.200]  It says, surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart.
[03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:10.760]  So the Bible says there that oppression makes a wise man mad.
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:12.000]  And so it ought to make you mad.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:15.680]  Well, the media, the media, the staff tried to spin it like, oh, it was a defeat.
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:17.960]  Alex got mad, but they don't have me back on.
[03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:18.960]  They were scared.
[03:55:18.960 --> 03:55:19.960]  They were upset.
[03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:20.960]  They were shaking.
[03:55:20.960 --> 03:55:22.040]  They were crying.
[03:55:22.040 --> 03:55:23.320]  The head producer.
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:26.440]  They know that they want to keep us in a calm coma.
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:27.440]  Right.
[03:55:27.440 --> 03:55:28.440]  They don't want us getting angry.
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:32.640]  Well, and people get mad when preachers get mad and start yelling about sin.
[03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:37.440]  Every preacher in the Bible yelled and raised his voice and and got mad and beat the pulpit.
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:39.000]  That's the way the preachers in the Bible were.
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:40.640]  Jesus was that way.
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:41.640]  All of them.
[03:55:41.640 --> 03:55:43.920]  But, you know, Jesus beat him with a whip.
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:44.920]  Yeah.
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:46.560]  He chased him out of the temple with a whip, flipped over the tables.
[03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:51.280]  But, you know, every hair legged man that I know said that he loved that interview and
[03:55:51.280 --> 03:55:53.920]  he loved to see somebody just take it to him.
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:56.320]  Just just, you know, get mad.
[03:55:56.320 --> 03:55:59.400]  And I mean, look, you were face to face with the enemy right there.
[03:55:59.400 --> 03:56:01.280]  Oh, you should have seen it in the eye.
[03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:03.240]  And you know, how can you not be angry?
[03:56:03.240 --> 03:56:06.240]  The thing is, I'm real and he made me mad.
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:10.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick listening on XM, Nick in California.
[03:56:10.160 --> 03:56:11.160]  You're on the air, Nick.
[03:56:11.160 --> 03:56:12.160]  Go ahead.
[03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:13.160]  Hi, Alex.
[03:56:13.160 --> 03:56:14.160]  This is Nick.
[03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:15.160]  Hey, buddy.
[03:56:15.160 --> 03:56:18.160]  I'm calling about we're talking about religion and believing in God and everything, and I've
[03:56:18.160 --> 03:56:19.160]  been praying a lot lately.
[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:23.120]  And I just wanted to bring this to your attention that maybe we could start a third party with
[03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:28.920]  you in your camp and going back to his camp, because you both believe you both are against
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:29.920]  abortion.
[03:56:29.920 --> 03:56:31.800]  You're both against Agenda 21.
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:33.040]  You both believe in God.
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:34.400]  You both defend the Constitution.
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:38.560]  Listen, Glenn Beck does a lot of really good work and he's gotten better over the years.
[03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:43.480]  But he's done dirty tricks to us and I mean, I'm saying he is.
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:49.420]  He's got some serious issues and he's always trying to paint it like I'm doing bad things
[03:56:49.420 --> 03:56:50.420]  to people.
[03:56:50.420 --> 03:56:54.620]  And look, I don't even attack Rush Limbaugh or people like Michael Savage or Sean Hannity.
[03:56:54.620 --> 03:56:58.000]  I don't attack my quote competition because I'm not in competition with them.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:56:59.840]  I could care less about being a big shot.
[03:56:59.840 --> 03:57:01.000]  I want to fight tyranny.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  I'm risking my life.
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:06.880]  And I wish Glenn would stop taking things out of context or twisting things.
[03:57:06.880 --> 03:57:10.440]  And I'm glad he's been going in the right direction a lot.
[03:57:10.440 --> 03:57:12.020]  And you want to say something, Pastor Anderson?
[03:57:12.020 --> 03:57:14.100]  I don't like Glenn Beck at all.
[03:57:14.100 --> 03:57:15.720]  And I do like you, Alex.
[03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:20.440]  But to me, Glenn Beck is just too much of a neocon, Republican type.
[03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:22.520]  And I- He's been getting better, though.
[03:57:22.520 --> 03:57:23.520]  Has he?
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:25.840]  Well, I quit listening to him, so I'm not seeing him.
[03:57:25.840 --> 03:57:29.720]  Well, I think a lot of that's just like Gunners of America gets the NRA, to be honest.
[03:57:29.720 --> 03:57:30.720]  That's what we're doing.
[03:57:30.720 --> 03:57:32.720]  I mean, I hear stuff out of Limbaugh, him.
[03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:34.060]  It's directly what I say.
[03:57:34.060 --> 03:57:35.060]  And that's good.
[03:57:35.060 --> 03:57:37.520]  I just, I really feel good when they rip me off.
[03:57:37.520 --> 03:57:39.160]  But they twist it, so I don't like that.
[03:57:39.160 --> 03:57:40.480]  Because wow, I'm getting a bigger megaphone.
[03:57:40.480 --> 03:57:42.440]  I mean, that's me on the air now.
[03:57:42.440 --> 03:57:43.440]  All those places.
[03:57:43.440 --> 03:57:46.880]  I mean, that's really good, cuz I know we're forcing this stuff out there.
[03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:52.280]  Well, it seemed like Glenn Beck was just trying to promote his fellow Mormon, Mitt Romney.
[03:57:52.280 --> 03:57:57.380]  Well, he came out and attacked me when I went on Piers Morgan and said I was working with
[03:57:57.380 --> 03:57:58.380]  him to discredit people.
[03:57:58.380 --> 03:58:00.920]  Or what about in Police State Part 4?
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:03.560]  Isn't there a whole- He says there's no FEMA camps.
[03:58:03.560 --> 03:58:04.680]  There's no army plans.
[03:58:04.680 --> 03:58:05.680]  It's all documented.
[03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:06.680]  He says there isn't.
[03:58:06.680 --> 03:58:08.680]  Well, does Glenn Beck stand for 9-11 truth?
[03:58:08.680 --> 03:58:12.600]  Oh, he says Ron Paul supporters should have the army used against him.
[03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:16.520]  Well, if he's not standing for 9-11 truth, then he's not standing for much as far as
[03:58:16.520 --> 03:58:18.400]  a political talk show.
[03:58:18.400 --> 03:58:20.520]  All right, listen, folks, we're out of time here.
[03:58:20.520 --> 03:58:21.520]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:58:21.520 --> 03:58:22.980]  I wanted to go to Nick in Pennsylvania.
[03:58:22.980 --> 03:58:25.520]  Last words from Nick in Pennsylvania, 30 seconds.
[03:58:25.520 --> 03:58:26.520]  Take us out.
[03:58:26.520 --> 03:58:27.520]  Nick, Nick.
[03:58:27.520 --> 03:58:31.840]  Okay, Alex, I just wanted to say to you, God bless you.
[03:58:31.840 --> 03:58:34.840]  God bless Pastor Anderson.
[03:58:34.840 --> 03:58:38.360]  You, like Elvis, are a living legend.
[03:58:38.360 --> 03:58:39.720]  No, no, you are.
[03:58:39.720 --> 03:58:42.760]  See you this Sunday, 4 to 6 Central.
[03:58:42.760 --> 03:58:44.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
