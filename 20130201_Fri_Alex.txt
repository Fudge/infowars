[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.874]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:11.455]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:12.995]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:17.198]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:21.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.261]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:43.141]  It is Friday, the first day of February 2013.
[00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:51.503]  We're going to be here for the next three hours, and then I will return, Lord willing, this Sunday, as I always do, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:51.503 --> 00:00:54.244]  Central Standard Time, 5 to 7 p.m.
[00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:57.164]  Eastern for the Sunday transmission.
[00:00:57.164 --> 00:01:00.705]  She hasn't been on in about four or five months, Rosa Corey, who's one of the best
[00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:18.012]  Researched, well-spoken firebrands hailing from, where, San Francisco, and the author of Behind the Green Mask, you and Agenda 21, she will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk all things Agenda 21.
[00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:25.975]  Because that is the global treaty to bring in de-industrialization in a system designed, economies designed to
[00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:36.391]  implode in concentric rings down to a feudal system where we are under total social engineer control.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.463]  And again, everything is Agenda 21.
[00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:42.625]  Everything is eugenics.
[00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:50.792]  And as I do more and more research, it just slams me like a ton of bricks how accurate we are.
[00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:53.414]  And I'm not saying we're accurate, oh we're good people.
[00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:56.097]  I'm saying we know what we're talking about.
[00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:57.698]  We've got them.
[00:01:57.698 --> 00:01:59.179]  We have them.
[00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.562]  This morning, I was almost late to work.
[00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:13.915]  Because in amongst my other duties in the morning, I ended up watching about 45 minutes of the video that is academic and very dry, but bone-chilling.
[00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:16.637]  And the article is up at Infowars.com.
[00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.939]  Population control propagandist.
[00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.161]  This is at Yale.
[00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.944]  We get very little opposition from the public.
[00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:34.635]  Through the sitcoms, drama, and TV, we get very little opposition of the public because of the very gradual evolution of the characters.
[00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:43.638]  And here they are admitting what we already know, that the dramas, the sitcoms, the soap operas, not just here but worldwide, are globalist financed.
[00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:50.010]  ABC, NBC, CBS all get Bella Melinda Gates money that ends up going to these shows.
[00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.856]  And it's the same thing in Africa, Asia, you name it, to demonize the family, to demonize private property, to demonize liberty.
[00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:03.779]  And it's the ultra-mega-rich on record doing this.
[00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:11.225]  And what's sick is, yes, you can argue there are areas that are overpopulated, like some areas of India are absolutely hellish.
[00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:12.726]  Areas of China, absolutely hellish.
[00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:16.464]  That's not debatable.
[00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:32.089]  It's that they use the pretext of dealing with population to bring in a total control grid and actually target the middle class and the nouveau riche and the real intelligentsia that are threats to the old robber barons and they're using this whole population thing as a cover.
[00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.662]  To bring in a new dark age that they're exempt from in their technological reservations.
[00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:49.069]  I mean, this is earth-shattering key, key, key, key, key, key information.
[00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.250]  I mean, this is the real way the world works.
[00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.172]  This is why everything's happening.
[00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:58.647]  We have a socially engineered system where the general population is obsolete.
[00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:11.277]  They don't just plan to try to have clean industries put in where people end up only having two children on average or less and population goes into a negative push, whether it's Japan, the US, Italy, Germany, every country's the same.
[00:04:11.277 --> 00:04:13.318]  You see, I've actually read the population reports.
[00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:14.679]  I've actually read Ehrlich's books.
[00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:22.745]  I've actually read Paul Ehrlich's books and the rest of them and the Henry Kissinger documents, Memorandum 200, State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:24.282]  7277.
[00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:26.084]  All of them.
[00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:26.965]  I mean, I say all of them.
[00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:27.425]  Thousands.
[00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:29.107]  I mean, that's all I do.
[00:04:29.107 --> 00:04:32.330]  So much, I can't even... I don't even remember 10% of what I've read.
[00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.052]  I mean, it's so mountainous.
[00:04:34.052 --> 00:04:35.373]  It's so congruent.
[00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:36.975]  It's so mechanized.
[00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.156]  It's so clear-cut.
[00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.958]  It's so diagrammed.
[00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.560]  And I can walk out and see it.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.682]  In the billboards, the culture, the TV.
[00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:47.726]  I don't even need to... I can see what they're doing and go, let me go type in and look for a white paper saying this.
[00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:58.235]  And I go type it in, I find, I know their language, I find the exact white paper with the exact words I just envisioned of them talking about how they planned five years ago what I'm looking at now.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.524]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?
[00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:13.032]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:15.735]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:22.342]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:23.483]  After Hurricane Sandy,
[00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:32.773]  Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.
[00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:36.738]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:38.600]  I can warn ya, but I can't feed ya.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.103]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.330]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.550]  Don't be one of them!
[00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.251]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.
[00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:22.053]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound healing.
[00:07:22.053 --> 00:07:29.474]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases, such as strep.
[00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:30.214]  I think so.
[00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:04.859]  You have the power.
[00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:06.400]  Humanity has the power.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.981]  We have the power.
[00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:09.282]  Do you want to fight?
[00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:13.666]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:18.750]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.172]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.834 --> 00:08:44.154]  Thank you for joining us, listening across the United States, whether it's on our 150 plus AM and FM affiliates, global shortwave, the internet at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watching us at InfoWarsNews.com, the TV version of the radio transmission, or of course listening by the internet or shortwave all across the world.
[00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:52.338]  Thank you so much for tuning in on this Friday, the first day of February 2013.
[00:08:52.338 --> 00:09:02.743]  Probably one of the most well-spoken, focused fighters against the eugenics, new dark age, global government system of Agenda 21.
[00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.204]  Rosa Corey will be joining us.
[00:09:04.204 --> 00:09:05.965]  Hadn't been on in about four months.
[00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:08.786]  She was on the Nightly News a few months ago, but hadn't been on with me in about four or five months.
[00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:11.548]  She's going to be joining us in the second hour and in studio.
[00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:17.561]  Pastor Steve Anderson is one of the people in an amazing new film that we're carrying.
[00:09:17.561 --> 00:09:25.124]  He's the preacher who lives in Arizona and has to drive through a border patrol checkpoint a hundred miles in.
[00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:27.805]  They all know who he is and always want to search his vehicle.
[00:09:27.805 --> 00:09:29.286]  He says, why don't you do something about the illegals?
[00:09:29.286 --> 00:09:30.446]  So they beat him up.
[00:09:30.446 --> 00:09:33.748]  That's not why he's joining us, but that video has been seen millions of times online.
[00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:35.268]  A lot of folks know him because of that.
[00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:44.983]  He has prayed for the downfall of President Obama before, which is biblical, and he's been demonized nationally for that.
[00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:46.324]  That's probably how some of you will know him.
[00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:49.805]  But after the tribulation, let no man deceive you.
[00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:51.846]  Powerful new Christian film.
[00:09:51.846 --> 00:09:57.730]  And even if you're not a Christian, what are there, a billion, 200 million Catholics?
[00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:02.490]  And another billion or so other sects of Christians.
[00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.334]  So that's 2 billion plus Christians out there.
[00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:07.455]  People who claim they're Christians.
[00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:15.985]  Some estimates are 80% of Americans identify themselves as Christians, though not really practicing, but still believe in God and identify with Christ.
[00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:30.033]  Christians from the lion's den, and of course that was Jews, but that's what Christianity came out of, right through to all the prophets, right through to 50, 60, 70, 100 years after Christ in Rome.
[00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:37.597]  The Christians said slavery was wrong, and it was mainly white slaves.
[00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:38.478]  There were slaves from all over.
[00:10:38.478 --> 00:10:40.739]  If you weren't Roman, you could be a slave.
[00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:44.062]  It was the Christians that helped phase out slavery 2,000 years ago.
[00:10:44.062 --> 00:10:47.904]  It was Christians who wouldn't worship other gods and were thrown to the lions.
[00:10:47.904 --> 00:10:50.186]  I mean, this is all on record.
[00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:53.348]  Why do Christians submit to tyranny today?
[00:10:53.348 --> 00:10:57.331]  Why did Christians found America by saying, no king but King Jesus?
[00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:58.412]  King George is a tyrant.
[00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:03.195]  And led that rebellion, but today, why do they submit?
[00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:08.139]  And the biggest issue is they teach a pre-tribulation rapture.
[00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:10.261]  So we're going to examine that.
[00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:17.186]  And again, even if you're not a Christian, this is important anthropology, important sociology, important psychology.
[00:11:17.186 --> 00:11:21.050]  The globalists study all the groups out there, and then they manipulate us against each other.
[00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.952]  So I study Islam, I study Christianity, I study it all.
[00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:25.934]  I study Satanism, the occult,
[00:11:26.734 --> 00:11:27.455]  I am a Christian.
[00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:29.177]  I've studied it all.
[00:11:29.177 --> 00:11:40.307]  Animism, atheism, agnostics, Rosicrucianism, Aleister Crowley baloney stuff, all of it.
[00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:45.492]  And I'm telling you, the globalists believe in God, and they believe in spiritual forces.
[00:11:45.492 --> 00:11:47.874]  I mean, how do you know when somebody's looking at you?
[00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.278]  You can be walking through the woods on your own property on a thousand acres.
[00:11:52.557 --> 00:11:59.683]  I know I've been doing that before on my family's property in East Texas, and repeatedly I know when somebody's looking at me, and I'm always right.
[00:11:59.683 --> 00:12:04.626]  You always know when the restaurant, you feel somebody staring at you, you turn around and somebody's looking at you, and it's somebody you knew years before.
[00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:06.388]  They're like, oh, I thought that was you, Bob.
[00:12:06.388 --> 00:12:07.689]  I thought that was you, Carol.
[00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:24.909]  They've proven that's how a monarch butterfly, four generations, can fly to northern Canada and then one flies all the way back using the sun and magnetic systems, windage, everything, flying at 10,000 feet all the way to Mexico.
[00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:27.150]  That's the incredible cells they found in fish.
[00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:46.022]  They found in birds, and they're in humans as well, that are electromagnetic, and that are picking up on all sorts of not just magnetic systems, but cells they don't know exactly what they do, but that are antennas.
[00:12:46.022 --> 00:12:47.303]  I mean, you're picking things up.
[00:12:47.303 --> 00:12:48.224]  The globalists know this.
[00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:49.345]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:53.442]  And they want you to be dumbed down and unaware of it.
[00:12:53.442 --> 00:13:01.469]  Most of the major atheist movements, the low-level atheists, think they know it all and are real intellectual and, you know, they never believe even in government corruption.
[00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:02.630]  That couldn't exist.
[00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.011]  Things that are admitted can't exist.
[00:13:04.011 --> 00:13:07.394]  It's a very one-dimensional, dried, stale...
[00:13:08.547 --> 00:13:09.107]  Perspective.
[00:13:09.107 --> 00:13:10.508]  I don't blame people wanting to be atheists.
[00:13:10.508 --> 00:13:14.191]  You look at establishment religion, boy, that would make me an atheist any day.
[00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:15.512]  Or at least an agnostic.
[00:13:15.512 --> 00:13:18.394]  But the spiritual, it's definitely real.
[00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:26.480]  And humans for our entire history have known this, so there's always priest, a priesthood, who tries to get between you and the universe.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.362]  You and God.
[00:13:29.362 --> 00:13:31.404]  You and God's creation, the universe.
[00:13:31.404 --> 00:13:32.705]  There's always that priesthood
[00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:42.023]  That wants to get between you and your creator, you and the power that is God's creation.
[00:13:42.023 --> 00:13:56.032]  Because that's where the proof, the proof of the civilization, the proof of the intelligence is the civilization, is the creation, is the master builder.
[00:13:56.032 --> 00:13:58.534]  People say, that's Illuminati, master builder, great architect.
[00:13:59.758 --> 00:14:02.841]  God is called the great architect and the master builder.
[00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:07.926]  In the Bible, the Luciferians take everything and they take it on to themselves.
[00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:15.874]  Every symbol, every name, they take it and then there's no symbols left.
[00:14:15.874 --> 00:14:16.955]  There's no names left.
[00:14:16.955 --> 00:14:17.615]  They've taken them all.
[00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:18.456]  They've stolen them.
[00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:21.339]  And then people say, oh, you're talking about something that's the devil.
[00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:23.261]  No, you are looking at the counterfeit.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.663]  I'm not going to preach because I've got a bunch of news to cover.
[00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:29.466]  We'll get to that coming up with the pastor in studio with us today.
[00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:34.693]  He's also going to be on the Nightly News with Darren McBrain for an in-depth commercial-free, commercial-free during the interview.
[00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:42.022]  There's commercials as bookends on the TV show, 7 o'clock Central every night, Infowarsnews.com.
[00:14:43.444 --> 00:14:53.470]  But the new film is available, Let No Man Deceive You, after the Tribulation, and it goes well with Romans 13, the true meaning of submission, by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer's son, Timothy Baldwin.
[00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.411]  Great to give to every preacher.
[00:14:55.411 --> 00:15:09.100]  Filled with the, I don't know, it's gotta be a hundred Bible verses about it's your job to stand up against evil and corruption and bullies and thugs, and that if you don't, God will absolutely hate you more than anybody else, that you knew innocents were being hurt.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.282]  And you weren't evil, but you were a coward?
[00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:13.502]  God hates a coward.
[00:15:13.502 --> 00:15:16.224]  You need to get that straight.
[00:15:16.224 --> 00:15:17.465]  Justice hates a coward.
[00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:19.126]  Common sense hate a coward.
[00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.387]  Women hate a coward.
[00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.607]  Children hate a coward.
[00:15:21.607 --> 00:15:23.388]  And cowards hate themselves.
[00:15:23.388 --> 00:15:27.891]  You know, a man who has courage only dies a single death.
[00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:30.913]  Cowards die thousands of deaths.
[00:15:30.913 --> 00:15:32.414]  Every day is fear.
[00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:33.515]  Fear of what people think.
[00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.135]  Fear of what's going to happen.
[00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:37.417]  I absolutely hate fear.
[00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:46.895]  I absolutely despise it, because it does kill your intellect.
[00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:48.497]  It is the mind killer.
[00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:54.802]  To quote a great writer, and I'd say philosopher, Frank Herbert.
[00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.283]  Fear is the mind killer.
[00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:00.145]  Fear is the little death.
[00:16:00.145 --> 00:16:04.790]  You let it pass through you, over you, around you, past you, behind you.
[00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.171]  Get behind me, Satan!
[00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:06.932]  Get behind me!
[00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.514]  People say, what does that mean, get behind me?
[00:16:08.514 --> 00:16:09.855]  Get out of my way!
[00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:11.277]  Get out of the road!
[00:16:11.277 --> 00:16:12.778]  Get out of my way!
[00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:13.439]  Stop it!
[00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.059]  Get out!
[00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:15.341]  Get out!
[00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.245]  The devil accuses, tells us all day how we're bad, we're evil, we're guilty.
[00:16:20.742 --> 00:16:23.883]  And we all are guilty one way or another, but are our hearts guilty?
[00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.023]  Are we doing it on purpose?
[00:16:25.023 --> 00:16:26.063]  Do we love evil?
[00:16:26.063 --> 00:16:27.023]  No.
[00:16:27.023 --> 00:16:37.185]  And that's why, that's why the system tells you you're bad, so that you feel guilty, so you step aside when you run into the devil on the road.
[00:16:37.185 --> 00:16:38.745]  There is no turning back.
[00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:41.966]  There is no turning back on the road.
[00:16:41.966 --> 00:16:46.086]  There is no turning back on the run.
[00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:49.407]  But we're not running from the devil, we're trying to run to God.
[00:16:55.267 --> 00:16:57.873]  Because it's a race.
[00:16:57.873 --> 00:17:04.929]  And the devil, whatever you want to call it, doesn't want us to achieve that level of awakening and understanding.
[00:17:04.929 --> 00:17:05.551]  Consciousness.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:15.683]  The system wants to keep you in this control box, feeling small, feeling ugly, feeling powerless, feeling scared, so that you don't break out!
[00:17:15.683 --> 00:17:26.848]  Climb to the surface, come out of the cave, Plato's Cave, THX 1138, Robert Duvall, climbs to the top, Allegory of the Cave, and sees the world.
[00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:43.389]  Logan's run climbs out from the subterranean system of control, the technocracy, and sees the open earth.
[00:17:43.389 --> 00:17:46.470]  An artificial system to control us.
[00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:56.172]  And again, there's an hour and a half video, excuse me, an hour and 50 minute video up at Infowars.com right now.
[00:17:56.172 --> 00:17:58.253]  Population control propaganda.
[00:17:58.253 --> 00:18:00.073]  We get very little opposition from the public.
[00:18:00.728 --> 00:18:04.949]  And they go on to say, we get very little opposition from the public because of our television programs.
[00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:07.750]  They are a very gradual evolution of the characters.
[00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.430]  And what do they say?
[00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.690]  To end the family.
[00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.010]  To end fealty.
[00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.191]  To end any type of honor.
[00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:17.512]  Where you're just a nobody that's programmed by the television, by the culture.
[00:18:17.512 --> 00:18:20.493]  And they say, by increment, we do it.
[00:18:20.493 --> 00:18:21.813]  And it's everything I've talked about.
[00:18:21.813 --> 00:18:23.513]  It's everything Alan Watts talked about.
[00:18:23.513 --> 00:18:27.074]  Because it's all in Edward Bernays' three books.
[00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:29.455]  The Father of Modern Propaganda, Sigmund Freud's Nephew.
[00:18:30.814 --> 00:18:39.182]  When you go watch it, they're sitting around giggling and getting off on the fact that they're manipulating you because you're trusting.
[00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:54.636]  And you look at these men, these are weak, power-grasping, shaking men who have a look of egomania in their eyes, that they are world controllers, that they are engineering you, that they have taken control.
[00:18:55.985 --> 00:19:04.013]  They are world saviors, and they're there to all these PhD students doing their dissertation in this Yale hour, 50 minute thing.
[00:19:04.013 --> 00:19:04.634]  It's a nightmare.
[00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:06.235]  I haven't even watched the whole thing yet.
[00:19:06.235 --> 00:19:07.016]  Watched about half of it.
[00:19:07.016 --> 00:19:07.717]  It was very painful.
[00:19:08.729 --> 00:19:14.412]  Because I already knew it a hundred times over, but just to see them smacking the lips and doddering around.
[00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:22.777]  These people are all cold and intelligent to one level, but they miss any depth or variety or versatility.
[00:19:22.777 --> 00:19:25.238]  Or they would absolutely run the other direction.
[00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:30.602]  And they talk about the Rockefellers and everybody funding them and Maury Strong and Paul Ehrlich.
[00:19:31.782 --> 00:19:48.505]  John P. Holdren and all of it, and how I was just here 40 years ago like you, and I've led the worldwide program for the engineering program in television to break down the family, to help the family, and you will soon be in this force.
[00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:55.526]  I mean, it's all there, and you're just like watching soldiers, armies, built, and they're not even actually trying to reduce population.
[00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:58.267]  I'll tell you about that when we come back, and then get into all the other big news.
[00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:06.913]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:16.215]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:22.657]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:20:22.657 --> 00:20:31.340]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:31.620]  I don't know.
[00:21:01.283 --> 00:21:03.684]  Is 2013 your year to achieve more?
[00:21:03.684 --> 00:21:04.905]  More vitality?
[00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:05.666]  More health?
[00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:06.886]  More well-being?
[00:21:06.886 --> 00:21:08.807]  Hi, this is Pastor Jenny.
[00:21:08.807 --> 00:21:12.349]  For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.
[00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:16.552]  But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops.
[00:21:16.852 --> 00:21:22.916]  I learned that there are millions of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.
[00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:29.361]  I learned by taking RNA drops, I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve the more that I desire.
[00:21:29.361 --> 00:21:37.787]  I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.
[00:21:38.027 --> 00:21:40.408]  Go to RNAfreesample.com.
[00:21:40.408 --> 00:21:43.389]  That's RNAfreesample.com.

[00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.610]  That's 888-577-3703.
[00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.510]  RNAfreesample.com.
[00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.851]  Discover the more that's waiting for you.

[00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:31.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.263]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:36.263 --> 00:22:42.067]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:42.067 --> 00:22:45.709]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:48.531]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:53.474]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:22:53.474 --> 00:22:53.795]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:55.136]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:04.022]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:23:04.022 --> 00:23:07.385]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:10.368]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:23:10.368 --> 00:23:21.298]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:22.439]  Then there's affordability.
[00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:27.363]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:23:27.383 --> 00:23:28.043]  I think so.
[00:23:54.974 --> 00:23:57.022]  Free shipping on every order over $50.
[00:23:57.022 --> 00:23:58.388]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:23:58.388 --> 00:23:59.552]  For the love of clean water.
[00:24:15.194 --> 00:24:20.577]  You have found it, the tip of the spear in the fight to awaken free humanity, not just in the U.S.
[00:24:20.577 --> 00:24:22.338]  or North America, but worldwide.
[00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:25.160]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:32.084]  And remember, if you're a new listener tuning in to us on AM and FM stations all across the country, those are precious affiliates.
[00:24:32.084 --> 00:24:42.251]  And the fact that this broadcast is exploding, even though we come from a smaller, independent radio network, not one of the big three giants, is unprecedented in the history of modern radio.
[00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:51.536]  And it's because station managers, owners, and sponsors in your area understand that a lot of what I've talked about, unfortunately, is now coming true.
[00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:56.699]  They realize we're in trouble and they want to get this information out to you as a service.
[00:24:56.699 --> 00:25:05.105]  So be sure and spread the word about all the stations you're listening to and be sure and sponsor the local station if you're a business owner.
[00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:09.107]  And be sure and support the sponsors and let them know you appreciate it.
[00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:10.548]  That is so important.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.281]  That is so important.
[00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:21.824]  Because people at Yale, you know, Yale's come out recently and said, let's, you know, kill babies, some of their professors up to age three, even if they're healthy.
[00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.885]  It's been in the Journal of Bioethics.
[00:25:23.885 --> 00:25:29.687]  That's the new death panel groups where they get their walking orders.
[00:25:29.687 --> 00:25:33.809]  They say, well, the death panel, the bioethics board, says it's okay, so now we can kill you.
[00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:36.530]  And the police go, well, they're wearing a white lab coat.
[00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.891]  It must be OK.
[00:25:37.891 --> 00:25:38.972]  That's how Hitler did it.
[00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:41.494]  He got his first tyranny into the medical system.
[00:25:41.494 --> 00:25:43.915]  And I'll get more into this with Rosa Corey coming up on agenda 21.
[00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:47.258]  I want to get into all the other economic news that is incredibly important.
[00:25:47.258 --> 00:25:50.160]  Huge purges of gun owners have begun.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.300]  Legal gun owners.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.701]  This is moving faster than I thought.
[00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:55.203]  More giant military drills on a stage.
[00:25:55.203 --> 00:25:56.544]  We've never seen anything.
[00:25:56.544 --> 00:25:58.165]  This is an order of magnitude bigger.
[00:25:58.165 --> 00:26:04.309]  There's huge drills every day in major cities terrorizing people to acclimate the public for military occupation.
[00:26:05.932 --> 00:26:09.039]  It's all coming up, but here's what I want to explain to you.
[00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:13.509]  We cover it a lot in my film that's been out six years, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:21.134]  Available on DVD at Infowars.com, but in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, but it's free on YouTube, folks.
[00:26:21.134 --> 00:26:23.134]  But don't have it be pearls before swine.
[00:26:23.134 --> 00:26:23.754]  Okay?
[00:26:23.754 --> 00:26:24.754]  Go watch it.
[00:26:24.754 --> 00:26:26.535]  It has an online bibliography.
[00:26:26.535 --> 00:26:28.335]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[00:26:28.335 --> 00:26:29.575]  Whatistheendgame.com.
[00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:32.676]  So you can double-check every 30 seconds.
[00:26:32.676 --> 00:26:35.817]  We have it marked on the time code with a bibliography.
[00:26:36.557 --> 00:26:37.478]  Where the U.N.
[00:26:37.478 --> 00:26:40.259]  says they want to exterminate at least 80% of the public.
[00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:42.081]  Where they state it's U.S.
[00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:43.301]  government policy.
[00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.563]  The British Royal Commission on Population.
[00:26:45.563 --> 00:26:48.965]  Anything we quote in the film, it's right there.
[00:26:48.965 --> 00:27:00.872]  Even if it's George Herbert Walker Bush calling for world government, new world order, and everybody knows he did that, and we show the State of the Union, we still give the date, where they said it, and where we got it.
[00:27:00.872 --> 00:27:04.574]  The date in Congress of the United States.
[00:27:04.574 --> 00:27:05.275]  State of the Union.
[00:27:06.653 --> 00:27:08.174]  I mean, everything documented.
[00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:11.295]  It's like an online film book.
[00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:13.655]  Here's my basic indictment.
[00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:16.836]  We've had the different population associations on that have broken down the numbers.
[00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:17.757]  These numbers are fact.
[00:27:17.757 --> 00:27:20.458]  You can look them up.
[00:27:20.458 --> 00:27:26.500]  The eugenicist 150 years ago, well actually about 163 years ago now, by 1850, the robber baron British royalty and others, because even the other
[00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:39.142]  Financial elite were interbreeding so they were having a lot of deformed children, mentally ill children.
[00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:50.611]  The reason they started marrying commoners by the 1930s or so was because Queen Elizabeth has a bunch of siblings and all of them had to get locked up.
[00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:54.834]  Just completely insane and deformed and it's a very sad story.
[00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:59.186]  But that's why they've now been forced to marry commoners.
[00:27:59.186 --> 00:28:01.849]  See, they're so elite, they can't even have kids.
[00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:03.731]  Because of the psychos inbreeding together.
[00:28:03.731 --> 00:28:04.591]  And I mean psychos.
[00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:10.537]  They've inbred psychopathic traits to create, you know, certain breeds of dogs are overbred and completely insane.
[00:28:10.537 --> 00:28:13.119]  I mean, everybody knows that.
[00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:15.261]  It's many times worse with humans.
[00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:20.166]  I mean, most Egyptians, that's why they would have a dynasty's collapse.
[00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:27.885]  Over and over again, because, you know, the oldest live would live to be about 20.
[00:28:27.885 --> 00:28:44.615]  And imagine, these would be completely mentally retarded, king, sterile, unable to talk, totally deformed, and they would prop them up and worship them as God, and then whatever utterances came from their mouth, they would then follow immediately.
[00:28:45.952 --> 00:28:47.874]  Uh, and this is what we go through.
[00:28:47.874 --> 00:28:50.557]  So, they were obsessed with, why are we dying?
[00:28:50.557 --> 00:28:52.078]  Why are we deformed?
[00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:54.261]  And so all their scientists said, we're going to discover it.
[00:28:54.261 --> 00:28:55.842]  So they discovered genetics.
[00:28:55.842 --> 00:28:58.284]  Out of it, you know, came eugenics.
[00:28:58.284 --> 00:29:02.529]  Well, first eugenics, then genetics, then bioethics.
[00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:06.432]  Uh, biometrics is over 100 years old.
[00:29:06.432 --> 00:29:18.062]  Everything you know, the first computers, IBM was commissioned by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers to create computers to try to track why the elites were having, you know, most of their kids were dying at stillbirth.
[00:29:18.886 --> 00:29:20.167]  This is all on record.
[00:29:20.167 --> 00:29:22.469]  Race studies, the holler at the machines.
[00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:25.310]  It was IBM machines the Nazis had to put the tattoos on people.
[00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.452]  I'm going to come back and finish this.
[00:29:27.452 --> 00:29:29.353]  I say I'll do it simply, but it's just incredible.
[00:29:29.353 --> 00:29:30.214]  This is everything.
[00:29:30.214 --> 00:29:32.015]  This is why it's all like this.
[00:29:32.015 --> 00:29:37.979]  And they've made the decision to cut off the resources incrementally over time because they've learned you can't resist that.
[00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:44.564]  I'm going to explain it all when we come back and then get into why all this other stuff is happening.
[00:29:44.564 --> 00:29:47.786]  Because if you don't know this basic foundation, you won't know anything.
[00:29:50.287 --> 00:29:54.215]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.215 --> 00:29:56.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.005 --> 00:31:05.108]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[00:31:05.108 --> 00:31:06.329]  Don't be one of them!
[00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:12.033]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad-spectrum antibacterial solution.

[00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:28.524]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases.
[00:31:28.624 --> 00:31:29.985]  We're good to go.
[00:31:58.627 --> 00:32:04.851]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:32:04.851 --> 00:32:06.112]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:06.112 --> 00:32:10.055]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:12.437]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:12.437 --> 00:32:18.141]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:32:18.141 --> 00:32:24.385]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.805 --> 00:32:30.748]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:34.950]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.252]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:39.252 --> 00:32:45.195]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:48.757]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:50.718]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:51.158]  It's here.
[00:32:51.818 --> 00:33:09.532]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv He's bounding down!
[00:33:11.463 --> 00:33:19.152]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have reverse engineered this entire thing, and it isn't hard.
[00:33:19.152 --> 00:33:32.446]  The Globalists have all written books going back over 160 years describing the problems, why they've done what they've done, why they made the decisions, because they see the general public as absolute dumb animals.
[00:33:32.987 --> 00:33:36.272]  Really, the general public just isn't lusting after power.
[00:33:36.272 --> 00:33:47.567]  The general public is a mix of good people, bad people, ugly people, evil people, sweet people, creative people, eccentric people.
[00:33:48.912 --> 00:33:51.495]  It takes all kinds to make the world go round.
[00:33:51.495 --> 00:34:02.565]  But hereditary power always ends up taking over, whether it's North Korea, whether it's the kings of Europe, whether it's the kings of Japan, the emperors, whether it's been the kings of the Chinese.
[00:34:02.565 --> 00:34:07.950]  The communists always just end up turning the Politburo into an above-the-law hereditary royalty.
[00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:27.595]  I mean, you go to places like North Korea, they're now in some cases four generations into people who are given the seat on the government council, or given the seat in the local government job, and given the house that their grandfather had that was given to them by the communists.
[00:34:29.497 --> 00:34:39.164]  And this is what they set up, and so imagine, you've got inbred groups already inbreeding for being aggressive, being ruthless, being cunning, being smart.
[00:34:39.164 --> 00:34:47.870]  Let's say if your ancestor is William the Conqueror, who was a particularly powerful king, obviously out of France, what is France today?
[00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.313]  Because he was from a commoner.
[00:34:52.313 --> 00:34:53.894]  A king in that area, you know,
[00:34:55.382 --> 00:35:22.902]  mated with uh... you know particularly uh... aggressive uh... barbarian woman and so then you get uh... william the bastard as he was known and uh... you know he then goes into england and takes over so they weren't all psychopaths but they were cunning smart aggressive then you inbreed psychopaths control freaks sadist because they're willing to do the horrible things to stay in power in fact they enjoy it so it's an attribute for uh... their type of cancer
[00:35:23.877 --> 00:35:30.061]  To take control, to see the general public as cattle, the prey animal, they the Morlocks, we the Eloi.
[00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:30.762]  To use an H.G.
[00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:36.846]  Wells analogy, which he wrote non-fiction books admitting that was an analogy of the ruling class and the general population.
[00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:40.729]  That we were pure, that we were beautiful, that we were sweet.
[00:35:40.729 --> 00:35:47.433]  Didn't matter, you won't rule things from the subterranean keep like the Morlocks.
[00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:48.554]  You're going to be fed on.
[00:35:49.977 --> 00:35:56.598]  When one of you gets grabbed and drug away, the others will just run and hide in the bushes but come back out.
[00:35:56.598 --> 00:35:58.318]  And so, that's what they do.
[00:35:58.318 --> 00:36:00.439]  They see us like animals.
[00:36:00.439 --> 00:36:02.379]  They say we're animals.
[00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:14.841]  And the entire technological system, unlimited money, the unlimited stolen money of countries and peoples and tribes and other empires, has all been poured... Imagine, you're the elite.
[00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:16.862]  You say, all my kids are dying.
[00:36:16.862 --> 00:36:18.042]  My royal line is dying.
[00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.911]  We've got massive mental illness.
[00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:34.155]  That's why this whole government system, this train that's already been built, that we've been put on, that's a self-oiling, mechanized, perpetual motion system.
[00:36:34.155 --> 00:36:43.658]  That's why it just continues forward because thousands of trillions in the aggregate, and that's conservative, has been pumped into it in the last 160 plus years.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:37:01.298]  And a melding of the ancient empires, a melding of the ancient royal systems, the corruptions, all the corrupt minions that served and climbed into the ranks to become lords, and then to add their genetics to the pool of the super shark
[00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:04.742]  Super aggressive cancer.
[00:37:04.742 --> 00:37:07.503]  It's a cancer cell in a body system.
[00:37:07.503 --> 00:37:10.764]  They're right, we are a collective, but the individual is what makes us strong.
[00:37:10.764 --> 00:37:16.006]  An individual operating correctly is the opposite of the collective, but is within the collective.
[00:37:16.006 --> 00:37:31.591]  They create a false collective, where a cancer program is overlaid, and they know it's a cancer, and know it will destroy the old system, which they live off of, so they decided to fully re-engineer the entire old system, where everything else is eradicated, and it's only cancer.
[00:37:33.103 --> 00:37:35.005]  And this is not going to work.
[00:37:35.005 --> 00:37:38.648]  It's never worked, but they believe technology is going to allow them.
[00:37:38.648 --> 00:37:40.229]  And they all talk about this.
[00:37:40.229 --> 00:37:45.113]  Bertrand Russell, and Ted Turner, and Paul Ehrlich, and just all of them.
[00:37:45.113 --> 00:37:50.618]  They all write these papers, I've listed them here, I've made films about them, where they sit and talk about this.
[00:37:50.618 --> 00:37:52.960]  Just thinly, thinly, in many cases not even veiled.
[00:37:54.625 --> 00:38:08.992]  And so that's why they've gone to a system now where they're going to shut off the resources incrementally to bankrupt you and make you go under their control so they can then sterilize you, so they can then death panel you, so they can then euthanize you.
[00:38:08.992 --> 00:38:19.418]  And that's why they brag that they fund and run most of the big sitcoms, movies, dramas with product placement, propaganda placement, that they're now, you hear it on the shock radio.
[00:38:19.918 --> 00:38:36.570]  You hear it, you see it in the movies, making fun of old people, making fun of babies, saying children are gross, being married is stupid, men are all dumb, women are in charge, not to empower women, to isolate them and to make them be under state control and only trust the state as their husband.
[00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.773]  And that's what they say, the state will be the husband.
[00:38:40.773 --> 00:38:43.255]  And so they're taking control of the human system
[00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:51.974]  At a subconscious level, and they even write about this, they realize it, because they hate the strength of the unwashed masses.
[00:38:51.974 --> 00:38:53.475]  They hate the vigor.
[00:38:53.475 --> 00:38:55.436]  They hate the hybrid power.
[00:38:55.436 --> 00:38:57.598]  They hate it to the ends of the earth.
[00:38:57.598 --> 00:39:01.040]  It is a glaring light to them.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.201]  And they want it blotted out.
[00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:05.283]  So, really, this is why I indict them and I'll get the rest of the news.
[00:39:06.735 --> 00:39:17.297]  The globalists know that once you industrialize a country, and even bring in clean industry, that the population, I said, goes down to about, for every two adults, they have on average two children.
[00:39:17.297 --> 00:39:18.558]  That's not actually accurate.
[00:39:18.558 --> 00:39:21.458]  In the entire industrialized world, it's about 1.5.
[00:39:21.458 --> 00:39:23.759]  The U.S.
[00:39:23.759 --> 00:39:30.681]  is right at two people for every two, but that's because of the 10 million or so immigrants brought in every five years.
[00:39:30.681 --> 00:39:31.841]  We're actually imploding as well.
[00:39:32.674 --> 00:39:37.118]  I mean, it's different numbers every year, but it's about 1.3 children for every two children in Italy.
[00:39:37.118 --> 00:39:37.679]  About 1.3 to 1.2 in Japan.
[00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:38.319]  It's about 1.5 in Germany.
[00:39:38.319 --> 00:39:40.401]  It's about 1.3, 1.4 in Russia.
[00:39:40.401 --> 00:39:41.282]  It's about 1.3 in Britain.
[00:39:41.282 --> 00:39:42.763]  If you cut out the immigrant influx.
[00:39:42.763 --> 00:39:43.424]  So the West is dying.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:07.637]  And this was done through social engineering, done through the 50s and 60s social revolution, sold as empowerment, but actually destroyed the family, to get both people working so now the state raises your children.
[00:40:07.637 --> 00:40:09.480]  Very diabolical plan.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.883]  Now, that's the plan they're going with in the West.
[00:40:12.987 --> 00:40:21.749]  They have a surface plan in Africa, Asia, Latin America, claiming that through the sitcoms and dramas and conditioning, and they admit it's all conditioning, and laugh.
[00:40:21.749 --> 00:40:22.789]  Look at the little animals.
[00:40:22.789 --> 00:40:24.389]  They don't know we're doing this.
[00:40:24.389 --> 00:40:25.129]  They stand around.
[00:40:25.129 --> 00:40:26.789]  I mean, I got a video posted at Infowars.com.
[00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:41.012]  You know, top professors, top globalists, the head of the UN program, and they just sit there and laugh at you that this is all public, and they talk about how they're going to incrementally do this, and they've got all the PhDs out there, all the people about to get their PhDs in the graduate program,
[00:40:42.302 --> 00:40:44.503]  Sitting there listening to this, getting off on it.
[00:40:44.503 --> 00:40:59.608]  And they go to TED TV events, and they have, you know, the intelligentsia there, the technocrats there, the mid-level technocrats, and they say, yeah, we're going to reduce this number and show an equation of humans with carbon dioxide and show it going to zero, which means zero humans.
[00:40:59.608 --> 00:41:00.309]  Everybody laughs.
[00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.505]  And Bill Gates laughs.
[00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:05.426]  See, it's all a laugh because that's gang sign.
[00:41:05.426 --> 00:41:07.206]  It's like they speak another language.
[00:41:07.206 --> 00:41:09.407]  It's an equation, very simple equation.
[00:41:09.407 --> 00:41:13.408]  But they know people watching that, how are they even going to know an equation?
[00:41:13.408 --> 00:41:15.288]  They don't know what the three branches of government are.
[00:41:15.288 --> 00:41:18.289]  They show an equation that they're going to kill us.
[00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:24.050]  And he actually says, we've got to get this number down to zero using vaccines to lower their population.
[00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.331]  He even says it, shows the equation, and then they all laugh.
[00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.971]  Yeah!
[00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:35.174]  It's funny to them, see, because they're not really trying to save the planet.
[00:41:35.174 --> 00:41:37.335]  That's how they get the low-level people into this.
[00:41:37.335 --> 00:41:41.577]  They're a bunch of inbred psychopaths, sadists up top.
[00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:47.100]  And you read the 1949 Royal Commission on Population, that's the blueprint of all the modern stuff we followed.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.802]  Ehrlich, the UN, Agenda 21, UNESCO, all of it.
[00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:53.024]  You read all of that.
[00:41:53.024 --> 00:41:54.604]  Biological Diversity Assessment 96, all of it.
[00:41:57.785 --> 00:42:14.097]  They say, well if we go in and do clean industry, or even give them basic horticulture, and drill wells for them, water wells, they talk about how the Christian mercenaries are going in and actually helping people, and that's going to be a problem.
[00:42:14.097 --> 00:42:19.781]  They go, we've got to come in claiming we're helping, but we've got to block all this development, even though it'll lower their population.
[00:42:20.521 --> 00:42:30.843]  And they'll start having less than two kids because, you know, they'll be informed, they'll want to have some more wealth, they won't need, you know, ten kids because half of them are going to die to take care of them in their old age.
[00:42:30.843 --> 00:42:33.383]  Plus, the only wealth you have is being really poor is children.
[00:42:33.383 --> 00:42:35.444]  By the way, it is the real wealth.
[00:42:35.444 --> 00:42:38.364]  But the point is, is that the globalists all know.
[00:42:38.364 --> 00:42:40.605]  They've all got five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten kids.
[00:42:40.605 --> 00:42:41.625]  They all know that.
[00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:46.626]  They just, you know, Ted Turner's got five, and, you know, biggest landowner, and fifteen jet airplanes, and all the rest of it.
[00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:47.946]  You're a useless eater.
[00:42:47.946 --> 00:42:48.346]  He's not.
[00:42:50.196 --> 00:42:52.337]  According to his mindset.
[00:42:52.337 --> 00:42:54.118]  So you've got all this going on.
[00:42:54.118 --> 00:42:58.941]  They blocked, and they say this in the 1949 Commission on Population.
[00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:00.702]  You can pull up the synopsis online.
[00:43:00.702 --> 00:43:03.424]  You've got to go to a library, a big library, to find it.
[00:43:03.424 --> 00:43:04.125]  We've done it.
[00:43:04.125 --> 00:43:06.326]  We've shown it in film, shown the screenshots.
[00:43:06.326 --> 00:43:09.548]  They admit, they just say, we're just going to keep them from industrializing.
[00:43:09.548 --> 00:43:13.931]  That'll cause a population explosion, but we'll then just mitigate that.
[00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:38.249]  And of course that's the vaccines and programs at a certain point, but we want to use that cheap labor pool in select development zones with a mercantile model, that's globalism, 2.0 is globalism of mercantile, a selective system, a selective insider crony system where they pick the winners to leverage out the West so we can then social engineer them.
[00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:41.151]  So they want to social engineer the West because we're the real target.
[00:43:42.472 --> 00:43:49.395]  Highest education, highest IQ, genetically in the studies, whatever issue you want to look at.
[00:43:49.395 --> 00:43:51.356]  That's the main target.
[00:43:51.356 --> 00:43:57.799]  Of course, these are all averages.
[00:43:57.799 --> 00:44:00.640]  And they're also targeting the Chinese.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.342]  Again, they're also targeting the Japanese.
[00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:06.723]  But they're targeting every other country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.942]  And countries like Africa are just slated for extermination.
[00:44:10.942 --> 00:44:14.263]  That's why some countries have lost half their population in the last 30 years.
[00:44:14.263 --> 00:44:17.965]  I mean, this is so diabolical.
[00:44:17.965 --> 00:44:35.214]  To grow a giant people bomb, point out the problem, offer your solution, globalism, which is really blocking clean energies that are developed while claiming you're promoting them, and then only using that as wealth transfers in boondoggles that aren't even supposed to work on record.
[00:44:35.214 --> 00:44:37.015]  Solyndra and others, where they don't even
[00:44:38.157 --> 00:44:40.120]  Build anything.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.409]  And fake electric cars while blocking carburetors in the 70s that got 100 miles to the gallon on record.
[00:44:47.571 --> 00:44:54.113]  You see how smart... I mean, this is so evil, ladies and gentlemen, because they're cheating.
[00:44:54.113 --> 00:44:54.733]  They're cheating.
[00:44:54.733 --> 00:44:58.974]  They're not smarter than us that they're in control.
[00:44:58.974 --> 00:45:04.915]  These royals, in almost every dynasty, no matter which group they were, African royals, and there were plenty of those.
[00:45:04.915 --> 00:45:08.376]  There was a King of Africa who ruled the Middle East for a while, probably the richest man in history.
[00:45:08.376 --> 00:45:13.017]  Some estimates show, you can look that up, that show that richest man in world history was African.
[00:45:13.957 --> 00:45:25.977]  The Asians had their kings, all of it, it's the same system, that they were willing to then always kill whoever became the king or the queen would then kill or lock up their family members.
[00:45:28.194 --> 00:45:33.476]  Meet Manza Musa, the first of Mali, the richest human being in all of history.
[00:45:33.476 --> 00:45:36.277]  Now there's an example, a painting of him.
[00:45:36.277 --> 00:45:40.418]  Okay, so this is the type of stuff that goes on, and they all operate the same.
[00:45:40.418 --> 00:45:44.820]  So, just like a grizzly bear will go and smell, a male grizzly bear will go and smell
[00:45:45.996 --> 00:46:13.546]  a male baby and try to kill it because he sees it as a threat later in territory and food and mates just like lions and tigers do that the system is doing that but to all of us in a power grab they see us as, we can show the article out of the UN just last week as locusts, as a horde of locusts grasshoppers coming and eating all the plants down to the roots they see us as a disease
[00:46:14.963 --> 00:46:17.624]  Because this is their world they've conquered.
[00:46:17.624 --> 00:46:29.788]  But then the sick thing is, they actually increased populations, kept them from stabilizing, as a people bomb, to leverage out the West and sell the West on eugenics ideas.
[00:46:29.788 --> 00:46:35.290]  Because most trendies will tell you, of course there's too many people, of course, yeah, of course they're putting stuff in the water.
[00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:36.911]  What do you think we've got of this for the Earth?
[00:46:36.911 --> 00:46:38.971]  They're not even doing it for that!
[00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:43.073]  They're doing it to just control everybody and their main target.
[00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.191]  It's come out a decade ago or more.
[00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:57.482]  They have school study tests where they give them to sixth and seventh graders, and the boys that show the highest aptitude, black, white, doesn't matter, and who show the leadership traits, those are the ones that get flagged.
[00:46:57.482 --> 00:47:03.968]  You get called into the principal's office or the nurse's office, and they say, you're a troublemaker, we want to put you on Ritalin.
[00:47:03.968 --> 00:47:09.514]  Even when the people aren't troublemakers, they try to put them on it, because it's targeted to cause neuron death
[00:47:10.094 --> 00:47:13.295]  Brain shrinkage and also organ problems.
[00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:15.855]  The heart gets larger and has ventricle issues.
[00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:17.416]  That's just a few of the side effects.
[00:47:17.416 --> 00:47:26.477]  This is a scientific program laid out in grids like we're animals, you know, in a coyote extermination program or something.
[00:47:26.477 --> 00:47:38.400]  They're trying to wipe people out, dumb down their opposition, neutralize, put the public in a trance, and then carry out the orderly, gradual, ambient extermination of the general population.
[00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:47.038]  Now there's Margaret Sanger quote, the most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[00:47:47.038 --> 00:47:48.640]  She was talking about kids period.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.364]  This is a death cult.
[00:47:52.364 --> 00:47:55.828]  And so these people stand around like they're saviors of the world.
[00:47:55.828 --> 00:47:57.610]  They're not saviors of the world.
[00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:59.032]  They are stealing the world.
[00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:04.673]  And by the way, it's the globalists doing open-air genetic planting all over the planet.
[00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:11.945]  They're the ones with thousands of laboratories, thousands, firing gene guns into random plant, animal, bacterial, you name it.
[00:48:14.105 --> 00:48:15.927]  ...organisms to create mutations.
[00:48:15.927 --> 00:48:22.754]  They're the ones releasing the ingredients to mouse pox for humans that kills over 90% of those that come in contact with it, and it's airborne.
[00:48:22.754 --> 00:48:34.967]  They're the ones, these UT professor Pianca and Dr. Peter Singer, what, at Princeton, and all of them, go look up any head of a biology department, type in eugenics population control, you're not let in to the club.
[00:48:36.457 --> 00:48:37.318]  Unless you're for this.
[00:48:37.318 --> 00:48:42.221]  That's why Pianka, remember this famously five years ago, gave a speech at the Texas Academy of Sciences.
[00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:43.322]  He got their highest award.
[00:48:43.322 --> 00:48:44.743]  He's gotten global awards.
[00:48:44.743 --> 00:48:46.184]  Been to Europe.
[00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:51.148]  And he said, I look forward to the airborne Ebola being released and 90% of us dying, including my family.
[00:48:51.148 --> 00:48:53.089]  It's sad, but it's for the better.
[00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:55.711]  And there was a standing three-minute ovation.
[00:48:55.711 --> 00:49:00.034]  Photos were taken, newspapers reported, with crying.
[00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:00.734]  Oh, yeah!
[00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.531]  Even my family's gonna die.
[00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:11.531]  And everyone was so moved by it.
[00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:15.012]  Yes, all the top Texas Academy of Sciences people.
[00:49:15.012 --> 00:49:16.572]  I talked to the reporters that were there.
[00:49:16.572 --> 00:49:18.472]  They were taking photos and covered it.
[00:49:18.472 --> 00:49:30.695]  And they estimated 90% stood in the ovation and it went on for three minutes as he projected on the PowerPoint a giant screen of pile of red skulls.
[00:49:32.065 --> 00:49:33.346]  Red skulls.
[00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:36.329]  We actually went and did a Google search later of that photo.
[00:49:36.329 --> 00:49:40.292]  It's a Rwandan pile of skulls.
[00:49:40.292 --> 00:49:41.573]  You can actually do an image search.
[00:49:41.573 --> 00:49:44.415]  Giant red pile of skulls and they're in their church.
[00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:45.416]  They're in their church.
[00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:48.459]  Standing ovation.
[00:49:48.459 --> 00:49:50.581]  Standing ovation.
[00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:51.822]  Standing ovation.
[00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.850]  It's their church.
[00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:54.892]  It's their time to cry.
[00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:56.514]  It's their time to have a sacrament.
[00:49:56.514 --> 00:49:59.418]  It's their time to take the blood of Satan, not the blood of Jesus.
[00:49:59.418 --> 00:50:01.482]  It's their time to take communion.
[00:50:01.482 --> 00:50:02.383]  It's their time!
[00:50:02.383 --> 00:50:03.404]  It's their time!
[00:50:03.404 --> 00:50:04.666]  It's their time!
[00:50:04.666 --> 00:50:05.347]  Their time!
[00:50:06.058 --> 00:50:12.303]  And as your factories shut down, as your businesses shut down, as things bankrupt and rot, they see it as a victory.
[00:50:12.303 --> 00:50:14.505]  As Detroit falls, they see it as a victory.
[00:50:14.505 --> 00:50:26.495]  And then they all are building a Gen 21 compact subsystem districts that are openly known in the Plandopolis documents, in all their statements, as the governing corporate stakeholder zone.
[00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:31.559]  Those will be armored, those will be lavished, the latest medical systems, the latest entertainment.
[00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:33.580]  Unlimited power.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.344]  Those areas are exempt from the rolling blackouts already globally going in.
[00:50:37.344 --> 00:50:41.047]  They turn our power off now on rolling blackouts in Austin.
[00:50:41.047 --> 00:50:42.348]  To the point we have to have generators.
[00:50:42.348 --> 00:50:43.769]  They're talking about taxes on those.
[00:50:43.769 --> 00:50:51.556]  But the quote government district downtown and the key Agenda 21 new high-rises, they are exempt!
[00:50:51.556 --> 00:50:54.178]  And they're exempt from the increased power prices.
[00:50:54.178 --> 00:50:58.882]  The city of Austin decides what you pay according to your needs.
[00:50:58.882 --> 00:50:59.723]  They decide.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:02.600]  Food storage?

[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.884]  Folks, I know I'm ranting.
[00:54:24.884 --> 00:54:27.852]  You should be ranting too.
[00:54:27.852 --> 00:54:29.917]  You should be really upset as well.
[00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:32.703]  I mean, this is all public.
[00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:46.815]  I mean, if you go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com in the featured news section, population control propaganda, we get very little opposition from the public because we are very gradual evolving the characters on the TV shows.
[00:54:46.815 --> 00:54:48.737]  This is going on all over the world.
[00:54:48.737 --> 00:54:53.861]  And it's got the quotes in there about how they're basically breaking up society and the family.
[00:54:54.676 --> 00:55:00.299]  To save the earth from population and how it's all Paul Ehrlich's plan and how it's the UN plan.
[00:55:00.299 --> 00:55:02.500]  And this is at Yale.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:10.903]  And there are literally thousands of these videos where they sit around and the Yale put this on its science section website.
[00:55:10.903 --> 00:55:12.584]  They're not hiding this, okay?
[00:55:12.584 --> 00:55:14.685]  Because they know the average person that watches TV.
[00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:16.806]  You tell them, hey, there's messages in there.
[00:55:16.806 --> 00:55:17.866]  There's messages in there.
[00:55:17.866 --> 00:55:18.987]  They're like, oh, yeah, right.
[00:55:18.987 --> 00:55:21.068]  There's messages where we live in the Soviet Union.
[00:55:22.588 --> 00:55:26.692]  That's why you've got all the anti-gun messages, all the anti-Founding Father messages.
[00:55:26.692 --> 00:55:32.899]  You know, I was last night up here working and I saw a clip of that Milwaukee sheriff on Piers Morgan, I guess on Monday.
[00:55:32.899 --> 00:55:34.661]  I'd missed it.
[00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:35.201]  Or Tuesday.
[00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:36.743]  It had been a few days ago.
[00:55:40.267 --> 00:55:45.053]  Piers Morgan was sitting there talking to him about, why aren't you for any background checks?
[00:55:45.053 --> 00:55:47.616]  Why don't you want to close the loopholes?
[00:55:47.616 --> 00:55:50.158]  And the sheriff's like, because it doesn't work.
[00:55:50.158 --> 00:55:52.061]  Criminals are still going to get guns.
[00:55:52.061 --> 00:55:53.102]  And that's the whole point.
[00:55:53.102 --> 00:55:55.505]  There's already background checks on law-abiding citizens.
[00:55:56.789 --> 00:56:00.572]  But they're using that to come after us.
[00:56:00.572 --> 00:56:11.179]  And I've got gun purge news where that's happening of people with no criminal record, veterans and others, getting arrested and charged with felonies in New York before the law even went into effect.
[00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:15.021]  Checkpoints where it's a routine vehicle check.
[00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:21.806]  Oh, you have a 30 mag clip in a bag in your backseat and you're going to jail.
[00:56:21.806 --> 00:56:26.489]  That's to a veteran who's involved running a program raising money for other veterans.
[00:56:28.342 --> 00:56:37.588]  You're the enemy.
[00:56:37.588 --> 00:56:39.689]  You're a robot that's now to be decommissioned.
[00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:45.433]  You've gone out and fought for the New World Order, and shot up with the deadly vaccines, and they're not killing you fast enough.
[00:56:45.433 --> 00:56:47.134]  The DU isn't killing you fast enough.
[00:56:47.134 --> 00:56:48.395]  You're supposed to come back here,
[00:56:50.973 --> 00:56:51.613]  And die.
[00:56:51.613 --> 00:56:52.774]  Or go to prison.
[00:56:52.774 --> 00:56:53.994]  You're the number one enemy.
[00:56:53.994 --> 00:56:56.015]  You're what Homeland Security is targeting.
[00:56:56.015 --> 00:56:58.556]  I've got all these articles where vets are getting targeted.
[00:56:58.556 --> 00:57:00.656]  It's like it's weird they're pulling vets over.
[00:57:00.656 --> 00:57:02.737]  Cops just say they're pulling me over for no reason.
[00:57:02.737 --> 00:57:04.498]  They've got your license plate scanned.
[00:57:04.498 --> 00:57:05.558]  You're in a database.
[00:57:05.558 --> 00:57:10.140]  It's telling them, in many of these major cities, to pull you over.
[00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:14.321]  See, now it's not just warrants or priors with these scanners.
[00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:15.462]  It's now vet.
[00:57:15.462 --> 00:57:16.062]  That's a vet.
[00:57:16.062 --> 00:57:16.943]  Pull him over.
[00:57:16.943 --> 00:57:19.205]  And they know when they're vets, they walk over.
[00:57:19.205 --> 00:57:20.045]  So, you're a vet.
[00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:21.366]  Got back from Iraq last year.
[00:57:21.366 --> 00:57:25.550]  Get out of the car!
[00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:26.711]  I'm gonna search it.
[00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:29.513]  Look, look, they're coming for everybody, okay?
[00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:30.734]  They're coming for us.
[00:57:30.734 --> 00:57:32.435]  They want to start a civil war.
[00:57:32.435 --> 00:57:33.596]  They've got a purge going.
[00:57:33.596 --> 00:57:35.838]  I've got a stack of articles on that front.
[00:57:35.838 --> 00:57:40.161]  This is social engineering, where they hire cops now that'll follow orders
[00:57:41.002 --> 00:57:44.865]  And show they'll follow orders and they put them on the street and a lot of them will do whatever they're told.
[00:57:44.865 --> 00:57:49.688]  You've either got departments run by good people that are saying get guns, protect yourself, this is tyranny.
[00:57:49.688 --> 00:57:55.032]  You got a thousand plus Green Berets signing a public letter saying they're going to resist this and it's tyranny.
[00:57:55.032 --> 00:57:57.353]  You've got people showing whose side they're on.
[00:57:57.353 --> 00:58:00.375]  You're either going to kneel to this or you're going to resist it.
[00:58:00.375 --> 00:58:02.817]  And we better resist it in the InfoWar right now.
[00:58:02.817 --> 00:58:05.239]  By the way, we go to InfoWarStore.com
[00:58:07.148 --> 00:58:10.851]  We are giving away 150,000 bumper stickers free in groups of 50.
[00:58:10.851 --> 00:58:13.733]  Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[00:58:13.733 --> 00:58:16.195]  Average sticker gets seen about 20,000 times a year, they estimate.
[00:58:16.195 --> 00:58:18.057]  Depending on where you live, 10,000 to 30,000.
[00:58:18.057 --> 00:58:18.477]  So I'll just say 20.
[00:58:20.765 --> 00:58:22.886]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're giving $150,000 away.
[00:58:22.886 --> 00:58:24.247]  How many tens of millions is that?
[00:58:24.247 --> 00:58:25.048]  We'll see it.
[00:58:25.048 --> 00:58:26.889]  Infowars.com stickers.
[00:58:26.889 --> 00:58:28.630]  Save the Constitution.
[00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:30.031]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:30.952]  They're going really quick.
[00:58:30.952 --> 00:58:32.373]  I put it up last night.
[00:58:32.373 --> 00:58:33.493]  Go there.
[00:58:33.493 --> 00:58:34.334]  Send us your email.
[00:58:34.334 --> 00:58:35.114]  Free shipping.
[00:58:35.114 --> 00:58:35.815]  Free stickers.
[00:58:35.815 --> 00:58:37.216]  100% free.
[00:58:37.216 --> 00:58:38.457]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:38.457 --> 00:58:47.863]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.283 --> 00:58:53.184]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:58:53.184 --> 00:58:56.827]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:58:56.827 --> 00:59:01.370]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:07.494]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:59:07.494 --> 00:59:18.501]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:59:18.501 --> 00:59:21.123]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.
[00:59:21.343 --> 00:59:24.965]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:59:24.965 --> 00:59:42.275]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:59:42.275 --> 00:59:47.598]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at InfoWorksStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:54.269 --> 00:59:56.671]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.671 --> 01:00:05.938]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.938 --> 01:00:07.239]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.239 --> 01:00:09.021]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:10.822]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.822 --> 01:00:12.364]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.364 --> 01:00:13.905]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.905 --> 01:00:18.088]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.088 --> 01:00:22.191]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.238 --> 01:00:36.084]  Alright, Rosa Corey, firebrand, great research author, is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:38.486]  Give us an update on Agenda 21, the latest info there.
[01:00:38.486 --> 01:00:40.568]  I haven't even gotten into all the news.
[01:00:40.568 --> 01:00:43.590]  I'll intersperse it in this hour and the next.
[01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:50.076]  Pastor Steve Anderson is going to be joining us in studio as well with a new film we're going to be talking about.
[01:00:50.076 --> 01:00:52.558]  I haven't even gotten into all the other news yet.
[01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:56.523]  I mean, just look at this financial news.
[01:00:56.523 --> 01:00:58.524]  It's just amazing.
[01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:02.725]  Another Harvard study finally getting attention out of the Huffington Post.
[01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.925]  I thought it was a conspiracy theory, Huffington Post.
[01:01:04.925 --> 01:01:16.187]  Harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ massively, reviewing more than 27 other studies by governments and major universities.
[01:01:16.187 --> 01:01:18.388]  Reduces IQ, increases cancer.
[01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:21.203]  And of course, that's just sodium fluoride.
[01:01:21.203 --> 01:01:30.575]  When they put in the hydrofluorosilicic acid, of course, Paul Ehrlich and the White House Science Czar John V. Holdren, I mean, they talked about that.
[01:01:30.575 --> 01:01:33.539]  It's an adjuvant to accelerate all the other soft kills.
[01:01:33.539 --> 01:01:37.403]  The bisphenol A's accelerates those, turbocharges them.
[01:01:38.766 --> 01:01:43.870]  The aluminum dioxide they're spraying on us, all the other goods, all the other goody goods.
[01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:48.013]  And then, of course, the globalists all religiously like the plague.
[01:01:48.013 --> 01:01:49.874]  On record, the Chinese elite, the U.S.
[01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:56.840]  elite, European elite, they all literally obsess on purified water organics religiously.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.705]  But they want you to have it, because they care about you and your family.
[01:02:03.705 --> 01:02:05.006]  They're good people.
[01:02:05.006 --> 01:02:07.268]  Now, I started plugging this, but 10 seconds is not enough to plug it.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:16.828]  If you go to infowarestore.com and you go to the bumper sticker area, you'll see it says free stickers.
[01:02:16.828 --> 01:02:18.890]  You can also buy them at cost.
[01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:23.375]  At cost, like $4.99 for 50 stickers.
[01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:27.719]  But if you want to get them totally free, no shipping, no money, zero.
[01:02:27.719 --> 01:02:29.140]  Zero, zero, zero.
[01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:35.444]  Might be one-tenth of a cent the amount of computer energy you use, you know, electricity while you're on the website.
[01:02:35.444 --> 01:02:37.885]  So I guess it may cost you about, you know, one-tenth of a penny.
[01:02:37.885 --> 01:02:39.626]  But that's your own money, your electricity bill.
[01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:40.287]  I guess I lied.
[01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:41.307]  It's not totally free.
[01:02:41.307 --> 01:02:42.728]  But I'm not charging you anything.
[01:02:42.728 --> 01:02:48.311]  If you want to start splitting hairs, how many angels can dance on the head of a possum, you know, all of this type of stuff.
[01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:50.692]  How many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pen?
[01:02:50.692 --> 01:02:52.773]  I've made that term famous now.
[01:02:52.773 --> 01:02:58.895]  You can go there and we've got, I don't know, like six or seven new bumper stickers that are also available for sale.
[01:02:58.895 --> 01:03:01.816]  But you can get these for free, 50 of them.
[01:03:01.816 --> 01:03:07.399]  But you've got to copy the pledge and send it back to our email for our liability.
[01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:11.347]  Because I already have homemade stickers where L.A.
[01:03:11.347 --> 01:03:13.448]  sends me a bill saying someone stuck a homemade sticker up.
[01:03:13.448 --> 01:03:18.652]  If somebody sticks an Obama sticker up in L.A., do they send me a $100 bill saying they'll arrest me?
[01:03:18.652 --> 01:03:20.192]  Of course, obviously, I'm not going to pay it.
[01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:20.693]  It's made up.
[01:03:20.693 --> 01:03:22.334]  It's not even one of our stickers.
[01:03:22.334 --> 01:03:24.615]  Everybody gets to sell bumper stickers to put on people's cars.
[01:03:24.615 --> 01:03:30.479]  It's not my fault if somebody buys a can of Coca-Cola and goes and throws it at somebody.
[01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:31.979]  Are we going to blame the Coca-Cola company?
[01:03:31.979 --> 01:03:36.042]  I mean, again, that's an example of what we're talking about here.
[01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:37.583]  But you have to just be over the top
[01:03:38.379 --> 01:03:47.704]  Just wherever you want it sent, you just send the email back with the attached PDF, pledging to put it on your own property or to give it to others who want to put it on their property.
[01:03:47.704 --> 01:03:50.846]  And it's 50 stickers, that's easy to give out, it's a great conversation piece.
[01:03:52.697 --> 01:03:54.899]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:56.460]  Now, I put it on YouTube last night.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.763]  We can give out about 3,000 groups of 50.
[01:03:59.763 --> 01:04:05.128]  As of this morning, about 1,600 had already been given out.
[01:04:05.128 --> 01:04:08.211]  So by the time I plug this, everyone's going to rush in there.
[01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:10.012]  So that doesn't mean everybody's going to get them free.
[01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.574]  We'll probably pull the offer by the end of the show.
[01:04:12.574 --> 01:04:13.635]  But you are in danger.
[01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:14.836]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:14.836 --> 01:04:16.318]  That'll get people talking.
[01:04:16.318 --> 01:04:17.179]  It's a great conference.
[01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:28.928]  There are so many great new stickers and again, we kept back, we got 150,000 printed, another 30,000 of the same stickers for sale at cost.
[01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:29.868]  At cost.
[01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:30.329]  At cost.
[01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:34.831]  You pay the shipping and $4.99 or $4.95 for 50.
[01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.312]  And that is the cost.
[01:04:36.312 --> 01:04:37.593]  I had them break it down.
[01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:39.054]  That is the cost.
[01:04:39.054 --> 01:04:40.395]  That is the cost.
[01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:43.457]  Bumper stickers at cost for those that want to help us do more.
[01:04:43.957 --> 01:04:49.465]  And if we get donations, and we get financial support, and the money comes in, I'll start doing this every month.
[01:04:49.465 --> 01:04:54.031]  Cost us like twenty-something thousand dollars, I think, to get the stickers and ship them.
[01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:59.359]  I think Weldon said thirty thousand, but the point is, it'll reach tens of millions conservatively.
[01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:00.580]  It's part of Operation Paul Revere.
[01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:04.343]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:04.343 --> 01:05:09.366]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:16.530]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:22.315]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:22.315 --> 01:05:26.339]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:14.545]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:08:06.158 --> 01:08:11.002]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:11.002 --> 01:08:12.583]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:14.104]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.104 --> 01:08:18.328]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:22.391]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.727]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the first day of February 2013.
[01:08:41.977 --> 01:08:55.841]  And we're going to be going to a very special guest, the author of Behind the Green Mask, you and Agenda 21, Rosa Corey, a book we sell at theinfowarestore.com online book video slash patriot bookstore.
[01:08:55.841 --> 01:09:08.584]  Very important to get that book and get that out to county commissioners, sheriffs, police, city planners, because most people are following Agenda 21, they just don't know because they're compartmentalized.
[01:09:08.584 --> 01:09:10.405]  This is basically the red pill.
[01:09:11.803 --> 01:09:13.485]  With a green cover.
[01:09:13.485 --> 01:09:15.327]  Okay, the green-red pill.
[01:09:15.327 --> 01:09:19.091]  Now, before we go to her, this is the type of news...
[01:09:20.575 --> 01:09:26.217]  That I have here in front of me, and this is all up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:09:26.217 --> 01:09:27.437]  This is now every day.
[01:09:27.437 --> 01:09:35.220]  I've never seen the magnitude of huge invasions practicing taking over government buildings, universities, facilities, public schools.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:41.602]  They're now saying the army will respond to, quote, domestic terrorism, and they're calling terrorism, quote, gun crime.
[01:09:42.222 --> 01:09:45.323]  The whole Homeland Security System officially to go after gun owners.
[01:09:45.323 --> 01:09:46.944]  This is a way to purge people.
[01:09:46.944 --> 01:09:58.488]  And speaking of that, also up at InfoWars.com, and this is in the local news, decorated combat veteran arrested, charged with five felonies for possession of an AR magazine.
[01:09:58.488 --> 01:10:00.649]  Those are now illegal in New York State.
[01:10:00.649 --> 01:10:07.112]  And it turns out, his family's just now speaking out, this happened before it was even officially implemented.
[01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.935]  They don't care, and it said a routine vehicle check.
[01:10:11.935 --> 01:10:13.697]  They have checkpoints all over New York now, folks.
[01:10:13.697 --> 01:10:15.219]  They now have them in Texas.
[01:10:15.219 --> 01:10:16.541]  They're gun checkpoints.
[01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:22.107]  They call them gang checkpoints, vehicle checkpoints, and they know you're a vet, it's in the computers, and they're going after you.
[01:10:23.124 --> 01:10:27.688]  And again, it's not every jurisdiction, but some of these jurisdictions have really evil police.
[01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:30.210]  They're out hunting the veterans, and that's on record.
[01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:33.152]  Department of Homeland Security targets gun collector.
[01:10:33.152 --> 01:10:38.816]  And the KRQE piece I want to play later, they're like, well, they caught him by this.
[01:10:38.816 --> 01:10:49.404]  And then it goes on to say he hadn't done anything wrong, and that he's a firearms importer of decades, and they claim a serial number might not have been properly on one rifle.
[01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:50.545]  And it's a local gun dealer.
[01:10:51.578 --> 01:11:01.881]  And they go, well, he might not have filled out all his forms right, and the news acts like he's the... and they have a neighbor woman, you gotta see the video at InfoWars.com on the KRQE going, he's just so evil.
[01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:07.202]  I mean, oh my gosh, I saw the guns, I saw them bringing the guns out, I hope something's done about him.
[01:11:07.202 --> 01:11:10.663]  I mean, just amazing.
[01:11:11.536 --> 01:11:12.197]  So we've got that.
[01:11:12.197 --> 01:11:14.801]  Newtown calls for armed school officers.
[01:11:14.801 --> 01:11:22.493]  Gun control officials set sights on ammunition and background checks now to take those guns.
[01:11:24.741 --> 01:11:28.662]  Teens shot at Atlanta school, but they had an armed police officer there, so it got stopped.
[01:11:28.662 --> 01:11:30.002]  So that's the answer.
[01:11:30.002 --> 01:11:33.343]  Suspect suicide bombing kills two at US Embassy in Turkey.
[01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:34.823]  Boy, that's really heating up over there.
[01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.524]  That's some of the news on that front we're going to be getting into.
[01:11:37.524 --> 01:11:43.325]  DHS revamping immigrant welcome material set to include Obamacare.
[01:11:43.325 --> 01:11:45.226]  How you don't just get your babies paid for now.
[01:11:45.626 --> 01:11:47.628]  Free Obamacare!
[01:11:47.628 --> 01:11:57.336]  But citizens have to buy the insurance, and the official IRS website says they may make families buy up to $20,000 a year as the new average within three years.
[01:11:57.336 --> 01:12:04.462]  This year, premiums are set to double from average of $5,000 to $10,000 per person.
[01:12:04.462 --> 01:12:07.044]  Within three years, $20,000 per family.
[01:12:07.044 --> 01:12:09.466]  Because it's mandated, written by the insurance companies,
[01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:12.573]  Oh my gosh.
[01:12:12.573 --> 01:12:13.393]  Unbelievable.
[01:12:13.393 --> 01:12:14.494]  That's CNS News.
[01:12:14.494 --> 01:12:18.415]  Obamacare to soon cost an average American family $20,000 a year.
[01:12:18.415 --> 01:12:22.936]  Natural news story up at Infowars.com by Mike Adams.
[01:12:22.936 --> 01:12:24.956]  Stocks jolted by jobs data.
[01:12:24.956 --> 01:12:26.117]  Dow briefly test $14,000.
[01:12:26.117 --> 01:12:28.157]  That's because of dollar devaluation.
[01:12:28.157 --> 01:12:32.478]  The real economy is going into freefall.
[01:12:32.478 --> 01:12:34.739]  Gas prices heading up again.
[01:12:36.257 --> 01:12:38.818]  Yeah, now it's time for inflation.
[01:12:38.818 --> 01:12:41.360]  8.5 million Americans left labor force in the last four years.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.123]  169,000 Americans dropped out of labor force in January alone.
[01:12:46.123 --> 01:12:52.246]  Yeah, hey, listen, I was realizing I was about to hire some more crew members, but I just realized they're going to force me to get Obamacare.
[01:12:52.246 --> 01:12:53.647]  I don't know if I can keep who I've got.
[01:12:54.511 --> 01:12:58.013]  Anyways, all part of the Agenda 21 shutting down the economy.
[01:12:58.013 --> 01:13:01.095]  You can have a coal power plant, but we're going to bankrupt it.
[01:13:01.095 --> 01:13:08.220]  Again, this is the admitted program to bankrupt us because only the insiders are exempt from everything.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:20.007]  Now joining us is a lady that more and more, other than maybe myself or somebody like Glenn Beck, is out there really exposing Agenda 21, something I've been covering for 17 years.
[01:13:21.502 --> 01:13:24.425]  And I'm proud of the fact that we forced this out in the open.
[01:13:24.425 --> 01:13:26.788]  She wrote the best little book.
[01:13:26.788 --> 01:13:29.110]  Because other books out there are like fiction and stuff about this.
[01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:30.211]  It's really weird.
[01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.433]  Hers is non-fiction.
[01:13:31.433 --> 01:13:35.117]  It's only 168 pages long.
[01:13:35.117 --> 01:13:37.439]  Great bibliography at the bottom of each page.
[01:13:38.621 --> 01:13:47.928]  Behind the green mask, UN Agenda 21, all the information you need to understand what is happening in your town, why it's happening, who's behind it, and what you can do to stop it.
[01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:50.530]  Awareness is the first step in resistance.
[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:57.835]  She is a ASA, Forensic Commercial Real Estate Developer and Appraiser, specializing in eminent domain valuation.
[01:13:57.835 --> 01:14:01.258]  Her nearly 30 years of experience analyzing land use and property, now it's over 30 years.
[01:14:01.898 --> 01:14:04.019]  Now, again, we sell her book at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:14:04.019 --> 01:14:11.840]  My point here is, and we're going to go to her and give her the floor for the first few segments, and I've got some questions, and I want to open the phones up for your questions.
[01:14:31.685 --> 01:14:33.907]  We've gone every town around Austin.
[01:14:33.907 --> 01:14:35.348]  Austin's a command base of this.
[01:14:35.348 --> 01:14:37.350]  Every town's being taken over by it.
[01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:42.734]  And what it means is, you can't build an office on your house you've owned for 30 years and got two acres.
[01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:45.751]  Your property taxes are going to go up.
[01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:47.632]  Your power prices are going to double.
[01:14:47.632 --> 01:14:53.017]  But the selective insiders who get waivers, their power bill gets cut.
[01:14:53.017 --> 01:14:53.958]  That's happening in Austin.
[01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:55.759]  That's happening in San Francisco.
[01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:57.141]  Government has the lowest rate.
[01:14:57.141 --> 01:15:00.964]  Next is groups that get certified by the local environmental council.
[01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:04.147]  But you can't get certified unless some payoffs get made.
[01:15:04.147 --> 01:15:05.848]  This is open criminal mafia.
[01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.373]  But they act like trendy liberals, so it's a cover.
[01:15:09.373 --> 01:15:16.643]  But you go to their meetings, it's the Dallas Cowboys are there locally, you know, retired ones, big bank heads, Republicans.
[01:15:16.643 --> 01:15:19.748]  That's why all the Republicans' leadership's behind this.
[01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.749]  Mitt Romney, you name it.
[01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:23.053]  It is bipartisan, global screwjob.
[01:15:24.212 --> 01:15:30.414]  Now, you can't cut a tree what, 10 inches around in Austin, even if it's an invasive cedar, they'll come and fine you.
[01:15:30.414 --> 01:15:38.376]  I know one guy got fined something like $50,000 in a week for cutting invasive cedars growing up under his fence at his wrecking yard.
[01:15:38.376 --> 01:15:40.237]  So it's not even a plant from here.
[01:15:40.237 --> 01:15:45.599]  But they can cut down giant, you know, 5 foot around oaks if they want to build something.
[01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:48.240]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.603]  I'll take you now to Rosa Corey joining us via phone, because she's on the road.
[01:15:52.603 --> 01:16:02.949]  She's traveling the entire U.S., battling them, and she's been very, very effective, because on many other issues, you know, she's what you call a liberal, but a real liberal.
[01:16:02.949 --> 01:16:06.892]  Someone, you know, who's more like Thomas Jefferson, who wants everybody to have equality and freedom.
[01:16:07.732 --> 01:16:15.300]  The system that calls itself liberal, they are the globalist operatives using that as camouflage.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:27.373]  And she joins us now, and we're going to break in four minutes, but roll through the basics of what it is, how they're adapting to our counter-strike against them, and some of the biggest criminal actions they're engaged in right now.
[01:16:27.373 --> 01:16:27.914]  Rosa Corey.
[01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:35.447]  Hey Alex, you know what we're talking about here is the erection of a totalitarian state right in front of us.
[01:16:35.447 --> 01:16:37.328]  This is what globalization is.
[01:16:37.328 --> 01:16:40.910]  It's the standardization of all systems.
[01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:53.118]  And so you're seeing it in every possible element, every possible aspect of your life, from health care, to law enforcement, to schools, to land use, water use restrictions.
[01:16:53.118 --> 01:16:55.980]  This is the way that corporations take over.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.521]  This is the corporatocracy.
[01:16:58.061 --> 01:17:00.222]  So, what do corporations want?
[01:17:00.222 --> 01:17:07.245]  They want low-wage workers, global markets, standardized systems, and they want to destroy competition.
[01:17:07.245 --> 01:17:08.765]  And this is what we're getting here.
[01:17:08.765 --> 01:17:14.848]  This is artificial scarcity all over the world, whether you're in the UK or Australia, New Zealand.
[01:17:15.248 --> 01:17:22.735]  Canada, the United States, EU, wherever you are, this is the globalization of all systems.
[01:17:22.735 --> 01:17:31.964]  And we're experiencing this now because we have a long way to fall in the United States in order to bring us to the same level as developing nations.
[01:17:32.624 --> 01:17:37.085]  So when you think about corporatocracy, it's about developing new markets.
[01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:39.825]  There's no loyalty to existing markets.
[01:17:39.825 --> 01:17:50.167]  So if we collapse into poverty or slightly below the median for the entire world, that is of no concern to the huge corporations.
[01:17:50.167 --> 01:17:58.889]  What they're looking for is to bring up the very low third world nations so that they can buy their goods and work cheaply.
[01:17:58.889 --> 01:18:00.189]  This is what we're looking at.
[01:18:00.489 --> 01:18:02.432]  This is what we're dealing with here.
[01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:11.388]  This is a totalitarian state being erected because they need to control all system inventory and control.
[01:18:11.388 --> 01:18:12.610]  That's what this is about.
[01:18:12.915 --> 01:18:17.318]  And the cover is, it's for the Earth, but I've been to the Smart Growth Conferences as early as 97.
[01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:25.865]  In fact, we have some bombshell video that Mike Hanson has that he needs to upload to his YouTube channel, my camera guy at the time, where they were just admitting it's a takeover.
[01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:29.848]  They'd laugh when my camera was off and just go, of course it's a takeover!
[01:18:29.848 --> 01:18:40.617]  And I had some really mean Dallas Cowboy guy, I forget his name, he's famous, big white guy with long, long gray hair, just push me out of the way, just like, yeah, you better get out of my way.
[01:18:40.617 --> 01:18:42.198]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:18:42.694 --> 01:18:44.375]  Yes, they do know what they're doing.
[01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:47.577]  And that's, you know, this is really hard for people to believe.
[01:18:47.577 --> 01:18:50.119]  They think, well, you know, this can't be possible.
[01:18:50.119 --> 01:18:52.941]  How can this be going on, for instance, in the United States?
[01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:56.743]  The totalitarian, you know, dictatorship happening.
[01:18:56.743 --> 01:18:58.224]  But this is what it looks like.
[01:18:58.224 --> 01:19:02.046]  People are not aware that this is what it looks like in your town.
[01:19:02.046 --> 01:19:04.528]  They're not going to call it Agenda 21.
[01:19:04.528 --> 01:19:06.569]  They'll call it sustainable development.
[01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:08.551]  They'll call it regional plans.
[01:19:08.551 --> 01:19:11.392]  You'll see it as water and land use restrictions.
[01:19:11.392 --> 01:19:11.953]  Smart growth.
[01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:19.058]  Smart growth, wild lands project, common core in the schools, standardization of your schools.
[01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:25.822]  And they'll lie and say, we're going to give you park land, we're going to take this farmer's land, his 5,000 acres, and not pay him anything, we're just going to take it.
[01:19:25.822 --> 01:19:32.046]  Then they turn around and build condos on it that the mayor who takes it, his buddy, builds the houses.
[01:19:32.046 --> 01:19:33.327]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:19:33.767 --> 01:19:35.789]  Yes, this is about what they're doing.
[01:19:35.789 --> 01:19:45.477]  It's a completely unleveled playing field because they're using your taxes to subsidize low-income development and high-density transit-oriented development.
[01:19:45.477 --> 01:19:48.219]  So they can raise the general public's taxes even more.
[01:19:48.219 --> 01:19:49.100]  That's what Bloomberg says.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.000]  Let's talk about that.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.864]  You're going to live in a 250 square foot, San Francisco's doing it too, apartment.
[01:19:53.864 --> 01:19:57.887]  They're going to raise your taxes in an actuary to force you into that.
[01:19:57.887 --> 01:20:00.249]  We'll be right back with the incredible social engineering.
[01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:07.662]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[01:20:07.662 --> 01:20:17.269]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:24.495]  If the Hunza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[01:20:24.495 --> 01:20:27.297]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it
[01:20:27.717 --> 01:20:30.099]  Is the type and quality of protein consumed.
[01:20:30.099 --> 01:20:33.481]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged.
[01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:39.244]  Destroying 50 to 75% of your ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids.
[01:20:39.244 --> 01:20:44.888]  One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[01:20:44.888 --> 01:20:47.369]  This feat no one else has achieved.
[01:20:47.369 --> 01:20:50.111]  The results to your health can be amazing.
[01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:50.572]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:20:50.572 --> 01:20:50.792]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:21:01.419 --> 01:21:02.980]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:09.064]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi.

[01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:22.914]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.

[01:21:25.436 --> 01:21:35.482]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens, with no turning and no obnoxious odors.

[01:21:59.277 --> 01:22:00.679]  Life's getting better!
[01:22:00.679 --> 01:22:07.365]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:07.365 --> 01:22:15.113]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:15.453 --> 01:22:23.638]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:28.720]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.363]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:33.943 --> 01:22:38.285]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[01:22:38.285 --> 01:22:39.365]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.365 --> 01:22:43.867]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:48.769]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:22:48.769 --> 01:22:51.770]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:53.551]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:53.771]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.155 --> 01:23:03.376]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:23:03.376 --> 01:23:08.458]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:10.259]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:23:10.259 --> 01:23:15.541]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[01:23:15.541 --> 01:23:22.724]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:23:23.564 --> 01:23:26.365]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:26.365 --> 01:23:30.146]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:23:30.146 --> 01:23:38.688]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:23:38.688 --> 01:23:48.831]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:54.913]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:23:54.913 --> 01:23:56.914]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:24:18.109 --> 01:24:21.271]  The UN's the devil.
[01:24:21.271 --> 01:24:21.932]  And who set it up?
[01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:22.833]  The robber barons.
[01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:24.754]  The Rockefellers.
[01:24:24.754 --> 01:24:32.880]  Alright, Rosa Corey is one of these guests where I just find it so hard to shut up because everything she's saying is true.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:40.545]  Everything she talks about gives me flashbacks of 16 years, 17 on air, but listeners were like, have you seen these UN documents?
[01:24:40.545 --> 01:24:43.227]  Have you seen the Rio meeting four or five years ago?
[01:24:45.017 --> 01:24:47.180]  Nineteen ninety-six or so.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.061]  Nineteen ninety-seven.
[01:24:48.061 --> 01:24:53.468]  Because they just had the Rio meeting in two thousand, in nineteen ninety-two.
[01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:57.794]  And so I've been on this forever, and then I know how criminal it is.
[01:24:57.794 --> 01:24:59.496]  I'm not up here with rhetoric, okay?
[01:25:00.017 --> 01:25:01.219]  You're calling them criminals.
[01:25:01.219 --> 01:25:07.726]  It's diabolical mafia takeover through zoning, through government, all selectively enforced.
[01:25:07.726 --> 01:25:10.530]  Let's go back now to Rosa Corey.
[01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:15.436]  Rosa, we were getting into these new compact coffin apartments.
[01:25:15.436 --> 01:25:15.916]  Continue.
[01:25:15.916 --> 01:25:18.099]  This is a short segment breaking down what we're facing.
[01:25:18.733 --> 01:25:20.514]  Well, you know, this just sounds great.
[01:25:20.514 --> 01:25:23.234]  If it didn't sound so good, we wouldn't be falling for it.
[01:25:23.234 --> 01:25:28.156]  I mean, who doesn't want walkable, bikeable, transit neighborhoods, you know?
[01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.256]  Sounds so great!
[01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:33.217]  But smart growth is the hardscape for your future poverty.
[01:25:33.217 --> 01:25:44.800]  It is for a failed economy and a loss of private property that they're designing these small apartments stacked in the center of your town so that you supposedly don't need a vehicle,
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:51.343]  But the fact is that you will only be able to go where that train line, that may or may not exist, goes.
[01:25:51.343 --> 01:26:03.289]  And the idea is that you will be restricted to city centers, megaregions, megacities, and you will not be able to get out into the rural and suburban areas.
[01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:13.916]  This plan is about bringing people out of rural and suburban areas into city centers, where they can be more easily controlled, monitored, and surveilled.
[01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:15.277]  That is what this is about.
[01:26:15.277 --> 01:26:17.018]  More eyes on the street.
[01:26:17.018 --> 01:26:20.761]  Community-oriented policing is Department of Justice.
[01:26:20.761 --> 01:26:27.445]  This is about creating more crime, calling it community crime, and then being able to jail more people.
[01:26:27.445 --> 01:26:30.167]  Those prisons are public-private partnerships.
[01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:36.605]  So this is what we're looking at, a combination of non-profits, corporations, and government.
[01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:38.330]  This is how government is taken over.
[01:26:40.171 --> 01:26:48.073]  And again, right here where I live in Austin, they now have TSA checkpoints downtown and at the train, and they admit, you're not going to have the money to have a car.
[01:26:48.073 --> 01:26:53.734]  You're going to be on a bike or in these compact cities, and guess what they're doing out in Elgin and other areas?
[01:26:53.734 --> 01:27:04.156]  They're going to use federal taxpayer money to build ten-story high-rises in the country, make everybody move into them, and they say they'll then be a factory off the back, like China.
[01:27:04.156 --> 01:27:05.656]  Yes, it's the Chinese model.
[01:27:05.656 --> 01:27:07.117]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:27:07.117 --> 01:27:08.337]  With the suicide nets, I guess.
[01:27:09.401 --> 01:27:23.891]  And you know, the Walton Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, many huge foundations are funding nonprofits that then pressure your government and partner with corporations to make this happen.
[01:27:23.891 --> 01:27:26.012]  This is what it's about, but we have power.
[01:27:26.012 --> 01:27:30.075]  The people have power, and we can stop it, but we need to work together.
[01:27:31.570 --> 01:27:42.557]  And by the way, for those that don't know, the globalists all brag, China is the model, and it's an anti-human system, not meant to build up a civilization, meant to destroy it, to reduce population.
[01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:48.841]  It's not that, oh, there's horrible labor in China before they get built up, like our industrial revolution 150 years ago.
[01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:51.623]  The globalists didn't get to fully take over.
[01:27:51.623 --> 01:27:55.526]  The robber barons got beaten back in the 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s.
[01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:57.767]  This is their massive counter-strike.
[01:27:57.767 --> 01:27:58.708]  This is their move.
[01:27:59.068 --> 01:28:00.068]  Mm-hmm, that's right.
[01:28:00.068 --> 01:28:09.331]  You know, this is, if you look at who the large corporations are behind this, some of them, like Siemens and IBM, are a continuation of the Nazi plan.
[01:28:09.331 --> 01:28:11.472]  This is exactly what we're looking at.
[01:28:11.472 --> 01:28:23.196]  Control, management of information, and restriction on your use of land, water, and minerals, and every aspect of human life is going to be controlled.
[01:28:23.196 --> 01:28:25.297]  And it is in the process right now.
[01:28:26.656 --> 01:28:38.381]  And by the way, they talk about once all the robotics is fully in and they have robots fixing the robots, which they're almost done with, a bunch of big tech companies see the ads on CNN bragging, soon robots will fix the robots that fix the robots.
[01:28:38.381 --> 01:28:40.322]  They won't put suicide nets up anymore.
[01:28:40.322 --> 01:28:42.563]  They'll tell you, go right on up and jump off.
[01:28:42.563 --> 01:28:44.603]  We have so little value.
[01:28:44.603 --> 01:28:53.887]  And the pig demon, Al Gore, the fake liberal, he's the guy on the board of Apple who's made sure they don't pay people a living wage in China.
[01:28:53.887 --> 01:28:55.428]  I mean, what a monster.
[01:28:56.428 --> 01:29:10.775]  Yeah, you know, if you take a look at what the largest job growth, what the largest industry growth is over the next 20 years projected, it's retinal scanning and imaging machines, secure data storage, satellite imaging, and of course social networking.
[01:29:10.775 --> 01:29:13.616]  So none of you, none of your information is private.
[01:29:15.461 --> 01:29:16.501]  It's just incredible.
[01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:21.343]  And I think about the Foxcom workers for Apple and just the devastating things they've gone through.
[01:29:21.343 --> 01:29:25.105]  I've got an image up for TV viewers of these innocent young people.
[01:29:25.105 --> 01:29:27.606]  I mean, total slaves.
[01:29:27.606 --> 01:29:29.146]  Absolute total slaves.
[01:29:29.146 --> 01:29:30.827]  And look how skinny they are.
[01:29:30.827 --> 01:29:32.448]  But it shows how powerful humans are.
[01:29:32.448 --> 01:29:34.989]  They actually look pretty darn healthy despite the horrible
[01:29:35.569 --> 01:29:36.750]  And they still have their human dignity.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.272]  They have pretty makeup on and stuff, the girls do.
[01:29:39.272 --> 01:29:40.532]  But they live in these facilities.
[01:29:40.532 --> 01:29:42.914]  They have forced abortions inside.
[01:29:42.914 --> 01:29:44.195]  That's on record.
[01:29:44.195 --> 01:29:46.336]  They do a scan every month.
[01:29:46.336 --> 01:29:48.398]  These people, these poor people, pray for them, folks.
[01:29:48.398 --> 01:29:50.839]  We'll be right back with Rosa Corey.
[01:29:50.839 --> 01:29:52.220]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.762]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.762 --> 01:29:57.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:07.013]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[01:30:07.013 --> 01:30:16.317]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:30:16.317 --> 01:30:22.500]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.786]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Bottom line?
[01:30:26.786 --> 01:30:29.730]  It's better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

[01:31:04.882 --> 01:31:10.803]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:31:10.803 --> 01:31:17.404]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:31:17.404 --> 01:31:23.085]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:31:23.085 --> 01:31:26.726]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:31:26.906 --> 01:31:30.727]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:31:30.727 --> 01:31:35.328]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:31:35.328 --> 01:31:37.828]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[01:31:37.828 --> 01:31:41.669]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:46.110]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.731]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:55.899]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:31:55.899 --> 01:32:01.246]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:32:01.246 --> 01:32:06.552]  Introducing Pro1, all of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:11.316]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:32:11.316 --> 01:32:17.441]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:32:17.441 --> 01:32:28.450]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:31.312]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.
[01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:34.715]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[01:32:34.915 --> 01:32:52.218]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:52.218 --> 01:32:57.539]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at infowarestore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:08.948 --> 01:33:10.649]  You got a business.
[01:33:10.649 --> 01:33:12.470]  You didn't build that.
[01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:21.616]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:33:21.616 --> 01:33:26.559]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:27.859]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.881 --> 01:33:35.682]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go back to Rosa Corey here in just a moment.
[01:33:35.682 --> 01:33:36.783]  I'm going to give the number out.
[01:33:36.783 --> 01:33:40.724]  If you've got questions or comments for her, she'll be with us until about five after next hour.
[01:33:40.724 --> 01:33:43.145]  Then we've got our next guest in studio.
[01:33:43.145 --> 01:33:44.686]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:44.686 --> 01:33:45.886]  First-time callers on this Friday.
[01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.827]  Your questions or your statements on Agenda 21.
[01:33:53.849 --> 01:33:55.450]  And this is global governance.
[01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:57.130]  It's all under UNESCO.
[01:33:57.130 --> 01:34:01.231]  That's why it's global standardized training on every front, on every issue.
[01:34:01.231 --> 01:34:04.012]  Social, cultural, religious, economic.
[01:34:04.012 --> 01:34:05.613]  It's so diabolical.
[01:34:05.613 --> 01:34:09.894]  Now, again, the book, Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, is available.
[01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:15.376]  The lowest price you're going to find anywhere, matching her price, at infowarestore.com.
[01:34:15.376 --> 01:34:17.536]  Your purchase supports our work.
[01:34:17.536 --> 01:34:18.837]  You ought to buy these by the cases.
[01:34:19.833 --> 01:34:29.748]  And give them to city planners and others to identify if they're a conscious operative or a lot of them read it and wake up and resist and Rosa can talk about that.
[01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:34.334]  So the good news is this is so diabolical and so on record.
[01:34:35.168 --> 01:34:41.312]  That if we just expose them and resist them, we're beating them all over the place, and that's why they are screaming bloody murder.
[01:34:41.312 --> 01:34:42.893]  A year ago they said this didn't exist.
[01:34:42.893 --> 01:34:46.455]  Now they're going, of course it exists, it's good, and you people are stopping us.
[01:34:46.455 --> 01:34:48.477]  We're going to be talking about that in a moment.
[01:34:48.477 --> 01:34:52.860]  Now, the new issue, the February issue of InfoWars Magazine is out.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:59.524]  The hard copy, 60 page, big color, glossy, with an image of the 50 states forming a gun.
[01:34:59.524 --> 01:35:01.646]  Why the tyrants want your guns.
[01:35:02.606 --> 01:35:04.469]  And this is guaranteed to sell out.
[01:35:04.469 --> 01:35:07.293]  Sometimes the magazine sells out in four or five days.
[01:35:07.293 --> 01:35:11.038]  We put 70,000 on the streets in Texas and sell 30,000.
[01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:11.699]  We hold back some.
[01:35:11.699 --> 01:35:17.007]  You can either buy them in bulk in groups of 10 up to 100 at cost or get a one-year subscription.
[01:35:17.928 --> 01:35:28.240]  And when you get the one-year subscription while supplies last, we are also able to then generally put in the last issue a few that we hold back.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:36.871]  So you can subscribe at InfoWarsTore.com or you can buy them in bulk while supplies last at InfoWarsTore.com or you can call toll-free 888.
[01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:40.013]  253-3139.
[01:35:40.013 --> 01:35:44.615]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:44.615 --> 01:35:46.936]  An amazing magazine.
[01:35:46.936 --> 01:35:48.697]  People are blown away by it.
[01:35:48.697 --> 01:35:50.117]  And it's a pamphlet.
[01:35:50.117 --> 01:35:57.321]  It's a 60-page color pamphlet that you can buy at cost to give to people to wake them up.
[01:35:57.321 --> 01:35:59.162]  It is an info war.
[01:35:59.162 --> 01:35:59.702]  And finally,
[01:36:00.717 --> 01:36:09.104]  You know, four years ago, we sold the Obama-Joker-Socialism shirt.
[01:36:09.104 --> 01:36:11.066]  Really, it's fascism, so we had both variants.
[01:36:11.066 --> 01:36:14.789]  But we only sold it for about a year, and then I said, I'm never going to sell it again.
[01:36:14.789 --> 01:36:16.971]  We may sell a different design later.
[01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:19.433]  Our great graphics designer, Janae Meadows,
[01:36:20.498 --> 01:36:25.981]  She put together the Obama Tyrant shirt that I'm holding here in my hands.
[01:36:25.981 --> 01:36:28.642]  And it is Obama the Joker and it says Tyrant.
[01:36:28.642 --> 01:36:29.923]  InfoWars.com.
[01:36:29.923 --> 01:36:35.526]  When people then ask you what it's about, it's a great conversation piece to wake them up.
[01:36:35.526 --> 01:36:39.348]  And on the back, we've taken our most popular t-shirt ever and put that on the back.
[01:36:39.348 --> 01:36:40.789]  InfoWars.com.
[01:36:40.789 --> 01:36:45.391]  An AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed on the back.
[01:36:45.391 --> 01:36:46.952]  And the words come and take it.
[01:36:47.492 --> 01:36:54.788]  So, I think this is going to end up being the best t-shirt most popular ever and that's how we fund our news operation and everything here and fight these globalists.
[01:36:54.788 --> 01:36:57.213]  Now, before I go back to Rosa, I want to say this about guns.
[01:37:00.185 --> 01:37:07.892]  The NRA, I saw a statement they put out yesterday, and in the past they were like, yeah, we think there should be background checks for everybody.
[01:37:07.892 --> 01:37:10.194]  Get rid of private sales even to your neighbor of a gun.
[01:37:10.194 --> 01:37:13.737]  And they were asked, why have you changed and said you're not against private sales now?
[01:37:13.737 --> 01:37:18.381]  And they said, because the system doesn't work, criminals will still have guns.
[01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:21.744]  Well, let me take that one further, and then we're going to go to our guest.
[01:37:21.744 --> 01:37:22.785]  Let me take that one further.
[01:37:23.846 --> 01:37:25.407]  We don't trust the system.
[01:37:25.407 --> 01:37:35.253]  Yeah, it sounds reasonable to have a mental background check and a bunch of background checks to get a gun, and if angels were running things, the good angels, then I would be for it.
[01:37:35.253 --> 01:37:37.434]  The globalists have taken the guns everywhere in the world.
[01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:40.776]  While they arm against us, they are taking our guns.
[01:37:40.776 --> 01:37:42.838]  Australia took all the semi-autos, then the
[01:37:43.698 --> 01:37:45.179]  Now they're taking the bolt action.
[01:37:45.179 --> 01:37:46.080]  It's happened everywhere.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.463]  These globalists are on record saying they're going to have the abolition of our guns.
[01:37:50.463 --> 01:37:54.046]  The UN is on record, while they engage in atrocities worldwide.
[01:37:54.046 --> 01:37:54.806]  It's the same thing.
[01:37:54.806 --> 01:37:56.528]  I like bike lanes.
[01:37:56.528 --> 01:38:04.433]  I like a city ordinance saying you get a tax discount if you put a garden on your roof.
[01:38:04.433 --> 01:38:06.535]  I like things like that.
[01:38:06.535 --> 01:38:09.817]  The problem is they take all this good stuff and make it global
[01:38:10.698 --> 01:38:16.122]  And selectively enforce it, and that's just the window dressing for all the bad stuff that goes on.
[01:38:16.122 --> 01:38:18.744]  I want to give her the floor for about 10 minutes before we go to calls.
[01:38:18.744 --> 01:38:21.686]  I'm going to stick a sock in my mouth because the information is so important.
[01:38:21.686 --> 01:38:22.647]  Because I know it's real.
[01:38:22.647 --> 01:38:23.827]  I know it's a criminal takeover.
[01:38:23.827 --> 01:38:30.672]  It's like, if I saw a guy robbing my neighbors, I'd be like, you know, going, hey, Bob, somebody's in your garage.
[01:38:30.672 --> 01:38:34.275]  I mean, it's, it's, but this is our liberty, our freedom, our economy.
[01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:35.456]  They want to wreck it.
[01:38:35.456 --> 01:38:37.037]  They're on record wanting to wreck it.
[01:38:37.905 --> 01:38:45.452]  And it's not that environmental stuff isn't reasonable, that's the sugar coating on the cyanide pill to make it taste good.
[01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:48.695]  You can give somebody Kool-Aid, you know, Jim Jones, but it had cyanide in it.
[01:38:48.695 --> 01:38:50.956]  Tastes like grape Kool-Aid, gonna kill you better than a hammer.
[01:38:50.956 --> 01:38:52.698]  Tastes real good, like antifreeze.
[01:38:52.698 --> 01:38:53.619]  It tastes good, it'll kill you.
[01:38:54.733 --> 01:39:02.157]  And that's what's frustrating is that they all want to sound reasonable and they want us to sit back and be nice and debate with them in a false paradigm.
[01:39:02.157 --> 01:39:05.779]  No, it's time to get aggressive to shake people out of their trance.
[01:39:05.779 --> 01:39:10.001]  That's why they're now admitting Piers Morgan was a defeat when I blew up.
[01:39:10.714 --> 01:39:11.855]  For him.
[01:39:11.855 --> 01:39:14.077]  They're now admitting, oh, this is the way to get.
[01:39:14.077 --> 01:39:15.359]  Oh, being aggressive does work.
[01:39:15.359 --> 01:39:16.400]  Of course it works.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.001]  They're aggressive.
[01:39:18.001 --> 01:39:19.503]  Get aggressive or get overrun.
[01:39:19.503 --> 01:39:21.184]  Now, Rosa, I'm going to shut up for 10 minutes.
[01:39:21.184 --> 01:39:22.626]  Then we're going to take a few calls for you.
[01:39:22.626 --> 01:39:30.153]  But break down, again, the latest on what they're doing, our victories, how we beat them, where you see this going.
[01:39:30.153 --> 01:39:30.634]  Rosa Corey.
[01:39:31.034 --> 01:39:31.614]  Mm-hmm.
[01:39:31.614 --> 01:39:36.756]  Well, you know, first of all, I want to make sure that people know this is the hijacking of the environmental movement.
[01:39:36.756 --> 01:39:43.838]  That's why I called my book Behind the Green Mask, because if it didn't look good and sound good, then we wouldn't be going for it.
[01:39:43.838 --> 01:39:51.660]  So there is a political and social ideology that goes, you know, that's sort of overarching on this, and it's communitarianism.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.882]  And Dan Jones just called Obama a communitarian.
[01:39:55.882 --> 01:40:06.149]  He said that we've gone way too far in the individualistic direction and we have to pull it back to rebalance towards communitarianism.
[01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:11.592]  And what that means is that your individual rights are balanced with the so-called community.
[01:40:12.052 --> 01:40:14.474]  And the community can change at any time.
[01:40:14.474 --> 01:40:27.502]  What this is about is about taking away your right to privacy, to your freedom, to live where you wish, to move freely, and to instate instead the power of the community.
[01:40:27.502 --> 01:40:30.664]  So this is why it's about consensus.
[01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:45.780]  And the Delphi technique where you get invited to give your opinion on a new plan in the center of your town, but if you don't agree with what the direction of that plan is, what the goal is, then you're considered to be fringe and you are ignored.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.182]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:40:47.182 --> 01:40:52.948]  It's about artificial consensus and giving the illusion of community buy-in.
[01:40:53.444 --> 01:41:05.931]  So that's why I say awareness is the first step in the resistance, because people need to educate themselves about what this looks like in their town, because you're going to see it called many different things.
[01:41:05.931 --> 01:41:10.013]  Your smart meters, you might see it as the International Code.
[01:41:10.013 --> 01:41:18.377]  You'll see it as whatever that plan is called, Vision 2025, or One Valley, One Vision, or whatever they're calling it in your town.
[01:41:18.377 --> 01:41:19.538]  It's the same plan.
[01:41:20.058 --> 01:41:22.019]  All across the world.
[01:41:22.019 --> 01:41:39.490]  And Agenda 21 is the action plan to inventory and control all land, water, minerals, plants, animals, means of construction, education, energy, and information, and human beings.
[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.831]  In the world.
[01:41:40.831 --> 01:41:42.892]  That's what this plan is about.
[01:41:42.892 --> 01:41:45.413]  Now we have a chance to fight this.
[01:41:45.413 --> 01:41:50.735]  I believe that 2013 is the year of critical awareness all over the world.
[01:41:50.735 --> 01:41:52.656]  And we are really breaking through.
[01:41:52.656 --> 01:41:58.899]  This is the year where people are understanding that this is a global, regional, neighborhood plan.
[01:41:58.899 --> 01:42:03.902]  It's global, designed to look like it's coming up from the grassroots, and it is not.
[01:42:03.902 --> 01:42:05.142]  So it's up to us.
[01:42:05.142 --> 01:42:06.163]  There's no heroes.
[01:42:06.813 --> 01:42:08.714]  Nobody on the sidelines here.
[01:42:08.714 --> 01:42:14.735]  You know, we've got to get out there and expose these public-private partnerships in our local communities, in our towns.
[01:42:14.735 --> 01:42:25.678]  We want to educate our local officials and let them know that we will support them if they refuse to take federal grants for Partnership for Sustainable Community grants.
[01:42:25.678 --> 01:42:31.679]  We will support them, but if they don't, if they don't listen to us, we will take them out.
[01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:34.420]  We need to recognize that we have power.
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.440]  So what we're doing is,
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.682]  We are getting active in the resistance.
[01:42:38.682 --> 01:42:41.925]  We're understanding that you don't wait until it gets violent.
[01:42:41.925 --> 01:42:45.087]  You want to call a halt to it while you can.
[01:42:45.087 --> 01:42:47.749]  So you want to stop redevelopment projects.
[01:42:47.749 --> 01:42:53.494]  This is so-called urban renewal, which actually directs you into city centers.
[01:42:53.494 --> 01:42:57.658]  You want to stop them from pulverizing your rural roads to gravel.
[01:42:57.658 --> 01:43:04.063]  You want to get out there and protect those farmers that are out there being restricted and regulated to death.
[01:43:04.463 --> 01:43:07.905]  They're putting monitoring on wells, private wells.
[01:43:07.905 --> 01:43:13.549]  What is happening with your government is that you are looking at treason.
[01:43:13.549 --> 01:43:17.692]  Treason is happening in every town all across the world.
[01:43:17.692 --> 01:43:20.614]  There are people who think that they're doing the right thing.
[01:43:20.614 --> 01:43:31.361]  It's up to us as the informed electorate to let our elected officials know that they are committing treason and treason has no statute of limitations.
[01:43:32.133 --> 01:43:36.879]  There is no statute of limitations, so these people will be held to account.
[01:43:36.879 --> 01:43:38.502]  And this is our job.
[01:43:38.502 --> 01:43:40.865]  There are way more of us than there are of them.
[01:43:40.865 --> 01:43:44.450]  And we need to expose collaborators, speak out,
[01:43:45.032 --> 01:43:57.418]  Anti-Delphi these meetings and work together to break that left-right paradigm because that terrifies those who are in power and we can do it We are doing it all over the world.
[01:43:57.418 --> 01:44:04.622]  I'll actually be in Texas in March I'm traveling all across the country speaking out and people are joining me.
[01:44:04.622 --> 01:44:08.084]  This is tremendous We are really getting movement across the world
[01:44:09.522 --> 01:44:14.104]  And by the way, you know, the globalists operate like we don't read their own websites and white papers.
[01:44:14.104 --> 01:44:15.825]  Talk about their panic button.
[01:44:15.825 --> 01:44:21.388]  They're not just freaking out in the Washington Post, New York Times, you know, admitting we're fighting them globally.
[01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:24.970]  They are panicking in their own white papers right now.
[01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:26.151]  What's hurting them the worst?
[01:44:26.151 --> 01:44:27.912]  I mean, I guess just exposure.
[01:44:27.912 --> 01:44:29.733]  People go to the meetings.
[01:44:29.733 --> 01:44:31.333]  No one's allowed to even talk.
[01:44:31.333 --> 01:44:35.676]  They just tell you, you know, what to believe, or even if you do, they then certify it.
[01:44:35.676 --> 01:44:37.877]  I mean, people understand what's happening here.
[01:44:38.871 --> 01:44:45.836]  Well, you know, we have a series of videos online called Near Riot at Delphi Meeting, which are really great.
[01:44:45.836 --> 01:44:57.404]  And the thing is, is that people now are beginning to recognize what it looks like, because they've been told, you know, these controlled opposition people will tell you not to talk about Agenda 21.
[01:44:57.404 --> 01:45:01.307]  And, you know, you're being directed by people who are infiltrating your
[01:45:01.727 --> 01:45:02.227]  Exactly!
[01:45:02.227 --> 01:45:09.069]  They'll say it's discrediting to talk about Agenda 21 and the UN Biological Diversity Assessments.
[01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:10.090]  Don't do that!
[01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:11.910]  That is how they're controlling people.
[01:45:16.732 --> 01:45:17.672]  We're good to go.
[01:45:45.266 --> 01:45:53.232]  Money coming from the federal government that is funding these plans, and then that money is coming from corporations and non-profits.
[01:45:53.232 --> 01:45:57.676]  So what you want to do is break that cycle and refuse to participate.
[01:45:57.676 --> 01:45:59.277]  You want to be the resistance.
[01:45:59.277 --> 01:45:59.657]  That's right.
[01:45:59.657 --> 01:46:04.201]  All the big mega-corporations, they put tiny seed money in to get the politicians.
[01:46:04.201 --> 01:46:09.025]  They conduit federal HUD money and others, just like Akron, but in a hundred other groups plus.
[01:46:09.665 --> 01:46:20.812]  Back to them, to then let them take over the local government, take over the infrastructure, and then have their buildings subsidized and go tax-free while not letting you fix your roof.
[01:46:21.926 --> 01:46:22.826]  You know, that's right.
[01:46:22.826 --> 01:46:25.468]  And it's not only, hey, it's not only in land use.
[01:46:25.468 --> 01:46:33.191]  We're talking about education with a common core, standards, where teachers no longer can teach, where students are being restricted.
[01:46:33.191 --> 01:46:40.754]  I'm sure, Alex, you know about those little kids, the six-year-olds who got suspended from school for using their fingers like guns and saying, dang it.
[01:46:40.754 --> 01:46:42.775]  It's total Soviet mind control.
[01:46:43.155 --> 01:46:53.541]  Right, this is what we're talking about is actually social engineering and restricting human beings so that they literally don't know what is right and what is wrong.
[01:46:53.541 --> 01:46:55.302]  And this is how you break down a society.
[01:46:55.302 --> 01:46:57.464]  We want to talk about a hostile takeover.
[01:46:58.755 --> 01:47:13.967]  The authoritarians, I've read countless books, Bernays and others, they say, we have them do, we tell them ridiculous things are bad, we tell them common sense things are bad, we tell them good things are bad, so they feel guilty and off balance and we'll do whatever we say.
[01:47:13.967 --> 01:47:20.872]  They're giving them a guilt complex, and again, the teachers don't know, they're just given the programming, the handbooks.
[01:47:20.872 --> 01:47:24.475]  It is meant to prepare children to believe they're criminals.
[01:47:24.475 --> 01:47:25.476]  It is pure evil.
[01:47:25.899 --> 01:47:26.499]  That's right.
[01:47:26.499 --> 01:47:40.424]  We need to refuse to participate, refuse to give your personal information, refuse to collaborate, refuse to pay non-profits, refuse to give donations, and refuse to volunteer.
[01:47:40.424 --> 01:47:42.584]  If you're a teacher, refuse!
[01:47:42.584 --> 01:47:44.025]  We need to do this together.
[01:47:44.025 --> 01:47:46.426]  There are so many of us who are becoming aware.
[01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:52.067]  We need to stand tall, stand together, and refuse this indoctrination that we're getting.
[01:47:52.067 --> 01:47:53.568]  How freaked out is the enemy right now?
[01:47:54.053 --> 01:47:55.655]  They are so freaked out!
[01:47:55.655 --> 01:47:56.837]  It's incredible!
[01:47:56.837 --> 01:48:02.205]  They were thinking they were going to pull this off and be able to... They're in the endgame, but you know what?
[01:48:02.205 --> 01:48:08.034]  We are giving them a run for their money and we will prevail because this is not going to fly.
[01:48:08.034 --> 01:48:09.356]  People are not willing to
[01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.449]  I think so.
[01:48:29.548 --> 01:48:30.929]  Well they've openly announced it.
[01:48:30.929 --> 01:48:37.211]  I'm in this particular mega region and they admit that you're not going to live in these little towns unless you have special permits.
[01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:41.453]  That's all under the original UN maps where half the country's off limits.
[01:48:41.453 --> 01:48:43.514]  I mean this is so diabolical.
[01:48:43.514 --> 01:48:44.675]  It's true, but you know what?
[01:48:44.675 --> 01:48:46.215]  We do have them on the run.
[01:48:46.215 --> 01:48:50.037]  When you start seeing this, you know, they're vilifying me in the press.
[01:48:50.037 --> 01:48:51.538]  That's when I know I'm winning.
[01:48:51.538 --> 01:48:55.600]  When they're actually out there talking about this and they're saying, oh that agenda 21, that's the
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:49:00.543]  It's a good thing when they wouldn't even admit that it existed for 20 years.
[01:49:00.543 --> 01:49:02.264]  You know, then you know you're winning.
[01:49:02.264 --> 01:49:03.525]  We are out there.
[01:49:03.525 --> 01:49:07.487]  We are bringing up the truth and nobody is going to be left behind.
[01:49:07.487 --> 01:49:08.988]  Nobody on the sidelines.
[01:49:08.988 --> 01:49:09.929]  No heroes.
[01:49:09.929 --> 01:49:11.089]  We all work together.
[01:49:11.089 --> 01:49:12.270]  That's another reason.
[01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.650]  You know what?
[01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:20.375]  My book is a great opportunity for you to get up to speed on this quickly and we've got 20 pages in the back on what you can do.
[01:49:20.375 --> 01:49:24.478]  So you want to educate yourself and others as quickly as you can.
[01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:26.210]  Absolutely.
[01:49:26.210 --> 01:49:28.232]  I want to come back and take two short segments of calls.
[01:49:28.232 --> 01:49:34.118]  Then we have Pastor Steven Anderson in here talking about the police state in a new film and a lot more.
[01:49:34.118 --> 01:49:40.866]  Rosa Corey is our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask, available at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:49:40.866 --> 01:49:45.210]  We're about to go to break in about a minute.
[01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:47.533]  Any other key points you want to relay to people right now?
[01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:51.553]  Yeah, you know, this plan is predicated on sharing information.
[01:49:51.553 --> 01:49:53.455]  That's part of Agenda 21.
[01:49:53.455 --> 01:49:56.077]  It's all about sharing our info through technology.
[01:49:56.077 --> 01:49:57.899]  This is a technocracy.
[01:49:57.899 --> 01:50:00.821]  So every part of your life is being shared.
[01:50:00.821 --> 01:50:02.623]  You have no personal privacy.
[01:50:02.623 --> 01:50:06.186]  You need to break that paradigm and refuse to cooperate.
[01:50:06.226 --> 01:50:18.129]  That's why they want you in the megapolises with the face scanning cameras, the controls, where they can turn the taxes up to bankrupt anybody they want and literally render you down to people living in jail cells.
[01:50:18.129 --> 01:50:18.929]  That's their plan.
[01:50:18.929 --> 01:50:23.190]  Turn the cities into giant medium security prison grids.
[01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:28.411]  I mean, it's while the elite live in the country and are exempt flying there by jet copter.
[01:50:28.411 --> 01:50:29.412]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:29.412 --> 01:50:34.253]  This is about controlling populations, restricting ability to move freely.
[01:50:35.029 --> 01:50:36.470]  And to speak out.
[01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:43.776]  But they're going to have model, and Austin is it, model megacities where the elite lives that are quasi-exempt.
[01:50:43.776 --> 01:50:45.218]  It's so incredible.
[01:50:45.218 --> 01:50:47.059]  I mean, these people, it's a science fiction movie, folks.
[01:50:47.059 --> 01:50:49.121]  You're living in a science fiction movie.
[01:50:49.121 --> 01:50:50.482]  You've got to read her book.
[01:50:50.482 --> 01:50:53.525]  You've got to see my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:50:53.525 --> 01:50:56.107]  This is a stated on-the-record program.
[01:50:56.107 --> 01:50:58.088]  These are criminal authoritarians.
[01:50:58.088 --> 01:51:00.711]  You've got to realize they are your mortal enemies.
[01:51:01.616 --> 01:51:06.179]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:51:06.179 --> 01:51:07.099]  Number one.
[01:51:07.099 --> 01:51:10.502]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:51:10.502 --> 01:51:11.362]  Number two.
[01:51:11.362 --> 01:51:16.265]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:16.265 --> 01:51:17.006]  It's true.
[01:51:17.006 --> 01:51:21.889]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:21.889 --> 01:51:22.709]  Number three.
[01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:26.292]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:26.292 --> 01:51:29.974]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:30.194 --> 01:51:30.995]  Number 4.
[01:51:30.995 --> 01:51:33.758]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:33.758 --> 01:51:37.442]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:37.442 --> 01:51:38.222]  Number 5.
[01:51:38.222 --> 01:51:42.387]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:51:42.387 --> 01:51:47.132]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:47.412 --> 01:51:51.599]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:51:51.599 --> 01:51:53.382]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:52:06.975 --> 01:52:11.501]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public.
[01:52:11.501 --> 01:52:14.205]  And we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[01:52:14.205 --> 01:52:18.111]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet.
[01:52:18.311 --> 01:52:20.233]  Because MREs are all we do.
[01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:23.815]  Tasty varieties of chicken, beef, salmon, and pasta entrees.

[01:52:26.558 --> 01:52:29.860]  Full moisture, long shelf life, and ready to eat hot or cold.
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:33.163]  We sell by the pouch or case, so the choices are endless.
[01:52:33.163 --> 01:52:35.525]  And so are the graduated quantity discounts.

[01:52:52.719 --> 01:52:53.940]  Emergency preparedness.

[01:52:55.061 --> 01:52:56.362]  Longlifefood.com.
[01:52:56.362 --> 01:52:57.663]  Since 1983.
[01:52:57.663 --> 01:53:00.985]  Sending real food to your real future.
[01:53:00.985 --> 01:53:05.769]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:53:05.769 --> 01:53:08.791]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:53:08.791 --> 01:53:17.098]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:53:17.745 --> 01:53:23.286]  Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:53:23.286 --> 01:53:34.668]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[01:53:34.668 --> 01:53:41.670]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:46.653]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:50.256]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[01:53:50.256 --> 01:53:57.501]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[01:53:57.501 --> 01:53:58.782]  Protect your immune system.
[01:53:58.782 --> 01:53:59.823]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:54:06.343 --> 01:54:18.808]  I read part of the Telecommunications Act in 96 and it said by October 1st, 2001, all cell phones had to have a tracker chip in them to track you via satellite triangulation via the cell towers.
[01:54:18.808 --> 01:54:21.769]  And that the government would be able to dial in and listen to your phone even when it's off.
[01:54:21.769 --> 01:54:23.710]  It was all there.
[01:54:23.710 --> 01:54:27.372]  And that they would start sending you messages onto your phone.
[01:54:28.152 --> 01:54:29.993]  And it described text messages and others.
[01:54:29.993 --> 01:54:31.573]  It described smartphones.
[01:54:31.573 --> 01:54:33.454]  They're like 30 years ahead of us.
[01:54:33.454 --> 01:54:34.854]  Here's Fox News.
[01:54:34.854 --> 01:54:38.115]  Text on missing kids startles cell users.
[01:54:38.115 --> 01:54:39.476]  And this is out of Los Angeles.
[01:54:39.476 --> 01:54:42.116]  They first tested on the East Coast, now the West Coast.
[01:54:42.116 --> 01:54:43.297]  Now it's happening in Austin.
[01:54:43.297 --> 01:54:44.917]  My crew are getting these.
[01:54:44.917 --> 01:54:47.598]  And they say now it's going to be presidential announcements.
[01:54:47.598 --> 01:54:48.939]  Your smartphone will break in.
[01:54:48.939 --> 01:54:49.779]  It'll be Obama.
[01:54:50.751 --> 01:54:53.893]  I mean, people of Earth, we are the Glaxian Empire.
[01:54:53.893 --> 01:54:56.835]  I mean, it's total control.
[01:54:56.835 --> 01:54:59.577]  The police are being trained to set up checkpoints to take your guns.
[01:54:59.577 --> 01:55:01.558]  It's already happening to veterans in New York.
[01:55:01.558 --> 01:55:02.419]  Checkpoints.
[01:55:02.419 --> 01:55:05.321]  They just randomly pull you over a checkpoint, search your car.
[01:55:05.321 --> 01:55:07.662]  30 round mag, five felonies.
[01:55:07.662 --> 01:55:08.523]  I mean, they're coming.
[01:55:08.523 --> 01:55:10.884]  This is how they're going to purge us.
[01:55:10.884 --> 01:55:12.145]  And you're like, well, I'll just turn my guns in.
[01:55:12.145 --> 01:55:13.186]  They're still coming.
[01:55:13.186 --> 01:55:16.348]  These are authoritarians.
[01:55:16.348 --> 01:55:17.409]  We're in so much trouble.
[01:55:19.048 --> 01:55:21.569]  I just can't believe it's actually happening.
[01:55:21.569 --> 01:55:24.169]  And there are a lot of people that want power.
[01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:27.970]  Here it is, FEMA implements special chip in cell phones to send out alerts.
[01:55:27.970 --> 01:55:33.011]  I told people about this 16 years ago, and they looked at me like I was a space alien.
[01:55:33.011 --> 01:55:36.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're running army checkpoints all over the country.
[01:55:36.412 --> 01:55:42.373]  They're having hardcore army drills everywhere and saying the army is going to respond to extremists now in America.
[01:55:42.893 --> 01:55:50.077]  They're getting ready for the organized collapse where they'll pose as the saviors and try to then bring us under their control.
[01:55:50.077 --> 01:55:53.719]  That's part of the plan, is a stepped process of collapses.
[01:55:53.719 --> 01:55:56.401]  Rosa Corey, we're going to take a few calls, but your comment on what I just covered.
[01:55:56.932 --> 01:56:03.096]  Well, you know, it goes worse than that because there's something called mandatory volunteering.
[01:56:03.096 --> 01:56:06.939]  And if you haven't caught on to that, it's basically slavery.
[01:56:06.939 --> 01:56:15.424]  This is the trend where you're going to be expected to do your mandatory volunteering if you want to get anything from the so-called community.
[01:56:15.424 --> 01:56:19.427]  So we're talking about restrictions on every aspect of your life.
[01:56:19.967 --> 01:56:23.129]  You have to pay 70% on average if you actually work for the government one way or another.
[01:56:23.129 --> 01:56:28.132]  Rahm Emanuel said you're going to serve at least two months every year, up to age 65.
[01:56:28.132 --> 01:56:29.953]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:29.953 --> 01:56:32.994]  Lifelong learning and participation in your community.
[01:56:32.994 --> 01:56:34.655]  This means brainwashing.
[01:56:34.655 --> 01:56:35.896]  Giving back.
[01:56:35.896 --> 01:56:36.656]  That's it.
[01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:40.178]  We're not doing enough.
[01:56:40.178 --> 01:56:47.622]  Let's go ahead and take a call from a listener who's listening on KKGM up in Dallas, Fort Worth, 1630.
[01:56:47.622 --> 01:56:48.823]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[01:56:48.823 --> 01:56:48.943]  Go.
[01:56:50.347 --> 01:56:55.736]  Hi, there was two ladies that recently got arrested for their smart meters.
[01:56:55.736 --> 01:56:58.500]  I want to know, Rosie, did you hear anything about that?
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.062]  Because I have a similar story.
[01:57:00.062 --> 01:57:01.084]  Yeah, sure.
[01:57:01.084 --> 01:57:05.531]  That's in Naperville, and you know, a very good friend of mine, Thelma Tarmena, and
[01:57:05.791 --> 01:57:07.072]  For those who don't know,
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:29.601]  They admit that, and all the new appliances, and the CIA director admitted, Petraeus said we're spying on you through your, quote, washing machine.
[01:57:29.601 --> 01:57:32.662]  All the new ones, it dials in and monitors you.
[01:57:32.662 --> 01:57:35.902]  I mean, they're putting a giant eavesdropper on your house.
[01:57:35.902 --> 01:57:37.023]  Check this out, Alex.
[01:57:37.023 --> 01:57:40.183]  I don't know if you knew this, but you know how they crush the old cars?
[01:57:40.183 --> 01:57:50.605]  Well, they're going into, you know, like Goodwills and stuff and buying up old appliances and crushing those so that you can't get, you won't be able to get an old appliance that doesn't have a chip in it.
[01:57:50.945 --> 01:57:52.947]  They know what they're doing, boy.
[01:57:52.947 --> 01:57:54.608]  That's what the design is.
[01:57:54.608 --> 01:57:57.190]  Think of the diabolical evil, folks.
[01:57:57.190 --> 01:58:00.472]  I mean, this is a nightmare!
[01:58:00.472 --> 01:58:01.553]  Yeah, but you know what?
[01:58:01.553 --> 01:58:03.174]  We are going to win this.
[01:58:03.174 --> 01:58:04.375]  We need to work together.
[01:58:04.375 --> 01:58:06.296]  Let's get the information out to people.
[01:58:06.296 --> 01:58:06.677]  I agree.
[01:58:06.677 --> 01:58:08.138]  Ryan, what happened to you real fast?
[01:58:09.712 --> 01:58:10.973]  I had a sign.
[01:58:10.973 --> 01:58:16.976]  I listened to the lady from Democrats vs. Agenda 21, the lady that you have on.
[01:58:16.976 --> 01:58:18.716]  Anyways, I put a sign on.
[01:58:18.716 --> 01:58:22.178]  I wrote a bunch of letters to the proper officials.
[01:58:22.178 --> 01:58:25.620]  I even put a lock onto the smart meter.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:32.863]  They came through trespass with the sign that said exclusively that you're allowed on my property but not to switch out the meter.
[01:58:32.863 --> 01:58:36.565]  They ripped the sign down, took off the lock, put in the smart meter.
[01:58:36.565 --> 01:58:38.846]  I called the lady, actually talked to the PR people.
[01:58:39.467 --> 01:58:42.093]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:42.093 --> 01:58:45.621]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:12.767 --> 02:00:14.308]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.308 --> 02:00:18.509]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.509 --> 02:00:22.571]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.708 --> 02:00:26.369]  Oh man, I want to go to more of your calls.
[02:00:26.369 --> 02:00:27.230]  We're almost out of time.
[02:00:27.230 --> 02:00:30.892]  We've got a powerful in-studio guest as well, but she's coming to Texas.
[02:00:30.892 --> 02:00:33.534]  We'll get her in here for two hours at that time.
[02:00:33.534 --> 02:00:36.076]  Rosa Corey's our guest, author of Behind the Green Mask.
[02:00:37.239 --> 02:00:38.240]  Ryan in Texas.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:41.703]  Yeah, no, it's illegal for them to come across your property and do this.
[02:00:41.703 --> 02:00:44.666]  They could just turn your power off, I guess, and you've got to argue with them on that.
[02:00:44.666 --> 02:00:48.050]  That's why they have laws trying to block real solar power you control.
[02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:49.371]  They want it in their grid.
[02:00:49.371 --> 02:00:52.714]  And that's really the answer here, is to get out of the system.
[02:00:52.714 --> 02:00:56.338]  You know, real sustainability, their sustainability is the opposite of sustainability.
[02:00:56.338 --> 02:00:58.239]  It's slavery.
[02:00:58.239 --> 02:01:00.422]  But what happened when you said you violated my rights?
[02:01:01.872 --> 02:01:05.654]  Uh, they said, well, by law that we can come in and do whatever we want.
[02:01:05.654 --> 02:01:06.795]  That's our property.
[02:01:06.795 --> 02:01:07.795]  And I said, well, you know what?
[02:01:07.795 --> 02:01:16.200]  I want my, I want your property removed and I'm going to take it out and I'm going to go on eBay and buy myself a little analog, uh, analog meter and replace it.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.822]  And they say, well, if you even touch it, that's tampering and we'll have you arrested.
[02:01:19.822 --> 02:01:21.103]  And I go, well, I want it out.
[02:01:21.103 --> 02:01:24.044]  And they go, the only option is for you to go solar.
[02:01:24.044 --> 02:01:24.264]  And, uh,
[02:01:25.525 --> 02:01:33.691]  And anybody that refuses to have the smart meter installed in the beginning quarter of this year, they're just going to start turning people's powers off.
[02:01:33.691 --> 02:01:35.493]  You know what?
[02:01:35.493 --> 02:01:48.882]  I say go dark, and then they're going to send the health department saying you're unsanitary and stuff, and say, hey, get a civil rights lawsuit, and then bring out that they're dialing into everything you're doing, watching and listening to you, including jacking your computers.
[02:01:48.882 --> 02:01:53.266]  This is on record, folks, in the Google patents, and dialing into your camera and microphone.
[02:01:53.868 --> 02:01:54.653]  God bless you, sir.
[02:01:54.653 --> 02:01:56.485]  Let's go get a quick comment from Rosa Corey.
[02:01:58.072 --> 02:02:00.193]  It's time to get back to that anyways!
[02:02:00.193 --> 02:02:01.114]  Get the candles out!
[02:02:01.114 --> 02:02:01.394]  Go dark!
[02:02:27.708 --> 02:02:30.492]  Yeah, I lived like that for a long time in Mexico.
[02:02:30.492 --> 02:02:32.394]  It's great.
[02:02:32.394 --> 02:02:33.476]  It's like camping.
[02:02:33.476 --> 02:02:35.078]  I mean, go dark, folks.
[02:02:35.078 --> 02:02:35.719]  Go dark.
[02:02:35.719 --> 02:02:37.822]  We either fight, and it's only going to get worse, okay?
[02:02:37.822 --> 02:02:40.986]  This is a scientific, in their words, technocracy.
[02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:44.550]  They think they've got it all planned out, and they're counting on you to be lazy.
[02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:46.170]  God bless you, sir.
[02:02:46.170 --> 02:02:47.931]  Go dark, sue them, fight them.
[02:02:47.931 --> 02:02:49.732]  This is the new civil rights movement.
[02:02:49.732 --> 02:02:56.514]  While they're busy saying, if you don't want to turn your guns in, you're a cracker, you know, and that's on MSNBC, total racism, to create racial division.
[02:02:56.514 --> 02:02:59.996]  The real discrimination is going on against all of us by the globalists.
[02:02:59.996 --> 02:03:03.677]  Mike in New Hampshire, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:03:03.677 --> 02:03:04.838]  Hey, how are you, Alex?
[02:03:04.838 --> 02:03:05.158]  Good, sir.
[02:03:06.857 --> 02:03:07.377]  How you doing?
[02:03:07.377 --> 02:03:15.199]  I got a quick question for you.
[02:03:15.199 --> 02:03:18.180]  I'm 36 years old and I have three children up here.
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:20.740]  I'm very invested in what's going on.
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:29.002]  I would like some sort of brochure that I would commit to knock on every door in my town here in Epping, New Hampshire and tell them about Agenda 21.
[02:03:31.223 --> 02:03:33.944]  We have those flyers for you on our website.
[02:03:33.944 --> 02:03:38.106]  That's DemocratsAgainstUNAgenda21.com.
[02:03:38.106 --> 02:03:45.148]  Those flyers are called, What's Wrong With Sustainable Development and Why Is Everyone Talking About Agenda 21?
[02:03:45.148 --> 02:03:45.968]  Make those flyers.
[02:03:45.968 --> 02:03:47.849]  You can make 100 flyers for $6.
[02:03:47.849 --> 02:03:48.569]  Walk them around.
[02:03:48.569 --> 02:03:50.010]  Get that info out to everyone.
[02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:51.091]  Absolutely.
[02:03:51.091 --> 02:03:53.413]  It's time to hit them and hit them hard.
[02:03:53.413 --> 02:03:54.535]  And you said you've got children.
[02:03:54.535 --> 02:03:55.536]  That's what this is about.
[02:03:55.536 --> 02:04:01.402]  This is the Chinese communist slave model with a tiny elite on top that are free market and get the money.
[02:04:01.402 --> 02:04:08.189]  The globalists, the CFR admits, the deal they made with the Chinese communists is the plan here.
[02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:09.510]  They've done this in China.
[02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.791]  Rosa?
[02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:11.291]  Yeah, and that's it.
[02:04:11.291 --> 02:04:12.571]  This is what we're fighting.
[02:04:12.571 --> 02:04:21.236]  One great thing is that this year I am being invited to speak to governors, to congresspeople, to senators, all across the country.
[02:04:21.236 --> 02:04:24.078]  So people are getting through to their elected officials.
[02:04:24.078 --> 02:04:25.959]  We want to draw this down.
[02:04:25.959 --> 02:04:26.940]  We want to block it.
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:29.581]  This is an ideology and we will stop it.
[02:04:29.581 --> 02:04:32.743]  Free people never submit to this kind of tyranny.
[02:04:33.888 --> 02:04:34.488]  No, they don't.
[02:04:34.488 --> 02:04:36.129]  Rosa Cori, we're going to talk to you again soon.
[02:04:36.129 --> 02:04:36.970]  Callers, I'll get to you.
[02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:38.071]  I'll get to talk to Pastor Williams.
[02:04:38.071 --> 02:04:39.291]  We can talk at Agenda 21.
[02:04:39.291 --> 02:04:41.813]  The book, Behind the Green Mask, going to Agenda 21.
[02:04:41.813 --> 02:04:44.835]  Rosa Cori, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:04:44.835 --> 02:04:45.876]  But go to her site.
[02:04:45.876 --> 02:04:47.897]  Print off the flyers in your printer.
[02:04:47.897 --> 02:04:49.458]  And get them out to people.
[02:04:49.458 --> 02:04:51.219]  Give the website out one more time.
[02:04:51.219 --> 02:04:56.762]  DemocratsAgainstUNAgenda21.com Great job.
[02:04:56.762 --> 02:04:57.263]  Great job.

[02:06:05.345 --> 02:06:11.410]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[02:07:01.405 --> 02:07:06.871]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[02:07:06.871 --> 02:07:16.180]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:22.406]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:07:22.626 --> 02:07:26.649]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Bottom line?
[02:07:26.649 --> 02:07:29.592]  It's better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[02:07:37.858 --> 02:07:38.078]  I think so.
[02:08:14.116 --> 02:08:20.148]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:27.509 --> 02:08:32.472]  Thank you for joining us again on this Friday, February 1st, 2013 edition.
[02:08:32.472 --> 02:08:41.278]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and wow, we just had Rosa Kory on with You and Agenda 21, the book, and everything she's saying is totally true.
[02:08:41.278 --> 02:08:55.208]  I mean, we're calling them total eugenics, world government, population reduction, turning the cities into total prisons, where everything's surveilled beyond 1984, forced abortions, you know, suicide nets around the Agenda 21 factories.
[02:08:57.376 --> 02:09:00.437]  All of it's true, and then some.
[02:09:00.437 --> 02:09:02.778]  And we've just had it so good because of liberty.
[02:09:02.778 --> 02:09:06.179]  America, people say, they can point out the problems with America.
[02:09:06.179 --> 02:09:10.020]  But compared to other countries, 5% of the population, half the world's wealth.
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:18.943]  Now as the liberty is taken, now as the Constitution is ignored, now as the Bible is ignored, everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:09:18.943 --> 02:09:21.364]  And you can't deny that, whether you believe in God or not.
[02:09:21.364 --> 02:09:26.326]  When you become decadent, when you don't care about other people, when you don't make a stand,
[02:09:26.866 --> 02:09:34.368]  When you don't take action, you are rudderless, and a ship without a rudder just goes around wherever the wind blows it.
[02:09:34.368 --> 02:09:40.310]  And that's why I have an article up at InfoWars.com, Population Control Propaganda.
[02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:43.211]  This is at Yale, with top UN officials.
[02:09:43.211 --> 02:09:49.953]  We get very little opposition from the public, because via the television programs we have very gradual evolution of the characters.
[02:09:51.305 --> 02:09:53.846]  It's an hour and 50-something minute video.
[02:09:53.846 --> 02:09:54.867]  You can go watch it.
[02:09:54.867 --> 02:09:55.567]  Go do it!
[02:09:55.567 --> 02:09:57.128]  Go watch them laugh about you.
[02:09:57.128 --> 02:10:01.090]  Go watch them talk about how they're conditioning you with the television.
[02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:06.813]  I mean, you go see those messages that are anti-man, anti-family, anti-liberty, that are savage.
[02:10:08.427 --> 02:10:10.288]  That's because they want to screw you up.
[02:10:10.288 --> 02:10:11.668]  They want to have you be alone.
[02:10:11.668 --> 02:10:14.229]  And they say that if you go after other groups, you hate them.
[02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:15.409]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:10:15.409 --> 02:10:19.690]  What's happening is they want to make us all under the state's control.
[02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:21.131]  They want to bankrupt us.
[02:10:21.131 --> 02:10:31.794]  And the Democratic Party officially has adopted, by the 60s, the Cloward and Piven strategy that we've talked about for 15, 16 years, that's become now widely understood, just like Agenda 21.
[02:10:33.772 --> 02:10:42.820]  Where the top sociologist for the Democratic Party said we're going to bankrupt things in the name of the poor, but it's meant to bankrupt things to bring in our socialist society.
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:43.981]  Which isn't even socialist.
[02:10:43.981 --> 02:10:49.125]  When you hear socialism, that means get control of you so you can be under eugenics.
[02:10:49.125 --> 02:10:50.766]  Now I know we got loaded phones.
[02:10:50.766 --> 02:10:55.010]  We're going to get to so many that are patiently holding, like Sean in Australia.
[02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:56.831]  I didn't even notice we had a caller from Australia.
[02:10:56.831 --> 02:10:58.033]  William, Eric, Ed.
[02:10:58.033 --> 02:11:01.756]  We'll probably go into overdrive next hour because our guest is here all the way from Arizona.
[02:11:03.027 --> 02:11:07.211]  I shot a video talking about this last night.
[02:11:07.211 --> 02:11:16.021]  Weldon Henson, a few weeks ago, who does research over what we carry, either I watch and read something and like it or have an idea, or he's going over stuff we're sent and brings it to me.
[02:11:16.021 --> 02:11:20.065]  He said, hey, I really like this, After the Tribulation, Let No Man Be Deceived.
[02:11:20.065 --> 02:11:21.126]  Do you know who these guys are?
[02:11:21.126 --> 02:11:24.790]  And yes, I know who all three of the men are that are featured in it.
[02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:30.373]  And it's a very well done film and it's after the tribulation, let no man be deceived.
[02:11:30.373 --> 02:11:31.994]  Now I want to explain something here.
[02:11:31.994 --> 02:11:33.354]  Let's say you don't believe in God.
[02:11:33.354 --> 02:11:34.995]  You don't believe in the sixth sense.
[02:11:34.995 --> 02:11:42.579]  You don't know why you know when you're walking through an empty place you feel somebody looking at you and there's a guy behind you looking at you.
[02:11:42.699 --> 02:11:47.804]  You don't know why all that happens, why a monarch butterfly can, you know, fly to Canada and back or whatever.
[02:11:47.804 --> 02:11:52.128]  You just, you just think all that is here, the TV is the reality, whatever.
[02:11:52.128 --> 02:11:55.351]  The elites are all very, very spiritual.
[02:11:55.351 --> 02:11:59.255]  And let me tell you, they worship something that looks a lot like the devil of the Bible.
[02:11:59.255 --> 02:12:00.796]  In fact, they say that's who they worship.
[02:12:00.796 --> 02:12:01.958]  They believe Lucifer is God.
[02:12:03.266 --> 02:12:09.128]  And I was brought up a Christian, and I have had spiritual experiences, and we've got that part of our brain connected to our spirit.
[02:12:09.128 --> 02:12:23.572]  But you get a little bit older and you hear all this stuff, but then when I went to Bohemian Grove and saw a thousand plus world leaders in religious rapture that I'd experienced in Baptist and Evangelical churches I went to as a child, but on a dark side.
[02:12:23.572 --> 02:12:31.354]  People really, you know, in a religious experience, an average atheist goes, oh, they're just having fun worshiping the big owl and doing a mock sacrifice to it.
[02:12:32.199 --> 02:12:35.541]  But you see, when you're there, you know it's not just a play.
[02:12:35.541 --> 02:12:38.123]  Plays come from religious events thousands of years ago.
[02:12:38.123 --> 02:12:40.644]  The stage, the people watching.
[02:12:40.644 --> 02:12:42.926]  The whole world's a stage, each of us players upon it.
[02:12:42.926 --> 02:12:44.707]  You find out, man, there's something going on here.
[02:12:44.707 --> 02:12:46.828]  But I know this.
[02:12:46.828 --> 02:12:49.930]  It was Christians that said no to slavery in Rome 2,000 years ago.
[02:12:49.930 --> 02:12:50.851]  It got thrown to the lions.
[02:12:50.851 --> 02:12:52.872]  I'm going to be technical.
[02:12:52.872 --> 02:12:56.074]  About 1,960 years ago is when it was really going on.
[02:12:56.074 --> 02:12:58.596]  It was Christians said no to slavery in Europe and then finally here.
[02:12:59.753 --> 02:13:05.474]  Now there's some Bohemian Grove footage from Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove we're showing TV viewers.
[02:13:05.474 --> 02:13:12.675]  The point is, is that if you're a new listener, yes, I snuck into Bohemian Grove where the big boys of Skull and Bones go when they're old men.
[02:13:12.675 --> 02:13:25.638]  And the point I want to make to everybody out there who's watching, who's viewing us right now, is that even if you don't believe in a spiritual realm, you have to understand the New World Order's greatest tool is convincing you it doesn't exist.
[02:13:26.621 --> 02:13:29.825]  Because they don't want you looking into it because they believe all the power is there.
[02:13:29.825 --> 02:13:30.806]  Whether it's real or not.
[02:13:30.806 --> 02:13:39.297]  They don't want you knowing about it and have written that they have pushed atheism and agnostic stuff so that you don't even ever think about it.
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.721]  You know, it's like the screw tape letters, you know, demon talking to a low-level demon.
[02:13:44.721 --> 02:13:48.402]  Was it written by, you know, a great British writer?
[02:13:48.402 --> 02:13:49.482]  Pop my head in a minute.
[02:13:49.482 --> 02:13:49.842]  C.S.
[02:13:49.842 --> 02:13:51.083]  Lewis.
[02:13:51.083 --> 02:13:53.663]  They don't even want you, you know, getting into the big evils.
[02:13:53.663 --> 02:13:58.404]  They just don't want you ever thinking outside the box and feeling that connection.
[02:13:58.404 --> 02:14:00.565]  Or they want to misdirect it if you do discover that.
[02:14:01.772 --> 02:14:07.958]  But regardless, it has been the rapture doctrine that's, what, 150 years old, max or so?
[02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:10.521]  We've got a theologian here who can break it down.
[02:14:10.521 --> 02:14:13.804]  No Christians ever believed.
[02:14:13.804 --> 02:14:18.008]  I guess there were a few small groups later in Rome who did for a certain period that
[02:14:19.178 --> 02:14:24.545]  That it was the end of the world, or, oh, don't worry about evil, it's the end of the world.
[02:14:24.545 --> 02:14:31.894]  Our founders are now criticized by TV preachers who are getting government funding and clergy response team FEMA money to say, oh, the Christians.
[02:14:31.894 --> 02:14:33.636]  I've got the clips, you can just go to YouTube.
[02:14:33.636 --> 02:14:37.400]  Preachers, TV preacher says that we shouldn't have...
[02:14:38.442 --> 02:14:42.966]  You know, Christians should have obeyed and worshipped the gods and should have been thrown into the lions.
[02:14:42.966 --> 02:14:43.687]  Twisting Romans 13.
[02:14:43.687 --> 02:14:46.129]  They teach our founders were bad.
[02:14:46.129 --> 02:14:47.951]  They should have followed King George.
[02:14:47.951 --> 02:14:51.254]  That's all diametrically opposed to everything in the Bible.
[02:14:51.254 --> 02:14:53.977]  So understand, if you want to know why we got in this position...
[02:14:54.437 --> 02:14:57.940]  Where the government now runs the churches, it violates the First Amendment and common sense.
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:59.361]  This country was founded on.
[02:14:59.361 --> 02:15:06.187]  It's because the leadership got bought off by the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the same Rockefeller groups.
[02:15:06.187 --> 02:15:07.308]  Go look it up.
[02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:12.632]  And so from an anthropologist or sociologist view, you need to see after the Tribulation.
[02:15:12.632 --> 02:15:17.115]  Because the Bible clearly states the Tribulation comes after
[02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:24.895]  The devil wages war on the saints and overcomes them and chops off their heads by the millions and all of this.
[02:15:24.895 --> 02:15:34.543]  And I understand why Christians go, oh no, no, no, I'm going to get jet-packed out of here, a golden rope's going to come down, you know, Scotty's up there on the Enterprise, he's going to teleport me out of here.
[02:15:34.543 --> 02:15:42.048]  Well, let me tell you something, the Bible, from front to back, nobody gets teleported out except for one guy who's been so good, you know, God picked him up.
[02:15:42.048 --> 02:15:43.650]  But the point is, and he didn't,
[02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:49.111]  And he wasn't getting teleported out to escape something, he'd already gone through the fire.
[02:15:49.111 --> 02:15:53.632]  Okay, so I want to explain some, of course, and Christ, of course, did as well, but that wasn't really a man.
[02:15:53.632 --> 02:15:55.192]  You can go back and forth.
[02:15:55.192 --> 02:15:58.553]  The point is, is God in man's body.
[02:15:58.553 --> 02:16:04.014]  The point is, this is, this is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
[02:16:04.014 --> 02:16:08.515]  And they hate Christians and they hate gun owners because they know we understand what's going on.
[02:16:08.515 --> 02:16:11.096]  That's the litmus test, that we know they're authoritarians.
[02:16:11.616 --> 02:16:15.238]  Now he's with us for this hour and a little bit into the next hour.
[02:16:15.238 --> 02:16:20.800]  After the Tribulation, a film that they even did an InfoWars style trailer without us even saying it.
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:23.382]  So I went ahead and tagged on my own promo onto it.
[02:16:23.382 --> 02:16:25.302]  It's up at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:16:25.302 --> 02:16:27.744]  But After the Tribulation, Let No Man Deceive You.
[02:16:27.744 --> 02:16:33.927]  Everyone needs to buy this at InfoWarsStore.com and go give it to their pastor, their preachers and others.
[02:16:33.927 --> 02:16:36.508]  And again, Pastor Steve Anderson is famously
[02:16:37.268 --> 02:16:38.869]  A hundred-mile-in checkpoints.
[02:16:38.869 --> 02:16:40.251]  He's been beat up for asking questions.
[02:16:40.251 --> 02:16:41.512]  We'll play some of that later.
[02:16:41.512 --> 02:16:46.115]  He's the guy that said, you know, he prays for Obama, you know, to be brought down, which is biblical.
[02:16:46.115 --> 02:16:47.376]  Got demonized for that.
[02:16:47.376 --> 02:16:50.939]  But Pastor Steven Anderson was born and raised in Sacramento, California.
[02:16:50.939 --> 02:16:52.881]  He's married with seven beautiful children.
[02:16:52.881 --> 02:16:59.306]  At age 18, he traveled throughout Germany and Eastern Europe with Baptist churches, studying foreign languages and getting experience in the ministry.
[02:16:59.306 --> 02:17:04.430]  Pastor Anderson started a totally independent Baptist church, Faithful World Baptist Church, on December 25, 2005.
[02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:12.477]  So, I guess, seven, eight years old now, and faithfulworldbaptist.org is the website.
[02:17:12.477 --> 02:17:14.039]  Okay, we're going to break in a few minutes.
[02:17:14.039 --> 02:17:25.750]  Great to have you here, but let's get right in to this film and the scriptures and where this doctrine came that it's a pre-tribulation rapture, so nobody's got to worry about anything.
[02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:31.495]  All the other Christians had to go through the fire, but, you know, this generation, as it's all coming down, we're going to be left alone.
[02:17:32.321 --> 02:17:33.602]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:17:33.602 --> 02:17:35.143]  Good to be here.
[02:17:35.143 --> 02:17:49.715]  I think this film is most important because, you know, if you want to know why Christians are asleep right now, if you want to know why the vast majority of Christians don't want to hear about the New World Order, they don't care when you warn them about global government or police state, it's because of this doctrine.
[02:17:49.715 --> 02:17:56.481]  This pre-trib rapture doctrine makes everybody believe that it doesn't really matter what's going on because we're all going to be out of here.
[02:17:56.801 --> 02:18:08.205]  And there was a pastor in Arizona that I know who recently said to me, as soon as he found out that I didn't believe in this pre-tribulation rapture, he said, well, now I understand why you're so paranoid about government.
[02:18:08.205 --> 02:18:15.227]  Because he'd seen all the stuff with... Yeah, that's sick that they don't care about, even if they were going to be teleported out, don't they care about all the people now?
[02:18:15.227 --> 02:18:15.707]  No, they don't.
[02:18:15.707 --> 02:18:17.028]  They sit around at country clubs.
[02:18:17.708 --> 02:18:26.050]  Yeah, so he said, and now I see why you're so paranoid about government, but I'd like to turn that around on him and say, now I see why you don't give a rip about anything that's going on.
[02:18:26.050 --> 02:18:37.713]  Now I see why you trust the government so much, because you believe this fairy tale that we're going to be taken out of here before... Homeland Security is now saying the number one enemy of the groups is the Christians.
[02:18:37.713 --> 02:18:43.895]  Remember Janet Reno said, a believer that believes in the second coming of Christ, that is a mentally ill cult member.
[02:18:44.568 --> 02:18:46.530]  Yeah, and this is all prophesied in the Bible.
[02:18:46.530 --> 02:18:52.915]  The Bible's real clear that eventually Christians are going to be... The smart meters, the chips, the face scanning, the hands, all of it!
[02:18:52.915 --> 02:18:56.559]  World government, the exact empires, the name of it, everything!
[02:18:56.559 --> 02:19:03.685]  It's all in the Bible, and the amazing thing is that, you know, people a hundred years ago might have read the Bible and wondered, you know, how could this be implemented?
[02:19:03.925 --> 02:19:06.766]  How do you stop people from buying or selling?
[02:19:06.766 --> 02:19:10.748]  You know, how do you take this kind of global power over every single nation in the world?
[02:19:10.748 --> 02:19:12.248]  But now we can see it happening.
[02:19:12.248 --> 02:19:13.889]  The UN says ten kingdoms.
[02:19:13.889 --> 02:19:15.750]  They call it ten kingdoms.
[02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:16.510]  Right.
[02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:17.250]  It's all there.
[02:19:17.250 --> 02:19:18.891]  It's all... I mean, they're following it.
[02:19:18.891 --> 02:19:21.712]  The only other argument is, well, they're using it as a template of control.
[02:19:21.712 --> 02:19:24.713]  Like it's a science fiction book and they go, ooh, this is a good plan.
[02:19:24.713 --> 02:19:26.994]  Oh, and they worship the devil on top of it?
[02:19:26.994 --> 02:19:28.095]  But that's a joke too, I guess.
[02:19:28.868 --> 02:19:29.868]  Yeah, there's no way.
[02:19:29.868 --> 02:19:34.970]  I mean, obviously, the Bible has been talking about this stuff since hundreds and hundreds of years ago.
[02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:35.971]  It's crystal clear.
[02:19:35.971 --> 02:19:47.054]  It's like reading a newspaper when you read the Bible about the One World Government, global warfare, the engineered famines that... Bio-weapons, weather control... All of it.
[02:19:47.054 --> 02:19:53.297]  Metal insects that drop things that turn into mountains of fire, columns, hydrogen bombs.
[02:19:53.297 --> 02:19:53.877]  I mean, it's all there.
[02:19:54.798 --> 02:20:10.556]  I mean, the people having these visions were like, I saw metal, giant insects, mountains of flame, I mean... If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[02:20:10.556 --> 02:20:10.997]  Here's why.
[02:20:11.337 --> 02:20:14.618]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:20:14.618 --> 02:20:21.320]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.761]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:20:24.761 --> 02:20:26.262]  Now here's the best part.
[02:20:26.262 --> 02:20:31.063]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:20:31.063 --> 02:20:35.565]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily.
[02:20:35.805 --> 02:20:36.885]  at the end of each year.
[02:20:36.885 --> 02:20:40.907]  We call them Scratch and Dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:20:40.907 --> 02:20:46.048]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:20:46.048 --> 02:20:47.689]  Don't wait, they go fast.

[02:21:22.638 --> 02:21:23.939]  But it's not Africa.

[02:22:32.069 --> 02:22:36.611]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.611 --> 02:22:42.374]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.374 --> 02:22:45.996]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.996 --> 02:22:48.797]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:48.797 --> 02:22:53.700]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:23:01.598 --> 02:23:02.599]  Hi there.
[02:23:02.599 --> 02:23:04.140]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:07.982]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:23:07.982 --> 02:23:17.128]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:23:17.128 --> 02:23:23.833]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:23:23.833 --> 02:23:26.034]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:23:26.034 --> 02:23:31.118]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:23:31.878 --> 02:23:39.822]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them, too.
[02:23:39.822 --> 02:23:45.405]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.

[02:23:57.692 --> 02:23:58.832]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:24:17.535 --> 02:24:21.277]  Pastor Steve Anderson is one of the people in this great new film.
[02:24:21.277 --> 02:24:22.537]  After the Tribulation is our guest.
[02:24:22.537 --> 02:24:23.798]  Okay, I'm ranting and raving.
[02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:29.679]  Let's continue with the points you were making during the break, and let's get into what the Bible really says.
[02:24:29.679 --> 02:24:47.257]  And again, even if you're not a Christian, this is what governs over two billion people on the planet who say they're one form of Christian or another, and they're all being told, you're all going to be raptured, Hollywood loves to promote it, it's what all the TV heads say, and it turns out they're all basically clergy response teams, federal agents.
[02:24:47.998 --> 02:24:48.919]  Go over it.
[02:24:48.919 --> 02:24:55.345]  Yeah, let me just start out by saying that this doctrine of the pre-tribulation rapture is not found in the Bible at all.
[02:24:55.345 --> 02:24:59.409]  It's not derived from any scripture, and it's like the emperor's new clothes.
[02:24:59.409 --> 02:25:07.898]  Everybody goes around saying, of course we believe in it, all the pastors preach it, but nobody ever stops to ask themselves, wait a minute, is this even taught in the Bible?
[02:25:07.898 --> 02:25:10.560]  And it all is relying upon one key point.
[02:25:11.181 --> 02:25:14.365]  That they teach that Jesus can come back at any moment.
[02:25:14.365 --> 02:25:19.210]  And, you know, you'll hear a lot of TV preachers saying, you know, He may even come back before I'm done with this sermon.
[02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:21.793]  Come like a thief in the night, no man know the time.
[02:25:21.793 --> 02:25:22.374]  Right.
[02:25:22.374 --> 02:25:25.017]  You know, send your money now, you know, you don't need it.
[02:25:25.017 --> 02:25:25.778]  We could be gone tomorrow.
[02:25:26.218 --> 02:25:31.722]  So this doctrine that says that Jesus is coming at any moment is not found in scripture at all.
[02:25:31.722 --> 02:25:41.048]  And what they're twisting is where Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24, of that day and hour, he said, but of that day and hour knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven.
[02:25:41.048 --> 02:25:45.691]  But what they forgot to tell you is that a couple of verses before that, he said it was after the tribulation.
[02:25:45.691 --> 02:25:49.694]  So he said after the tribulation, he's coming in the clouds, the trumpet's going to sound.
[02:25:49.694 --> 02:25:53.156]  Then a couple of verses later, he said, no stone will be left unturned in this war.
[02:25:53.376 --> 02:25:59.463]  And a couple of verses later he says, "...but of that day and hour knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
[02:25:59.463 --> 02:26:02.266]  So they quote that one verse hoping that you're too ignorant.
[02:26:02.266 --> 02:26:04.749]  Yeah, quote the other voice, the earlier part.
[02:26:04.749 --> 02:26:06.151]  Okay, it says in verse 29 of Matthew 24,
[02:26:08.353 --> 02:26:18.081]  After the tribulation of those days, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
[02:26:18.081 --> 02:26:19.122]  You're going to notice that.
[02:26:19.122 --> 02:26:22.585]  This isn't some secret, left behind, everybody disappears thing.
[02:26:22.585 --> 02:26:25.087]  It's talking about the sun and moon being... Stuff's going to be blowing up!
[02:26:25.087 --> 02:26:28.570]  And it says, then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven.
[02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:31.651]  Son of Man is what Jesus called himself on this earth.
[02:26:31.651 --> 02:26:37.655]  And then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[02:26:37.655 --> 02:26:44.158]  And he shall send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other.
[02:26:44.158 --> 02:26:48.821]  The elect in the New Testament is always referring to those that are believers, those that are saved, those who believe in Christ.
[02:26:49.341 --> 02:26:59.848]  So, they totally skip over that part, and they jump down to verse 36, where it says, And again, I've read the Bible.
[02:26:59.848 --> 02:27:03.150]  The whole thing foreshadows in the Old Testament what's going to happen.
[02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:16.059]  It says in the New Testament, it says in Revelation, over and over again, it describes how the devil goes after God's people, and they have to stand against it, because it's not about what happens to their body, it's about their soul, and having the courage.
[02:27:16.059 --> 02:27:17.740]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:18.601]  It is the Emperor's...
[02:27:20.001 --> 02:27:21.962]  He's totally naked here.
[02:27:21.962 --> 02:27:24.163]  Exactly, and there's no basis for it.
[02:27:24.163 --> 02:27:32.327]  But anyway, the scripture that I just read for you, where it said, after the tribulation, Christ comes in the clouds, he gathers the elect, the trumpet sounds.
[02:27:32.327 --> 02:27:38.050]  When you try to show this to one of these pre-trib preachers, they'll tell you, well that's not even about the rapture.
[02:27:38.590 --> 02:27:43.332]  But then these same people will turn around and quote you that no man knoweth the day or the hour all day long.
[02:27:43.332 --> 02:27:45.192]  No, I've had them do it to me in person.
[02:27:45.192 --> 02:27:46.873]  Even though it's just a couple verses later.
[02:27:46.873 --> 02:27:49.474]  So it's like they just take that one verse out of context.
[02:27:49.474 --> 02:27:51.755]  Now you brought up the part about the thief in the night.
[02:27:51.755 --> 02:27:54.276]  Where they say, you know, Jesus is coming as a thief in the night.
[02:27:54.276 --> 02:27:55.656]  He can come at any moment.
[02:27:55.656 --> 02:27:56.497]  But here's what's funny.
[02:27:56.497 --> 02:28:01.959]  If you actually go to that passage where it says that he's coming as a thief in the night in 1 Thessalonians 5.
[02:28:02.899 --> 02:28:10.541]  If you go down two verses, it says, but ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
[02:28:10.541 --> 02:28:12.981]  Ye are all the children of the light and the children of the day.
[02:28:12.981 --> 02:28:14.742]  We are not of the night nor of darkness.
[02:28:14.742 --> 02:28:18.803]  Therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober.
[02:28:18.803 --> 02:28:21.603]  It's saying the dumbed-down masses won't know what hit them.
[02:28:21.603 --> 02:28:22.543]  Exactly.
[02:28:22.543 --> 02:28:26.984]  He says that it's coming upon those that do not believe, those who don't know.
[02:28:26.984 --> 02:28:28.125]  We all know it's coming.
[02:28:28.125 --> 02:28:29.325]  We all see the freight train.
[02:28:29.585 --> 02:28:33.306]  Why would it come upon us as a thief in the night when he's telling us exactly what's gonna happen?
[02:28:33.306 --> 02:28:36.228]  He says you're not in darkness that that day should overtake you.
[02:28:36.228 --> 02:28:37.128]  Totally clear!
[02:28:37.128 --> 02:28:37.788]  Totally clear!
[02:28:37.788 --> 02:28:38.108]  Exactly.
[02:28:38.108 --> 02:28:40.969]  That's why you gotta stop listening to preachers and read the Bible.
[02:28:40.969 --> 02:28:44.651]  It's gonna overtake them as a thief because the Bible says they're asleep.
[02:28:45.151 --> 02:28:46.792]  We're not asleep as others.
[02:28:46.792 --> 02:28:51.796]  He said, wake up, watch, be sober, read the Bible, know this is coming.
[02:28:51.796 --> 02:28:57.880]  He says, when you begin to see these things come to pass, then lift up your heads, look up, your redemption draweth nigh.
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.162]  But there's nothing in the Bible that teaches that Jesus can come at any moment.
[02:29:01.162 --> 02:29:03.964]  He said, look, X, Y, and Z has to come first.
[02:29:03.964 --> 02:29:10.588]  And what's funny is the two main passages that I encourage people to read are Matthew 24 and 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[02:29:10.588 --> 02:29:14.591]  And in both of these passages, he uses the term, let no man deceive you.
[02:29:15.151 --> 02:29:23.039]  And then he goes on to explain how his coming is not at any moment, and that first the tribulation comes, first the sun and moon are darkened.
[02:29:23.039 --> 02:29:25.001]  So that tells me Christ is the deceiver!
[02:29:25.001 --> 02:29:28.604]  Christ is even saying, now I'm going to tell you when this is going to happen, but people are going to try to deceive you on this.
[02:29:28.604 --> 02:29:28.984]  Exactly.
[02:29:28.984 --> 02:29:33.409]  Listen carefully, and a five-year-old could tell what he's saying, and these preachers twisted it.
[02:29:33.409 --> 02:29:34.069]  I figured it out when I was 12.
[02:29:35.455 --> 02:29:41.936]  Well, we're going to come right back and talk about, as you go back to this, this got pushed by the globalists about 150 years ago.
[02:29:41.936 --> 02:29:42.457]  Exactly.
[02:29:42.457 --> 02:29:44.877]  Because they were sick of Christians always fighting evil.
[02:29:44.877 --> 02:29:49.278]  They said, don't worry about it, go have some fun.
[02:29:49.278 --> 02:29:51.118]  Scotty's up there, he's going to beam you.
[02:29:51.118 --> 02:29:55.019]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:33:06.673 --> 02:33:10.975]  You could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
[02:33:10.975 --> 02:33:12.455]  What do you mean, biblical?
[02:33:12.455 --> 02:33:14.856]  What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
[02:33:14.856 --> 02:33:16.997]  Real wrath of God type stuff.
[02:33:16.997 --> 02:33:19.158]  Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
[02:33:19.158 --> 02:33:20.499]  Rivers and seas boiling.
[02:33:20.499 --> 02:33:21.439]  Forty years of darkness.
[02:33:21.439 --> 02:33:22.640]  Earthquakes, volcanoes.
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:24.200]  The dead rising from the grave.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:25.401]  Human sacrifice.
[02:33:25.401 --> 02:33:27.302]  Dogs and cats living together.
[02:33:27.302 --> 02:33:28.142]  Mass hysteria!
[02:33:30.137 --> 02:33:39.667]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:39.667 --> 02:33:41.709]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:41.709 --> 02:33:47.976]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:49.344 --> 02:33:51.626]  Sean in Australia, we're going to get to you.
[02:33:51.626 --> 02:33:55.109]  John, who disagrees, will be a pre-trib rapture.
[02:33:55.109 --> 02:33:56.050]  We're going to get to him.
[02:33:56.050 --> 02:33:57.351]  We're going to get to everybody.
[02:33:57.351 --> 02:34:01.794]  I know people were holding over from the last interview, but it all ties together, this total control grid.
[02:34:01.794 --> 02:34:06.478]  And we're not judging people out there who are Christians and think there's going to be a pre-trib rapture.
[02:34:07.959 --> 02:34:13.363]  You guys are getting freaked out by it because it's now doctrinal that you're going to hell if you don't believe in this.
[02:34:13.363 --> 02:34:23.889]  It's not about Jesus and the blood of Jesus, it's about the rapture happening before, and this is universal now across the board, especially in the Protestant circles.
[02:34:23.889 --> 02:34:24.530]  This is it.
[02:34:26.491 --> 02:34:28.011]  It's not saved by grace alone.
[02:34:28.011 --> 02:34:35.193]  There's a pre-trib rapture because you've got to think this so you stand down and go along with it.
[02:34:35.193 --> 02:34:38.314]  And boy, are people in for a rude awakening.
[02:34:38.314 --> 02:34:42.775]  I want to talk about the history of this, where it came from, what happened to you as a Baptist preacher.
[02:34:42.775 --> 02:34:45.296]  You said you knew this when you were 12, reading the Bible.
[02:34:45.296 --> 02:34:47.256]  Go through that and then we'll go to some calls.
[02:34:47.256 --> 02:34:51.057]  It's all covered in the film after the Tribulation, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:51.557 --> 02:34:53.759]  Shop.com or InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:34:53.759 --> 02:34:55.381]  Both URLs will get you there.
[02:34:55.381 --> 02:34:55.901]  And you know what?
[02:34:55.901 --> 02:35:03.168]  It's important to talk about this and to look at it because these, you know, Christ, I mean, I know he's not the preacher, so he doesn't really count.
[02:35:03.168 --> 02:35:06.251]  He's kind of the back of the bus, you know, saying that.
[02:35:06.251 --> 02:35:09.514]  And I know it says the beast will wage war against the states and overcome them and all that.
[02:35:10.214 --> 02:35:14.639]  And then it clearly says, you know, at the end of the tribulation when Christ comes back, the dead are raised and all that.
[02:35:14.639 --> 02:35:16.081]  But that's the Bible!
[02:35:16.081 --> 02:35:23.829]  The Bible takes the back seat to the preachers, who are the clergy response team on FEMA payroll, violating the First Amendment with the federal government controlling them.
[02:35:23.829 --> 02:35:25.871]  But I guess they are my Pharisee kings.
[02:35:25.871 --> 02:35:26.612]  Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:26.832 --> 02:35:28.413]  Okay, so here's the history on this.
[02:35:28.413 --> 02:35:38.618]  Before the year 1830, every denomination, every type of Christianity taught that the Rapture took place after the Tribulation, because that's what the Bible explicitly says.
[02:35:38.618 --> 02:35:40.659]  Why would anyone teach anything different?
[02:35:40.659 --> 02:35:46.822]  But in the late 1830s, a man by the name of John Nelson Darby started teaching a doctrine of what he called the Secret Rapture.
[02:35:47.242 --> 02:35:51.828]  Which is this idea that people are going to disappear, nobody knows where they went, nobody knows what's going on.
[02:35:51.828 --> 02:35:52.449]  It's asinine.
[02:35:52.449 --> 02:35:55.212]  It happens before the Tribulation.
[02:35:55.212 --> 02:35:57.755]  Okay, he promoted and taught that doctrine throughout the 1800s.
[02:35:57.755 --> 02:36:05.105]  He put out his own version of the Bible, the Darby Translation, where he tampered with key passages about the Second Coming of Christ.
[02:36:05.105 --> 02:36:06.026]  He's famous for that!
[02:36:06.306 --> 02:36:07.046]  Oh yeah!
[02:36:07.046 --> 02:36:10.889]  And then later on it was picked up by a guy named Schofield.
[02:36:10.889 --> 02:36:21.515]  And this guy Schofield put out a Schofield reference Bible and that is what is responsible for getting it to all the Baptists, all the seminaries started really pushing the Schofield reference Bible.
[02:36:21.515 --> 02:36:25.157]  I just got a call this week of people trying to sell me Schofield Bibles.
[02:36:25.157 --> 02:36:30.180]  And so the Schofield Bible is all about getting the Pre-Trib Rapture Doctrine out to people.
[02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:41.235]  Now, because this doctrine is not found in the Bible at all, there's no clear scripture that anybody can point to that shows you, here's where it says, before the tribulation, Jesus comes in the clouds.
[02:36:41.235 --> 02:36:46.342]  They have to rely on a lot of fear and intimidation to make sure that all the preachers walk in line.
[02:36:46.863 --> 02:36:54.326]  Now, just in my own personal life, I started pastoring seven years ago, and I was sent out to start an independent Baptist church in Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:36:54.326 --> 02:37:03.009]  The church that sent me out, as soon as they found out that I did not believe in the pre-tribulation rapture, because I preached a sermon, you know, where I explained why it was false.
[02:37:03.729 --> 02:37:09.352]  They immediately cut all ties with me, cut all contact with me, disowned me effectively.
[02:37:09.352 --> 02:37:15.574]  And honestly, any pastor who preaches against the pre-tribulation rapture is going to pay a big price.
[02:37:15.574 --> 02:37:22.518]  They're going to lose their preacher friends, they're going to lose any kind of funding, because if you are not pre-trib, you are not in the club.
[02:37:22.518 --> 02:37:31.422]  And they have to rely on that blackballing of anybody who will question it in order to make sure that every Baptist and every Evangelical is in lockstep
[02:37:32.382 --> 02:37:33.763]  Teaching the pre-trib rapture.
[02:37:33.763 --> 02:37:34.724]  Let me tell you something.
[02:37:34.724 --> 02:37:45.271]  Every single Baptist Bible college or Baptist seminary or evangelical Bible college that I know of teaches the pre-tribulation rapture and they demand that their graduates believe.
[02:37:45.271 --> 02:37:48.873]  And they even have Hollywood movies where the aliens come and take the good people away.
[02:37:48.873 --> 02:37:50.514]  Even, I mean, the Hollywood's pushing this.
[02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:54.898]  And every single church I've ever been in had people who believed right on this.
[02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:59.021]  Because, you know, there are people who, believe it or not, there are some people who actually read the Bible and believe it.
[02:37:59.021 --> 02:38:00.322]  You were saying when you were 12.
[02:38:00.322 --> 02:38:03.125]  When I was 12, I believed it right on this since I was 12.
[02:38:03.125 --> 02:38:06.467]  I grew up being taught the Pre-Trib Rapture in every church I've ever been to.
[02:38:06.467 --> 02:38:12.012]  But when I was 12, I decided to read the Bible, or I'm sorry, the New Testament, I wanted to read cover to cover for the first time.
[02:38:12.012 --> 02:38:16.116]  I started in Matthew, and by the time I got to chapter 24 and read what Jesus said,
[02:38:16.696 --> 02:38:20.538]  It was clear to me, and I've never believed in the Preacher of Rapture since reading Matthew.
[02:38:20.538 --> 02:38:22.860]  Well, what does your gut and spirit tell you?
[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:25.441]  I mean, God's going to put us through the fire.
[02:38:25.441 --> 02:38:31.345]  Now, if we go halfway, God sometimes protects His people, but you just don't get out of the whole deal.
[02:38:31.345 --> 02:38:33.166]  I mean, none of the prophets did.
[02:38:33.166 --> 02:38:39.090]  The Bible says, "...and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
[02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:44.412]  And the Bible says, you know, these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace.
[02:38:44.412 --> 02:38:47.873]  In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.
[02:38:47.873 --> 02:38:49.474]  I've overcome the world.
[02:38:49.474 --> 02:38:51.394]  You know, the Bible warns us over and over again.
[02:38:51.394 --> 02:38:58.477]  I would just encourage anybody who's listening and skeptical about what I'm saying, look up in a concordance every time the Bible uses the word tribulation.
[02:38:59.417 --> 02:39:10.881]  90% of the time the word tribulations used in the New Testament, it's referring to believers going through trials and tribulations and suffering and persecution because of them taking a stand for the Word of God.
[02:39:10.881 --> 02:39:14.722]  Because if you take a stand and preach the Word of God, you're going to be persecuted.
[02:39:14.722 --> 02:39:15.723]  The whole book of Acts!
[02:39:16.343 --> 02:39:18.306]  It's people being thrown in jail!
[02:39:18.306 --> 02:39:19.327]  It's people being arrested!
[02:39:19.327 --> 02:39:25.995]  Have you seen the big TV preachers, I've played the clips now, saying the Christians were wrong to not do what Rome said and worship those idols.
[02:39:25.995 --> 02:39:27.998]  Romans 13, do what they say!
[02:39:27.998 --> 02:39:31.222]  I haven't seen it, but I know from reading the book of Acts,
[02:39:31.542 --> 02:39:34.583]  You know, the Jews were constantly persecuting the Christians.
[02:39:34.583 --> 02:39:36.264]  They were taking them out of the synagogues.
[02:39:36.264 --> 02:39:36.984]  They were beating them.
[02:39:36.984 --> 02:39:38.265]  They were putting them to death.
[02:39:38.265 --> 02:39:42.426]  And all throughout the Book of Acts, every Bible-believing preacher is getting arrested.
[02:39:42.426 --> 02:39:43.327]  He's getting beaten.
[02:39:43.327 --> 02:39:44.347]  He's getting persecuted.
[02:39:44.347 --> 02:39:45.528]  He's getting imprisoned.
[02:39:45.528 --> 02:39:51.410]  And yet, we're taught that before the Antichrist comes, before the One World Government's in place,
[02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:57.051]  Before they start, you know, this law that says that if you won't worship the Antichrist, you're going to be killed.
[02:39:57.051 --> 02:40:02.172]  You know, we're all going to be out of here because they say, God would never allow his people to go through something like that.
[02:40:02.172 --> 02:40:05.132]  God loves us too much to allow us to suffer.
[02:40:05.132 --> 02:40:08.793]  He would never, you know, allow us to go through tribulation.
[02:40:08.793 --> 02:40:11.794]  But yet every other generation of believers have gone through tribulation.
[02:40:11.794 --> 02:40:12.394]  Well, look at Paul.
[02:40:12.394 --> 02:40:16.154]  His job was to hunt down for the Sanhedrin, hunt down Christians.
[02:40:16.154 --> 02:40:17.695]  And let me make it real clear.
[02:40:17.695 --> 02:40:18.955]  I do believe in the rapture.
[02:40:19.255 --> 02:40:22.377]  I'm not saying that the rapture is a false... Oh I know, they'll spin that too!
[02:40:22.377 --> 02:40:23.617]  Oh yeah, this is what they'll do.
[02:40:23.617 --> 02:40:25.398]  You're saying there's no rapture!
[02:40:25.398 --> 02:40:30.141]  Or they'll say, oh well here's people before 1830 teaching that the rapture existed.
[02:40:30.141 --> 02:40:31.762]  No, that's not what we're saying.
[02:40:31.762 --> 02:40:38.506]  Before 1830, there was not a person on this planet who believed that the rapture came after or before the tribulation.
[02:40:39.406 --> 02:40:43.130]  The Bible says that the rapture happens after the tribulation.
[02:40:43.130 --> 02:40:44.652]  That's when Christ comes in the clouds.
[02:40:44.652 --> 02:40:47.795]  I want to go to some... The point is, the film covers all this.
[02:40:47.795 --> 02:40:50.238]  And again, even if you're not a Christian, you need to see it.
[02:40:50.238 --> 02:40:51.439]  It's very well done.
[02:40:51.439 --> 02:40:54.703]  Because it explains why Christians will go along with anything now.
[02:40:57.247 --> 02:41:01.748]  Well, you know what, and the film is important for Christian and non-Christian alike.
[02:41:01.748 --> 02:41:09.089]  First of all, if somebody's not a Christian, you know, they need to watch the film and become a Christian, because honestly, and you know, that's explained at the end of the film.
[02:41:09.089 --> 02:41:22.672]  But honestly, I don't understand how you can look around and see all these things happening in the world today, and then look at the Bible and see that it's exactly what the Bible said would happen, and then say... Well, see, what I do, what I do is I just point out what the New World Order is doing, and I just say, hey, you want to see it?
[02:41:22.672 --> 02:41:23.892]  And people will actually watch it.
[02:41:23.892 --> 02:41:24.193]  Right.
[02:41:24.193 --> 02:41:26.253]  My experience is, you're going to see this or go to hell!
[02:41:26.653 --> 02:41:27.794]  And they don't watch it, you know.
[02:41:27.794 --> 02:41:29.174]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:41:29.174 --> 02:41:40.599]  Even if you're not a Christian, I'm sure you have some Christian friend who just refuses to wake up and refuses to understand what's going on with the global government, the New World Order, the food supply, the water.
[02:41:40.599 --> 02:41:46.581]  You know, this film is the ultimate film for waking Christians up because it's packed with Bible... Well, look at Revelation.
[02:41:46.581 --> 02:41:47.982]  It talks about the different passages.
[02:41:49.142 --> 02:42:00.228]  How the kings of the earth and the sorcerers manipulate the pharmakia, the drugs, to drug the public and make us drunk.
[02:42:00.228 --> 02:42:03.149]  On the blood of the innocents, Pepsi puts the dead baby parts in.
[02:42:03.149 --> 02:42:09.012]  It's like the golden child, they're trying to get him to eat the bad things, spiritually get at him.
[02:42:09.992 --> 02:42:14.979]  But the point is they're sitting there point-blank saying that they traffic in our souls.
[02:42:14.979 --> 02:42:16.220]  That's what they want.
[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:17.622]  The globalists want our minds.
[02:42:17.622 --> 02:42:19.344]  They're not after treasure and power.
[02:42:19.344 --> 02:42:20.466]  Their minions are.
[02:42:20.466 --> 02:42:23.590]  The high-level Luciferians aren't even into materialism.
[02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:25.212]  They want our souls.
[02:42:26.053 --> 02:42:26.934]  Exactly right.
[02:42:26.934 --> 02:42:34.000]  And this film, we spend about half the film just demolishing the pre-tribulation rapture lie.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:38.564]  And, you know, that's like taking candy from a baby because, I mean, it's so clear in scripture.
[02:42:38.564 --> 02:42:50.574]  And then we spend the other half of the film just explaining how this is all going to play out and showing examples from now, you know, about the implantable chips, about the cashless society, about... The smart grid's already going in.
[02:42:50.574 --> 02:42:51.535]  I mean, it's total control.
[02:42:51.855 --> 02:42:54.977]  They're having police checkpoints with scanners.
[02:42:54.977 --> 02:42:59.381]  I've got articles targeting, they know veterans, off their license plates, scanned.
[02:42:59.381 --> 02:43:00.381]  No criminal record.
[02:43:00.381 --> 02:43:02.843]  The police are, this is a courtesy safety check.
[02:43:02.843 --> 02:43:04.184]  Let me search your car without a warrant.
[02:43:04.184 --> 02:43:09.328]  And then they're getting, in New York State, five felony counts facing 20 years in jail.
[02:43:09.328 --> 02:43:11.470]  And they're saying, I'm a decorated veteran.
[02:43:11.470 --> 02:43:13.271]  I didn't even know that the law said this was illegal.
[02:43:13.271 --> 02:43:16.553]  They're like, throwing the book at them, saying, we're going to get you.
[02:43:16.553 --> 02:43:18.175]  I mean, they're going after good people now.
[02:43:18.775 --> 02:43:23.943]  Oh yeah, and all throughout the Bible, you know, going back to the very beginning, you know, Cain killed Abel.
[02:43:23.943 --> 02:43:26.646]  You know, all throughout the Bible, it's the bad guys killing the good guys.
[02:43:26.646 --> 02:43:29.250]  And evil wants high office to abuse.
[02:43:29.250 --> 02:43:29.511]  Exactly.
[02:43:29.511 --> 02:43:32.855]  And again, the whole Bible's about don't trust the government, stand up against it.
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:35.821]  Romans 13 is totally taken out of context.
[02:43:35.821 --> 02:43:42.705]  That's why we sell the book Romans 13, the true meaning of submission, by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer's son.
[02:43:42.705 --> 02:43:43.985]  Breaks that all down.
[02:43:43.985 --> 02:43:50.109]  Every church I go to, doesn't matter, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Baptist, my wife wants to go to church.
[02:43:50.689 --> 02:44:05.092]  You know, for Christian friends, I go in, and at the end of the sermon they go, we need to do what the government says, and they're of the Lord, and there's going to be some times coming when the government needs to do some things, but it's of God, and I know their clergy response team, and I go up and say, were you told to do that by higher-ups for FEMA?
[02:44:05.092 --> 02:44:07.273]  I'm not going to talk about that now!
[02:44:07.273 --> 02:44:08.573]  Sonny boy there!
[02:44:08.573 --> 02:44:10.613]  It's a federal agent there now.
[02:44:10.613 --> 02:44:13.294]  So devilish, so unconstitutional.
[02:44:13.294 --> 02:44:18.195]  And they're not even bad men themselves, but they are now agents of the New World Order.
[02:44:18.795 --> 02:44:22.877]  Well, you know, I actually used to attend a really big, mega-type church.
[02:44:22.877 --> 02:44:29.221]  And when I went to that really big church, the pastor was literally called to a meeting with George W. Bush in Washington, D.C.
[02:44:29.221 --> 02:44:31.422]  with a bunch of other big-time pastors.
[02:44:31.422 --> 02:44:36.645]  And they sat him down and told him, we're on your team, you know, but you need to help us, and here's what, you know.
[02:44:36.645 --> 02:44:40.207]  And basically, these pastors are literally getting their marching orders from the government.
[02:44:40.207 --> 02:44:41.568]  Because the government's not stupid.
[02:44:42.068 --> 02:44:45.312]  You know, they know that these big pastors that pastor really big churches.
[02:44:45.312 --> 02:44:46.533]  It's over 100,000 now.
[02:44:46.533 --> 02:44:47.834]  It's little ones.
[02:44:47.834 --> 02:44:48.755]  I've got the manuals.
[02:44:48.755 --> 02:44:51.739]  I'm sure you've seen our clergy response team stuff we broke seven, eight years ago.
[02:44:51.739 --> 02:44:53.581]  And since then it's been declassified.
[02:44:53.581 --> 02:45:00.248]  They've got them ready that when the time comes, turn your guns in, take the shots, go to the camp, let them take your husband.
[02:45:00.248 --> 02:45:00.849]  It's of the Lord.
[02:45:01.569 --> 02:45:05.772]  It's actually... And you know what's sad about that is that... By the way, I'm not just saying that.
[02:45:05.772 --> 02:45:06.733]  That's in the manuals.
[02:45:06.733 --> 02:45:07.113]  Go ahead.
[02:45:07.113 --> 02:45:07.674]  No, I know.
[02:45:07.674 --> 02:45:09.635]  They plan on taking us away.
[02:45:09.635 --> 02:45:10.796]  I've seen the evidence.
[02:45:10.796 --> 02:45:16.240]  And the thing is, the thing that's sad about it, though, is that it turns a lot of people off away from Christianity.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:25.547]  Because they see how basically a lot of these pastors are these minions of the New World Order and these minions of big government and global warfare and all these different things.
[02:45:25.547 --> 02:45:26.387]  Minions of the devil.
[02:45:26.387 --> 02:45:27.368]  And minions of the devil.
[02:45:27.368 --> 02:45:30.130]  And then they look at that and it makes them turn against the Bible.
[02:45:30.310 --> 02:45:31.831]  Or turn against Jesus Christ?
[02:45:31.831 --> 02:45:32.952]  Or not want to hear about it?
[02:45:32.952 --> 02:45:35.453]  When in reality, that's not the Bible or Jesus talking.
[02:45:35.453 --> 02:45:36.954]  These guys don't know the Bible.
[02:45:36.954 --> 02:45:37.535]  You know?
[02:45:37.535 --> 02:45:46.681]  And so, if we could get some preachers that would stand up and preach what the Bible really says and warn people about these things, then maybe people would, you know... I agree.
[02:45:46.681 --> 02:45:51.604]  I'm gonna go to... And again, if people out there are Christians, like, how dare you even talk about this?
[02:45:51.604 --> 02:45:52.665]  What's wrong with talking?
[02:45:52.665 --> 02:45:54.186]  See, this is the big taboo.
[02:45:54.906 --> 02:45:57.087]  Let me tell all the Christians out there something.
[02:45:57.087 --> 02:46:03.969]  In your life, if you've done the right thing and stood up against evil, God, many times, will protect you, unless it's part of a larger plan.
[02:46:03.969 --> 02:46:06.470]  I don't pray to God every day, hey, give me this, give me that, protect me.
[02:46:06.470 --> 02:46:14.172]  I just say, look, I'm a sinner, I'm a dirty rag here, I'm trying to fight evil, my heart loves good, will you help me be strong?
[02:46:14.172 --> 02:46:16.613]  Will you help me not be a bad person?
[02:46:16.613 --> 02:46:21.054]  There's all these Pharisees out there that want to make you obsess on the law, but not the heart.
[02:46:21.054 --> 02:46:23.155]  And the issue is, I'm going to tell Christians something out there.
[02:46:23.954 --> 02:46:29.357]  You are not going to make it through this evil that's coming, believing you're going to be teleported out of here.
[02:46:29.357 --> 02:46:31.218]  I assure you, that's just not justice.
[02:46:31.218 --> 02:46:38.342]  God is not going to let you sit there like a coward and be ejected out of this if you don't stand up against evil.
[02:46:38.342 --> 02:46:42.385]  I'm not saying God doesn't deliver people, but they have to go through the fire first.
[02:46:42.385 --> 02:46:44.266]  Is that not biblical over and over again?
[02:46:44.266 --> 02:46:45.827]  It's the same stories over and over again.
[02:46:46.207 --> 02:46:54.014]  It's definitely biblical that every single Christian, according to the Bible, is appointed to suffering, to go through trials, to go through tribulations.
[02:46:54.014 --> 02:46:55.415]  You know, yeah, he's going to see us through.
[02:46:55.415 --> 02:46:59.639]  The Bible says, many of the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.
[02:46:59.639 --> 02:47:03.102]  But it's not saying, you know, we're going to be delivered before the afflictions come.
[02:47:03.102 --> 02:47:05.084]  You know, the Bible teaches... What about Job?
[02:47:05.084 --> 02:47:06.905]  You know, why didn't he just get delivered up front?
[02:47:06.905 --> 02:47:07.826]  Exactly.
[02:47:07.826 --> 02:47:09.528]  As Christians, we all have to fight.
[02:47:09.528 --> 02:47:11.910]  And it said he was as near perfect as any man.
[02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:15.873]  He was the greatest man living on the earth at that time, is what the Bible says.
[02:47:15.873 --> 02:47:20.698]  He was an upright man, and he went through the most suffering of anybody in the Bible, okay?
[02:47:20.698 --> 02:47:26.142]  Because all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[02:47:26.142 --> 02:47:39.054]  And people, Christians today, it's like you said, you know, the Christians today who don't see this coming, they're not prepared for it, you know, it's going to catch them unawares, it's going to catch them off guard, they're going to panic, they're going to be disillusioned,
[02:47:39.554 --> 02:47:40.795]  What happened to the rapture?
[02:47:40.795 --> 02:47:42.295]  I don't know what to do, I'm scared!
[02:47:42.295 --> 02:47:46.597]  You know, and you know, those of us that are awake, we're ready for it, you know?
[02:47:46.597 --> 02:47:56.341]  They're already setting up checkpoints nationwide where they're looking for veterans, Christians, gun owners, second coming of Christ believers, libertarians.
[02:47:56.341 --> 02:48:02.163]  They know, I mean, there are, the main homeland security, and the same in Europe, is for us?
[02:48:02.163 --> 02:48:03.043]  I mean, there it is!
[02:48:03.043 --> 02:48:04.364]  These are really bad people!
[02:48:05.612 --> 02:48:08.253]  I mean, where's the... I want to go to calls.
[02:48:08.253 --> 02:48:09.313]  We've got a caller from Australia.
[02:48:09.313 --> 02:48:10.314]  He's been on the longest.
[02:48:10.314 --> 02:48:11.834]  I promise I'm going to get to you after the break, Sean.
[02:48:11.834 --> 02:48:12.815]  I'm going to give you time.
[02:48:12.815 --> 02:48:14.335]  But John says he disagrees.
[02:48:14.335 --> 02:48:19.577]  He's listening on Shortwave in Texas, WWCR, World Service.
[02:48:19.577 --> 02:48:21.678]  John, what do you disagree with, brother?
[02:48:21.678 --> 02:48:22.398]  Hello.
[02:48:22.398 --> 02:48:25.919]  Yes, I'm approaching this conversation not hostile.
[02:48:25.919 --> 02:48:27.440]  It's okay.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:28.360]  Tell us what you think, brother.
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:32.401]  I just didn't want you to understand I'm not coming at you hostile.
[02:48:32.401 --> 02:48:34.582]  I don't mind that.
[02:48:34.582 --> 02:48:35.822]  Go ahead.
[02:48:35.822 --> 02:48:36.862]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:36.862 --> 02:48:42.484]  Pastor Anderson, in 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 3, have you ever read the Geneva Bible?
[02:48:42.484 --> 02:48:42.824]  In that verse
[02:48:49.346 --> 02:49:02.239]  They changed it in the Geneva Bible, in the King James Version, they changed it to accept there come a falling away, and originally it was a departing.
[02:49:02.239 --> 02:49:08.605]  And that to me shows that there has to be a departing of something.
[02:49:09.048 --> 02:49:15.451]  Okay, I've heard this theory that the falling away is actually a departure, meaning that Christians are departing this earth.
[02:49:15.451 --> 02:49:18.153]  The Greek word there is apostasia.
[02:49:18.153 --> 02:49:27.437]  You actually expect me to believe that the Greek word apostasia should be translated as departure, meaning departing in the rapture?
[02:49:27.437 --> 02:49:31.820]  No, apostasy is when people fall away from the faith or depart from the faith.
[02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:34.401]  The Bible says in the last days some will depart from the faith.
[02:49:35.261 --> 02:49:39.763]  Everyone knows a falling away means, look at Europe, look at America.
[02:49:39.763 --> 02:49:45.725]  But look, I encourage you, the Greek word apostasia is where we get our English word apostasy.
[02:49:45.725 --> 02:49:50.107]  And so when the Geneva Bible said a departure, it's talking about departing the faith.
[02:49:50.107 --> 02:49:53.148]  Falling away means falling away from the truth.
[02:49:53.148 --> 02:49:55.029]  And that's what we're seeing today.
[02:49:55.029 --> 02:49:58.890]  How does the beast wage war on the saints and overcome them if the Christians are all gone?
[02:49:59.070 --> 02:50:05.875]  Look, I've heard this so many times, wake up people, apostasy, apostasia, that is not the rapture.
[02:50:05.875 --> 02:50:10.238]  And look, this caller, I'm not trying to be rude to the caller, but this subject just gets me fired up.
[02:50:10.238 --> 02:50:17.423]  And let me tell you something, Christians today who believe in the pre-trib rapture, this is the kind of ridiculous reasoning they use.
[02:50:17.423 --> 02:50:21.966]  They're going to take me to 2 Thessalonians... Look, my gut and studying the world,
[02:50:22.566 --> 02:50:24.968]  They're planning to bring in world government to kill.
[02:50:24.968 --> 02:50:26.909]  Their plan is over 90% of us, okay?
[02:50:26.909 --> 02:50:31.111]  They're planning to kill people and they're occultists and they're using microchips to buy and sell.
[02:50:31.111 --> 02:50:32.993]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[02:50:32.993 --> 02:50:37.475]  I'm here to tell you, all the Christians out there thinking you and your kids are getting out of this.
[02:50:37.475 --> 02:50:41.278]  None of you are getting out of this unless it means you die early before this happens.
[02:50:41.738 --> 02:50:44.140]  Okay, I got a warning for you right now.
[02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:45.601]  You can put it in the bank.
[02:50:45.601 --> 02:50:47.462]  Okay, you can put it in the pipe and smoke it.
[02:50:47.462 --> 02:50:51.625]  Nobody, and I mean nobody, rides for free.
[02:50:51.625 --> 02:50:54.667]  Nobody's going into the Kingdom of Heaven without showing their medal.
[02:50:54.667 --> 02:50:58.510]  The fire separates the garbage from the gold.
[02:50:58.510 --> 02:50:59.530]  I'm gonna go back to that caller.
[02:50:59.530 --> 02:51:00.011]  Stay there, sir.
[02:51:00.011 --> 02:51:01.672]  I want to give you a response back, John.
[02:51:01.972 --> 02:51:10.614]  If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[02:51:10.614 --> 02:51:11.414]  Here's why.
[02:51:11.414 --> 02:51:14.695]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:51:14.695 --> 02:51:21.377]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:51:21.377 --> 02:51:24.818]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:51:24.818 --> 02:51:25.858]  Now here's the best part.
[02:51:26.318 --> 02:51:31.122]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:51:31.122 --> 02:51:36.966]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.
[02:51:36.966 --> 02:51:40.988]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:51:40.988 --> 02:51:45.672]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe!
[02:51:46.112 --> 02:51:47.774]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[02:51:47.774 --> 02:51:49.455]  Go to scratchanddensolar.com.
[02:51:49.455 --> 02:51:51.657]  That's scratchanddensolar.com.
[02:51:51.657 --> 02:51:56.381]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddensolar.com.
[02:51:56.381 --> 02:51:58.503]  That's scratchanddensolar.com.
[02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:03.851]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[02:52:03.851 --> 02:52:04.792]  Answer this.
[02:52:04.792 --> 02:52:17.079]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:20.481]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[02:52:20.481 --> 02:52:26.703]  This year about one in every 50 US homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:29.284]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:52:29.284 --> 02:52:37.346]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:40.287]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[02:52:40.287 --> 02:52:40.748]  And for only $34.95,
[02:52:42.068 --> 02:52:47.374]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[02:52:47.374 --> 02:52:50.056]  Go to FakeTV.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:52:50.056 --> 02:52:51.638]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to FakeTV.com.
[02:52:51.638 --> 02:52:53.280]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:53:01.408 --> 02:53:06.611]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[02:54:11.189 --> 02:54:15.635]  By the way, everything we've talked about unfortunately is now starting to unfold.
[02:54:16.781 --> 02:54:20.902]  All over the country they're getting Homeland Security grants, starting with New York and L.A.
[02:54:20.902 --> 02:54:25.663]  They now have naked body scanners that the police force people into on the street randomly.
[02:54:25.663 --> 02:54:30.403]  They're doing something like half a million a year random searches without warrants.
[02:54:30.403 --> 02:54:33.384]  Now, that's up at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:33.384 --> 02:54:34.484]  In New York!
[02:54:34.484 --> 02:54:36.805]  And now they're having warrantless checkpoints here in Texas.
[02:54:36.805 --> 02:54:38.805]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:54:38.805 --> 02:54:44.586]  An engineer files lawsuit against New York street body scanners, a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:54:45.786 --> 02:54:46.067]  I don't know.
[02:55:05.802 --> 02:55:11.686]  Decorated combat veteran arrested, charged with five felonies for possession of AR-15 magazines in New York State.
[02:55:11.686 --> 02:55:12.727]  Now illegal.
[02:55:12.727 --> 02:55:14.528]  They say they're going to throw him under the jail.
[02:55:14.528 --> 02:55:16.429]  This is how they're going to come after us, folks.
[02:55:16.429 --> 02:55:18.050]  And it is pure evil.
[02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:21.673]  And we can be like Nineveh, I believe, and get a reprieve if we push this back.
[02:55:21.673 --> 02:55:28.277]  I had a sheriff on the one in Kentucky who's now got hundreds of sheriffs by his honor going public saying, I won't enforce this.
[02:55:28.277 --> 02:55:29.998]  I'm going to stand against the gun confiscation.
[02:55:29.998 --> 02:55:33.661]  Now hundreds, prominent ones are coming out saying they stand with him.
[02:55:33.661 --> 02:55:35.442]  He said, look, you know, he said,
[02:55:36.342 --> 02:55:38.644]  We might have had all this happen in the 70s when people stood up.
[02:55:38.644 --> 02:55:40.325]  We would have had it happen last year.
[02:55:40.325 --> 02:55:42.927]  We're in the game, folks, and it's all in the Bible.
[02:55:42.927 --> 02:55:47.130]  Whether you believe it or not, it's amazing philosophy, amazing information.
[02:55:47.130 --> 02:55:50.212]  The media puts it down all day because they're scared of it.
[02:55:50.212 --> 02:55:54.434]  And read the Bible and tell me, how did it predict all this with such precision?
[02:55:54.434 --> 02:55:56.956]  I want to go to Sean in Australia, who's holding super patient.
[02:55:56.956 --> 02:55:58.317]  I promise I'm going to get to you.
[02:55:58.317 --> 02:56:02.560]  But John in Texas who disagrees, the pastor got fired up there with you.
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:03.701]  You're very nice to call in.
[02:56:03.701 --> 02:56:05.702]  Do you want to have a counterpoint back to him?
[02:56:06.683 --> 02:56:08.844]  Yes, yes, thank you.
[02:56:08.844 --> 02:56:15.889]  Pastor Anderson, have you ever read the book Why So Many Churches by Dr. Nell Hutchings?
[02:56:15.889 --> 02:56:19.451]  The reason I'm bringing this up is because I believe that... I've read it.
[02:56:19.451 --> 02:56:21.753]  Everybody fights over doctrine until everything splits.
[02:56:22.398 --> 02:56:23.299]  Exactly.
[02:56:23.299 --> 02:56:25.722]  And I don't have a bone to pick either way on this side.
[02:56:25.722 --> 02:56:27.864]  If we're raptured out of here, I'm happy.
[02:56:27.864 --> 02:56:29.425]  I just know I'm insecure in Christ.
[02:56:29.425 --> 02:56:30.587]  That's where I'm coming from.
[02:56:30.587 --> 02:56:30.887]  No, no.
[02:56:30.887 --> 02:56:31.768]  I think that's key.
[02:56:31.768 --> 02:56:33.910]  But we need to be fighting this thing.
[02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:36.413]  Because what matters is people's souls.
[02:56:36.413 --> 02:56:36.993]  Go ahead, Pastor.
[02:56:37.794 --> 02:56:38.695]  Comments?
[02:56:38.695 --> 02:56:42.780]  Well, you know, I appreciate the call and I'm, you know, I'm sorry that I got a little fired up there.
[02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:44.702]  It's just I'm really passionate about this stuff.
[02:56:44.702 --> 02:56:46.564]  Falling away means falling down, not up.
[02:56:46.564 --> 02:56:48.786]  Yeah, if things fall, they fall down, they don't fall up.
[02:56:48.786 --> 02:56:50.448]  We're not going to be raptured to the center of the earth.
[02:56:50.448 --> 02:56:54.172]  So the apostasia or falling away or departure is not the rapture.
[02:56:54.693 --> 02:56:58.397]  But as far as the idea of not fighting over doctrine, I disagree with that.
[02:56:58.397 --> 02:56:59.198]  I haven't read the book.
[02:56:59.198 --> 02:57:00.400]  I can't comment on it.
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:03.243]  But I'm going to fight over doctrine until I die.
[02:57:03.243 --> 02:57:05.685]  Because I do want to fight over every little doctrine.
[02:57:05.685 --> 02:57:08.569]  Because if it wasn't important, it wouldn't have been in the Bible.
[02:57:08.569 --> 02:57:12.233]  And let me tell you something, it's the New World Order that wants to unite everybody.
[02:57:13.274 --> 02:57:13.875]  Alex, how are you?
[02:57:13.875 --> 02:57:14.576]  Look, I want to speak to
[02:57:34.563 --> 02:57:39.425]  Another book, another book written by Carol Quigley that I'm sure you're familiar with, Tragedy and Hope.
[02:57:39.425 --> 02:57:40.025]  Yes sir.
[02:57:40.025 --> 02:57:52.171]  It's actually, there's a passage in there that actually gives you the historical framework for understanding why weapons are needed in times of human civilization when there is enemies.
[02:57:53.024 --> 02:57:58.706]  Now, if you give me just five minutes to read it, you can use this against anyone who argues against you.
[02:57:58.706 --> 02:58:03.347]  No, no, we're going to go to break, go to overdrive in a moment, but go ahead and tell people to passage the page.
[02:58:03.347 --> 02:58:04.907]  We even sell Tragedy and Hope.
[02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:06.788]  It's like 1,100 pages long.
[02:58:06.788 --> 02:58:11.829]  This is a top globalist admitting the whole program, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown.
[02:58:11.829 --> 02:58:13.890]  Give people the passage and page number.
[02:58:13.890 --> 02:58:16.471]  We'll come back and let you read it on air.
[02:58:16.471 --> 02:58:17.191]  No worries.
[02:58:17.191 --> 02:58:19.012]  I actually don't have the page number.
[02:58:19.012 --> 02:58:20.092]  I've just got to print it out right now.
[02:58:20.999 --> 02:58:27.921]  No, no, I understand, but I'm saying if you give me the page number, I can actually go grab the book right over there on the bookshelf, and then show people.
[02:58:27.921 --> 02:58:29.962]  You know what?
[02:58:29.962 --> 02:58:38.264]  Give me a couple words out of it, and then I can go to the, give me a name out of it, and then I can go look up the page number in the back of the book.
[02:58:38.264 --> 02:58:44.006]  Stay there, we'll be right back.

[03:00:18.789 --> 03:00:22.853]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.329 --> 03:00:37.517]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I was talking to Pastor Anderson, he listens to us on XM 166, and they carry three hours, but they come in at the second hour, and do the second, third, and fourth hour, and for a while I was doing four hours.
[03:00:37.517 --> 03:00:41.719]  And a lot of days we do do the fourth hour, and here we are doing it.
[03:00:41.719 --> 03:00:43.260]  But we're talking to
[03:00:44.441 --> 03:00:48.226]  Sean in Australia, this is about a five minute segment, so you've got the floor.
[03:00:48.226 --> 03:00:51.430]  Go ahead and read from Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope.
[03:00:51.430 --> 03:00:52.851]  And then guys, I don't see one over there.
[03:00:52.851 --> 03:00:55.214]  Will you guys run me one in from the shipping department?
[03:00:55.214 --> 03:00:55.855]  Thank you.
[03:00:55.855 --> 03:00:56.956]  So Sean, you've got four minutes.
[03:00:56.956 --> 03:00:57.397]  Start reading.
[03:00:58.470 --> 03:01:05.493]  Okay, so firstly, callers, you've got to understand that this book was actually intended for the intellectual community and for the elites themselves.
[03:01:05.493 --> 03:01:12.436]  They never actually, really, it was never targeted for the general population, so the general population can now use this as the weapon.
[03:01:12.436 --> 03:01:21.140]  Yeah, this was a control manual for globalists to understand why they were left and right, how they created the synthesis.
[03:01:21.140 --> 03:01:21.860]  Go ahead.
[03:01:21.860 --> 03:01:24.401]  Okay, so this is directly reading.
[03:01:25.831 --> 03:01:35.419]  On the military level in Western Civilization in the 20th century, the chief development has been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons.
[03:01:35.419 --> 03:01:41.944]  Weapons are cheap and easy to get, and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short period of training.
[03:01:41.944 --> 03:01:46.307]  Armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers.
[03:01:46.307 --> 03:01:52.672]  Such weapons we call amateur weapons, and such armies we might call mass armies of citizen soldiers.
[03:01:53.365 --> 03:02:02.490]  The age of Pericles in classical Greece and the 19th century in western civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers.
[03:02:02.490 --> 03:02:12.075]  But the 19th century was preceded, as was the age of Pericles also, by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training in their use.
[03:02:12.075 --> 03:02:14.917]  Such weapons we call specialist weapons.
[03:02:15.470 --> 03:02:20.153]  Periods of specialist weapons are generally periods of small armies of professional soldiers.
[03:02:20.153 --> 03:02:28.298]  In a period of specialist weapons, the minority who have such weapons can usually force the majority who lack them to obey.
[03:02:28.298 --> 03:02:35.263]  Thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian government.
[03:02:35.843 --> 03:02:41.064]  But a period of amateur weapons is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power.
[03:02:41.064 --> 03:02:47.945]  A majority can compel a minority to yield, and a majority rule or even democratic government tends to rise.
[03:02:47.945 --> 03:02:51.906]  So what you've got to realize here in this passage is he refers to specialist weapons.
[03:02:51.906 --> 03:02:53.986]  Now think about what we have right now.
[03:02:53.986 --> 03:02:57.807]  We have Skynet, total lockdown of the skies.
[03:02:57.807 --> 03:02:59.327]  We have specialist weapons.
[03:02:59.327 --> 03:03:01.048]  They're called drones.
[03:03:01.048 --> 03:03:01.888]  We have the specialist
[03:03:02.905 --> 03:03:03.125]  I don't
[03:03:16.269 --> 03:03:30.480]  Characterizes that periods of specialist weapons, which are, which we are currently in, today, the present, 2013, it's a period of specialist weapons, tend to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian government.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:32.941]  Now, the term authoritarian is actually incorrect.
[03:03:32.941 --> 03:03:34.643]  Alex also uses it a lot.
[03:03:34.643 --> 03:03:38.145]  You should actually refer to it as totalitarian government.
[03:03:39.873 --> 03:03:56.548]  This totalitarian government is also in tandem with programs such as Agenda 21 and everything like that, and the underlying ideology of this, I would actually like to speak to, um, Alex was just talking before about how the elites, or whatever you want to call them, worship, you know, a specific
[03:03:57.728 --> 03:04:12.214]  They worship religion, they worship certain ideologies, they have basically, they recruit people into their organisation through what I call the most extreme form of nepotism, where they actually recruit people based on their ideologies alone.
[03:04:12.214 --> 03:04:22.359]  Now the undercurrent of ideology through all sciences, especially earth or environmental sciences, is actually something called conservatism.
[03:04:23.019 --> 03:04:23.499]  We're good to go.
[03:04:37.486 --> 03:04:40.909]  Anything in history we actually see counter-entropic developments.
[03:04:40.909 --> 03:04:42.050]  Hey sir, let me stop you.
[03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:45.713]  I've actually got the book here and it's bibliography is big but not big enough.
[03:04:45.713 --> 03:04:46.834]  I'm not finding them.
[03:04:46.834 --> 03:04:49.136]  I remember reading this many years ago.
[03:04:49.136 --> 03:04:50.317]  Tell me where you found it.
[03:04:50.317 --> 03:04:56.483]  Send your link to showtipsandinfowars.com or give me the basic page number because I want to show TV viewers this.
[03:04:56.483 --> 03:04:57.304]  You're right.
[03:04:57.304 --> 03:04:58.365]  This is big news.
[03:04:58.365 --> 03:04:58.685]  Stay there.
[03:04:58.685 --> 03:04:59.526]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[03:05:02.014 --> 03:05:03.435]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:03.435 --> 03:05:14.122]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:05:14.122 --> 03:05:18.585]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:05:18.585 --> 03:05:21.327]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:05:21.327 --> 03:05:31.954]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.574 --> 03:05:36.075]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:36.075 --> 03:05:42.216]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:42.216 --> 03:05:52.119]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:52.119 --> 03:05:53.619]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.619 --> 03:05:55.520]  It's an info war.
[03:05:55.520 --> 03:05:57.460]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:01.781 --> 03:06:02.902]  My name is Stephen Heuer.
[03:06:02.902 --> 03:06:10.205]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[03:06:10.205 --> 03:06:22.250]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[03:06:22.250 --> 03:06:27.032]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[03:06:27.392 --> 03:06:32.154]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[03:06:32.154 --> 03:06:36.416]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months his constipation is gone.
[03:06:36.416 --> 03:06:42.039]  He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he's made his first friend.
[03:06:42.039 --> 03:06:45.801]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[03:06:45.801 --> 03:06:50.263]  You could offer him a present, or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[03:06:50.603 --> 03:06:52.786]  Go to oneworldway.com.
[03:06:52.786 --> 03:06:55.550]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:56.150]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.411]  That's 888-988-3325.
[03:07:02.739 --> 03:07:06.580]  In this unpredictable world, disaster can strike anyone.
[03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:12.922]  That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove-in-a-can.
[03:07:12.922 --> 03:07:22.604]  When power goes out and gas lines are down, the portable, safe, easy-to-use stove-in-a-can cooks food up to four hours and boils water in as little as five minutes.
[03:07:22.984 --> 03:07:25.605]  Stove in a can comes with everything you need.
[03:07:25.605 --> 03:07:28.687]  The stove, fuel, even waterproof matches.
[03:07:28.687 --> 03:07:31.508]  All in a compact, durable, heavy-duty container.
[03:07:31.508 --> 03:07:38.072]  Plus, the all-natural, non-explosive, 100% waterproof fuel source can be stored indefinitely.
[03:07:38.072 --> 03:07:42.354]  Say goodbye to the hassle and danger of propane, lighter fluid, or gas.

[03:08:03.396 --> 03:08:10.021]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.021 --> 03:08:13.004]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:16.092 --> 03:08:18.914]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going back to Sean in Australia.
[03:08:18.914 --> 03:08:26.600]  If you just joined us, he brought up Tragedy and Hope, written by the head of political science at one time at Georgetown University.
[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:31.284]  That's where the globalists send their people to get the inside scoop.
[03:08:31.284 --> 03:08:40.471]  And only a thousand copies of this book were originally printed back in the mid-1960s to be given to CIA section chiefs, State Department people.
[03:08:40.471 --> 03:08:42.193]  It was commissioned over a decade
[03:08:43.153 --> 03:08:46.596]  By the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations.
[03:08:46.596 --> 03:08:50.138]  Quigley, later when this came out, you know, had to admit that.
[03:08:50.138 --> 03:08:56.982]  And he brags in the book, actually, that he was commissioned and allowed into the Annals, the Bilderberg Group, and others.
[03:08:56.982 --> 03:08:59.524]  And he says, I believe this should be an open conspiracy.
[03:08:59.524 --> 03:09:02.786]  It's a great idea to have world government to engineer everybody.
[03:09:02.786 --> 03:09:07.169]  And the book is, let me tell you how many pages long, it's over 1,350 pages long.
[03:09:07.169 --> 03:09:07.930]  Now, the plates got out.
[03:09:13.351 --> 03:09:37.993]  and Patriot groups associated with the John Birch Society and others printed tens of thousands of these up in the seventies and there were even threats of legal actions and things but the point is they backed off and we found the publisher that republished that we do I wasn't getting to sell the book today but the caller from Australia called and said have you read what's on page twelve hundred the unfolding of time and I'm gonna show view
[03:09:40.211 --> 03:09:47.277]  And it's also in Chapter 2, The Unfolding of Time, but also in Chapter 2 they say similar things.
[03:09:47.277 --> 03:09:49.138]  And yes, I read most of this book.
[03:09:49.138 --> 03:09:52.361]  I'm going to be honest with you, it's 1,300 pages long.
[03:09:52.361 --> 03:09:56.664]  I read most of it back in about 1996, and a few years ago I tried to read it again.
[03:09:56.664 --> 03:09:58.166]  I'm going to be honest, I haven't read the whole thing.
[03:09:58.846 --> 03:10:01.387]  But the whole deal is how we control the left and the right.
[03:10:01.387 --> 03:10:03.308]  We want there to be the illusion of choice.
[03:10:03.308 --> 03:10:05.409]  We want to bankrupt people, make them dependent.
[03:10:05.409 --> 03:10:06.930]  Only we'll be able to operate.
[03:10:06.930 --> 03:10:07.830]  We like fascism.
[03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:08.730]  We like socialism.
[03:10:08.730 --> 03:10:09.811]  We like communism.
[03:10:09.811 --> 03:10:12.332]  As long as it centralizes, we hate libertarianism.
[03:10:12.332 --> 03:10:14.573]  We hate freedom because it makes people uppity.
[03:10:14.573 --> 03:10:18.555]  And this guy was, this caller was bringing this up, and I remember reading this when he was saying it.
[03:10:18.555 --> 03:10:23.157]  I knew he wasn't lying because I had the remnants of the memory of that.
[03:10:24.177 --> 03:10:25.939]  I guess that's what the beginning of wisdom is.
[03:10:25.939 --> 03:10:28.081]  You don't remember it all, you just remember pieces.
[03:10:28.081 --> 03:10:29.822]  You know the person's being accurate.
[03:10:29.822 --> 03:10:36.488]  And he says right here, we don't want the general public having arms because it makes it a free society and we can't stand up against them.
[03:10:36.488 --> 03:10:40.051]  We want specialized armies to basically oppress them.
[03:10:40.051 --> 03:10:47.998]  And he goes on to talk about how, you know, basically the founders wanted a citizen army in Western civilization and freedom and they don't want that.
[03:10:47.998 --> 03:10:50.501]  And the caller's like, this will defeat the gun control debate.
[03:10:51.327 --> 03:10:53.351]  You know, point out the tyrants won our guns.
[03:10:53.351 --> 03:10:55.155]  Well, that is what's defeating them.
[03:10:55.155 --> 03:10:58.641]  Sure, you could argue let's put mentally ill people in a registry so they can't own a gun.
[03:10:58.641 --> 03:10:59.422]  They already have that.
[03:10:59.422 --> 03:11:02.187]  Adam Lanza tried to buy guns five times.
[03:11:02.187 --> 03:11:02.668]  He failed.
[03:11:03.715 --> 03:11:06.218]  Okay, so they don't care.
[03:11:06.218 --> 03:11:07.379]  They want our guns.
[03:11:07.379 --> 03:11:10.283]  They're going to use anything reasonable to enslave us.
[03:11:10.283 --> 03:11:11.584]  They're not reasonable.
[03:11:11.584 --> 03:11:14.367]  So their reason to want our guns is to enslave us.
[03:11:14.367 --> 03:11:19.173]  They're arming to the teeth while telling us it's bad for us to have any guns.
[03:11:19.173 --> 03:11:20.234]  I want to go back to Pastor...
[03:11:21.335 --> 03:11:31.209]  Who's here in studio with us today and he's got the new, well he's part of the new film, Pastor Anderson, Let No Man Deceive You After the Tribulation film.
[03:11:31.209 --> 03:11:37.898]  What is your take on this Carol Quigley passage and what the caller was raising?
[03:11:38.615 --> 03:11:40.577]  Well, it's all part of the same agenda.
[03:11:40.577 --> 03:11:46.282]  You know, in order to totally enslave people, you're going to have to take away their guns, you're going to have to take away their weapons.
[03:11:46.282 --> 03:11:52.687]  The Bible clearly says that the Antichrist is going to make war with the saints and overcome them.
[03:11:52.687 --> 03:11:54.348]  Well, how's he going to do that?
[03:11:54.348 --> 03:11:59.273]  Obviously, he's going to put us in a society where we have no freedom.
[03:11:59.873 --> 03:12:08.742]  Where we're completely controlled, completely surveilled, we're not going to have any weapons, we're not going to be able to defend ourselves, and that's why the Bible tells us that Christians are going to be beheaded en masse.
[03:12:08.742 --> 03:12:12.305]  Because of the fact that the government's going to have the control to carry out that.
[03:12:12.305 --> 03:12:15.689]  But a TV preacher told me that Scotty's on the Enterprise is going to beat me up.
[03:12:18.174 --> 03:12:22.496]  It's about as true as Star Trek is true.
[03:12:22.496 --> 03:12:32.500]  The idea of the Rapture taking place before the Tribulation is about as biblical as the Starship Enterprise picking us up before the Tribulation.
[03:12:32.500 --> 03:12:40.584]  I want to go back to the caller, but if you just join us, I'm going to read the passage from page 1200 that the caller was raising.
[03:12:40.584 --> 03:12:42.765]  When weapons are of the amateur type,
[03:12:43.305 --> 03:12:43.445]  Yes.
[03:12:58.642 --> 03:13:05.565]  They want the abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, quote, because it threatens a legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[03:13:05.565 --> 03:13:14.949]  UN Treaty on General Small Arms Disarmament ratified and accepted for full attempted passage at the full UN Assembly, July 7th, 2001.
[03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:18.231]  I mean, this is their plan.
[03:13:18.231 --> 03:13:21.293]  They say, because they know people aren't reading what they're saying.
[03:13:21.293 --> 03:13:23.475]  I mean, they're like, we're going to enslave these people.
[03:13:23.475 --> 03:13:26.317]  We're going to cut their food off so we can sterilize whoever we want.
[03:13:26.317 --> 03:13:28.999]  Once we got them all on welfare, they'll all be social engineered.
[03:13:28.999 --> 03:13:31.000]  We can just give them shots to kill their butt.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:34.022]  But we want to kill them over a couple of years so they don't know we killed them.
[03:13:34.022 --> 03:13:36.544]  But then the Africans know how to run at the villages when the UN shows up.
[03:13:36.544 --> 03:13:38.785]  Let's continue.
[03:13:38.785 --> 03:13:40.667]  And again, let's show people from the actual book.
[03:13:40.667 --> 03:13:42.448]  If you guys can document Cam in on here.
[03:13:42.448 --> 03:13:43.829]  I want to show people this right here.
[03:13:44.710 --> 03:14:01.131]  When, right here, when the weapon, thank you, when the weapons are of an amateur type as the 1880s, as they were in Greece in the 5th century BC, they are widely possessed by citizens' power, is similarly dispersed, and no minority can compel the majority to yield to its will, globalist foreign bankers.
[03:14:03.172 --> 03:14:11.315]  With such an amateur weapons system, that's what he calls it, in other conditions, are not totally unfavorable.
[03:14:11.315 --> 03:14:16.716]  See, that's saying it's a problem for the elite if people are armed.
[03:14:16.716 --> 03:14:26.099]  We are likely to find majority rule, ah, this is a big problem, and a relatively democratic political system, but on the contrary,
[03:14:27.492 --> 03:14:48.822]  When a period can be dominated by complex and expensive weapons that only a few persons can afford to possess, robot armies, drones, or can learn to use, we have a situation where the minority who control such specialist weapons can dominate the majority who lack them, and the minority is a eugenicist, luciferian, psycho group.
[03:14:48.822 --> 03:14:50.863]  You might not want them to be the only ones with weapons, just an idea.
[03:14:51.383 --> 03:14:59.709]  In such a society, sooner or later, an authoritarian political system that reflects the inequity and control of weapons will be established.
[03:14:59.709 --> 03:15:08.154]  At the present time, there are systems to be little reason to doubt that the specialist weapons of today will continue to dominate the military picture in the foreseeable future.
[03:15:08.154 --> 03:15:10.736]  And I'm going to do a whole piece on this, because it's so important.
[03:15:10.736 --> 03:15:14.799]  He goes on to say how terrible it is that in the United States, we have guns.
[03:15:15.339 --> 03:15:22.647]  That's right over here, because they're not going to be able to have their social engineer system, you know, because of the United States and the guns, and England.
[03:15:22.647 --> 03:15:23.368]  Well, forget that.
[03:15:23.368 --> 03:15:24.690]  They got the guns in England.
[03:15:24.690 --> 03:15:25.991]  I'm not going to spend all day on that.
[03:15:25.991 --> 03:15:29.235]  Pastor Anderson, another comment there, and then we'll go back to the caller.
[03:15:30.196 --> 03:15:34.499]  What about the distribution of power amongst a lot of people versus being ruled by a small minority?
[03:15:34.499 --> 03:15:44.167]  Well, when we look at the book of Revelation, we see the end of this is that all the power is going to be concentrated in ten kings, or ten leaders, and then all of those... Who give power unto the beast.
[03:15:44.167 --> 03:15:44.587]  Exactly.
[03:15:44.587 --> 03:15:50.711]  Then those ten kings will further give all their power to one man, who's called the Antichrist.
[03:15:50.711 --> 03:15:53.153]  And this man's going to be given all of the power.
[03:15:53.153 --> 03:15:54.634]  He's going to rule over the entire world.
[03:15:54.634 --> 03:15:55.195]  And he's going to have
[03:15:59.658 --> 03:16:13.788]  Exactly, and so he is going to rule over everyone, and not only is he going to have all the political power, but he's also going to be worshipped as God.
[03:16:13.788 --> 03:16:18.571]  And the Christians are going to declare him to be the second coming of Jesus Christ, the apostate Christians.
[03:16:18.931 --> 03:16:22.553]  That's because they believe this must be the raptures.
[03:16:22.553 --> 03:16:24.634]  Yeah, this is the second coming of Christ.
[03:16:24.634 --> 03:16:28.757]  And then the Jews are going to say, this is our Messiah we've been waiting for.
[03:16:28.757 --> 03:16:36.902]  And then, you know, the Islamic people, they will declare him to be the fifth imam or whatever, or the Imam Mahdi.
[03:16:36.902 --> 03:16:40.984]  And then, you know, the Buddhists are going to say, well, this is the new embodiment of the Dalai Lama.
[03:16:41.084 --> 03:16:41.344]  I don't know.
[03:16:56.681 --> 03:16:56.961]  Exactly.
[03:16:56.961 --> 03:16:58.203]  They're all lining it up.
[03:16:58.203 --> 03:16:58.643]  Exactly.
[03:16:58.643 --> 03:17:03.489]  And all of these major false religions, they're all looking for some messiah.
[03:17:03.489 --> 03:17:04.110]  Okay.
[03:17:04.110 --> 03:17:09.055]  Now, yes, we are looking for the second coming of Jesus Christ, but we know it comes after the tribulation.
[03:17:09.055 --> 03:17:10.897]  We know that the imposter comes first.
[03:17:11.578 --> 03:17:13.360]  Now think about how evil this is.
[03:17:13.360 --> 03:17:18.384]  The Bible teaches us that before the second coming of Christ, there's an imposter coming.
[03:17:18.384 --> 03:17:19.805]  And a great delusion.
[03:17:19.805 --> 03:17:26.130]  A great delusion and an imposter who comes first and claims to be Jesus Christ before the real Jesus Christ comes back.
[03:17:26.130 --> 03:17:28.833]  And what is this pre-tribulation rapture doctrine teaching?
[03:17:28.833 --> 03:17:31.375]  To expect Jesus to come at any moment.
[03:17:31.375 --> 03:17:32.396]  Who's really coming?
[03:17:32.396 --> 03:17:33.096]  The Antichrist.
[03:17:33.096 --> 03:17:33.877]  Now, exactly.
[03:17:33.877 --> 03:17:36.119]  Now let's explain this here in Overdrive.
[03:17:36.119 --> 03:17:37.040]  Powerful information.
[03:17:38.174 --> 03:17:44.276]  If you're looking at this, this is the only argument that people can say to shoot this down.
[03:17:44.276 --> 03:18:01.082]  The elites looked at this science fiction book, the Bible, and said, this is a great idea, this hallucination, you know, the guy on the Isle of Patmos had, John had, John the Revelator and stuff, this is a great idea, let's just use this, and then, oh, let's go ahead and worship Lucifer, because I've studied the globalists, they do, they are into the occult.
[03:18:01.082 --> 03:18:05.544]  So they've just adopted it, they've just adopted the bad guy of the book as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:18:05.544 --> 03:18:06.144]  What do you say to that?
[03:18:06.943 --> 03:18:10.285]  Well, you know, I say the fool hath said in his heart there is no God.
[03:18:10.285 --> 03:18:11.846]  You know, I'm a Bible-believing Christian.
[03:18:11.846 --> 03:18:13.567]  I believe every word of the Bible.
[03:18:13.567 --> 03:18:19.631]  And I think it's hard to look at all the evil in this world, and it's hard to look at the... Well, there is a design that's above humans.
[03:18:19.631 --> 03:18:20.612]  There's got to be a design.
[03:18:20.612 --> 03:18:26.536]  You know, I'm sorry, but I do not believe that if we travel all the way to the top, we're just going to get to the bankers.
[03:18:26.676 --> 03:18:27.657]  I know they're at the top.
[03:18:27.657 --> 03:18:28.178]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:18:28.178 --> 03:18:29.139]  I've studied it.
[03:18:29.139 --> 03:18:31.541]  There is a spirit behind it.
[03:18:31.541 --> 03:18:33.904]  You can see it animating and working.
[03:18:33.904 --> 03:18:34.925]  I have studied it.
[03:18:34.925 --> 03:18:36.887]  This conspiracy is multi-generational.
[03:18:36.887 --> 03:18:38.950]  It's been going on for hundreds of years.
[03:18:38.950 --> 03:18:41.633]  And it is magic.
[03:18:41.633 --> 03:18:44.536]  I mean, the enemy has over-the-horizon radar.
[03:18:44.536 --> 03:18:45.537]  They've got a lot of tricks.
[03:18:45.657 --> 03:18:45.737]  It's
[03:19:03.903 --> 03:19:05.083]  I've studied all these people.
[03:19:05.083 --> 03:19:07.004]  They're all into weird secret stuff.
[03:19:07.004 --> 03:19:07.684]  All of them.
[03:19:07.684 --> 03:19:14.485]  And a lot of people, the reason why they don't believe in so-called conspiracy theories, you know, you can't tell me that these people have gotten together and orchestrated this.
[03:19:14.485 --> 03:19:16.485]  No, no, it's Satan that's directing them.
[03:19:16.485 --> 03:19:18.646]  Not all of them might even know what their party is.
[03:19:18.646 --> 03:19:19.926]  No, no, they're compartmentalized.
[03:19:19.926 --> 03:19:21.026]  They're compartmentalized.
[03:19:21.026 --> 03:19:30.508]  And the Bible says, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
[03:19:30.708 --> 03:19:32.689]  Spiritual wickedness in high places.
[03:19:32.689 --> 03:19:33.850]  Perfect description!
[03:19:33.850 --> 03:19:34.330]  Yeah.
[03:19:34.330 --> 03:19:35.511]  The Bible warns us.
[03:19:35.511 --> 03:19:37.312]  Rulers of the darkness of this world.
[03:19:37.312 --> 03:19:39.613]  Spiritual wickedness in high places.
[03:19:39.613 --> 03:19:40.974]  That's what needs to be preached.
[03:19:40.974 --> 03:19:44.996]  And look at how they keep busting senators with underage kids.
[03:19:44.996 --> 03:19:46.097]  Exactly.
[03:19:46.097 --> 03:19:48.518]  You don't even get in the door.
[03:19:48.518 --> 03:19:50.019]  Unless you like to hurt children.
[03:19:50.019 --> 03:19:51.420]  Exactly.
[03:19:51.420 --> 03:19:52.701]  Unbelievable.
[03:19:52.701 --> 03:19:53.221]  We'll be back.
[03:19:53.221 --> 03:19:55.382]  I promise we're going to go back to Sean in Australia.
[03:19:55.382 --> 03:19:56.463]  Then a bunch of other people.
[03:19:56.463 --> 03:19:57.143]  XM listeners.
[03:19:57.143 --> 03:19:57.644]  You name it.
[03:19:57.644 --> 03:19:59.164]  We'll just do the whole hour overdrive.
[03:19:59.164 --> 03:19:59.565]  Get ready.
[03:20:02.076 --> 03:20:06.620]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:20:06.620 --> 03:20:07.540]  Number 1.
[03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:10.963]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:20:10.963 --> 03:20:11.824]  Number 2.
[03:20:11.824 --> 03:20:16.707]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:20:16.707 --> 03:20:17.448]  It's true.
[03:20:17.448 --> 03:20:22.332]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:20:22.332 --> 03:20:23.152]  Number 3.
[03:20:23.152 --> 03:20:26.735]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:20:26.735 --> 03:20:30.438]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:20:30.638 --> 03:20:31.439]  Number 4.
[03:20:31.439 --> 03:20:34.201]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:20:34.201 --> 03:20:37.884]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:20:37.884 --> 03:20:38.665]  Number 5.
[03:20:38.665 --> 03:20:42.809]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:20:42.809 --> 03:20:47.573]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[03:22:32.468 --> 03:22:37.031]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:37.031 --> 03:22:42.835]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:42.835 --> 03:22:46.477]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[03:24:05.828 --> 03:24:08.129]  Alright, Alex Jones back live here.
[03:24:08.129 --> 03:24:16.733]  We have Stephen L. Anderson, a pastor, and he's one of the very informative people in this amazing film, After the Tribulation, Let No Man Deceive You.
[03:24:16.733 --> 03:24:23.937]  The new film out and available at InfoWarsShop.com or link through at InfoWars.com.
[03:24:23.937 --> 03:24:30.040]  And also the book by Chuck Baldwin and his constitutional lawyer son, Timothy Baldwin, Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission.
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:32.501]  Very important to give to all your preachers out there.
[03:24:32.501 --> 03:24:38.063]  They'll probably curl up like snakes and hiss at you and pull out a pitchfork, but the pun, no, most of them don't know.
[03:24:38.063 --> 03:24:40.043]  It's our job to challenge them.
[03:24:40.043 --> 03:24:41.784]  I'm not on some high horse either here, folks.
[03:24:41.784 --> 03:24:42.965]  It doesn't mean I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[03:24:42.965 --> 03:24:44.985]  It's just that I know right from wrong.
[03:24:44.985 --> 03:24:48.927]  I know deception from the truth, because I have discernment.
[03:24:48.927 --> 03:24:52.228]  I mean, anybody who has discernment would just be freaking out over all this.
[03:24:52.628 --> 03:24:58.594]  Especially when you integrate it with history, and everything else, and what the globalists are doing.
[03:24:58.594 --> 03:25:04.781]  The more I learn about the New World Order, and then the more I go to the Bible, it's like, oh my gosh, I can only now, 38 years old, almost 39, 39 in a couple days,
[03:25:08.224 --> 03:25:09.485]  Actually understand the Bible.
[03:25:09.485 --> 03:25:13.227]  And it's just so deep now, unlike anything I've ever read.
[03:25:13.227 --> 03:25:15.368]  Once you understand that, you know it is inspired.
[03:25:15.368 --> 03:25:16.409]  And it is a warning.
[03:25:16.409 --> 03:25:20.771]  I mean, God wouldn't put us through this to test us if he didn't give us a handbook.
[03:25:20.771 --> 03:25:22.072]  Okay, I'm not trying to preach here.
[03:25:22.072 --> 03:25:28.816]  It's just that you have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing an elite that believe they're being directed by spirits.
[03:25:28.816 --> 03:25:33.579]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the UN has this Luciferian Chapel in New York in it.
[03:25:33.579 --> 03:25:34.239]  It's real.
[03:25:34.239 --> 03:25:37.021]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Ed, Eric, Nick,
[03:25:37.541 --> 03:25:38.781]  Nick and others.
[03:25:38.781 --> 03:25:49.304]  But Sean in Australia, you got us off on this thing about Carol Quigley's book where they admit free peoples have weapons, but we want a technocratic elite with super weapons because we want control.
[03:25:49.304 --> 03:25:50.265]  Yes, amazing.
[03:25:50.265 --> 03:25:57.327]  Here's one of their top statisticians, tacticians admitting this, but it's like admitting the sun came up this morning.
[03:25:57.327 --> 03:26:00.728]  But yes, they want our guns to enslave us, not to keep the children safe.
[03:26:00.728 --> 03:26:01.048]  Go ahead.
[03:26:02.611 --> 03:26:22.689]  Well, you see, this book, Tragedy and Hope, is an informed historical account, but what it lacks is the actual understanding of the proper way to... the proper framework for understanding human history, and that is looking at human history based on its developmental qualitative states.
[03:26:22.689 --> 03:26:25.792]  Now, let me give the readers an example, just based on this
[03:26:26.092 --> 03:26:34.135]  The point is they're saying we have the will to power, we're in charge, that gives us the right to be authoritarian as if some moral authoritarianism.
[03:26:34.135 --> 03:26:35.636]  It never works like that.
[03:26:35.636 --> 03:26:37.296]  It always leads to total rot.
[03:26:37.296 --> 03:26:44.099]  But of course some academic feeling good about himself because he's invited into the upper halls of power is delusional.
[03:26:44.099 --> 03:26:47.000]  This person is not spiritually smart.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:48.361]  I gotta jump to other callers.
[03:26:48.361 --> 03:26:49.921]  Go ahead and finish it up quick because we gotta go.
[03:26:49.921 --> 03:26:52.822]  Let me give the callers a quick example.
[03:26:52.822 --> 03:26:54.603]  Now for example, I'm talking about
[03:26:55.734 --> 03:26:56.075]  I don't know.
[03:27:12.197 --> 03:27:34.712]  Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete, along with his stone castle, by the invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use until 1800, that the minority rule and authoritarian government continued, even though that the government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights to professional pikemen and musketeers.
[03:27:34.712 --> 03:27:37.914]  Now this shift is a qualitative upshift in development.
[03:27:37.914 --> 03:27:41.797]  You see, the new phase of technology, the gunpowder,
[03:27:42.117 --> 03:27:43.338]  No, I agree.
[03:27:43.338 --> 03:27:49.162]  This is all going to leak out everywhere, the bioweapons everywhere, and they're going to kill everybody.
[03:27:49.162 --> 03:27:50.102]  And is that where you're going?
[03:27:50.102 --> 03:27:54.505]  The elite are creating their own destruction by a global arms race?
[03:27:54.505 --> 03:28:00.089]  Where I'm going is that if you look at human history, we see these changes.
[03:28:00.089 --> 03:28:08.554]  Now, the scientists who actually have now taken the overall commanding, the overall directing ideological
[03:28:10.290 --> 03:28:11.852]  Gotta finish up in 30 seconds!
[03:28:11.852 --> 03:28:12.732]  Now I gotta go!
[03:28:28.567 --> 03:28:30.328]  Listen, this is what I do with callers.
[03:28:30.328 --> 03:28:34.171]  I'll let one person on for a long time and then everybody else didn't get on.
[03:28:34.171 --> 03:28:36.713]  Sean, if I wouldn't have gotten to other callers, I never would have gotten to you.
[03:28:36.713 --> 03:28:37.454]  I've got to let you go.
[03:28:37.454 --> 03:28:40.536]  And we've got a long segment coming up here.
[03:28:40.536 --> 03:28:48.101]  And I promise we're going to get to Ed, Eric, Nick, Nick, and that's going to be it for calls, our XM listeners and shortwave listeners and AM and FM listeners.
[03:28:48.101 --> 03:28:53.585]  We're going to get to you, and then we're going to give him some time to finish up some other topics and some other news that I haven't gotten to.
[03:28:53.585 --> 03:28:56.628]  But do you want to comment on where he was going with all that?
[03:28:57.068 --> 03:29:05.172]  Well, I mean, it's really interesting information, and you know, the Bible definitely is very clear that every single person should have a weapon.
[03:29:05.172 --> 03:29:12.716]  You know, all the way back to the book of Deuteronomy, he talks about every single citizen having a weapon and having a paddle on the back of their weapon and so forth.
[03:29:12.716 --> 03:29:13.637]  Because it restrains evil.
[03:29:13.897 --> 03:29:20.225]  And then also even Jesus Christ himself in the Garden of Gethsemane said, hey, if you don't have a sword, you need to sell your coat.
[03:29:20.225 --> 03:29:24.231]  And they try to spin that now and say it was misinterpreted.
[03:29:24.231 --> 03:29:25.833]  He was talking about a literal sword.
[03:29:25.833 --> 03:29:28.817]  They pulled out two literal swords and said, Lord, we have two swords.
[03:29:28.817 --> 03:29:30.359]  And he said, it's enough.
[03:29:30.359 --> 03:29:31.780]  And so the disciples had swords.
[03:29:33.198 --> 03:29:35.600]  Plus, somebody just had their ear chopped off with a sword.
[03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:36.561]  We're talking about swords.
[03:29:36.561 --> 03:29:39.364]  Yeah, Peter pulled out a sword and chopped the ear off.
[03:29:39.364 --> 03:29:41.326]  Don't tell me that was a metaphor for the Bible.
[03:29:41.326 --> 03:29:45.990]  He didn't pull out his Bible and chop that guy's ears off with a paper cut with a Bible.
[03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:48.393]  It was a lateral sword.
[03:29:48.393 --> 03:29:49.373]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:49.373 --> 03:29:51.455]  Stay with us.
[03:29:51.455 --> 03:29:52.837]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.837 --> 03:29:54.438]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.438 --> 03:29:58.062]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:32:01.560 --> 03:32:06.324]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:32:06.324 --> 03:32:08.426]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:32:09.336 --> 03:32:18.300]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:32:18.300 --> 03:32:23.202]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[03:32:23.855 --> 03:32:35.228]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[03:32:35.228 --> 03:32:42.237]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[03:32:42.897 --> 03:32:47.199]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[03:32:47.199 --> 03:32:50.801]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[03:32:50.801 --> 03:32:58.065]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[03:32:58.065 --> 03:32:59.325]  Protect your immune system.
[03:32:59.325 --> 03:33:00.366]  It's the only one you've got.
[03:33:05.819 --> 03:33:11.466]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[03:33:11.466 --> 03:33:16.091]  It came to me when I tried to classify your species.
[03:33:16.091 --> 03:33:19.675]  I realized that you're not actually mammals.
[03:33:21.249 --> 03:33:31.539]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not.
[03:33:31.539 --> 03:33:40.288]  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[03:33:40.288 --> 03:33:45.073]  The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[03:33:50.882 --> 03:33:55.667]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[03:33:55.667 --> 03:33:58.891]  Do you know what it is?
[03:33:58.891 --> 03:34:01.874]  A virus.
[03:34:01.874 --> 03:34:04.157]  Human beings are a disease.
[03:34:04.157 --> 03:34:07.160]  A cancer of this planet.
[03:34:07.160 --> 03:34:08.401]  You are a plague.
[03:34:17.461 --> 03:34:21.562]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:34:21.562 --> 03:34:23.283]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:34:45.330 --> 03:34:54.860]  We had a Obama Joker symbol that went viral all over the world, and I said it was a limited edition t-shirt of it, and we haven't sold it in over a year and a half.
[03:34:54.860 --> 03:34:58.143]  So we've redesigned a new one, because that was limited edition.
[03:34:58.143 --> 03:35:02.488]  Janaye Meadows, our star graphics person, they're all stars, but she's amazing.
[03:35:02.488 --> 03:35:06.412]  She came up with this of a bunch that we did that is my favorite, and it says,
[03:35:07.032 --> 03:35:10.074]  Uh, Tyrant Obama and him as the Joker.
[03:35:10.074 --> 03:35:12.116]  And, uh, Obamanoids will ask you what it means.
[03:35:12.116 --> 03:35:14.218]  Others will, and you can explain what a tyrant is.
[03:35:14.218 --> 03:35:17.260]  And we've taken our most popular t-shirt and put it on the back.
[03:35:17.260 --> 03:35:22.003]  The, uh, come and take it AK-47 with the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:35:22.003 --> 03:35:23.324]  Words inside of it.
[03:35:23.324 --> 03:35:26.166]  This, I believe, is the best t-shirt we've ever come out with.
[03:35:26.166 --> 03:35:30.610]  It is available at InfoWarsShop.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:30.610 --> 03:35:32.451]  Both URLs take you to the same place.
[03:35:32.451 --> 03:35:33.072]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:35:36.417 --> 03:35:41.582]  And your purchase of books and videos and materials funds our entire operation.
[03:35:41.582 --> 03:35:43.944]  And look, I got 50 people here.
[03:35:43.944 --> 03:35:44.244]  51.
[03:35:44.244 --> 03:35:50.570]  I want to hire 5 or 6 more to, quite frankly, do radio news because stations all want it in that first 5-6 minute segment.
[03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:55.515]  We're getting ready to get the show cut down to its official version every day with the nightly news.
[03:35:55.515 --> 03:35:56.576]  It's all happening.
[03:35:57.136 --> 03:36:06.519]  It's all happening, and we just put out 150,000 free bumper stickers in 50 packs with the free shipping to anybody that wanted them at infowarestore.com.
[03:36:06.519 --> 03:36:09.140]  I think all those slots are filled now, 3,000 of them.
[03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:11.500]  I mean, I know it's coming down.
[03:36:11.500 --> 03:36:14.041]  It's in steps downwards.
[03:36:14.041 --> 03:36:17.442]  We've gone into another big step, and now another, and it's going to accelerate.
[03:36:17.442 --> 03:36:18.742]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:36:18.742 --> 03:36:20.383]  So I'm just like, fire everything!
[03:36:21.243 --> 03:36:22.124]  Hit them!
[03:36:22.124 --> 03:36:22.584]  Go!
[03:36:22.584 --> 03:36:23.905]  Boom!
[03:36:23.905 --> 03:36:25.366]  My gut is what I follow.
[03:36:25.366 --> 03:36:25.926]  My spirit.
[03:36:25.926 --> 03:36:27.747]  And it tells me what to do.
[03:36:27.747 --> 03:36:32.590]  Off the intellectual things, but what my gut tells me is also picked up by everything in front of me.
[03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:33.191]  It's amazing.
[03:36:33.191 --> 03:36:36.013]  It knows what's around the corner and then boom, it's there.
[03:36:36.013 --> 03:36:37.894]  And I trust but verify my gut.
[03:36:38.334 --> 03:36:44.917]  This will sell out as well as 30,000 of them available, 70,000 at the streets in key areas in Texas is the InfoWars.
[03:36:44.917 --> 03:36:52.761]  But the tyrants, why the tyrants want the guns, the new magazine, buy them in 10 up to 100 packs at cost or get a subscription.
[03:36:52.761 --> 03:37:01.246]  And everyone that signs up at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter will get a free e-copy where it's color, you can flip it, click on the links.
[03:37:02.127 --> 03:37:02.649]  It's free.
[03:37:02.649 --> 03:37:05.357]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:37:05.357 --> 03:37:08.867]  But you have to sign up to get it and we will send it to you.
[03:37:08.867 --> 03:37:09.509]  And incidentally...
[03:37:10.782 --> 03:37:12.603]  We've got the nightly news for subscribers.
[03:37:12.603 --> 03:37:13.584]  We've got all the films.
[03:37:13.584 --> 03:37:16.106]  We're putting stuff up there in HD now, most of it.
[03:37:16.106 --> 03:37:17.787]  We're putting a lot of old archive stuff.
[03:37:17.787 --> 03:37:20.369]  10 years of PrisonPlanet.tv in April.
[03:37:20.369 --> 03:37:21.069]  17 years on air.
[03:37:21.069 --> 03:37:23.171]  A lot of old stuff we're now putting there.
[03:37:23.171 --> 03:37:25.653]  But the goal is to reach people.
[03:37:25.653 --> 03:37:28.635]  So we're going to start in the next few weeks on a limited basis.
[03:37:28.635 --> 03:37:31.277]  I want to make sure it works well and doesn't bankrupt me.
[03:37:32.346 --> 03:37:37.008]  We're going to have the three-hour radio show in a medium quality, the high quality would be for subscribers.
[03:37:37.008 --> 03:37:38.869]  But the goal is to get the word out to people.
[03:37:38.869 --> 03:37:51.695]  PrisonPlanet.tv, the video feed of the three-hour, today it's a four-hour radio show, that will be fed out to everyone that signs up at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:37:51.695 --> 03:37:53.516]  In a week or two you'll get a link
[03:37:54.076 --> 03:38:00.097]  to the test beta streamed to make sure we can afford it and everything.
[03:38:00.097 --> 03:38:06.399]  And so we're definitely going to test that out over a few months.
[03:38:06.399 --> 03:38:11.880]  So again, I want to encourage everybody to sign up at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:19.562]  Now, I promise to go to your calls and Pastor Steven Anderson is here also in studio with us today.
[03:38:19.562 --> 03:38:19.622]  But
[03:38:21.562 --> 03:38:22.663]  Other points you'd like to add.
[03:38:22.663 --> 03:38:26.707]  You wanted to get into Plato's Republic, which is a key globalist model.
[03:38:26.707 --> 03:38:31.471]  You know, Tarpoli will tell you that that's the model of the oligarchy in the New World Order, Plato's Republic.
[03:38:31.471 --> 03:38:34.414]  We're going to talk about that after we race through calls here.
[03:38:34.414 --> 03:38:40.599]  But it's important to read the globalist intelligentsia's own manuals to not just believe us,
[03:38:41.320 --> 03:38:44.561]  Yes, I heard you describe that you have different products you have for sale just now for a while.
[03:39:09.688 --> 03:39:16.634]  Over the years, I thought that I had something to contribute to your show.
[03:39:16.634 --> 03:39:29.145]  I thought it was the technology that Pat Flanagan has described in the book by Nick Bajik, Towards a New Alchemy, where the neurophone he describes, I believe is miniaturized
[03:39:30.182 --> 03:39:32.685]  Yeah, they're now selling Neurophones.
[03:39:32.685 --> 03:39:34.227]  They've got all sorts of new products.
[03:39:34.227 --> 03:39:40.554]  The new Google Glasses have a Neurophone and broadcast into your skull, into the middle ear.
[03:39:40.554 --> 03:39:42.536]  So that's the big technology they're going for.
[03:39:42.536 --> 03:39:44.018]  Do you have any comments on that?
[03:39:44.018 --> 03:39:48.904]  A Neurophone only receives, it doesn't transmit.
[03:39:49.977 --> 03:39:58.464]  Well, I'm talking about, in fact guys, just type it in right now, Google Glasses broadcast sound directly into the middle ear.
[03:39:58.464 --> 03:40:04.910]  The point is that 15 years ago they had Coke machines in Japan that project at you, nobody else can hear it, and it goes through to the skull.
[03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:11.936]  Alright, I appreciate your call, I'm not sure we're talking about NeuroPhone, write me a letter, okay, about that.
[03:40:11.936 --> 03:40:16.320]  Let's go to Eric in Wyoming, then we're going to go to Nick listening on XM.
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:17.581]  Eric in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[03:40:18.571 --> 03:40:20.033]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[03:40:20.033 --> 03:40:20.894]  My name's Eric Miller.
[03:40:20.894 --> 03:40:23.256]  I'm not hiding my identity.
[03:40:23.256 --> 03:40:25.939]  We had an incident here at 1006 Plum Street.
[03:40:25.939 --> 03:40:28.141]  Hold on, hold on, sir, sir.
[03:40:28.141 --> 03:40:29.582]  Let me put you on hold.
[03:40:29.582 --> 03:40:32.565]  We don't like people, and nobody does this at Talk Radio.
[03:40:32.565 --> 03:40:33.987]  Sometimes, you know, we get a lot of great calls.
[03:40:33.987 --> 03:40:39.532]  Sometimes we get calls that are interesting, but they're all over the map, especially when I go into a fourth hour and people have been holding.
[03:40:39.532 --> 03:40:39.793]  Listen.
[03:40:41.004 --> 03:40:44.186]  You call in, you could be saying somebody else's name.
[03:40:44.186 --> 03:40:45.447]  I don't think you're a liar.
[03:40:45.447 --> 03:40:47.028]  You sound like a reasonable guy.
[03:40:47.028 --> 03:40:52.412]  But other people can spoof and call in and say, I'm this person at this address, this is happening.
[03:40:52.412 --> 03:40:55.995]  And then we can get in trouble for letting that information go out.
[03:40:55.995 --> 03:40:58.216]  You understand that's a dirty trick people do?
[03:40:58.216 --> 03:41:01.118]  So that's why we don't like people giving out their last name.
[03:41:01.118 --> 03:41:04.461]  Now they're a public figure and they call in and we think we recognize their voice.
[03:41:04.461 --> 03:41:07.102]  We put them on hold, call them back, verify who they are.
[03:41:07.102 --> 03:41:08.784]  Okay, now I'm not saying you're doing this.
[03:41:09.404 --> 03:41:10.765]  But just tell us about the incident.
[03:41:10.765 --> 03:41:12.046]  What happened to you?
[03:41:12.046 --> 03:41:13.226]  We got smart meters.
[03:41:13.226 --> 03:41:17.569]  We have Agenda 21 in the capital state, the capital city of Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[03:41:17.569 --> 03:41:18.489]  We got smart meters.
[03:41:18.489 --> 03:41:20.170]  We have Agenda 21.
[03:41:20.170 --> 03:41:22.631]  We have international building codes.
[03:41:22.631 --> 03:41:29.135]  And we were forced, alright, by three Cheyenne light fuel and power workers and a deputy
[03:41:29.642 --> 03:41:30.603]  Well, I was away.
[03:41:30.603 --> 03:41:33.886]  They came and threatened my wife.
[03:41:33.886 --> 03:41:39.652]  Yeah, they put the eavesdropping that dials into all your electronics on record and is going to, quote, control your temperature.
[03:41:39.652 --> 03:41:41.654]  They put the little, that's a little robot.
[03:41:41.654 --> 03:41:42.695]  It's a drone.
[03:41:42.695 --> 03:41:46.019]  It's a, they admit they're going to robots.
[03:41:46.019 --> 03:41:46.900]  It just hit me.
[03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:51.544]  The smart meter is a little robot that's plugged into the side of your house spying on you.
[03:41:51.544 --> 03:41:52.626]  It's a robot spy.
[03:41:53.266 --> 03:42:01.491]  Okay, what happens is, we're seeing the videos of the police coming with the smart meters, and some are saying, we don't care if you even turn your power off, you're going to have it, slave.
[03:42:01.491 --> 03:42:02.712]  Go ahead.
[03:42:02.712 --> 03:42:07.015]  Yeah, so anyway, they forced their way, and I refer to them as the four cowards.
[03:42:07.015 --> 03:42:11.658]  While I was away from home, they came and intimidated my wife, or else.
[03:42:11.658 --> 03:42:12.438]  Alright?
[03:42:12.438 --> 03:42:21.004]  Now, no man wants to come home and see his wife staring out the kitchen window, in tears, and wondering what happened, just happened.
[03:42:21.795 --> 03:42:23.476]  Now, we got our smart meter.
[03:42:23.476 --> 03:42:28.277]  They also put a lock on it, which they took off later on, and two tags.
[03:42:28.277 --> 03:42:29.658]  A tag for the lock.
[03:42:29.658 --> 03:42:33.319]  In other words, they were trying to demonize us for standing up.
[03:42:33.319 --> 03:42:33.899]  No, I know.
[03:42:33.899 --> 03:42:34.880]  Oh, it's so weird.
[03:42:34.880 --> 03:42:37.361]  You don't want a smart meter admitted to rip you off.
[03:42:37.361 --> 03:42:38.161]  It's on record.
[03:42:38.161 --> 03:42:39.521]  They use them to rip people off.
[03:42:39.521 --> 03:42:41.742]  That's San Francisco Chronicle, you name it.
[03:42:41.742 --> 03:42:46.024]  Oh, it dials into all new appliances, have digital wireless and your TV.
[03:42:46.024 --> 03:42:48.985]  This dials into and it's all these health issues.
[03:42:48.985 --> 03:42:49.745]  You're weird.
[03:42:50.225 --> 03:42:51.786]  You care what we're putting on your house?
[03:42:51.786 --> 03:42:52.847]  You're weird!
[03:42:52.847 --> 03:42:55.008]  It's weird to care about anything!
[03:42:55.008 --> 03:43:04.494]  Oh, you don't like the army checkpoints on your highways, and drills in every major city, and TSA, two miles from here, TSA runs checkpoints on the road now.
[03:43:04.494 --> 03:43:05.635]  Ah, but that's no big deal!
[03:43:05.635 --> 03:43:07.836]  That's freedom, Pastor Anderson!
[03:43:07.836 --> 03:43:08.917]  So, how did this end, sir?
[03:43:09.775 --> 03:43:15.718]  Well, this ended with them forcing their way into my home and putting in the smart meter.
[03:43:15.718 --> 03:43:17.279]  Oh, into the home?
[03:43:17.279 --> 03:43:25.363]  Oh yeah, well, they had to go to my home to get to my backyard because we have a fence that has a high privacy fence that's over six feet.
[03:43:25.363 --> 03:43:27.164]  Excuse me, this is a major felony.
[03:43:27.164 --> 03:43:32.046]  You've got to file suit on them, official oppression, civil rights violations.
[03:43:32.046 --> 03:43:34.047]  Just sue them, okay?
[03:43:34.047 --> 03:43:34.287]  And sir,
[03:43:37.759 --> 03:43:39.159]  You know what, I can tell you're a real guy.
[03:43:39.159 --> 03:43:46.481]  You want to give out your name and info for any constitutional lawyers that want to stand up for you and your family in the state of Washington?
[03:43:46.481 --> 03:43:47.441]  Yes.
[03:43:47.441 --> 03:43:49.061]  In Wyoming we're in.
[03:43:49.061 --> 03:43:51.822]  In the state of Wyoming.
[03:43:51.822 --> 03:43:55.143]  Post-conservative state, and Cheyenne is the capital.
[03:43:55.143 --> 03:43:57.303]  I know, but this is happening to everybody right now.
[03:43:57.303 --> 03:43:59.784]  So they forced their way into the House?
[03:43:59.784 --> 03:44:01.084]  Well, they said, or else.
[03:44:01.084 --> 03:44:03.144]  I got the phone call while I was up at the farm.
[03:44:03.144 --> 03:44:03.925]  Or else.
[03:44:03.925 --> 03:44:04.765]  Or else.
[03:44:04.765 --> 03:44:05.445]  That's free country.
[03:44:06.628 --> 03:44:09.129]  You know what the answer is?
[03:44:09.129 --> 03:44:10.269]  Go dark.
[03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:15.730]  You tell them you come remove it, you send them a cease and desist because courts like that, then you sue them when they don't remove it.
[03:44:15.730 --> 03:44:16.750]  Go dark.
[03:44:16.750 --> 03:44:18.271]  Make a stand in the local news.
[03:44:18.271 --> 03:44:19.731]  Make a big issue out of it.
[03:44:19.731 --> 03:44:21.311]  Believe me, you're the new Rosa Parks.
[03:44:21.311 --> 03:44:22.952]  This is the new civil rights issue.
[03:44:22.952 --> 03:44:25.152]  They want us fighting over race and all this stuff.
[03:44:25.152 --> 03:44:26.292]  This is what's happening.
[03:44:26.292 --> 03:44:31.294]  Okay, how do people, do you have an email address or something so lawyers can help you in Wyoming?
[03:44:31.294 --> 03:44:32.234]  Yes, I do.
[03:44:32.234 --> 03:44:32.674]  Give it to us.
[03:44:33.522 --> 03:44:33.762]  All right.
[03:44:52.419 --> 03:44:53.200]  Ken Lay.
[03:44:53.200 --> 03:44:54.440]  I'm so tired.
[03:44:54.440 --> 03:44:55.141]  Enron.
[03:44:55.141 --> 03:44:57.802]  Enron developed this in the mid-90s as a scam.
[03:44:57.802 --> 03:44:59.603]  They're convicted of scamming.
[03:44:59.603 --> 03:45:02.865]  And they can control the prices, manipulate, gouge, and spy.
[03:45:02.865 --> 03:45:05.426]  This is all their smart growth plan.
[03:45:05.426 --> 03:45:08.328]  And so you just get that together, you fight it in your local community.
[03:45:08.328 --> 03:45:11.209]  Everybody has to fight this because it's diabolical.
[03:45:11.209 --> 03:45:12.530]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[03:45:13.010 --> 03:45:17.634]  They're also using the smart meters that are up on poles that dial into your smart meter.
[03:45:17.634 --> 03:45:21.638]  Those are hacking in, just like Google's been caught doing with their cars.
[03:45:21.638 --> 03:45:23.300]  Pastor Anderson, comments on what he was saying?
[03:45:24.585 --> 03:45:28.906]  Well, you know, unfortunately, I think I might have a smart meter at my house already.
[03:45:28.906 --> 03:45:29.567]  No, no, that's what they do.
[03:45:29.567 --> 03:45:32.427]  They just show up, they come across your yard, they put it on.
[03:45:32.427 --> 03:45:34.448]  Yeah, they never even asked me about it.
[03:45:34.448 --> 03:45:38.289]  It's just something that I think has just been installed a long time ago, and there it is.
[03:45:38.289 --> 03:45:47.272]  I don't really, you know, I think I need... And then what they do is they charge you more when they feel like it, they track everything you're doing, and they grab all your wireless data, and they hack your computers.
[03:45:47.272 --> 03:45:49.392]  Well, I already know that I've been under surveillance.
[03:45:49.392 --> 03:45:52.553]  No, I know, but the point is, is that it's this total grid.
[03:45:52.553 --> 03:45:53.134]  Right.
[03:45:53.134 --> 03:45:54.174]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:45:54.778 --> 03:45:56.499]  And I mean, it has to be that way.
[03:45:56.499 --> 03:46:00.462]  You know, it's like the Bible says, all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[03:46:00.462 --> 03:46:02.463]  You know, it has to be in place.
[03:46:02.463 --> 03:46:06.626]  The control grid has to be in place in order to give the man all the power.
[03:46:06.626 --> 03:46:08.488]  But we have to resist it.
[03:46:08.488 --> 03:46:09.308]  Absolutely.
[03:46:09.308 --> 03:46:09.809]  Of course we can.
[03:46:09.809 --> 03:46:13.211]  I mean, folks, if you won't resist now, you're not going to resist when they've got a gun to your head.
[03:46:13.471 --> 03:46:22.495]  The Bible verse I quoted earlier says, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[03:46:22.495 --> 03:46:26.296]  So it's saying we do wrestle against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[03:46:26.296 --> 03:46:30.238]  We do wrestle against spiritual wickedness and hypocrisy.
[03:46:30.238 --> 03:46:33.579]  But wait, they twist Romans 13 to say that we should have submitted to Hitler.
[03:46:33.579 --> 03:46:36.100]  You know, they now teach Hitler was of the Lord.
[03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:41.966]  Well, you know, you can take little tiny bits and pieces of the Bible and twist them to say whatever you want.
[03:46:41.966 --> 03:46:46.832]  But earlier in the chapter it's all about resisting tyranny and people are being arrested for not following orders.
[03:46:46.832 --> 03:46:52.138]  Not only that, Romans 13 is really clear about what the purpose of government is.
[03:46:52.138 --> 03:46:53.580]  The only purpose of government.
[03:46:53.880 --> 03:46:56.142]  Which is the punishment of evil doers.
[03:46:56.142 --> 03:47:00.045]  Evil doer meaning someone... Evil in the Bible means harming someone else.
[03:47:00.045 --> 03:47:04.008]  So it's to punish people... It's the libertarian... Exactly.
[03:47:04.008 --> 03:47:04.889]  Exactly right.
[03:47:04.889 --> 03:47:08.091]  And so God never gave... No initiation of force.
[03:47:08.091 --> 03:47:08.532]  Exactly.
[03:47:08.532 --> 03:47:14.036]  And so God never gave the government the authority to regulate our lives.
[03:47:14.036 --> 03:47:17.278]  But maybe Romans 13 and what do these mainline preachers say?
[03:47:17.278 --> 03:47:19.439]  Maybe the US Senator caught with all these little kids.
[03:47:19.439 --> 03:47:20.800]  Maybe he's the government.
[03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:22.861]  I mean, I don't agree with that, but I'm a devil.
[03:47:22.861 --> 03:47:26.283]  See, I don't think that Senators should be having sex with little kids.
[03:47:26.283 --> 03:47:28.725]  I am now violating Romans 13.
[03:47:28.725 --> 03:47:38.151]  Well, they try to claim that basically every single governor or government official is ordained by God, when what he's saying is that he ordained human government in general.
[03:47:38.911 --> 03:47:47.482]  The Bible is teaching that God ordained, you know, parents to have authority over their children, and he ordained human government to be there to punish the evildoer.
[03:47:47.482 --> 03:47:49.444]  You know, thieves, rapists, murderers.
[03:47:49.444 --> 03:47:52.048]  But when it's an evil government, we have a duty to overthrow it.
[03:47:53.596 --> 03:47:54.657]  Absolutely.
[03:47:54.657 --> 03:47:55.598]  But, I mean, wait a minute.
[03:47:55.598 --> 03:47:56.699]  That's of the devil.
[03:47:56.699 --> 03:48:01.324]  I mean, Dominican prostitutes, says Senator Bob Menendez, likes the youngest and newest girls.
[03:48:01.324 --> 03:48:02.445]  I mean, he's a senator.
[03:48:02.445 --> 03:48:04.267]  I mean, maybe he's God.
[03:48:04.267 --> 03:48:05.988]  I mean, they already say Congress is above the law.
[03:48:05.988 --> 03:48:12.555]  According to a lot of these pastors, you know, that guy, you know, we need to submit to him and love him and pray for him and think he's wonderful.
[03:48:12.555 --> 03:48:13.556]  And bring him children.
[03:48:13.556 --> 03:48:14.877]  If you read the book of Judges,
[03:48:15.698 --> 03:48:24.975]  All throughout the book of Judges, there are all kinds of oppressive governments coming in, taking away the freedom, and then men like Gideon and men like Samson are standing up to them.
[03:48:24.975 --> 03:48:25.916]  Well, they were of the devil!
[03:48:25.916 --> 03:48:27.319]  No, no, no, no, they were devils.
[03:48:27.319 --> 03:48:28.240]  Samson was of the devil.
[03:48:29.537 --> 03:48:30.697]  Delilah was good.
[03:48:30.697 --> 03:48:31.998]  She did what the government said.
[03:48:31.998 --> 03:48:33.598]  Samson was bad.
[03:48:33.598 --> 03:48:33.978]  Right.
[03:48:33.978 --> 03:48:34.419]  And you know what?
[03:48:34.419 --> 03:48:38.820]  They were coming to Samson saying, look... The Pharisees were good and you know who else was bad.
[03:48:38.820 --> 03:48:39.480]  And you know what?
[03:48:39.480 --> 03:48:40.820]  They came to Samson.
[03:48:40.820 --> 03:48:44.882]  The Israelites came to Samson and said, listen Samson, you need to understand.
[03:48:44.882 --> 03:48:46.342]  These people rule over us.
[03:48:46.342 --> 03:48:48.063]  The Philistines rule over us.
[03:48:48.063 --> 03:48:49.183]  They're the government.
[03:48:49.183 --> 03:48:50.683]  You need to obey the government.
[03:48:50.683 --> 03:48:52.504]  And they're rebuking Samson.
[03:48:52.504 --> 03:48:55.125]  But the Bible says that Samson was filled with the Spirit of God.
[03:48:55.874 --> 03:48:56.995]  And Samson brought freedom.
[03:49:13.649 --> 03:49:17.692]  But the Israelites are constantly telling Samson, you need to just shut up and do what you're told.
[03:49:17.692 --> 03:49:18.693]  These are our leaders.
[03:49:18.693 --> 03:49:19.934]  These are our rulers.
[03:49:19.934 --> 03:49:22.656]  And God's spirit was leading Samson to fight against the fleas.
[03:49:22.656 --> 03:49:26.159]  It's the same thing in Ezekiel where he says, God, they're going to kill me.
[03:49:26.159 --> 03:49:27.480]  I keep speaking out, but I can't help it.
[03:49:27.480 --> 03:49:28.621]  It's burning in my bones.
[03:49:28.621 --> 03:49:29.161]  Right.
[03:49:29.161 --> 03:49:29.561]  Exactly.
[03:49:29.561 --> 03:49:30.402]  Jeremiah, actually.
[03:49:30.402 --> 03:49:30.862]  Yep.
[03:49:30.862 --> 03:49:31.643]  Exactly.
[03:49:31.643 --> 03:49:31.823]  Yeah.
[03:49:31.823 --> 03:49:35.106]  Jeremiah, you know, he finally... But I mean, I think that's in Ezekiel.
[03:49:36.447 --> 03:49:37.148]  It's in Jeremiah.
[03:49:37.148 --> 03:49:42.653]  But Jeremiah basically got frustrated with preaching and finally just said, I quit.
[03:49:42.653 --> 03:49:43.153]  That's it.
[03:49:43.153 --> 03:49:44.955]  And everybody was telling him to quit.
[03:49:44.955 --> 03:49:50.521]  But then he said that the word of God was like a fire burning in his bones and he could not stop preaching.
[03:49:51.690 --> 03:49:52.151]  I believe you.
[03:49:52.151 --> 03:49:55.214]  That's the kind of preachers we need today.
[03:49:55.214 --> 03:49:57.216]  We don't need... That's Jeremiah!
[03:49:57.216 --> 03:49:58.818]  Yeah, Jeremiah 20, verse 9.
[03:49:58.818 --> 03:50:08.729]  We don't need these milquetoast preachers that are, you know, prostitutes of propaganda of the federal government, lying to people.
[03:50:08.729 --> 03:50:11.211]  We need people to preach the actual Bible stories
[03:50:12.272 --> 03:50:16.654]  And to take stands, even that are unpopular, and to preach the truth today.
[03:50:16.654 --> 03:50:23.877]  Because I tell you... I just... It's the pastors that are leading... I just can't believe most people submit to evil just because they don't want to be looked at bad by the world.
[03:50:23.877 --> 03:50:26.038]  I mean, who cares what a bunch of idiots think about you?
[03:50:26.038 --> 03:50:27.779]  Well, they crucified Jesus.
[03:50:27.779 --> 03:50:29.319]  They killed all the prophets.
[03:50:29.319 --> 03:50:32.141]  And you know, the thing about this movie after the Tribulation is...
[03:50:33.061 --> 03:50:35.322]  Every Christian who's watching it is convinced.
[03:50:35.322 --> 03:50:36.182]  It's so clear.
[03:50:36.182 --> 03:50:39.184]  But when you show it to pastors, they're scared of it.
[03:50:39.184 --> 03:50:40.064]  They don't want to accept it.
[03:50:40.064 --> 03:50:47.187]  Because they want their comfortable Cadillac and going to the cafeteria with a little... And they'll lose it if they take a stand on this.
[03:50:47.187 --> 03:50:49.988]  Because the Preacher Bratcher is the popular doctrine.
[03:50:49.988 --> 03:50:53.610]  Well, what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[03:50:53.610 --> 03:50:54.110]  Exactly.
[03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:56.771]  We'll be back with some more calls.
[03:50:56.771 --> 03:50:58.512]  Nick and Nick lined up next.
[03:50:58.512 --> 03:50:58.952]  Stay with us.
[03:51:02.403 --> 03:51:03.825]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:51:03.825 --> 03:51:14.479]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:51:14.479 --> 03:51:18.585]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:51:18.925 --> 03:51:21.666]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:51:21.666 --> 03:51:32.952]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:51:32.952 --> 03:51:36.114]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:51:36.434 --> 03:51:42.580]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:51:42.580 --> 03:51:52.468]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:51:52.468 --> 03:51:53.970]  The war is here.
[03:51:53.970 --> 03:51:55.892]  It's an info war.
[03:51:55.892 --> 03:51:58.434]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:52:06.403 --> 03:52:11.247]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[03:52:11.247 --> 03:52:13.329]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[03:52:13.329 --> 03:52:15.210]  Police call it robbery.
[03:52:15.210 --> 03:52:17.112]  We call it avoidable.
[03:52:17.112 --> 03:52:23.137]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[03:52:23.137 --> 03:52:28.421]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[03:52:28.421 --> 03:52:34.446]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[03:52:35.567 --> 03:52:40.750]  At only $34.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans.
[03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:43.371]  And it's perfect if you're traveling or away from home.

[03:54:16.492 --> 03:54:21.739]  We're gonna go to Nick in California listening on XM 166 and one more Nick and we're out of time.
[03:54:21.739 --> 03:54:26.765]  Pastor Anderson, you've been wanting to talk about Piers Morgan since you got here and your take on that.
[03:54:26.765 --> 03:54:28.267]  You have a Bible scripture about that event.
[03:54:28.942 --> 03:54:38.685]  Right, so somebody sent me a link to your video of Piers Morgan, and I just wanted to say that I loved it, because I know you were getting a lot of criticism, people saying you shouldn't have gotten angry.
[03:54:38.685 --> 03:54:40.626]  It was about 10%.
[03:54:40.626 --> 03:54:47.128]  But let me tell you something, you know, we ought to get mad about evil, and that's righteous indignation.
[03:54:47.128 --> 03:54:49.049]  Jesus flipped over the tables.
[03:54:49.049 --> 03:54:53.150]  I mean, yeah, we ought not get mad because of something small that, you know, our wife
[03:54:53.850 --> 03:54:56.652]  Conscious evil needs to be dealt with.
[03:54:56.652 --> 03:54:57.492]  Read that verse.
[03:54:57.492 --> 03:55:00.494]  So I found this verse for you, Ecclesiastes 7.7.
[03:55:00.494 --> 03:55:06.197]  It says, Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart.
[03:55:06.197 --> 03:55:11.920]  So the Bible says there that oppression makes a wise man mad, and so it ought to make you mad.
[03:55:11.940 --> 03:55:17.969]  Well the media, the staff tried to spin it like, oh it was a defeat, Alex got mad, but they don't have me back on.
[03:55:17.969 --> 03:55:23.316]  They were scared, they were upset, they were shaking, they were crying, the head producer.
[03:55:23.316 --> 03:55:26.841]  They know that they want to keep us in a calm coma.
[03:55:26.841 --> 03:55:27.923]  They don't want us getting
[03:55:28.363 --> 03:55:28.823]  Angry.
[03:55:28.823 --> 03:55:32.486]  Well, people get mad when preachers get mad and start yelling about sin.
[03:55:32.486 --> 03:55:37.289]  Every preacher in the Bible yelled and raised his voice and got mad and beat the pulpit.
[03:55:37.289 --> 03:55:39.090]  That's the way the preachers in the Bible were.
[03:55:39.090 --> 03:55:40.631]  Jesus was that way.
[03:55:40.631 --> 03:55:42.352]  All of them.
[03:55:42.352 --> 03:55:44.093]  Well, Jesus beat them with a whip.
[03:55:44.093 --> 03:55:46.795]  Yeah, he chased them out of the temple with a whip, flipped over the tables.
[03:55:46.795 --> 03:55:48.857]  But, you know, every hair-legged man that I know
[03:55:49.637 --> 03:55:51.199]  said that he loved that interview.
[03:55:51.199 --> 03:55:53.701]  And he loved to see somebody just take it to him.
[03:55:53.701 --> 03:55:55.783]  Just, just, you know, get mad.
[03:55:55.783 --> 03:55:59.547]  And I mean, look, you were face to face with the enemy right there.
[03:55:59.547 --> 03:56:01.188]  Oh, you should have seen it.
[03:56:01.188 --> 03:56:03.430]  And you know, how can you not be angry?
[03:56:03.430 --> 03:56:06.133]  The thing is, I'm real and he made me mad.
[03:56:06.133 --> 03:56:07.554]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick.
[03:56:07.554 --> 03:56:08.855]  Yeah, listening on XM.
[03:56:08.855 --> 03:56:10.117]  Nick in California.
[03:56:10.117 --> 03:56:10.897]  You're on the air, Nick.
[03:56:10.897 --> 03:56:11.258]  Go ahead.
[03:56:13.119 --> 03:56:34.155]  I'm calling about, we're talking about religion and believing in God and everything and I've been praying a lot lately and I just wanted to bring this to your attention that maybe we could start a third party with you and your camp and going back to his camp because you both believe, you both are, just listen, you both are against abortion, you both are against Agenda 21, you both believe in God, you both defend the Constitution,
[03:56:34.575 --> 03:56:49.993]  Listen, Glenn Beck does a lot of really good work and he's gotten better over the years but he's done dirty tricks to us and I mean I'm saying he he is he's got some serious issues and he's always trying to paint it like I'm doing bad things to people.
[03:56:50.413 --> 03:56:54.715]  And look, I don't even attack Rush Limbaugh or people like Michael Savage or Sean Hannity.
[03:56:54.715 --> 03:56:56.355]  I don't attack my, quote, competition.
[03:56:56.355 --> 03:56:58.056]  Because I'm not in competition with them.
[03:56:58.056 --> 03:57:00.057]  I could care less about being a big shot.
[03:57:00.057 --> 03:57:01.057]  I want to fight tyranny.
[03:57:01.057 --> 03:57:02.317]  I'm risking my life.
[03:57:02.317 --> 03:57:06.839]  And I wish Glenn would stop taking things out of context or twisting things.
[03:57:06.839 --> 03:57:08.980]  And I'm glad he's been going in the right direction a lot.
[03:57:10.121 --> 03:57:12.403]  And you want to say something, Pastor Anderson?
[03:57:12.403 --> 03:57:14.045]  I don't like Glenn Beck at all.
[03:57:14.045 --> 03:57:15.526]  And I do like you, Alex.
[03:57:15.526 --> 03:57:20.852]  But to me, Glenn Beck is just too much of a neocon Republican type.
[03:57:20.852 --> 03:57:22.393]  He's been getting better, though.
[03:57:22.393 --> 03:57:22.974]  Has he?
[03:57:22.974 --> 03:57:26.157]  Well, I quit listening to him, so I'm not seeing him getting better.
[03:57:26.157 --> 03:57:29.641]  Well, I think a lot of that's just like gun owners of America against the NRA, to be honest.
[03:57:29.641 --> 03:57:30.382]  That's what we're doing.
[03:57:30.822 --> 03:57:34.023]  I mean, I hear stuff out of Limbaugh, him, it's directly what I say.
[03:57:34.023 --> 03:57:38.984]  And that's good, my greatest... I really feel good when they rip me off, but they twist it so I don't like that.
[03:57:38.984 --> 03:57:40.544]  Because, wow, I'm getting a bigger megaphone.
[03:57:40.544 --> 03:57:42.425]  I mean, that's me on the air now.
[03:57:42.425 --> 03:57:43.205]  All those places.
[03:57:43.205 --> 03:57:46.806]  I mean, that's really good, because I know we're forcing this stuff out there.
[03:57:46.806 --> 03:57:52.487]  Well, it seemed like Glenn Beck was just trying to promote his fellow Mormon, Mitt Romney.
[03:57:52.487 --> 03:57:58.228]  Well, he came out and attacked me when I went on Piers Morgan and said I was working with him to discredit people.
[03:57:58.328 --> 03:58:01.109]  Or what about in Police State Part 4?
[03:58:01.109 --> 03:58:06.009]  He says there's no FEMA camps, there's no army plans, it's all documented, he says there isn't.
[03:58:06.009 --> 03:58:08.970]  Well, does Glenn Beck stand for 9-11 truth?
[03:58:08.970 --> 03:58:12.551]  Oh, he says Ron Paul supporters should have the army used against them.
[03:58:12.551 --> 03:58:18.812]  Well, if he's not standing for 9-11 truth, then he's not standing for much as far as a political talk show.
[03:58:18.812 --> 03:58:20.712]  Listen folks, we're out of time here.
[03:58:20.712 --> 03:58:21.492]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:58:21.492 --> 03:58:22.793]  I wanted to go to Nick in Pennsylvania.
[03:58:22.793 --> 03:58:24.413]  Last words from Nick in Pennsylvania.
[03:58:24.413 --> 03:58:24.753]  30 seconds.
[03:58:25.433 --> 03:58:26.373]  Take us out.
[03:58:26.373 --> 03:58:27.174]  Nick, Nick!
[03:58:27.174 --> 03:58:31.636]  Okay, Alex, I just wanted to say to you, God bless you.
[03:58:31.636 --> 03:58:35.197]  God bless Pastor Anderson.
[03:58:35.197 --> 03:58:38.779]  You, like Elvis, are a living legend.
[03:58:38.779 --> 03:58:39.679]  No, no, you are.
[03:58:39.679 --> 03:58:42.800]  See you this Sunday, 4 to 6 Central.
[03:58:42.800 --> 03:58:46.062]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
