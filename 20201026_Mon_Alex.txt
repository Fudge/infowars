[00:00.000 --> 00:15.400]  President Trump leveled with the American people yesterday, so did the Chief of Staff.
[00:15.400 --> 00:18.440]  There is no way to contain the COVID-19 virus.
[00:18.440 --> 00:20.740]  It is a cold virus.
[00:20.740 --> 00:22.500]  There is no cure.
[00:22.500 --> 00:27.440]  But of course, there are treatments and yes, there are preventatives, vitamin C, D, zinc
[00:27.440 --> 00:32.000]  and other compounds that are vital that your body absolutely must have to live.
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.880]  But CNN, MSNBC, ABC all said that he is capitulating and he's running up the white flag that he's
[00:37.880 --> 00:43.480]  surrendering the headline shot it out at CNN because he's not going on with Bill Gates
[00:43.480 --> 00:49.000]  fouching the UN with their stated goal of eradicating it where not one person on earth
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.920]  ever has COVID-19.
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.280]  So they've released a synthetic genetically engineered cold virus that has incredible
[00:55.280 --> 00:56.280]  gain of function.
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.640]  It does spread very well, but it only kills people that are extremely ill, who have comorbidities,
[01:01.640 --> 01:07.280]  things like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, normally overweight and extremely old who
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.600]  do not have enough again of the critical vital essential nutrients.
[01:12.600 --> 01:15.440]  And so Trump is really taken the bull by the horns.
[01:15.440 --> 01:16.680]  He's tried to end the lockdown.
[01:16.680 --> 01:18.600]  He tried to end the hysteria.
[01:18.600 --> 01:23.920]  He's tried to pacify members of the public that are still in a hysteria like chicken little.
[01:23.920 --> 01:27.320]  But we have to reach out to these people and explain to them the real statistics and the
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.080]  numbers and explain to them that masks are a symbol of their slavery and now the UN is
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.080]  coming out.
[01:33.080 --> 01:36.960]  And so is Fauci and saying, we're not just going to stay shut down for 10 years.
[01:36.960 --> 01:38.920]  Bill Gates said 10 years two weeks ago.
[01:38.920 --> 01:40.840]  Now it's forever.
[01:40.840 --> 01:46.520]  Those articles are all up at infowars.com and newswars.com because it's the medical system
[01:46.520 --> 01:53.160]  globally seizing power, creating a problem to which there will never be a solution.
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.960]  They're saying we can never have people die of the cold again.
[01:55.960 --> 01:57.280]  I predicted this eight months ago.
[01:57.280 --> 01:59.880]  Now they're saying, well, they got a lockdown for the flu too.
[01:59.880 --> 02:01.680]  It kills just as many.
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.200]  So you see, they're now saying that basically until there's a cure for something that they'll
[02:07.200 --> 02:12.080]  never be able to do, we can't leave our houses without special passes and authorization from
[02:12.080 --> 02:15.760]  them because powerful elites throughout history always follow the same patterns once they
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.760]  become corrupt.
[02:16.760 --> 02:21.280]  They want the power to lock down the general public and have control because even with
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.600]  all their wealth, they still don't feel superior to the general public.
[02:26.600 --> 02:27.600]  They're very, very envious.
[02:27.600 --> 02:30.680]  So they want to exercise that raw power.
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.680]  It's about global government.
[02:31.680 --> 02:32.680]  It's about global tracking.
[02:32.680 --> 02:34.160]  It's about cashless society.
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.880]  It's about the great reset and it's about surveilling everything you do while at the
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.040]  same time starving the third world in mass.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.400]  This is really a good thing that Trump is doing.
[02:45.400 --> 02:48.000]  He's coming out and saying the lockdown has already starved millions worldwide, which
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  is true.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.760]  He's coming out exposing the entire false globalist paradigm and taking it on head-on.
[02:54.760 --> 02:55.760]  This is what must happen.
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.520]  That's why he said, oh, we'll have a vaccine soon because Gates wanted to keep his clothes
[02:59.520 --> 03:03.920]  for, quote, two years until he got a vaccine because he knows that for two years you'll
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.880]  be totally habituated and trained to wear the mask, to be contact traced, and to have
[03:08.880 --> 03:10.520]  all the apps on your phone.
[03:10.520 --> 03:13.480]  And then big brother, the social credit score is in total control.
[03:13.480 --> 03:16.920]  So with seven days out from the election, Trump has knocked it out of the park once
[03:16.920 --> 03:21.200]  again and his leadership is critical, so pray for him and spread the science and the facts
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.200]  to everyone you know about this reality and don't let big tech censor you because the
[03:25.200 --> 03:27.440]  truth will set us free.
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.800]  Back to Owen Shroyer in the live broadcast, I'm Alex Jones, saluting you all.
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.440]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the Infowars World Headquarters here in
[03:37.440 --> 03:43.080]  Austin, Texas and sitting in the chair for Alex Jones today.
[03:43.080 --> 03:45.080]  I'm Owen Shroyer.
[03:45.080 --> 03:47.800]  Gerald Salenty is going to be joining us to host the fourth hour.
[03:47.800 --> 03:54.200]  I'll be back then hosting the War Room and Harrison Smith hosting the 2020 election countdown
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.720]  that airs weeknights from 7 to 9 p.m.
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.840]  Busy busy days here at the Infowars World Headquarters.
[04:02.840 --> 04:07.560]  No days off for this crew, long days, but we're in it to win it, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:07.560 --> 04:13.160]  just like President Trump, who is live right now in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
[04:13.160 --> 04:16.640]  It's been an incredible rally.
[04:16.640 --> 04:19.280]  One of the most excited crowds we've ever seen.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.000]  I mean, loud, rambunctious, I mean, screaming.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.040]  President Trump sometimes just like steps away from the podium, just like, all right,
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.240]  like you're shouting, you're screaming, let's have a good time.
[04:27.240 --> 04:28.800]  So we'll have some of that.
[04:28.800 --> 04:33.480]  We'll have more from Alex Jones and of course the latest breaking political developments
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.320]  and the latest breaking on the COVID hoax.
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.920]  America's waking up to it, though.
[04:38.920 --> 04:46.040]  That's the good news, and a landslide for President Trump is inevitable, except for
[04:46.040 --> 04:52.440]  only one thing, and that's the Democrat election steal that they're engaged in massively right
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.440]  now in Pennsylvania.
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.840]  But President Trump even called that out at his rally today.
[04:58.840 --> 05:01.240]  I admire President Trump.
[05:01.240 --> 05:06.720]  He's really proven himself to be unmatched, his wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.040]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[05:10.040 --> 05:11.040]  He's not God.
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.040]  He's not an angel.
[05:12.040 --> 05:13.040]  He's not perfect.
[05:13.040 --> 05:20.040]  But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order has been really incredible.
[05:20.040 --> 05:26.600]  The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom, and the way he stood up
[05:26.600 --> 05:32.080]  against these America-hating, God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful.
[05:32.080 --> 05:33.080]  And I'm serious.
[05:33.080 --> 05:37.000]  I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning, thinking about President
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  Trump.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.960]  I just want to say I admire the President so much, and I appreciate you, the listeners,
[05:42.960 --> 05:44.680]  and everybody for what you've done.
[05:44.680 --> 05:45.680]  I admire you.
[05:45.680 --> 05:47.480]  That's what you call it, thank me.
[05:47.480 --> 05:49.000]  Folks, I admire you.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  I admire Trump.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.960]  I admire all of you that are involved in this fight, and I just wish I could do more.
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.480]  We're going to win this fight together.
[05:55.480 --> 05:56.880]  This election is so important.
[05:56.880 --> 06:03.880]  Please pray for President Trump.
[06:26.880 --> 06:54.880]  I believe he said he wants to have five in one day coming up before the election, five
[06:54.880 --> 06:55.880]  in one day.
[06:55.880 --> 07:04.640]  Three times in Pennsylvania today, which is going to be key folks because here's the deal.
[07:04.640 --> 07:09.200]  The Democrats know their only hope is complete theft.
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.520]  They also know they don't have to do a complete theft of every election.
[07:13.520 --> 07:16.680]  Just a few select areas and a few select states.
[07:16.680 --> 07:19.980]  Pennsylvania and Florida are their prime targets.
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.720]  They got caught red-handed in Minnesota.
[07:21.720 --> 07:26.920]  They may have to back off that with Ilhan Omar's campaign and people.
[07:26.920 --> 07:30.800]  We got to watch out for Michigan with that corrupt governor, Whitmer.
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.120]  She belongs in jail.
[07:32.120 --> 07:37.000]  We're going to have to watch out for Pennsylvania and Philadelphia specifically with their corrupt
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.640]  governor, Tom Wolf, who President Trump was lambasting today during his rally to raucous
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.920]  applause in Allentown, Pennsylvania, his first of three stops in Pennsylvania today, which
[07:47.920 --> 07:54.840]  is significant because former President Barack Obama had three events in Pennsylvania last
[07:54.840 --> 07:55.840]  week.
[07:55.840 --> 07:56.840]  Nobody showed up, folks.
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.960]  I mean, literally 100 people combined total for three Obama rallies.
[08:01.960 --> 08:03.640]  Biden had a rally in Pennsylvania.
[08:03.640 --> 08:04.640]  No turnout.
[08:04.640 --> 08:06.120]  Harris had an event in Pennsylvania.
[08:06.120 --> 08:07.120]  No turnout.
[08:07.120 --> 08:16.000]  Trump will have three events today with over 100,000 people showing up in total.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.960]  President Trump is trying to take control of the fake pandemic.
[08:21.960 --> 08:25.840]  Everything is moving in his favor at this point, except, of course, the fake news, the
[08:25.840 --> 08:31.400]  scum of Fauci and Gates, and all the Democrats that want to keep the country locked down
[08:31.400 --> 08:35.000]  forever.
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.000]  That's their plan, folks.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.800]  They want to keep it locked down forever.
[08:39.800 --> 08:45.960]  And so we'll have more of those developments and what Trump is doing right now to win
[08:45.960 --> 08:52.760]  the COVID hoax fake pandemic battle.
[08:52.760 --> 08:54.680]  And there are some interesting developments.
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.760]  People in news who are just neutral, who kind of fell for the COVID thing, are now doing
[08:58.760 --> 09:01.960]  their own research and saying, huh, what happened to the flu numbers?
[09:01.960 --> 09:02.960]  There are no flu numbers.
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.600]  COVID is now the flu, huh?
[09:07.600 --> 09:10.320]  What happened to 15 days to slow the spread?
[09:10.320 --> 09:11.320]  Almost a year later?
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.320]  Nope.
[09:12.320 --> 09:14.920]  You have to stay locked down forever until you get a vaccine because that's freedom.
[09:14.920 --> 09:18.880]  Although it's not.
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.160]  And then you have former CDC directors coming out who have already pled guilty to sex abuse,
[09:24.160 --> 09:29.880]  now telling us that you never get to go back to normal and wear a mask forever.
[09:29.880 --> 09:32.760]  Of course, Trump wants to end it all.
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.760]  He wants to reopen.
[09:33.760 --> 09:34.760]  He doesn't want the mask.
[09:34.760 --> 09:35.760]  He doesn't want the lockdown.
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.560]  He wants none of it.
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.200]  And he's coming out more and more on that.
[09:41.200 --> 09:45.280]  And that's why the media is attacking him, saying, oh, he's bowing down to COVID, oh,
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.280]  he's giving up.
[09:46.280 --> 09:54.320]  No, he's being real about it and telling you to give up on your fake pandemic, you to give
[09:54.320 --> 10:02.280]  up on your forced vaccines, you to give up on the economic collapse.
[10:02.280 --> 10:11.880]  But here's how you know they're angry that President Donald Trump isn't going along in
[10:11.880 --> 10:18.240]  its enclosure, just fully going along with the COVID pandemic because he's saying no
[10:18.240 --> 10:20.320]  cases are up because the testing is up.
[10:20.320 --> 10:23.840]  So now you have reports.
[10:23.840 --> 10:30.240]  And of course, they force this to trend number one on all social media with the New York
[10:30.240 --> 10:35.200]  Times and the Hill and the USA Today.
[10:35.200 --> 10:39.680]  Increased testing does not explain the rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. New York Times
[10:39.680 --> 10:48.400]  and USA Today report, really, really business insider with the election eight days away,
[10:48.400 --> 10:52.480]  Trump lies about why coronavirus rates are hitting record highs and calls the media loses
[10:52.480 --> 10:55.160]  for covering the surging pandemic.
[10:55.160 --> 11:00.640]  So it's not testing, even though it is testing.
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.560]  And COVID-19 is extremely deadly, even though it's 99% survival rate.
[11:05.560 --> 11:06.560]  So think about it.
[11:06.560 --> 11:08.560]  It's a 99.9% survival rate.
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.040]  It's a 99.9% chance you won't even get it or notice you have it, but it doesn't matter.
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.120]  And now that the facts are coming out, they're just attacking Trump saying, oh, no, Trump's
[11:18.120 --> 11:19.120]  bad.
[11:19.120 --> 11:20.120]  It's not because of testing.
[11:20.120 --> 11:23.560]  You need to be afraid and you need to wear that mask forever and you need to stay locked
[11:23.560 --> 11:30.040]  down forever because Fauci said so and Bill Gates said so, two men who belong in jail
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.680]  and the former director of the CDC, who's also a sex abuser, says so.
[11:34.680 --> 11:36.680]  Isn't that nice?
[11:36.680 --> 11:40.360]  No.
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.080]  I don't think we have to listen to these creeps.
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.600]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, more is coming out on the Bidens and it's disgusting.
[11:48.600 --> 12:01.920]  We're talking about drug abuse, sex abuse, incest.
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.480]  We're talking about drug abuse and sex abuse with minors involved.
[12:06.480 --> 12:08.560]  And it's only going to get worse, folks.
[12:08.560 --> 12:12.600]  It's only going to get worse.
[12:12.600 --> 12:16.200]  And the fact that the Bidens, well, Joe Biden did put a lid on his campaign till Election
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.680]  Day, I think there's like two planned events right now, one for Biden tomorrow and then
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.680]  one for Harris.
[12:20.680 --> 12:22.880]  Harris is going to be coming to Texas on Friday.
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.960]  We'll be monitoring that, believe that.
[12:26.960 --> 12:27.960]  But he's done running.
[12:27.960 --> 12:28.960]  He's done campaigning.
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.200]  Yeah, misspoke in his last TV interview, he can barely even open his eyes at this point.
[12:34.200 --> 12:40.480]  He's halfway to hell and he thinks he's running against George Bush.
[12:40.480 --> 12:41.480]  So Biden is done.
[12:41.480 --> 12:43.520]  He has no political life.
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.760]  It'll be Harris the day he gets in and everybody knows it, but he has no chance of winning
[12:48.760 --> 12:51.000]  except for the Democrat Steel.
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.920]  And the media is all over covering up what's going on inside the Biden crime family with
[12:56.920 --> 13:05.320]  the illegal payouts, Biden being compromised by at least 10 different foreign countries.
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.520]  The drug abuse, the sex abuse, the minors, the incest, all of it, folks.
[13:10.520 --> 13:20.520]  It's all coming out and it's so, I keep using this analogy, but it's just the perfect analogy.
[13:20.520 --> 13:28.520]  The Infinity Gauntlet is the glove or whatever it is from the movie, the Marvel movie Avengers.
[13:28.520 --> 13:33.120]  And it's like, I guess the all powerful hand thing and it's called the Infinity Gauntlet.
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.200]  And it's like telling people about the Infinity Gauntlet your whole life, warning them about
[13:37.200 --> 13:38.200]  it.
[13:38.200 --> 13:39.600]  And now it's just sitting right there on your desk.
[13:39.600 --> 13:40.600]  It's just right there.
[13:40.600 --> 13:43.920]  It's like, look at what the Bidens are into.
[13:43.920 --> 13:50.600]  Millions of cash payouts from China and Russia and Ukraine and Romania and Iraq and Kazakhstan.
[13:50.600 --> 13:51.600]  I mean, the list goes on.
[13:51.600 --> 13:57.560]  A Borat's home country of Kazakhstan, Biden's making deals, unbelievable.
[13:57.560 --> 13:59.880]  And all of their October surprises flopped.
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.200]  The 500 kids separated from their parents turned into the Democrats think wild coyotes
[14:04.200 --> 14:06.880]  are bringing people across the border.
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.960]  Rudy Giuliani hits on 15 year old girl in Borat movie.
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.360]  No, even the people that have seen the movie said, no, that's not even true at all.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.760]  He's lying.
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.760]  So flop, flop.
[14:18.760 --> 14:20.040]  What was the other one that they flopped on?
[14:20.040 --> 14:21.040]  I can't even remember.
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.920]  It was such an in and out at this point that some other one just totally flopped.
[14:26.920 --> 14:32.480]  So all they have now folks is total election theft and President Trump is taking the gloves
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.280]  off right now against the Biden crime family.
[14:37.280 --> 14:45.280]  And he slowly, slowly, slow rolling it out, getting the people behind him that the COVID
[14:45.280 --> 14:46.680]  hoax is over.
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.440]  We're turning the corner after the election.
[14:49.440 --> 14:50.440]  They won't care.
[14:50.440 --> 14:52.440]  They'll reopen.
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.120]  And that's why the media is panicked that Trump isn't telling people to live in fear
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.800]  that Trump isn't telling people they're going to die from COVID that Trump isn't telling
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.920]  people it's the worst spread ever, that Trump isn't telling people it's the worst pandemic
[15:04.920 --> 15:07.520]  and everybody needs to hide forever and be scared.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.240]  They hate it.
[15:09.240 --> 15:10.640]  Trump is saying it's okay.
[15:10.640 --> 15:12.000]  You don't need to live in fear.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.320]  You don't need to wear the mask.
[15:13.320 --> 15:14.360]  We need to reopen.
[15:14.360 --> 15:16.160]  We need to get back to normal.
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.620]  We have a vaccine if we want it.
[15:18.620 --> 15:22.720]  We have therapeutics that some would call a cure.
[15:22.720 --> 15:29.120]  And the corrupt establishment absolutely hates it because it used to be Republicans and Democrats
[15:29.120 --> 15:32.160]  would go along when these hoaxes together.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.400]  And Trump did a little bit, but he knew in the long run he'd have to turn against this
[15:36.400 --> 15:38.200]  giant fraud.
[15:38.200 --> 15:39.840]  He knew it.
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.320]  And now you have doctors, international coalitions, national coalitions, all kinds of doctors
[15:44.320 --> 15:46.600]  saying, look, there is no pandemic.
[15:46.600 --> 15:48.760]  There is no COVID-19 pandemic.
[15:48.760 --> 15:50.000]  There is no spread.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.800]  There is no deadly virus.
[15:51.800 --> 15:57.520]  We are being lied to and it's time to prosecute those that lied to us.
[15:57.520 --> 16:00.560]  Go to 2020electioncenter.com.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.560]  Just type it in one time.
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.400]  You've got to save right there in your browser and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook,
[16:06.400 --> 16:12.640]  YouTube, Apple platforms, but most importantly via text message, email, or by word of mouth
[16:12.640 --> 16:20.640]  because they have banned the links to banned.video, but 2020electioncenter.com is a clone of the
[16:20.640 --> 16:25.920]  side of the exact same links, the exact same videos, we can comment and share them everything.
[16:25.920 --> 16:32.360]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.920]  Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going to take action, once reelected,
[16:35.920 --> 16:36.920]  he gets big tech.
[16:36.920 --> 16:38.400]  I mean, he's modern in the situation.
[16:38.400 --> 16:41.600]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry
[16:41.600 --> 16:43.000]  because he has to take an action.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.600]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020electioncenter.com,
[16:47.600 --> 16:53.080]  2020electioncenter.com, and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com and sharing
[16:53.080 --> 16:54.080]  that link.
[16:54.080 --> 16:56.680]  It's really obsessive, oh yeah.
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.920]  As I take this announcement, we were exactly 14 days out from the election and the global
[17:01.920 --> 17:06.480]  is controlled Democrats know that America has woken up to them and turned against them.
[17:06.480 --> 17:11.600]  The whole planet is a huge populace realignment and so they've openly said, we need to go
[17:11.600 --> 17:17.960]  to pure authoritarianism, not just censorship, but physically attacking and arresting anyone
[17:17.960 --> 17:20.080]  that doesn't submit to our agenda.
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.000]  And they're on record saying that once they remove Trump, they are going to persecute Trump's
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.040]  base and going to try to prosecute us and put us all in prison.
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.440]  This is what all the old Clintinesis are saying, it's what the Obama bots are saying, it's
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.520]  what Keith Overman's saying, it's what Nancy Pelosi's saying.
[17:38.520 --> 17:44.200]  This is their stated criminal authoritarian intent and they intend to keep the lockdowns
[17:44.200 --> 17:46.360]  going forever and force denoculations.
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.680]  They're trying to end the lockdowns and the sick vaccines will be voluntary.
[17:50.680 --> 17:55.320]  Donald Trump or die, we've got to get Trump in, everybody get out there and vote and tell
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.960]  your family to vote now.
[17:59.960 --> 18:26.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:26.960 --> 18:35.240]  That's right, Allentown, Pennsylvania, the Democrats shut all the factories down, President
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.320]  Trump is live in Allentown to a raucous crowd.
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.320]  I mean, like we got to be careful with the hot mic because I mean, these guys, you know,
[18:43.320 --> 18:46.680]  Biden's getting some MFers, let's just say that.
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.720]  So here is President Trump though, we jump into the live one of three rallies in Pennsylvania
[18:51.720 --> 18:55.520]  today for President Trump.
[18:55.520 --> 19:05.240]  Lou Barletta, and Lou Barletta is strongly against taking the statues of Christopher
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.240]  Columbus down.
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.040]  When you say that, Lou's not a big fan of that, right?
[19:11.040 --> 19:18.440]  And congressional candidate who is supposed to be fantastic and a star, Lisa Scheller.
[19:18.440 --> 19:26.560]  Folks, President Trump announced this rally less than 24 hours ago, there's tens of thousands
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.840]  of people that couldn't even get in, they had to find a trucking company's parking lot
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.000]  to have the event in because the governor, Democrat, governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.440]  shut everything down.
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.040]  Looks good, looks good, looks very good, harder to judge because you know, you go in so late,
[19:44.040 --> 19:45.640]  but it's looking good.
[19:45.640 --> 19:49.600]  The places where they're casting and where they're casting their vote, that's not any
[19:49.600 --> 19:52.040]  more polling, you sort of know.
[19:52.040 --> 19:53.600]  They are really looking good.
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.440]  Bernie, you got to win.
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.160]  You don't win how far you're so fast, you have no idea.
[19:59.160 --> 20:05.840]  I especially want to recognize the incredible truckers for Trump who are here tonight, truckers.
[20:05.840 --> 20:13.080]  I'm telling you, man, these rallies, Trump is not lying, these rallies are getting bigger
[20:13.080 --> 20:16.600]  and more raucous than ever.
[20:16.600 --> 20:20.480]  The truckers for Trump, they're incredible people actually.
[20:20.480 --> 20:25.480]  I don't know how they do it, those are long hours, driving down those highways, huh?
[20:25.480 --> 20:32.920]  That's long, that's got to be, just amazing.
[20:32.920 --> 20:36.440]  And we got them some pretty good legislation that other people wouldn't get them because
[20:36.440 --> 20:40.960]  they just don't do those things, but we got them some pretty good legislation, so thank
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.960]  you very much, fellas.
[20:41.960 --> 20:45.840]  I appreciate it, and the women and the men.
[20:45.840 --> 20:50.560]  Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in United States history.
[20:50.560 --> 20:57.120]  My opponents, insane immigration plan would eliminate U.S. borders entirely by implementing
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.200]  nationwide catch and release, they won't have catch, you know what catch and release is?
[21:02.200 --> 21:05.840]  You catch them, they're a murderer, they're a rapist, and you release them, you know where
[21:05.840 --> 21:08.480]  you release them into our country.
[21:08.480 --> 21:12.000]  Then Biden at the debate, he said, no, no, it's okay, because they come back for court,
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.400]  nobody comes back, they don't come back, they don't, no, I ended catch and release.
[21:17.400 --> 21:21.000]  I didn't like catching a murderer and releasing them now, that wasn't it.
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.360]  We keep them out, we're keeping them out.
[21:23.360 --> 21:27.440]  You can come into our country, but you have to come in legally, and you have to come in
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.280]  through merit.
[21:30.280 --> 21:35.160]  His plan would also make every community into a sanctuary city for violent criminals.
[21:35.160 --> 21:38.680]  Trump is such a throwback, man, these events are such a throwback.
[21:38.680 --> 21:42.640]  You gotta speak to him about it, you can't do this kind of stuff.
[21:42.640 --> 21:47.760]  He's in his huge rallies, like in a tiny party lot, they got like bleachers stacked on top
[21:47.760 --> 21:48.760]  of bleachers.
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.160]  They're also increased refugees coming into our country, if you watch like WWE in the
[21:53.160 --> 21:56.760]  90s, like the crowd was like involved in the show, that's how it is, like you can hear
[21:56.760 --> 22:00.960]  the crowd on the mic, Trump responds to the crowd.
[22:00.960 --> 22:07.440]  They pledge to terminate all national security travel bans, opening the floodgates to radical
[22:07.440 --> 22:10.880]  Islamic terrorism, no thank you.
[22:10.880 --> 22:13.200]  If you don't mind Joe, no thank you.
[22:13.200 --> 22:18.320]  You saw what happened a few days ago in Paris, right, you saw that horrible attack.
[22:18.320 --> 22:23.960]  I'm keeping the terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists the hell out of our country,
[22:23.960 --> 22:24.960]  is that okay?
[22:24.960 --> 22:26.960]  Do the truckers agree?
[22:26.960 --> 22:42.840]  I think so, I think I have the trucker's vote, that's nice, by the way, nice trucks,
[22:42.840 --> 22:46.480]  you think I could hop into one of them and drive it away, I'd love to just drive the
[22:46.480 --> 22:52.240]  hell out of here, just get the hell out of this, I had such a good life, my life was
[22:52.240 --> 22:53.720]  great.
[22:53.720 --> 22:58.920]  And then I said, let's do this darling, this will be a lot of fun, but you know what, I'm
[22:58.920 --> 23:04.880]  so happy with it because nobody has ever done so much in the first three and a half years,
[23:04.880 --> 23:08.480]  no administration.
[23:08.480 --> 23:15.680]  We invested 2.5 trillion with a T, trillion dollars.
[23:15.680 --> 23:30.120]  See now Biden would say 2.5 million, 2.5 thousand, thank you, and I love you too, thank you.
[23:30.120 --> 23:35.800]  I guess that's why we're all doing it together, right, when you get right down to it.
[23:35.800 --> 23:40.800]  We have a great country, we have to save our country, most important election, but we invested
[23:40.800 --> 23:47.680]  2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. military, and we saved a thing called the Philadelphia
[23:47.680 --> 23:48.680]  shipyard.
[23:48.680 --> 23:51.240]  We're in Pennsylvania, we're still playing as of today, I mean who knows, polls, whatever,
[23:51.240 --> 23:57.520]  it's all fake, but they say, oh Biden's ahead of five points in Pennsylvania, five points.
[23:57.520 --> 24:01.720]  We also passed VA choice and VA accountability, nobody said it was fast enough, for the best.
[24:01.720 --> 24:04.240]  And we just got a 91 approval rating.
[24:04.240 --> 24:12.240]  They say, oh Biden's had five points in Pennsylvania, five points, five points, they say.
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.240]  Biden has had five rallies in Pennsylvania in the last week, and you couldn't even get
[24:17.240 --> 24:20.400]  a crowd of 100 people combined.
[24:20.400 --> 24:24.240]  This is Trump's first event of three in Pennsylvania today, by the way, he was in Erie last week,
[24:24.240 --> 24:27.160]  50,000 people showed up.
[24:27.160 --> 24:30.600]  But this is his first event of three today, there'll be another 100,000 people turn out
[24:30.600 --> 24:31.600]  total.
[24:31.600 --> 24:39.600]  I mean legitimately how far ahead is Trump, and imagine if you didn't have the fake news,
[24:39.600 --> 24:45.760]  which Trump said, I think it was kind of like, it's one of those things where it's just
[24:45.760 --> 24:54.480]  so simple, but it's like so, it just hammers the point home so purely, the fake news media
[24:54.480 --> 24:56.960]  is blocking us out.
[24:56.960 --> 24:59.640]  Why do these people hate Trump, because the fake news told him to, why do these people
[24:59.640 --> 25:02.960]  hate whatever, why are they out in the streets, why do they believe this, why do they believe
[25:02.960 --> 25:07.480]  that, because the fake news, fake news, fake news, fake news, why are they wearing a mask,
[25:07.480 --> 25:11.480]  fake news, why do they think there's a pandemic, fake news, why do they think Trump is a racist,
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.680]  fake news, why do they think America is racist, fake news, why do they think George Floyd died
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.440]  from an officer choking him, fake news.
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.480]  Why do they think Breonna Taylor was an innocent saint murdered by police, fake news, fake news,
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.320]  fake news, fake news, there it is every time, fake news, who's hiding the Hunter Biden laptops,
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.840]  fake news, FBI Chris Wray, fake government.
[25:33.840 --> 25:35.880]  So it's just incredible and Trump is taking all of them on.
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.040]  Let's go back, we've got 60 seconds left to this segment, let's finish off with President
[25:40.040 --> 25:41.040]  Trump here.
[25:41.040 --> 25:44.280]  But we want him to do well, but it'll be the first call.
[25:44.280 --> 25:47.560]  I said we don't want to negotiate, they got to see what happens, because they dream also
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.480]  China dreams, every country's dreaming about it, Germany, you know, there was a poll that
[25:52.480 --> 25:58.920]  Barack Hussein Obama is more popular in Germany than I am, but I agree with that.
[25:58.920 --> 26:02.520]  If I win those polls and I'm not doing my job, right, you know, when you think about
[26:02.520 --> 26:05.680]  it, no, they rip us, everybody rips us.
[26:05.680 --> 26:13.320]  I recognize the true capital of Israel and open the American embassy.
[26:13.320 --> 26:19.720]  That was promised for decades and decades by every single president running for office,
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.280]  promised that and nobody did it, but me.
[26:23.280 --> 26:33.680]  Instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East.
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.720]  Three countries and they're lined up, they're lined up so beautiful to see, no blood in
[26:38.720 --> 26:39.720]  the sand.
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.720]  Yeah, no media coverage of that either.
[26:41.720 --> 26:43.320]  No media coverage of that either.
[26:43.320 --> 26:48.200]  The same liberal media, the same leftist progressives that said they wanted to end all the wars,
[26:48.200 --> 26:50.920]  the same Democrat politicians that wanted to end all the wars.
[26:50.920 --> 26:52.120]  Where are they now?
[26:52.120 --> 26:53.480]  They're silent.
[26:53.480 --> 26:54.480]  They're silent.
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.080]  With two weeks left to the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[26:59.080 --> 27:01.840]  the top some already amazing sales.
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.360]  It's Black Friday comes in October special, something we did last year that was very,
[27:06.360 --> 27:07.360]  very popular.
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.640]  We did it for the whole month last year, we can only do it for 11 days till the end of
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.040]  the month because stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products.
[27:15.040 --> 27:20.280]  But two things that came back in and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free

[27:55.160 --> 28:01.080]  In fiction super villains are known as super villains because they have gigantic, huge
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.560]  global plants that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[28:05.560 --> 28:11.760]  And I've told you a year ago back in October of 2019 that a powerful billionaire who controls
[28:11.760 --> 28:16.760]  the UN would roll out a global hysteria and lock down the planet and start millions of
[28:16.760 --> 28:21.680]  people and would be pushing a forced inoculation to even be able to leave your houses and that
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.200]  this same billionaire would say we're all going to work from home now and that this
[28:25.200 --> 28:29.880]  was good to lower the carbon footprint and the human population.
[28:29.880 --> 28:33.840]  You tell me that's crazy, you tell me that's a dystopia, you tell me that's some type of
[28:33.840 --> 28:38.120]  science fiction comic book, but in reality it really did happen.
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.480]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father
[28:43.480 --> 28:46.280]  and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[28:46.280 --> 28:48.840]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[28:48.840 --> 28:54.600]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates' property, it's time to expose Bill Gates.
[28:54.600 --> 28:58.680]  Introducing infowar's life pure turmeric extract.
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.960]  This is taken under the tongue, it is pure turmeric, it goes together very well with
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.280]  our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed
[29:10.280 --> 29:12.680]  in the stomach and intestines.
[29:12.680 --> 29:16.840]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.000]  then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.560]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[29:25.560 --> 29:29.040]  reviews, we've now been testing this out for several months, some of our staff like it
[29:29.040 --> 29:34.480]  more than bodies, some like bodies better, for me they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory
[29:34.480 --> 29:37.160]  action and so much more and they fund the infowar.

[29:46.560 --> 29:50.320]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so

[29:57.320 --> 30:23.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:23.320 --> 30:32.320]  But I mean I can go around saying oh my gosh I can go out to these leftist cities or whatever.
[30:32.320 --> 30:37.360]  Did you see President Trump inappropriately showering with his daughter Ivanka, oh my
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.600]  gosh it's sick and they'd be like oh wow I didn't know that, what a pervert, lock him
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.600]  up.
[30:41.600 --> 30:42.600]  Oh I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
[30:42.600 --> 30:45.760]  My bad, that was Joe Biden and his daughter.
[30:45.760 --> 30:48.840]  My bad though and his granddaughter too.
[30:48.840 --> 30:52.040]  That's my bad, sorry though but same applies right, I mean lock him up, he's bad right.
[30:52.040 --> 30:55.920]  Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not, not creepy uncle Joe.
[30:55.920 --> 31:02.200]  But wait a second, you said it was Trump and Ivanka and then, but now Joe it's okay.
[31:02.200 --> 31:08.520]  With the crack pipes and the little kids and the incest and all of that, okay, all right.
[31:08.520 --> 31:13.200]  All right, fine then, we'll just have to have more come out, we'll involve other Democrats
[31:13.200 --> 31:17.160]  and other, others getting money from China and members of the media and other daughters
[31:17.160 --> 31:20.160]  and it's fine, you want to see more of it, fine.
[31:20.160 --> 31:24.760]  It'll all come out but you know, it's all the fake news, here's another example.
[31:24.760 --> 31:31.600]  It's so sick, oh the fake news is so sick and their minions are so deranged.
[31:31.600 --> 31:39.880]  The purge of Providence, meetup, location and time to be determined, not a peaceful protest.
[31:39.880 --> 31:45.200]  That's this weekend, so the Democrats are just deciding to go full on terrorists, they already
[31:45.200 --> 31:49.840]  were but now they're admitting it and I'm trying to get more info on this but I can't
[31:49.840 --> 31:53.880]  imagine it's anything other than the Rhode Island riots that have been going on for
[31:53.880 --> 31:54.880]  a week now.
[31:54.880 --> 31:55.880]  Why?
[31:55.880 --> 32:00.920]  Because a man on a motorcycle was running from police, ran into a retaining wall and
[32:00.920 --> 32:05.360]  landed in a coma and then the fake news said he got hit by police officers even though the
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.720]  video evidence clearly shows the man ran his bike into the wall, no contact with police
[32:10.720 --> 32:16.920]  whatsoever but don't let that get in the way of a good Democrat riot, don't let the facts
[32:16.920 --> 32:21.200]  get in the way of a good Democrat riot, don't let the facts get in the way of a good Democrat
[32:21.200 --> 32:23.600]  fake news hit job.
[32:23.600 --> 32:34.920]  That's what these people do, they are sick, they are sick, man, I'll tell you, yeah it
[32:34.920 --> 32:41.880]  is the Rhode Island deal, literally over an event, it's every time George Floyd died
[32:41.880 --> 32:50.440]  a police officer, no drug overdose, Mike Brown, innocent, shot by Blit, no, charging the police
[32:50.440 --> 32:56.080]  officer, tried to steal his gun, also battered and robbed a convenience store which is the
[32:56.080 --> 33:02.600]  state of Missouri law, can be met with deadly force, well, hands up, don't shoot, never
[33:02.600 --> 33:10.960]  even happened, Obama said so, doesn't matter, seriously, I know there's a bunch of independent
[33:10.960 --> 33:14.600]  journalists that listen to this, you guys should go out, I mean maybe we should do this
[33:14.600 --> 33:24.360]  too but we're just on air all the time, working seven days a week, but I mean maybe we should
[33:24.360 --> 33:30.560]  send somebody out and go say, hey did you see text messages so diaries show that Donald
[33:30.560 --> 33:35.240]  Trump was inappropriately showering with Ivanka and you know the, oh he's the worst,
[33:35.240 --> 33:39.680]  he's a child molester pedophile, let's just kill him at the stake and then say, oh my
[33:39.680 --> 33:45.680]  gosh, I'm so sorry, I misread my notes, that's Biden, I'm sorry, that was Biden in the emails,
[33:45.680 --> 33:49.200]  that was Biden in the diaries showering with his daughters and granddaughters and inappropriate
[33:49.200 --> 33:52.000]  touching and everything, that was Biden, but same applies, right, you know, send him to
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.960]  jail, he's a pedophile, oh no, it's okay now, got it, and that's how sick these people
[33:56.960 --> 34:01.320]  are, all right, I want to go back to President Trump's first of three rallies in Pennsylvania,
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.480]  we'll be covering these all day on Band Out Video 2020ElectionCenter.com, part of the
[34:06.480 --> 34:15.880]  info is live transmissions, and so it's just so important for us to realize and hammer
[34:15.880 --> 34:21.640]  this information home that President Trump in Pennsylvania for three events today had
[34:21.640 --> 34:27.600]  100,000 people show up, five events for Biden, three featuring Obama, one Harris, one Biden
[34:27.600 --> 34:31.960]  last week, couldn't even draw 100 people, and the polls are lying about Pennsylvania,
[34:31.960 --> 34:35.600]  the polls are just fake, I mean they're literally fake, and that's what's so frustrating is you
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.440]  have John Roberts on Fox News, the polls say, the polls say Biden's ahead here, the polls
[34:41.440 --> 34:44.480]  say Biden's ahead here, I don't know, Trump can win here, look at the polls, the polls
[34:44.480 --> 34:50.600]  are fake bro, you've been on TV for 30 years and you're still so stupid, you've been looking
[34:50.600 --> 34:56.160]  at fake polls for 30 years and you still can't see it, wow, that shows how pathetic the news
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.320]  media in this country has become folks, in fact, it's like this, I've been doing political
[35:01.320 --> 35:09.080]  media, current events, politics for not even 10 years, not even 10 years, switched out
[35:09.080 --> 35:14.520]  of sports to politics about seven years ago, so not even 10 years, and a little, a little
[35:14.520 --> 35:20.440]  low life from St. Louis like me over here at the most banned networks in the world knows
[35:20.440 --> 35:25.520]  more about news and current events than John Roberts who's been a top analysis, top Fox
[35:25.520 --> 35:29.880]  News opponent for three decades, and he doesn't even get that the polls are fake, he doesn't
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.000]  even get that that's a fake pandemic, or maybe he does, or maybe he does, let's go back to
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.040]  President Trump live in Pennsylvania, first of three events today.
[35:40.040 --> 35:52.840]  We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
[35:52.840 --> 36:00.040]  We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together
[36:00.040 --> 36:10.840]  with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again, our military,
[36:10.840 --> 36:19.400]  we have made America wealthy again, our stock market, your 401ks, let's keep them up there,
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.960]  don't throw them away in two years and you'll say, huh, the president told, the previous
[36:24.960 --> 36:28.800]  president told me that was going to happen, I don't think that's going to happen, your
[36:28.800 --> 36:34.240]  401ks are hitting records, does anybody have a 401k?
[36:34.240 --> 36:42.360]  We have made America strong again, we have made America proud again, we have made America
[36:42.360 --> 36:50.800]  safe again, and we will make America great again, thank you Pennsylvania, go and vote,
[36:50.800 --> 36:51.800]  thank you.
[36:51.800 --> 37:05.520]  All right, cue it up, cue up the Trump dance, cue it up, cue up the massive energy, the
[37:05.520 --> 37:23.280]  massive crowd, they go crazy for the Trump dance, all right, ladies and gentlemen, so
[37:23.280 --> 37:31.080]  another massive rally for President Trump, I mean, this is just incredible, we are taking
[37:31.080 --> 37:37.040]  this country back, ladies and gentlemen, and the mainstream, I mean, how sick are these
[37:37.040 --> 37:42.240]  people in the mainstream media, that they don't even want you to be a part of this,
[37:42.240 --> 37:45.120]  they don't want you to see that it's going on, they lie about it, they want to try to
[37:45.120 --> 37:56.920]  snuff it out, you know there's no righteousness, no morals involved in these people, there's
[37:56.920 --> 38:05.160]  a party happening in Allentown, Pennsylvania at a trunk plant, a truck plant right now,
[38:05.160 --> 38:12.520]  and the governor tried to shut it down, what a loser, Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat governor
[38:12.520 --> 38:16.640]  of Pennsylvania, a loser shuts down their state, Trump talked about it earlier in his
[38:16.640 --> 38:19.440]  event how they tried to cancel this event, they didn't even want Trump to have a rally,
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.240]  so they had to go find a truck plant to do, to give their parking lot to Trump for a rally,
[38:25.240 --> 38:29.000]  because he can't do it at airports and all this stuff, can't do it at venues because
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.240]  the Democrats have them all shut down, these are sick people, man, I mean, God save us
[38:36.240 --> 38:41.680]  from these demons, oh my gosh, wow, okay, when we come back, I'm going to get into some of
[38:41.680 --> 38:46.600]  this news, we've got more Trump rallies coming up, I've got video clips news, we'll probably
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.800]  open up the phone lines, they'll probably be breaking news before we sign off of the
[38:49.800 --> 38:53.520]  Joan show, Gerald Salenty will host the fourth hour, then I'll take over on the war room,
[38:53.520 --> 39:00.120]  but folks, we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for your support at InfowarsStore.com,
[39:00.120 --> 39:04.520]  the Black Friday and October sales are still going and we've just added a couple new discounts

[39:51.520 --> 39:54.880]  we cannot thank you enough.
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.240]  China is open, America is closed, and in the European Union where the people are revolting
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.000]  trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  lockdown.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.600]  It's very simple, where authoritarians already have complete control of commerce, China,
[40:10.600 --> 40:16.880]  oh, there's no more lockdowns and their heroes and the UN says they're the example for assault.
[40:16.880 --> 40:21.800]  After all, that's where the virus came from, after all, that's where the fear monster came
[40:21.800 --> 40:26.960]  from, the lockdown came from, but that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken
[40:26.960 --> 40:35.080]  little syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear
[40:35.080 --> 40:38.440]  and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[40:38.440 --> 40:44.440]  And so far it's been incredibly successful, until just the last few weeks as across the
[40:44.440 --> 40:50.480]  world, humanity awakens in the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN, communist Chinese, world government
[40:50.480 --> 40:53.760]  power graph.
[40:53.760 --> 40:59.560]  Vitamin mineral fusion and ultra-12 are now back in stock, it's being sold out for months.
[40:59.560 --> 41:03.440]  They're sold out because people know that high quality B12 and a good mix of vitamins
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.760]  minerals, especially zinc, boost your body's natural defenses and are critical to your
[41:08.760 --> 41:09.760]  immune system.
[41:09.760 --> 41:16.120]  Both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com, just two weeks after the election, and we're
[41:16.120 --> 41:22.000]  offering them both at 50% off free shipping and triple paid trade points to your next
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  order.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.640]  Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off, that makes many of the
[41:26.640 --> 41:28.440]  things we're selling lost leaders.
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.480]  Now, we have had a big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out, a lot of the other
[41:32.480 --> 41:35.960]  stuff is close to selling out, but some of our best sellers are still there and some
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.440]  of them have actually come back in to stock and because of your support, we've had the
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.680]  money to reorder and get the other things that have actually sold out, so those should
[41:43.680 --> 41:45.440]  be back in stock as well soon.
[41:45.440 --> 41:47.680]  Thank you so much for keeping info wars on the air.
[41:47.680 --> 41:50.840]  Obviously, we're critical of the fight and you've helped win the war against the global
[41:50.840 --> 41:52.840]  so far.
[41:52.840 --> 42:00.720]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what info wars understand, what
[42:00.720 --> 42:04.280]  our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[42:04.280 --> 42:06.840]  We're in a digital civil war.
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.800]  There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech
[42:12.800 --> 42:18.200]  platform and now they're doing it to the private apps, they're doing it to text messages, they're
[42:18.200 --> 42:20.040]  doing it to email.
[42:20.040 --> 42:26.040]  This is mafia organized crime election meddling, but finally, when they blocked the Hunter
[42:26.040 --> 42:31.360]  Biden and the barisma information and the Chinese information and the photos, the crack
[42:31.360 --> 42:36.320]  pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real, Biden hasn't denied it.
[42:36.320 --> 42:39.920]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control, you've got to stop it
[42:39.920 --> 42:40.920]  now, we're taking action.
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.760]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, it's a mistake, it's an accident, it's an accident.
[42:44.760 --> 42:48.160]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff.
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.840]  Well, info wars is calling their bluff and I want to thank you all for keeping us on
[42:51.840 --> 42:53.840]  the air.
[42:53.840 --> 43:00.160]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out and has been incrementally
[43:00.160 --> 43:01.160]  orchestrated.
[43:01.160 --> 43:05.520]  First, it's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty, that's all right, then it's two months
[43:05.520 --> 43:09.960]  and it's six months and it's a year, now Bill Gates has 10 years and people are not saying
[43:09.960 --> 43:16.520]  I like my mask, I like my face diaper, I like my binky and so getting into the fear, getting
[43:16.520 --> 43:23.840]  into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated death numbers, this is our new neurotic control
[43:23.840 --> 43:32.240]  freak society overseen by robots, overseen by AI and all of it is designed to make humans
[43:32.240 --> 43:33.240]  not essential.
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.960]  That's why out of the gates, they tell us, you are not essential, you are not essential.
[43:39.960 --> 43:45.600]  Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is not essential.
[43:45.600 --> 43:51.280]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.320]  Come on folks, let's reject this.
[43:57.320 --> 44:21.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:21.840 --> 44:30.160]  You know I'm kind of at a loss right now just at all the different news trying to figure
[44:30.160 --> 44:34.600]  out what to cover, what's the most important and I just really need to focus in and hone
[44:34.600 --> 44:45.080]  in on one thing at a time but the active measures daily that Twitter and Facebook and YouTube
[44:45.080 --> 44:51.400]  and Google and Apple and the rest of them are taking to stop this American restoration,
[44:51.400 --> 45:02.040]  to stop President Trump from winning reelection, it's criminal folks, it's criminal and they're
[45:02.040 --> 45:09.040]  doing it every damn day and so this notification is now coming up on your Twitter when you
[45:09.040 --> 45:15.120]  log in it says, and by the way, see this is how active it is, Trump literally just addressed
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.480]  this at his rally and they already have their push notifications ready to go and so Twitter
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.520]  now releases this push notification when you log in it says, you might encounter misleading
[45:25.520 --> 45:28.360]  information about voting by mail.
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.320]  Election experts confirm, election experts, they don't mention who but election experts
[45:33.320 --> 45:39.120]  they say, election experts confirm that voting by mail is safe and secure says Twitter even
[45:39.120 --> 45:44.000]  with an increase in mail-in ballots, no not an increase that's never happened before.
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.160]  It's not an increase that's a first time ever.
[45:47.160 --> 45:53.280]  Even so, you might encounter unconfirmed claims like your claim that it's safe and effective
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.720]  that's unconfirmed because we've never had it before, no, no, unconfirmed claims that
[45:58.720 --> 46:02.160]  voting by mail leads to election fraud ahead of the 2020 US election.
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.440]  So this is how quick they're on it folks.
[46:05.440 --> 46:07.400]  Twitter's not even a social media company anymore.
[46:07.400 --> 46:10.000]  Twitter is literally an anti-Trump company now.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.880]  So Trump today, yeah there it is right there, I'm telling you as soon as you log in.
[46:13.880 --> 46:17.360]  So Trump today at his first rally of three in Pennsylvania, Biden won't even come out
[46:17.360 --> 46:18.360]  of the basement.
[46:18.360 --> 46:20.960]  He can't even have a bowl of cereal.
[46:20.960 --> 46:22.960]  Trump says the mail-in ballots are a disaster.
[46:22.960 --> 46:25.120]  He calls out the cheating that's happening in Pennsylvania.
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.560]  You know, look, I don't know what's going on if it's by osmosis but Trump's rallies are
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.280]  sounding more like infowars broadcasts every day.
[46:32.280 --> 46:33.280]  And it's just the truth.
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.640]  So I'm not saying he's stealing our talking points or maybe information's getting to him.
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.160]  It's just the truth.
[46:41.160 --> 46:46.640]  But he gets it, he knows Pennsylvania's their number one target folks.
[46:46.640 --> 46:48.800]  Trump knows it.
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.160]  Trump knows Pennsylvania's their number one target for theft plus Florida.
[46:53.160 --> 46:56.520]  But I think Florida's going to be such an overwhelming victory they're done there anyway.
[46:56.520 --> 47:00.720]  But they think they can steal Pennsylvania with the mail-in ballots and the fraud in
[47:00.720 --> 47:02.360]  Philadelphia.
[47:02.360 --> 47:06.760]  So Trump called that out about an hour ago in his rally.
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.360]  He said they're using the mail-in ballots that's never been done before.
[47:11.360 --> 47:12.800]  This is ripe for disaster.
[47:12.800 --> 47:14.840]  They're stealing it in Philadelphia right now.
[47:14.840 --> 47:16.320]  He said it right then.
[47:16.320 --> 47:22.400]  And so Twitter magically within the hour has the push notification going to your phone
[47:22.400 --> 47:27.840]  saying no mail-in voting is safe and secure.
[47:27.840 --> 47:32.160]  We've confirmed it with our election experts don't hear unconfirmed claims otherwise, even
[47:32.160 --> 47:36.040]  though their claims are unconfirmed and we've never done mail-in voting like this before.
[47:36.040 --> 47:39.800]  We've seen people get eight ballots, ballots for their dead grandparents, ballots for people
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.760]  who haven't lived in these houses for 10 years, ballots for animals and cats and pets and
[47:44.760 --> 47:46.120]  fish.
[47:46.120 --> 47:52.040]  But oh yeah and then if Trump puts out a tweet they'll say no it's not right.
[47:52.040 --> 47:54.840]  Trump puts up a video they say no it's not right.
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.680]  Somebody shows you CDC statistics on COVID they block it.
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.320]  You put out the Hunter Biden emails, you put out the images they block it.
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.280]  I mean Twitter, Facebook and Google are not social media companies.
[48:06.280 --> 48:12.600]  They are anti-American, anti-Trump companies whose number one mission right now is to keep
[48:12.600 --> 48:14.240]  Trump from getting reelected.
[48:14.240 --> 48:16.760]  That is number one.
[48:16.760 --> 48:18.720]  Number one at Facebook every day.
[48:18.720 --> 48:20.480]  Don't let Trump get reelected.
[48:20.480 --> 48:22.200]  Number one at Twitter every day.
[48:22.200 --> 48:23.840]  Don't let Trump get reelected.
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.600]  Number one at Apple and Google and YouTube and everything else in between.
[48:28.600 --> 48:31.200]  Do not let Trump get reelected.
[48:31.200 --> 48:32.800]  We must defeat Trump.
[48:32.800 --> 48:35.160]  We must lie to the American people.
[48:35.160 --> 48:37.880]  We must cover up the facts from the American people.
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.080]  We must confuse and trick and deceive the American people.
[48:42.080 --> 48:47.400]  That's what Facebook and Twitter and Google and the rest are.
[48:47.400 --> 48:50.760]  And we knew it right here.
[48:50.760 --> 48:56.760]  First at InfoWars and that's why they banned us first.
[48:56.760 --> 48:59.400]  And that's why they banned us first.
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.080]  They did the measurements, imagine.
[49:04.080 --> 49:09.480]  They talk about finding patient zero for COVID, please, give me a break.
[49:09.480 --> 49:11.760]  But you know what?
[49:11.760 --> 49:16.160]  They did find patient zero for freedom and free press, folks.
[49:16.160 --> 49:20.640]  They did find patient zero for spreading the Trump phenomenon and you know who that patient
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.080]  zero was, don't you?
[49:24.080 --> 49:25.800]  You're tuned into it right now.
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.920]  It's called InfoWars.
[49:27.920 --> 49:30.680]  It's called the Alex Jones show.
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.680]  It's called David Knight.
[49:31.680 --> 49:32.680]  It's called Owen Shroyer.
[49:32.680 --> 49:34.200]  It's called this crew right in here.
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.800]  It's called this audience right here, listening right now.
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.880]  Your patient zero of freedom.
[49:40.880 --> 49:42.480]  Your ground zero of freedom.
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.120]  This is Trump ground zero right here.
[49:46.120 --> 49:49.000]  That's why they came for us first.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.920]  That's why they came for you next.
[49:51.920 --> 49:57.080]  And that's why they're coming for anybody else who dare stand up for Trump and who
[49:57.080 --> 50:03.840]  dare have the courage and fortitude to report the truth in the midst of all of the internet
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.560]  censorship and sabotage that's going on.
[50:07.560 --> 50:11.680]  It's really incredible.
[50:11.680 --> 50:23.960]  So yeah, and there's of course the New York Post story from after banning us, big tech
[50:23.960 --> 50:25.880]  saying, yo, don't worry about big tech.
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.880]  It's fine.
[50:26.880 --> 50:28.600]  I'm going to expand Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[50:28.600 --> 50:29.600]  No big deal.
[50:29.600 --> 50:30.600]  No big deal.
[50:30.600 --> 50:35.120]  Well, I guess life comes at you fast there.
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.560]  And I'm not even to rub salt in the wound of the New York Post or like, you know, call
[50:39.560 --> 50:40.560]  them out.
[50:40.560 --> 50:46.040]  It's just like, see how it works?
[50:46.040 --> 50:50.680]  You can have the biggest story of all time and big tech will make sure that nobody ever
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.920]  sees it.
[50:53.920 --> 50:59.640]  And that's how they want the future to be folks so they can fake pandemics, which is
[50:59.640 --> 51:00.800]  what they're doing right now.
[51:00.800 --> 51:01.800]  And you know what?
[51:01.800 --> 51:10.280]  I'm going to get more into that coming up on the other side.
[51:10.280 --> 51:11.480]  What do I want to do here?
[51:11.480 --> 51:12.480]  Let's look.
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.760]  Let's just go ahead to Kamala Harris and clip six just real quick because Joe Biden is hiding
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.260]  in the basement.
[51:19.260 --> 51:22.760]  He doesn't know if he's running for Senate or what he thinks he's running against George
[51:22.760 --> 51:23.760]  Bush.
[51:23.760 --> 51:25.560]  He's done that multiple times.
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.240]  He literally can't even campaign.
[51:27.240 --> 51:29.840]  And now it's even Kamala Harris.
[51:29.840 --> 51:33.960]  Kamala Harris on a hot mic doesn't know where she is.
[51:33.960 --> 51:35.960]  Listen to this.
[51:35.960 --> 51:39.800]  Okay, well, that's all right, guys.
[51:39.800 --> 51:40.800]  Hold on.
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.000]  We'll get it all figured out here.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  All right.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  We ready to go.
[51:44.000 --> 51:52.440]  Let's go to Kamala Harris, not knowing where she is.
[51:52.440 --> 51:53.440]  Are we in Cleveland?
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.440]  Yeah.
[51:54.440 --> 51:55.440]  She doesn't even know.
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.440]  It's Kamala.
[51:56.440 --> 51:57.440]  Look at this.
[51:57.440 --> 52:02.080]  Look at this goofball in a mask.
[52:02.080 --> 52:03.080]  Are we in Cleveland?
[52:03.080 --> 52:04.080]  Yeah.
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.080]  How do you have?
[52:05.080 --> 52:06.080]  She doesn't even know where she is.
[52:06.080 --> 52:07.680]  She's getting the Biden fever.
[52:07.680 --> 52:10.800]  The Biden forgetsies.
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.800]  The Biden forgetsies.
[52:11.800 --> 52:12.800]  Oops.
[52:12.800 --> 52:13.800]  Where am I?
[52:13.800 --> 52:18.160]  And she's got like a double mask thing happening to there.
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.200]  These people are nuts.
[52:20.200 --> 52:21.280]  These people are nuts.
[52:21.280 --> 52:27.440]  Speaking of the mask, let's take a look at clip one here, where in Nashville, Tennessee,
[52:27.440 --> 52:31.400]  folks, I warned you, it's a great Republican stronghold, but the Democrats are coming in
[52:31.400 --> 52:34.200]  hard on Nashville.
[52:34.200 --> 52:37.520]  Nashville is going to be the next Austin, Texas at the rate it's going.
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.160]  Watch the Nashville police arrest a woman who's standing outside.
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.920]  They believe she was targeted because she had a Trump shirt on.
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.920]  I'm surprised by that.
[52:44.920 --> 52:49.200]  Trump's very popular in Nashville, but not wearing a mask, sitting outside gets arrested
[52:49.200 --> 52:50.200]  by police.
[52:50.200 --> 52:51.880]  Are you kidding me?
[52:51.880 --> 52:54.000]  Are you kidding me?
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  What?
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  Go.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  Whoa.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  I'm just filming.
[53:00.000 --> 53:00.520]  I got you, brother.
[53:00.520 --> 53:03.200]  I got you.
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.520]  What is he doing?
[53:06.520 --> 53:10.520]  She's being arrested for no mask?
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.480]  You guys are f***ing disgusting.
[53:12.480 --> 53:15.280]  You guys, you should be ashamed of yourself.
[53:15.280 --> 53:23.720]  disgusting. You guys. You should be ashamed of yourself. They're singling out a Trump supporter.
[53:23.720 --> 53:27.960]  So this lady gets arrested without a mask. Meanwhile, guys, let's go to clip four here
[53:27.960 --> 53:34.440]  before the break real quick. Roll this. So police officers sitting in their car and
[53:34.440 --> 53:40.880]  they get attacked. Just sitting in their vehicle. They get attacked by these guys with lacrosse
[53:40.880 --> 53:50.840]  sticks and baseball bats. And they try to break into the car. They throw rocks at the windshield
[53:50.840 --> 53:57.960]  beating it with bats and stuff. And the cops do nothing. Now, granted, I followed up on
[53:57.960 --> 54:03.720]  this. These individuals ended up getting arrested when backup arrived. But just imagine that
[54:03.720 --> 54:07.720]  you're standing outside doing nothing, minding your own business. A whole team of officers
[54:07.720 --> 54:11.640]  comes to arrest you. But if you're in New York City or LA and you're a cop sitting in
[54:11.640 --> 54:17.080]  your car, a whole mob of anti cop leftists are going to come and try to murder you and
[54:17.080 --> 54:22.160]  you can't even do your job. Think about that, folks. That's how lost we are. That's how
[54:22.160 --> 54:30.960]  far we've fallen. That's ridiculous, man. And now if you're an officer, you get fired
[54:30.960 --> 54:39.200]  for supporting Trump. So we've got that story coming up. NYPD suspends cop who blared 2020
[54:39.200 --> 54:43.920]  Trump 2020 from a cop car. So I mean, it's just clown world out here. It's on record.
[54:43.920 --> 54:47.560]  It's not disputed. It was rolled out more than eight months ago in common China. Now
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.560]  it's in Europe. Now it's the United States, Canada, and most other industrial parts of
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.280]  the planet. Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and pops have QR codes for
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.400]  you to supposedly check their menu. And they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu,
[55:02.400 --> 55:05.440]  but of course they have them. Now, what are they saying there? Well, you've got to have
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.960]  a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't have a piece of paper because
[55:09.960 --> 55:15.320]  oh, everybody's diseased and we're spreading germs. It's absolutely asinine. They can throw
[55:15.320 --> 55:19.400]  away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that. Now what this really is, is
[55:19.400 --> 55:24.600]  a contact tracing database. Again, this is admitted that everyone's being habituated
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.200]  into scan to be part of. So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially. Now
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.240]  your cell phones already tracking. You already have home assistants watching and listening
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.840]  to your house. But now this is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell,
[55:36.840 --> 55:40.720]  have a job, get an airplane without it. And Bill Gates even admits it. So think about
[55:40.720 --> 55:47.320]  that folks and we'll look out. Black Friday in October. Last year, that was one of our
[55:47.320 --> 55:52.400]  most popular sales that we ran in the last couple of weeks of October. It was popular
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.800]  for a reason. Some of the biggest sales of the year in Black Friday comes in October.
[55:58.800 --> 56:04.360]  And that means 30 to 60% off store-wide free shipping, triple-patriot points at 15% off
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.120]  your next order. And everybody that signs up for auto shipping additional 10% off, that
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.320]  makes many of these items lost leaders. Now, a lot of stuff sold out. Some of our best
[56:12.320 --> 56:16.440]  sellers are still there, but some good news. Vitamin mineral fusion with a big dose of
[56:16.440 --> 56:20.240]  zinc and all the other vitamins and minerals and amino acids for adults and children that
[56:20.240 --> 56:25.280]  boost your body's natural defenses. It is back in stock back on sale today, which is
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.120]  two weeks of the election. And more good news. Ultra 12. It's got the name Ultra for a reason.
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.120]  Highest quality vitamin B12. Take it under the tongue for full absorption. It is now
[56:36.120 --> 56:42.320]  back in stock. Both of those are 50% off at infowarstore.com. Infowarstore.com. Black
[56:42.320 --> 56:46.800]  Friday comes in October.
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:51.800 --> 56:59.800]  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
[56:59.800 --> 57:00.800]  What?
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.800]  So you're watching a team of eight police officers arrest a woman who's standing outside
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.800]  without a mask, but not wearing a mask.
[57:10.800 --> 57:17.800]  She's being arrested for no mask? You guys are disgusting. You guys.
[57:17.800 --> 57:20.800]  Now, this is a perfect example of the clown world that we're living in here.
[57:20.800 --> 57:27.280]  There's so many different angles of this, too, by the way. You know that Trump supporters
[57:27.280 --> 57:33.360]  support the police overall. You know that in that polarized narrative of the police
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.480]  are good or the police are bad, Trump supporters have the police back. They back the blue.
[57:37.480 --> 57:40.840]  They want to continue to fund the police and support the police. It's the Trump haters
[57:40.840 --> 57:45.960]  that hate the police, want to defund the police and even attack the police. In fact, another
[57:45.960 --> 57:53.360]  video we have here, cops just sitting in their squad car and they get attacked. Just, you
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.240]  know, people of course wearing the COVID mask, but I mean, these are masked vigilantes coming
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.300]  up to a cop car while an officer is sitting inside of it, beating it with bats, beating
[58:02.300 --> 58:06.800]  it with sticks, throwing rocks, breaking the windshield, trying to break into the car,
[58:06.800 --> 58:15.040]  breaking into it, and the cop just sits there and lets him do it. Now, here's the clown
[58:15.040 --> 58:24.520]  world aspect of this. In a normal society, when individuals are behaving like this,
[58:24.520 --> 58:29.920]  they would be arrested and put down immediately and sent to jail. But no, the cops have to
[58:29.920 --> 58:34.360]  take this because the Democrats are in charge and they know they'll be in jail if they go
[58:34.360 --> 58:39.800]  after these punks. And the media will be after them all day long saying how innocent these
[58:39.800 --> 58:45.080]  poor people were as they tried to murder police and surround their vehicle. So the police
[58:45.080 --> 58:52.360]  have to take this. But then, an innocent woman standing outside without a mask, she gets
[58:52.360 --> 59:00.220]  harassed, she gets arrested, she gets eight cops, 10 cops coming after her. Now, the reality
[59:00.220 --> 59:07.760]  of this situation is what? Those individuals that were trying to break into a police car
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.720]  and do harm to the officers, those individuals should have gotten their asses beaten and
[59:12.720 --> 59:18.560]  eaten concrete and dirt right there on the scene. No questions asked. But of course,
[59:18.560 --> 59:22.480]  you can't do that. Why? Because the Democrat city council, the Democrat mayor, the Democrat
[59:22.480 --> 59:25.320]  governor and the Democrat media will come after you, demonize you, and you're going
[59:25.320 --> 59:32.040]  to end up with your life destroyed. Now, on the other hand, officers harass an innocent
[59:32.040 --> 59:35.720]  woman for not wearing a mask, 10 of them team up on her and arrest her for not wearing
[59:35.720 --> 59:43.600]  a mask. Now, again, I am not for violence in any situation, but just to explain the
[59:43.600 --> 59:48.640]  clown world situation here. So the police get attacked for doing nothing and sitting
[59:48.640 --> 59:54.880]  in their cars by a bunch of deranged mainstream media heads that hate the police, trained
[59:54.880 --> 1:00:00.280]  to hate the police. So they attack the police and they pretty much get away with it. Again,
[1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:04.840]  backup ended up arriving, arresting people. But in that meantime, they get to attack police,
[1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:09.760]  they get to do damage to the squad car, the cops have to sit there and take it. Or in
[1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:13.520]  New York and all these other cities where the cops get beaten. I mean, folks, you've
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.560]  seen such bad footage of police being jumped and beaten and ambushed and shot and murdered.
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:24.000]  And they can't defend themselves. But oh, here we are. And they go and arrest an innocent
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.880]  woman for not wearing a mask. And there's eight police officers, folks, I'm not condoning
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:31.400]  violence. So I want you to understand, we do sport the police. We believe they're good
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.960]  men and women. And we're all on the same seat on the same side. But let me tell you, this
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:40.440]  is the reverse weird clown world. In that situation, those cops should have probably
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:45.680]  been attacked by the by the by the people by the public. You're harassing a lady and
[1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:50.840]  arresting a lady over a face mask. That's the type of situation in a clown world where
[1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:55.000]  the police deserve the treatment they get from the public. So again, I'm not condoning
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.040]  it. It's good that there was peace there. But you know, if the mob of people this society,
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:01.680]  you know what, you're not going to arrest this woman for not wearing a mask. And we're
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.480]  going to put you down. We're going to put you on the ground and you're going to have
[1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:07.280]  to you're going to have to leave this woman alone. And you know, maybe they throw some
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:11.200]  rotten tomatoes at him or something. Again, I'm not condoning it. I'm just saying that
[1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:15.960]  makes sense. You're a corrupt police force. You're going after an innocent woman. You're
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:19.240]  going to reap what you sow. But when you're an innocent police officer sitting in your
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:24.160]  car and you get attacked, well, then that's normal. So it's so that's the new clown world.
[1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:27.960]  Police officers, you get attacked, you have to sit there and take it. But then when you
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.760]  go after a woman for not wearing a mask, well, you have to just do that and nobody can stand
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:39.580]  up to you. And we all know because it's all the political pieces of this puzzle. For the
[1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:43.120]  most part, conservative Republicans, Trump supporters like police, so we're not going
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:47.400]  to give them a hard time. Leftist Biden supporters hate police want to attack them. And so then
[1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:52.480]  the police are put in a situation where there's only one law that applies.
[1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:59.080]  I admire President Trump. He's really proven himself to be unmatched. His wit, his focus,
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:03.680]  his commitment, his energy. And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump.
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:10.840]  He's not God. He's not an angel. He's not perfect. But the way he has used judo on the
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:15.280]  forces of the New World Order has been really incredible. The way he's pragmatically stood
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:22.520]  up for prosperity and basic freedom and the way he stood up against these America-hating,
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:27.600]  God-hating, family-hating trash is beautiful. And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:31.280]  to my eyes driving to work this morning thinking about President Trump. I just want to say
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:37.880]  I admire the President so much. And I appreciate you, the listeners, and everybody for which
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:42.840]  you've done. I admire you. That's what you call it, thank me, folks. I admire you. I
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:46.880]  admire Trump. I admire all of you that are involved in this fight. And I just wish I
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:50.640]  could do more. We're going to win this fight together. This election is so important. Please
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:57.800]  pray for President Trump.
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:05.240]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation. It's Owen
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:31.240]  Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:39.120]  That's it. That's it. Number one, mainstream media, ABC News, CNN, MSNBC, you know it,
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:44.880]  New York Times, Washington Post, all of you. You've done this to America, man. I'm going
[1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:53.480]  to take a deep breath and calm down. It's just, I just can't. Can you imagine if you
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:59.920]  didn't have the liars in mainstream news dividing us and pitting us against one another? Can
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:05.200]  you imagine the type of prosperity and unity we could be having right now? I mean, my God,
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:13.640]  especially under Donald Trump, who's anti-establishment, pro-America, like pro-prosperity, pro-you having
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:26.800]  a good job, pro-you having a good wage, pro-you having prospects and a future. So the good
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:34.000]  news is, they've lost most of their poll. They've lost most of their power, but they're
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.120]  still there. They're still brainwashing people. They're still dividing. They're still instigating.
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:49.520]  They're still lying. What do you do? What do you do about this criminal scum?
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:05:00.840]  Here's an example. Let's look at the latest in the COVID hoax. CNN, Trump team just announced
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:11.480]  its surrender to the pandemic. No. No, that's, they're just admitting that it's not a pandemic.
[1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:14.720]  But we can't say that because then you'll say, look at them. They're denying anybody
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:19.360]  died and it's their fault. I mean, you people are just sick. Trump can't even be honest
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:25.720]  because you're so dishonest. Think about that. You can't even be honest in this day and age
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:31.600]  because the media is so dishonest, they're going to lie every which way. So they fake
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:37.840]  a pandemic. They increase the testing. They shut down the economy. They make you wear
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:42.400]  a mask. And then Trump just says, oh, here's the CDC numbers. Here's the survival rate.
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:47.280]  I survived it. Melania survived it. My kids survived it. So it's time to go back to normal.
[1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:56.080]  And then CNN says, they're surrendering to the pandemic. Trump wants to kill you.
[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:01.160]  CNN again, White House Chief of Staff says we are not going to control the pandemic because
[1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:06.680]  it's the flu. No, but see, it's obviously very complex, but talk about a spectrum or
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:16.320]  a scale. Okay. On this end of the scale, it's the mainstream media, it's the CDC, it's everybody.
[1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:21.360]  Hundreds of millions are going to die. COVID is a death sentence. We have to shut and lock
[1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.760]  everything down because you're going to die and everyone's going to die and it's the worst
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:27.800]  thing in the history of the world. Okay, that's this side of the scale, this side of the spectrum
[1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:35.120]  over here. Over here on this side is it's just a flu. It's just a cold. Obviously, it's
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:41.840]  very more complex than that. But on that scale, the truth is over here. The truth is right
[1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:46.640]  next to it's just the flu. The truth is right next to it's just the cold season. It's just
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:52.760]  the flu season. So here's the lying media. Here's Fauci and Gates, worst pandemic ever.
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:56.080]  Everyone's going to die. That's their side of the spectrum all the way over here. And
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:00.760]  then on the other side is it's just the flu. The reality is just beyond it's just a flu.
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:06.840]  It's just kind of over here a little bit. But on that scale, it is just the flu and
[1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:12.640]  they know it. They've rebranded the flu. They have people running around in multiple masks
[1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:22.920]  and has bad suits because of the flu. You watch. You watch bacterial pneumonia will reach
[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:31.160]  all time highs probably in the month of December. Bacterial pneumonia and Fauci knows it. Let
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:34.600]  me tell you something. Dr. Anthony Fauci is such a criminal. He belongs in jail for the
[1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:41.240]  rest of his life. He knows the masks cause bacterial pneumonia. He knows it. He knows
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:47.680]  hydroxychloroquine with zinc and other things and other factors are known cures of disease
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:54.760]  like what was the the one that that he was with after I lost it when he was working with
[1:07:54.760 --> 1:08:04.720]  Obama. I forget now malaria. He gave Barack Obama was taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc.
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:09.560]  They know all of it folks. These are criminal liars. They belong in jail the rest of their
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:18.640]  lives. Feds halt coronavirus vaccine awareness campaign that included Santa. That's right
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:22.920]  because they want your kids to be scared of COVID to and then use Santa to give them a
[1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:30.760]  free vaccine. Oh, don't worry. Oh, just people are dying from the COVID vaccine and Japan
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:37.960]  and South Korea and you know, there's just some complications in the vaccine. But Santa's
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:42.320]  going to give it to your kid. And then when they go into polio or Deon beret syndrome or
[1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:50.120]  just croak right there, it's for the good for the good cause. Fauci, this is from Business
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:54.920]  Insider Fauci suggests a face mask mandate and warned that the general public might
[1:08:54.920 --> 1:09:04.160]  not get a COVID-19 vaccine until mid 2021. Oh, see, they're pissed. Trump took the reins
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:10.640]  on the vaccine and now they're pissed that they're not in control of it. And Trump wants
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:14.600]  to use the vaccine to say, Okay, time to reopen and get back to normal, which again, though,
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:21.040]  we shouldn't even have to do with that. If a mask works, then we should get back to normal.
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:24.400]  If the mask works and get back to normal, of course, the mask doesn't work. The mask is
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:31.960]  just a symbol of slavery. The mask is a brand on your ass like your cattle. Oh, but it has
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:37.840]  my favorite sports team. Oh, but my mask has a sweet little message. My mask says Trump.
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:45.040]  No, your mask is a sign of freedom. I don't care what it says. Excuse me, Freudian slip.
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:51.880]  Your mask is a sign of slavery. I don't care what it says. But they say, Oh, you're gonna
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:56.000]  need to wear that mask forever, even though it doesn't stop COVID. And if it did, then
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.880]  we could be able to reopen. But no, it's you get both you get double you get double raked
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:05.760]  by these people. Fauci and Bill Gates are double raping you right now. Wear the mask
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:10.000]  and get the vaccine. Wait a second. If the mask works, then I don't need the vaccine.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.800]  Wait a second. The vaccine works. I don't need the mask. No, you get both and we shut
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:26.240]  your economy down. Do you understand how evil Fauci and Gates are? This audience does. I
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:29.960]  know that, but it's just incredible. They get away with this. So the mask works, wear
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:34.880]  the mask, but everything still has to be closed. And you can't vote in person and you need
[1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:44.400]  a vaccine to reopen. Huh? Okay, even though Fauci knows the mask doesn't work. Business
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:49.560]  insider again, with the election eight days away, Trump lies about why coronavirus rates
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:53.240]  are hitting record highs and calls the media losers for covering the surging pandemic.
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:11:00.320]  Does anybody actually believe this crap anymore, other than a deranged liberal Democrat who's
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:11.640]  mentally retarded anyway? Folks, you see, you understand that liberal Democrats, first
[1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:15.280]  they said, Oh, the emails from Hunter Biden are unverified. Folks, we now literally have
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:19.160]  the videos of Hunter, the pictures of Hunter, the diaries of the family, his signature. I
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:23.440]  mean, it's, it couldn't be more verified if it came and slapped them right in the face.
[1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:30.560]  They say, Oh, no, no, no, this isn't real. But it's the same thing with the pandemic.
[1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:36.120]  So here's Twitter again, putting the push notification, increased testing does not explain
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:42.080]  the rise in COVID-19 cases, cites the USA Today and New York Times report. Folks, that
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:46.880]  I mean, that this is beyond 1984. This is beyond one plus one equals five. That's what they're
[1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:55.440]  telling you. Testing doesn't increase cases. Of course it does. How else are you having,
[1:11:55.440 --> 1:12:01.560]  you have no cases with no testing, zero testing, zero cases, 100 tests, whatever cases you
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:09.240]  get. It doesn't matter. They're all in on the lie. They're all in on the fake pandemic.
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:15.440]  It doesn't stop Vox headline, America's third COVID-19 surges here. It was predictable and
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:21.480]  preventable, but nobody's dying. They're faking the deaths. They're faking the numbers. There
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:27.000]  is no surge. Nobody's scared. But then in California in New York, where they have the
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.720]  most deaths, they say how great of a job they're doing. Los Angeles Times, how San Francisco
[1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:35.160]  became a national leader in slowing the spread. No, they didn't, they didn't slow anything.
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:38.520]  They killed the economy. They're shutting off the power now. They say the same thing
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:44.240]  about Cuomo in New York, where he gets to write a book now, even though he murdered thousands
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:49.280]  of old people in the nursing homes and all the people know it. These are sick criminals
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.680]  that need to be in jail or all screwed.

[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:34.160]  mean, he's modern in the situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:38.680]  now. So we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action. We the people are taking

[58:19.500 --> 1:15:26.720]  You know, it's like taking a traumatic blow to the head. It's like a dizzying, stunning
[1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:38.120]  blow. It's just like, whoa, seeing all these people with the mask. A mask that doesn't
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:44.000]  do anything, folks. It spreads. The science on the mask is out. It literally spreads.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:48.720]  It spreads COVID bacterial pneumonia all of it, man. I shouldn't say spreads. It just
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:53.200]  causes bacterial pneumonia, hypoxia, all these other things that just, you know, Oh, where
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  the mask, the law says where the mask. And it's just like a dizzying blow, man, because
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:08.920]  you look around and you just, it's just, wow, are my fellow Americans this stupid? Are my
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:17.640]  fellow humans here on this planet this stupid? Are we this controlled? Are we this dumb?
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:20.840]  And then if you're the guy that dares to stand up and say, hey, the COVID thing's fake, the
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:25.840]  mask doesn't do anything. They look at you like you're crazy. This is the clown world.
[1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:32.000]  How do we even, how do we come out of this, man? I don't want to live like this. I know
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:44.080]  you don't either, but it's just, man, what are we going to do? Because here's the thing.
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:52.000]  We can't get physical because we're like the police right now where the police do their
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.840]  job and they handle a violent criminal in a physical manner. They're bad. The same thing
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:03.760]  goes for us. So even though it didn't even happen, the FBI staged a false flag in Michigan
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:08.840]  to, to kidnap the governor, but hold on a second. See, and this is one of the things
[1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:13.760]  I can't even be real about this situation. I can't even actually talk about this because
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.040]  then they'll lie about me or sue me. Of course I'm banned on social media everywhere. So
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:20.800]  what more can they do? It's kind of like when Alex said, get your battle rivals ready.
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:23.880]  Antifa's coming to your front door. We'll look at them now, burning cities of the ground.
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:28.800]  I guess Alex Jones was right again. But see, I can't even sit here and be honest about the
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:33.520]  situation without being demonized. And so then I have to censor myself. But no, here, here's
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:36.680]  the honest, here's the God's honest truth. And they'll try to probably set me up for
[1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:47.880]  saying this. Our governors, our politicians are physically attacking us. We have a right
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:54.360]  of self defense. We have a right of self preservation. When they're locking you in your home, when
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:59.520]  they are shutting down your business, when they are forcing you to wear a mask, when
[1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:03.440]  they are forcing you to take a test, and when they're going to threaten to force you to
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:11.040]  take a foreign substance chemical rape called a vaccine, that is a physical assault on you.
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:18.960]  And in a sane society, in a free society, in our republic, we should be able to leverage
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:29.880]  physical attacks on them. Now, see, I'm not calling for violence, but they have violated
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:39.000]  the non-aggression principle, not us. They did that. Yes, Governor Whitmer deserves a
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:45.200]  citizen's arrest. But see, I can't say that. Now, I'll have an FBI team investigating me.
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:49.880]  Don't worry about Hunter Biden. Don't worry about Joe Biden, all the crimes. No, an info
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:54.520]  wars host said that the Democrats have violated the non-aggression principle, which they have
[1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:59.160]  wanting forced vaccines, forcing you to wear a mask, forcing you to stay inside, forcing
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:03.760]  you to take a test, forcing you to shut down your business. They have violated the non-aggression
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:09.040]  principle and we're not allowed to respond. We're not allowed to respond. We're not allowed
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:19.520]  to talk about it. We're not allowed to do anything. We can't even go have a rally.
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:28.920]  So this needs to be understood. I am not calling for any violence. I'm not calling for any physical
[1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:36.560]  assaults or attacks. No, I'm simply saying they have violated the non-aggression principle,
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:49.440]  not us, not us. We have withheld. We have stood back and stood by while the Democrats
[1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:58.000]  are raping our country dry. Joe Biden taking millions of dollars selling you out. They
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:04.080]  violated the non-aggression principle. They brought this on themselves, whatever their
[1:20:04.080 --> 1:20:13.480]  fortune may be, but it's really sad. And it just shows how tyrannical our government
[1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:28.480]  has gotten. And there is just no recourse for us. I was explaining this last night.
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:33.200]  We have all the videos up at Band-Aid, video on the War Room channel from a Trump train
[1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:38.760]  caravan from this weekend. And I've got local Republicans and people coming up to me like,
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:44.240]  don't be too loud on the PA and don't go by this building and have on the PA and then
[1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:47.880]  don't do this and don't do this. I'm saying like, don't do this. How about don't tell
[1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:55.720]  me what to do? We sit here and we take the liberal bullying all fricking day long and
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:04.840]  then we wonder why we're losing. Let me just carry on here. Three quarters of likely voters
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:12.280]  believe they'll recover from COVID if they get it. Hey, that's good. It should be 100%.
[1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:19.280]  It should be 100% of people believe they'll recover because almost 100% will. But no. So
[1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.520]  it's like we celebrate like 75% of Americans know COVID isn't deadly. And it's just the
[1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:31.720]  flu. Oh, but see COVID is deadly. See, we have the numbers and they fake the numbers.
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:36.000]  And then it doesn't matter that they fake the numbers, the fake numbers just get real.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.360]  And then you're not allowed to talk about it or you're crazy if you talk about it or
[1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:44.920]  quote the actual numbers. And then they lock everything down, come to arrest you and then
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:54.720]  you're bad and you don't have any recourse. Like this piece of human garbage. Dr. Tom
[1:21:54.720 --> 1:22:03.200]  Frieden says, we're not going back to pre COVID world anytime soon. The quicker we accept
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:07.400]  that the more we can reduce deaths and economic disruption. You know, I hate this notion when
[1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:13.160]  they say COVID did this COVID did that COVID did nothing. We did this. We shut down the
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:20.320]  economy not COVID. We closed the schools not COVID. We closed the hospitals from surgeries
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:25.800]  not COVID. We did this not COVID. And you have these people that think they're so intellectual
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:31.880]  they go on TV and they say COVID this, COVID that COVID didn't do this. We did. Oh, but
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:39.000]  did I mention Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC director pled guilty to sex abuse? Got no
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:44.120]  jail time. But you know, that's how it works. So that guy a sex abuser tells you to wear
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:52.600]  a mask forever. What human scum. But again, now again, people wake up daily male headline
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:57.840]  has COVID killed off the flu? I mean, info was reported this what four months ago? Has
[1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:02.280]  COVID killed off the flu? Experts pose the intriguing question as influenza cases nose
[1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:07.400]  dive by 98% across the globe. No, because everything's COVID. Now the flu is COVID.
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:13.200]  A car accident is COVID. A bloody nose is COVID. A stubbed toe is COVID. A splinter in your
[1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:21.640]  foot is COVID. It's all COVID. Everything's COVID. But now doctors are wise to the criminal
[1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:29.000]  Bill Gates. Dr. Urso, who's been outspoken for cures on COVID that he knows we have.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:33.280]  Bill Gates strikes us again with more lives. They're so pathetic. Not only does hydroxychloroquine
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:38.560]  work, but lots of other meds help stop COVID stop lying. And he finds out that it's a Bill
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:44.880]  Gates Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funding the hydroxychloroquine tests. So of course
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:48.440]  they want the vaccines. They want to make their billions. They want to make you a slave. They
[1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:53.160]  don't want there to be a cure with two weeks left to the historic election. We're launching
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:58.960]  the biggest sell the year the top some already amazing sales. It's Black Friday comes in
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:03.120]  October special. Something we did last year was very, very popular. We did it for the
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:08.160]  whole month last year. We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month because
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:12.120]  stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products. But two things that came back in
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:18.200]  and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free shipping is ultra 12 incredible high

[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:54.520]  two five three three one three nine. History is now history is taking place in front of
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:25:00.000]  us. We are at the crossroads. We are now only two weeks out from the most historic and important
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.640]  election in world history. I've been saying that for over a year, but now people really
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.720]  understand I wasn't exaggerating. This is so critical. The new world order wants to repudiate
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:11.760]  the nation state that will repudiate the idea of America. They want to repudiate the idea
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:17.480]  of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy. So they are throwing
[1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.200]  everything they've got and not just the American people, but the people of the world. That's
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:27.680]  why your word of mouth is beyond came. It is paramount. When you spread the articles,
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:31.760]  when you spread the videos, when you shoot your own video or write your own article or
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:34.920]  knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell
[1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:38.480]  them to vote for Trump. When you speak out against the system, when you do things that
[1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:44.160]  seem little together, it adds up into giant things. Many hands make life work. History
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:50.120]  is happening now. Take action now while you still can please for all of our futures. Six
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:56.360]  months ago, the highly respected former head of the Rockefeller hospital biology department
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  went public and said the mainline science on virology is you cannot protect somebody
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.640]  from a virus like this. You have to wait till there's herd immunity and there's never been
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:13.360]  a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses. They do not work. Well, even Bill
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:18.320]  Gates now admits, oh, the vaccine will really never work. But you have to keep social distancing
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:23.520]  and wearing masks. They're now saying forever. Last week, it was 10 years. Now it's forever.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:27.600]  See how the power grab works? So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:31.400]  a sheep of staff is surrendering to coronavirus, when they say we just have to learn to live
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:36.840]  with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and of course, sink, that's
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:42.440]  the reality. That's not fear mongering. That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:46.640]  fear of the new world order. They create a problem to which there is no solution. But
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:52.880]  they are again the people that say they've got to be in charge.
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:59.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:30.000]  I got a long day here at the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, and probably
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.480]  should calm down. You know, it's just I'm sick of these demons. I'm sick of these liars
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:40.400]  and sick of these deceivers destroying us, folks, and that's what they're doing. They're
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:51.160]  destroying us. And it's sad. It's sad to see how brainwashed and deceived my fellow man
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:28:06.160]  is walking around wearing a face diaper. I just want to live in reality, man. I just
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:15.080]  want to live in reality. Why is it so damn hard to live in reality? Gosh, man, the media
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:21.760]  builds this prison of lies. We ought to sit here and suffer begging for scraps of truth.
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:29.720]  Begging. And the average liberal is so retarded, and I'm sorry, it's the only word to describe
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:34.800]  these people, folks. They still deny the Hunter Biden laptop is real, even though we now have
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:38.520]  videos, pictures, all of its signatures. I mean, the whole thing, the lawyer requests
[1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:47.800]  a laptop back. It's unverified, they say. The COVID pandemic, 99.9% survivability rate,
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:51.440]  99.9% chance you leave your house. You're not going to get it. Doesn't matter. Shut
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:29:00.560]  everything down. Ruin our lives. Tell everyone to live in fear. Take a vaccine. All right,
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:10.200]  we've got Patrick Howley coming up soon with breaking news out of Houston. You know, but
[1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:16.960]  here's the thing, I do expect Trump to get reelected. And that's great. That's good.
[1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:25.000]  But it's not going to stop the fake news media from dividing us, destroying us. And it's
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:34.200]  not going to stop this fake pandemic. And we lost, folks. Believe me, I'm telling everyone
[1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:41.120]  in their mother to get out and vote for Trump. But we lost this COVID battle. We lost. And
[1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:44.040]  I think maybe Trump really believes that they're just going to give this thing up when it's
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:49.240]  all said and done. No, they are not. Never will they. We lost, folks. We lost. We're
[1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:56.320]  in a fake pandemic forever now. So get used to it. And you can't do anything because the
[1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:03.120]  FBI will come after you and the police will come after you. They won't go after Gates
[1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:09.760]  and Fauci who are lying to us and criminally attacking this country economically with a
[1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:14.840]  fake pandemic. They won't go after the Biden's crime family for taking tens of millions of
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:18.920]  dollars from foreign countries selling us down the drain. No, but you don't wear a mask.
[1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:24.000]  They're coming for you. You talk about how corrupt your governor is. They're coming for
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:29.620]  you. You open your business in the middle of a fake pandemic. They're coming for you.
[1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:34.640]  So what recourse do we have? Sure, we can vote Trump in. We can vote Trump in for 50
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:48.320]  more years. We'll still be in the fake pandemic. Just makes me sick. I tell you, man, I, you
[1:30:48.320 --> 1:31:03.520]  know, I look at this crew. I see the audience when we have events and I just sit here and
[1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:11.600]  I just ponder. Are we the are we what's left of free men and women? Are we it? Is this it?
[1:31:11.600 --> 1:31:18.160]  Is this what it comes down to us? You're tuned in here. This crew, our reporters, are we
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:22.520]  what's left? Is this it? Is this the is this the rest of free America? Are we the left
[1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:30.120]  vestige or are we are we the last? Are we just an archaic shadow of free men or women?
[1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:43.440]  What happened to you, America? What happened? What the hell happened, man? It's unbelievable.
[1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:47.120]  And because we've given them this fake pandemic victory, we're never coming out of it, folks.
[1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:51.120]  However, you better face that fact because you're never going to real you. If you think
[1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:55.720]  this thing's gonna Trump says we're rounding the curve, we aren't around around the curve.
[1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:59.840]  The whole thing's been fake. They're never going to stop testing. The cases will never
[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:05.280]  stop going up. It's all a hoax. It's all a sham. It's all a fake. It's an economic warfare
[1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:11.200]  attack. Where are the free men and women? Where are the brave Americans? I know where
[1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:16.320]  they are. They get arrested. Oh, you open your business arrested. Oh, you didn't wear
[1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:23.360]  a mask arrested. Oh, you talked about how corrupt your governor is arrested. Oh, Biden,
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:27.520]  you took tens of millions of dollars from China. Good job. Oh, Hunter Biden, you're smoking
[1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:31.080]  crack and you got little little girls and stuff with you and your sexual predator. Good
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:42.280]  job, Hunter. Good job. Where is Hunter? Anybody seen Hunter? Haging Hunter. So believe me,
[1:32:42.280 --> 1:32:45.720]  I understand how important it is to get Trump reelected. But folks, we better wake up and
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:53.720]  realize only we can take this country back. Only we can take this country back and it
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:33:00.280]  has to start against the fake pandemic, folks. It has to. And I don't even have the answers
[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:08.320]  because I mean, I live by the words I speak. But when most of the country is mentally retarded,
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:16.000]  I yeah, I don't know what to do. I mean, I drive down the streets of Austin and I get
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:29.040]  death threats. By the way, police not interested. No. No. So I'm gonna have to spend hours
[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:36.600]  on the phone with police just to get him interested in this. I filed. I mean, it said it's like
[1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:40.760]  why I'm filed police reports. I've been assaulted and attacked dozens of times. I've had one
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:46.560]  arrest. One. I filed multiple police reports. It's on video. I send them the video. Nothing.
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:52.360]  I have text messages threatening me. I send them the text. Nothing. Video, audio, pictures,
[1:33:52.360 --> 1:33:56.840]  license plate numbers, names, dates, video, audio, text, everything. Police report, police
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:02.840]  report, police report, police report. No rest. Nothing. Doesn't matter. But hey, I mean,
[1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:13.960]  if I went outside without a mask, oh, believe me, the cops will be on me like stink on crap.
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:20.000]  What is this clown world? And see, that's the thing about President Trump that I appreciate
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.360]  though, because he could run away from all of this. Anybody could run away from all this.
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:28.160]  It's very simple. Get the hell out of it. If you if you can socially distance yourself
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:33.600]  from a Democrat, you can find a way to be free again. If you can socially distance yourself
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:37.400]  from the media, you can find a way to be free again. Now, sadly, it's becoming few and far
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:40.600]  between. Maybe you can go out and find a little mountain town. Maybe you can go out and find
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:44.560]  a little lake town, something like that. Some good local leadership that's conservative
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:47.080]  that doesn't get involved in your life. Okay, you can get away from it, but they'll come
[1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:59.640]  there too. They already are. I just don't know what to do, man. Just do just all become
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.480]  recluses. I mean, in New York and California, they show up at your house and arrest you
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:14.480]  if you have a party for violating COVID. I'm sorry, I just can't even focus. I'm supposed
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:18.840]  to be on air for six hours a day. It's just it's just such a joke, man. It's just such
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:24.160]  a joke. A fake pandemic. They're literally they literally got away with a fake pandemic,
[1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:31.000]  man. And we're sitting here just unbelievable. I'll try to focus and cover some of this other
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:37.600]  news when I get back in this break. And then the guest Patrick Halley has joined me. I'm
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:45.080]  just people just need to understand we're never coming out of this. Okay, just just
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:50.520]  understand this rounding the curve after the election vaccine, no vaccine. It's all fake
[1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:56.240]  folks. You're never getting out of this ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Even in Florida, you
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:59.240]  think they're doing great in Florida. I got friends in Florida. They still make your mask.
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.840]  They still got half the crap shut down. The governor said, Hey, you can reopen the NFL
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:08.160]  stadiums full capacity. They didn't do it. They let in 10 people. So just understand
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.960]  until Americans decide to take this country back, until we the people decide to take action,
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:16.780]  you're never getting it. You're never going to be free again. You're never going to get
[1:36:16.780 --> 1:36:22.640]  out of this fake pandemic, folks. And that's the big test that we're in right now. And there's
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:28.760]  risks involved at every angle. And sadly, the thing that we think is the safest, the thing
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:33.680]  that we think is the least risky, which is to not fight this is actually the most risky.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:39.880]  The biggest risk we take is doing nothing. And the big lie is that we sit back and do
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:44.720]  nothing. And that's the least risky thing. No, that's the most risky thing. You're never
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:59.800]  going to be out of these shackles unless you take that risk.
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:06.040]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:10.960]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.440]  menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:22.680]  I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:26.360]  that Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:31.120]  bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:35.680]  they can get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:40.480]  buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want. Be
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.480]  sure and share band.video.
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:17.080]  And we're offering them both at 50% off, free shipping, and triple-patriot points
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:21.760]  at your next order. Also, if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off. That
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:25.560]  makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders. Now, we have had a big clearance
[1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:29.000]  sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out. A lot of the other stuff is close to selling
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:32.240]  out, but some of our best sellers are still there, and some of them have actually come
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:37.080]  back in to stock. And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:41.040]  other things that have actually sold out, so those should be back in stock as well soon.
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:44.640]  Thank you so much for keeping InfoWars on the air. Obviously, we're critical of the
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:50.080]  fight, and you've helped win the war against the global so far.
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.600]  Seeing in and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline that Trump
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:58.120]  has surrendered to the coronavirus. It's the opposite. He's not surrendering to the
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:03.960]  endless drumbeat of fear and false science that it's incredibly deadly and that we have
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:09.120]  the chance of eradicating it. Bill Gates, Fauci, and the UN have said, we will always
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:14.280]  wear masks, we will never shake hands, and even the vaccines won't protect us forever
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:22.680]  until the civilization, as we know, is over, until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated.
[1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:26.240]  That's impossible. That's right. They're trying to say they have never cured to the
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:33.000]  common cold. That's what COVID-19 falls positives for on the test. They created a problem that
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:37.400]  can never be defeated, but of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem, and so
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:43.080]  they stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers, and now going
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:48.280]  with the police to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking four samples. We must
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:49.280]  say no.
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:55.360]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time. You've got to save right there in your
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:01.200]  browser, and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, but most
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:08.000]  importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:15.160]  links to banned.video, but 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links,
[1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:21.200]  the exact same videos, we can comment, we can share them, everything. The system is censoring
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:25.920]  because the power of the people overrode them four years ago. Trump has finally figured
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:30.000]  this out, and since he's going to take action once reelected against big tech, I mean, he's
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.960]  in such a modern situation. Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:37.120]  we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action. We the people are taking
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.120]  action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:47.600]  and checking out the new redesigned infowars.com and sharing that link. Hope that really upsets
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:41:01.600]  them, oh yeah.
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:20.560]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now your
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:33.680]  watching. We're going to move on to the Hunter Biden laptop from hell. In this segment, Patrick
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:40.120]  Alley joining me in the next segment with some major election news. Of course, Alley
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:45.000]  breaking news left and right right now at NationalFall.com, whether it's election news
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:50.760]  or the Biden scandals, so that's coming up real quick though. Ladies and gentlemen, we're

[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:35.080]  off our last run ever of Extendo-wise is 60% off right now. We're crazy with that deal.
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:41.000]  We're going crazy with that deal right there. Extendo-wise, one of my favorite supplements,
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:47.160]  it's got the CoQ10, it's got the fish oil, it's got the garlic, it's a very unique supplement.
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:54.520]  I've never seen another one like it, but it's our final run of that as well. It's 60% off.
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:00.040]  And don't forget about free shipping store-wide and triple Patriot points with every order.
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:04.720]  The Patriot points can be used towards future purchases. You'll see that in your account
[1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:09.640]  after you make your purchase. Go look at your Patriot points. You'll see, whoa, I got a
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:13.960]  bunch of these Patriot points and you'll probably have enough for a t-shirt, a hat, maybe try
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:18.920]  one of the supplements at infowarsstore.com. I would suggest while we have the free shipping
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:21.920]  and the triple Patriot points, if you don't have a water filter yet, if you don't have
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:26.720]  an air filter yet, if you don't have emergency food yet, now's the time. Those are heavy items
[1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:31.440]  expensive to ship. We're going to cover those costs. Those are big ticket items, a little
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:35.760]  more expensive triple Patriot points. You're going to get enough Patriot points back into
[1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:41.280]  your account probably to get a, basically, you know, on the house, a bottle of extended
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:47.120]  wise or brain force plus or vitamin mineral fusion or a t-shirt or a hat. So that's what
[1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:53.880]  the Patriot points are all about at infowarsstore.com. Triple Patriot points right now.
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:44:05.600]  Okay. This morning, even they're talking about how Trump wants to get rid of Ray,
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:17.880]  Haspel and Esper. I don't think that we could see that happen fast enough. And now everybody
[1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:25.320]  knows Chris Ray, Gina Haspel, were both sitting on that Hunter Biden laptop and did nothing
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:31.000]  about it. And you know, look, even Fox News is so sick because they're spinning it this
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:37.720]  morning saying that Trump is mad that Chris Ray didn't help him in his reelection process.
[1:44:37.720 --> 1:44:43.960]  You know, you dirtbags, how about Trump is mad at Chris Ray for not doing his job? How
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:50.440]  about Trump is mad at Chris Ray for covering up child abuse? How about that, you dirtbags
[1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:58.200]  at Fox? Literally, that was their headline this morning. Trump mad at Ray for not helping
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:11.720]  him in reelection. Oh, screw you. Screw you. Christopher Ray covered up child abuse. How
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:20.160]  about that? He should be fired yesterday, perhaps even in jail for a criminal coverup
[1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:31.600]  of child abuse and treason. We know who you are Chris Ray. We had doubts, but now we know
[1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:37.240]  you covered up the Biden family crimes. You covered up the treason. You covered up the
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:47.040]  sex abuse. You did Chris Ray. You'll be lucky if you get fired. Chris Ray would be lucky
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:52.880]  if he got fired. He should be thrown into the same jail cell as Hunter Biden and Joe
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:46:03.880]  Biden. Trump can't fire these heads fast enough. Christopher Ray needs to go to jail. CIA
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:09.480]  director Haspel needs to be gone. Defense Secretary Mark Esper needs to be gone. Not
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:15.440]  when you get reelected Trump now, now. And you know, here's what he's being told. Believe
[1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:19.560]  me, Trump wants to fire all these people. See, and this is the problem with these DC
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:27.120]  politicians. They're weak. They're weak. They're pathetic. They live in fear. So they're telling
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:31.480]  Trump, don't fire Ray, don't fire Haspel, not before the election. That'll be bad. It'll
[1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:36.600]  be bad. It'll be bad, Mr. President. The polls, the polls, the people, the poll. No, let me
[1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:43.400]  tell you something. If Trump fired these three heads of the CIA, the FBI and the, uh, the
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:50.480]  Defense Secretary, that would motivate people to go vote for Trump even more. You think the
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:47:00.920]  FBI is popular? You think the CIA is popular? Give me a break. But that's, that's corrupt
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:10.800]  swamp DC pussy territory is what it is. These little, sorry, these little wussies, these
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:16.200]  little wussies, these little wuss bags, they come to President Trump because he's banging
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:20.400]  on the desk like, what the hell is Chris Ray doing? And they say, sir, you can't get
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:24.440]  rid of Chris Ray before the election. It'll be bad. Sir, you can't get rid of Gina Haspel
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:31.680]  before the election. It'll be bad. Was you are weak. And that's the advice that they
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:35.400]  give him. So Trump says, fine, I'll wait till after the election. No, President Trump, your
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:43.880]  instincts are right. Fire them now. And your poll numbers will go up into the fake pandemic
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:48.720]  now. Your poll numbers will go up. But he see again, all of these wuss bags, all of these
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:53.000]  pus filled maggots in DC come into the White House. They say, no, president, you can't
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.480]  do that. The people are scared. No, president, you can't do that. It'll be bad for your
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:02.920]  reelection. A bunch of sad sacks who haven't lived a day in reality for their whole lives.
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:07.160]  They sit in DC playing with their little, their little tiddly wink DC games, these little
[1:48:07.160 --> 1:48:14.680]  political games they like to play. Like, I'm in DC. I have power. You're sick. You're
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:20.400]  human filth. You're wuss bags, you're maggots, you're turds. And it's time for Trump to throw
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:24.320]  all you out. They're the ones giving Trump the bad advice. They're the ones stopping
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:28.040]  info war stories from getting to Trump's desk. Now they're starting to get to Trump's
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:31.160]  desk. They're starting to get to Trump's ear and his rally sound more like an info wars
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:35.840]  broadcast than ever before. And what do you know? His rallies are bigger than ever before.
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:44.000]  Go figure because the truth wins out. Not this wuss bag, maggot DC swamp mentality. That's
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.840]  a losing attitude. It's been losing for 50 years. That's how Joe Biden's been able to
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:52.680]  get away with all this crime because of all the wuss bag maggots in the swamp saying, oh,
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:58.600]  we don't go after our own. Christopher Ray sits on Hunter Biden's laptop protects him
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:09.640]  from child sex abuse. What the hell's wrong with you, Ray? The latest from Gateway Pundit.
[1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:18.220]  By the way, guys, is Jim Hoff on with me on the war room later today? Okay, we're working
[1:49:18.220 --> 1:49:26.440]  on getting him aligned today. He may already be confirmed. I don't know. Anyway, the latest
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:31.320]  from Project or excuse me, Gateway Pundit, Project Veritas also has breaking news today.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:39.120]  More election theft that they caught him on tape. But text messages show Vice President
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:46.360]  Biden and his wife colluded to suppress Hunter's actions with a certain minor. And they have
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:51.080]  all the text documented here. And more is coming out, folks. And look, I'm just going
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:56.200]  to tell you it's not just Hunter Biden. It's others. It's other Democrats. It's other members
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:08.040]  of the media and it's their kids. I wonder how much of this is going to come out, though.
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:17.400]  Why is Hunter Biden on tape doing all of this stuff? Why is Hunter Biden on tape doing all
[1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:20.960]  of this stuff? Why is he shooting some of it himself? Why does some of it appear to be
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:25.120]  like maybe undercover camera from a from a television or something? What is really going
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:35.240]  on here? Who owns the Bidens? Who owns our politicians? Who is blackmailing these people?
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:39.560]  Remember it came out during the Epstein testimonies, how Epstein had the tapes on everybody. Pretty
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:43.520]  much video tapes of everybody engaged in sexual acts, probably even with minors and other
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:48.040]  such stuff. Who knows what else he had. Why is all this footage of Hunter Biden doing this
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:56.880]  out there? Why? Why? It's all blackmail, folks. This is how the blackmail complex, the compromised
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:06.800]  blackmailed individual complex works. So you either have somebody tap into your computer
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:11.280]  or cell phone and get video footage of you or take documents off of it and blackmail
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:15.960]  you. Or you have to do it yourself or do it at a party or do it at some event and then
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:23.320]  send it to join the club as part of the blackmail. Folks, I'm telling you right now, everybody
[1:51:23.320 --> 1:51:32.160]  knows Joe Biden molests kids. Okay? Everybody's seen it. And if you want to see how bad it
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:38.960]  gets, just wait and see, folks. More is coming out. Joe Biden molests kids.
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:44.240]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:49.840]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:56.120]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:02.080]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:07.680]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:14.160]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:21.200]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:52:21.200 --> 1:52:27.360]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:33.760]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:39.640]  a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:16.040]  Joe Biden has called it a lid on the rest of the campaign. That's right. In a pitiful
[1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:22.160]  historical move, Joe Biden will not be campaigning to a smattering of people honking in their
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:32.680]  cars in the last week before election Tuesday. Well, I suppose you can't blame Joe Biden.
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:42.160]  More Trump supporters have been turning up at his rallies than his own supporters. This
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:49.000]  as the Hunter Biden emails emerge with disturbing photos and video of Hunter doing his thing,
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:54.080]  smoking crack and fornicating with hookers. With the outside possibility of bombshell
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:55:00.280]  evidence dropping this week of Hunter abusing underage girls, it doesn't take much to realize
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:05.400]  that Joe must have set a fine example. There is no controversy about my son. It's all
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:10.880]  lost. It's a flat lie because the president has nothing else to run on. If you notice
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:14.920]  that while American people are talking about what's happening to their families, he has
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:19.200]  no plan and the debate, he has no plan. Everything from the Wall Street Journal, every other
[1:55:19.200 --> 1:55:25.880]  major news outlet has said what he's saying is simply not true about my son. But it's
[1:55:25.880 --> 1:55:32.640]  classic Trump, classic Trump. Now text message evidence has emerged revealing
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:38.000]  that Joe Biden knew about claims that Hunter was sexually inappropriate with a minor.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.640]  The text detail a mother accusing Hunter Biden of inappropriate contact with her child and
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:49.080]  told Joe Biden that the police would be called if Hunter came near the minor again. Joe's
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:55.160]  brother Jim sent a text to Hunter with a plan to silence the mother. The child in question
[1:55:55.160 --> 1:56:01.560]  is allegedly a relative of Joe and hunters. Apparently a lot has been transpiring behind
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:07.960]  the scenes as Joe Biden juggles a corruption scandal, a potential child abuse cover up
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:14.080]  and a presidential campaign simultaneously. Is old Joe calling a lid because of his son's
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:20.680]  debacle or does Joe already know something we don't? We have put together, I think the
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:31.320]  most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.960]  Meanwhile, 60 minutes and the rest of the pro-democrat propaganda circus will struggle
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:42.440]  to keep Joe Biden's campaign of lies alive. I can make sure every single person qualifies
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:45.960]  community college can go and we still have a lot of money left over. That's what I mean
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:51.080]  by significant institutional changes. The nonpartisan tax policy center and others have
[1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:56.080]  questioned whether Joe Biden's corporate minimum tax plan would raise as much money as he
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:01.680]  estimates. After our interview, Mr. Biden's staff told us he misspoke and that the cost
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:09.600]  of free public college could be twice as much as he said. Do you think that your tweets
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.520]  and your name calling are turning people off? No, I think I wouldn't be here if I didn't
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:20.880]  have social media. But the media is fake and frankly, if I didn't have social media, I'd
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:24.960]  have no way of getting out of my voice. Do you know what you told me a long time ago
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:32.160]  when I asked why you keep saying fake media? You said to me, I say that because I need
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:37.480]  to discredit you so that when you say negative things about me, no one will believe you.
[1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:41.360]  I don't have to discredit you. But that's what you told me. You've discredited yourself.
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:51.320]  I'll see you in a little while. Thanks. Be careful. Expect to see one presidential candidate
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:57.680]  relentlessly hitting the trail during the most important week before the most important election
[1:57:57.680 --> 1:58:03.240]  concerning the future of the United States. The only one that has truly faced the hypocrisy
[1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:11.960]  head on, Donald J. Trump, John Bown reporting. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:15.880]  calls a lid on his campaign as it comes out of all his crimes, all his treason and all
[1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:21.360]  the sexual, six sexual, seductive fantasies of him and his family. And now Christopher
[1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:27.120]  Ray covering all of it up probably needs to be thrown into a jail cell with the Bidens.
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:32.040]  But coming up next, Patrick Halley is on the march, ladies and gentlemen, breaking news
[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:39.200]  in the Biden crime family. And now the massive attempt by the Democrats to steal Texas. We
[1:58:39.200 --> 1:58:42.760]  knew they were coming in Pennsylvania and Florida and Michigan and Minnesota. They've
[1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:49.040]  been caught. Now they've been caught in Texas. That story coming up next. I admire President
[1:58:49.040 --> 1:58:55.880]  Trump. He's really proven himself to be unmatched. His wit, his focus, his commitment, his energy.
[1:58:55.880 --> 1:59:00.920]  And I just want to affirm my admiration for President Trump. He's not God. He's not an
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:08.040]  angel. He's not perfect. But the way he has used judo on the forces of the New World Order
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:14.720]  has been really incredible. The way he's pragmatically stood up for prosperity and basic freedom.
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:21.000]  And the way he stood up against these America hating, God hating, family hating trash is
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.240]  beautiful. And I'm serious. I was just bringing tears to my eyes, driving to work this morning,
[1:59:25.240 --> 1:59:29.880]  thinking about President Trump. I just want to say I admire the president so much. And
[1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:34.840]  I appreciate you, the listeners and everybody for what you've done. I admire you. That's
[1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:40.160]  what you call it. Thank me, folks. I admire you. I admire Trump. I admire all of you
[1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:44.040]  that are involved in this fight. And I just wish I could do more. We're going to win this
[1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:47.640]  fight together. This election is so important. Please pray for President Trump.
[1:59:47.640 --> 2:00:01.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer. You're listening to the
[2:00:01.320 --> 2:00:10.280]  Alex Jones show.
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:17.000]  The headline at nationalfile.com, exclusive Texas poll watcher testifies on 2020 voter
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:24.040]  fraud in Houston has photos. Texas poll watcher Raymond T. Stewart, a retired police officer
[2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:28.840]  submitted a sworn affidavit Thursday that was provided to the Harris County district
[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:34.720]  attorney's office and exclusively obtained by national file. Patrick Halley has a story
[2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:40.640]  and joins me from national file.com now. Uh, while Patrick, uh, I'm wondering if you're
[2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:45.280]  sleeping these days with all the news that you're breaking a national file. Uh, so scoop
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:50.240]  us. What is going on here? Uh, we know they were trying to steal Pennsylvania and Florida.
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:54.600]  We talked about that last week. They got caught in Minnesota, so they may have to back off.
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:57.160]  But Texas, they've been caught in Texas now.
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:02.280]  Well, I sleep with one eye open, uh, Owen. And one of my sources on the story has had
[2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:07.640]  some very dangerous situations. Um, these people played dirty. Now, what happens here
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:15.480]  is, uh, this voter fraud ring has been going on for a while. There is a number of, um,
[2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:21.440]  people who have already been indicted in Greg County. Now, um, by attorney general Paxton
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.480]  stemming back from 2018 when they were doing this, Harris County, they were doing this.
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:28.840]  They were caught on tape going into the nursing homes, getting the nursing home residents
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:34.600]  to sign off their X. A nursing home resident was even denied food until he or she agreed
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:38.440]  to vote for the candidate that the nursing home is forcing them to vote for. So this
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:42.440]  has been going on and this has been going on under the watch of a man named Dallas Jones,
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:47.600]  who was recently hired to be the Texas political director for the Joe Biden campaign on, uh,
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:01:53.840]  Saturday over a week ago, Dallas Jones disappeared. He's usually a public guy. He's usually like
[2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:59.120]  the mayor of Harris County. He's out there shaking hands. He was, he, he disappeared.
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:04.440]  We have numerous sources saying that he was picked up by the FBI sources within the FBI
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:11.000]  told us that he wasn't necessarily picked up, but implied that he was interrogated voluntarily.
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:15.920]  So you know, my FBI source says, look, when you interrogate somebody like this, you put
[2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:21.600]  them up in a hotel, uh, you sequester them and then the interrogation goes on for days.
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:27.040]  Um, now, uh, yesterday on Sunday, Dallas Jones was spotted for the first time in over a week
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.200]  at the fountain of praise church in Houston. So this is the first time we've seen Dallas
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:37.400]  Jones. There are rumors that the Joe Biden campaign has technically fired him for damage
[2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:42.800]  control reasons, but here's what's really going on. The FBI has been investigating this.
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:47.320]  I know that for a fact, the FBI knows exactly what's going on with the fake IDs and the
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:54.400]  fraudulent voting and the fraudulent drive-through voting. They are trying to do their bare minimum
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:59.520]  to try to stop this as FBI agents while keeping it silent, while trying to not get it out
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:04.640]  into the press while, you know, massaging the reporters there, the Democrat reporters
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.040]  in Houston, Texas, not to talk about it. And then we see Chris Ray coming out saying,
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:14.320]  Oh, the, the reports of voter fraud are the Iranians. It's Iranian disinformation sending
[2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:19.000]  a message to the rank and file agents, shut up about these investigations. And if anybody
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:23.280]  talks about voter fraud, then it's Iran who's spreading that kind of misinformation. So
[2:03:23.280 --> 2:03:27.280]  the orders are coming down from the top from the FBI, shut up about this stuff, but I'm
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:34.120]  not going to. Well, Chris Ray, at this point, uh, to me is, is involved in criminal activity.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:38.720]  I mean, I think we gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was at, at worst, just hapless
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:44.640]  up there and inactive. Now it looks like he's actively covering up crimes. The sexual abuse
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:49.960]  of even children by the Biden family, the illegal payouts, millions of dollars from
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:54.560]  foreign nations to the Biden family. And now this just blatant election theft that's going
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:59.240]  on in Texas. Now here's why I've said this for a while. I've been worried about Texas
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:03.920]  going blue a because they move in all these people from California and they're turning
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:09.360]  Austin, Texas into Los Angeles, bringing in Google campuses, Apple campuses, Facebook,
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.240]  all these other things. So they bring in these leftist, these liberal voters. And then they
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:18.440]  just do outright fraud here in Harris County and in Texas, the Travis County Republicans,
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:25.680]  the GOP is weak. I mean, weak as a wet noodle. Uh, thank God that we have, uh, Colonel Allen
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:29.520]  West as the head of the Texas GOP. Now, otherwise I really believe that the Democrats would
[2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:33.840]  get away with this stuff. I really believe the Democrats thought that this was the year
[2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:38.600]  they would turn Texas blue. And thank God, Allen West is the head of the GOP now to fight
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:42.000]  some of this on the Republican side, because the Republicans don't fight this. They let
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:46.880]  this happen. They've been letting this happen. Absolutely right. The Republicans don't know
[2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.800]  how to fight most of the time. President Trump is the only one who has taught them how to
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:54.840]  fight and they all get dragged along and they, you know, roll their eyes about it as though
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:59.680]  somehow it's uncouth for them to actually engage in politics. The Republican party is
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:04.040]  going to go down in history as controlled opposition. And you're right. We've got Colonel
[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:09.480]  West, uh, leading the Texas GOP, which is good. Um, but you know, if it wasn't for me
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:13.760]  and if it wasn't for a couple of private investigators, former law enforcement people, a very brave
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:17.680]  poll watcher, we, this stuff would not be out there. The media would cover it up. The
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:21.600]  Republicans wouldn't do anything about it. So we're standing up to the entire machine.
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:26.280]  We're standing up to the entire Democrat voter fraud behemoth and we're doing this ourselves.
[2:05:26.280 --> 2:05:30.400]  And thankfully, uh, President Trump is receptive to it. I believe that Bill Steppi and the
[2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:35.040]  campaign manager is receptive to it. I know that they are plotting a strategy for what
[2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:39.040]  happens in the overtime period after election day. So we've got to be grateful that we have
[2:05:39.040 --> 2:05:42.960]  Trump as the Republican candidate, because if it was Romney or McCain or Nikki Haley
[2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:46.240]  or one of these other folks, they would not be fighting. They would concede an election
[2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:47.240]  night.
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:53.360]  And of course, Project Veritas caught the Beto campaign involved in all kinds of criminal
[2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:57.600]  activity as well. Nothing was done about that. They got away with all that with, uh, with
[2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:02.240]  absolutely no punishment. So maybe this story will be the same way, but, uh, it sounds like
[2:06:02.240 --> 2:06:07.240]  there's at least some interest from law enforcement. But you know, uh, thank God that you broke
[2:06:07.240 --> 2:06:13.400]  this story. Now other people are having to pick it up as well. Uh, uh, here's a story
[2:06:13.400 --> 2:06:19.560]  from Texas 2020 elections on, uh, the Texas Tribune. Voters in Harris County may continue
[2:06:19.560 --> 2:06:24.840]  using drive-thru voting, the Taco Bell style voting, as you call it. Texas Supreme Court
[2:06:24.840 --> 2:06:28.760]  rules. So I mean, that's how they get away with the fraud. Texas Attorney General Ken
[2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:32.600]  Paxton warns election officials against expanding curbside voting. So they're just going to
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:39.400]  do it anyway. Uh, Biden's Texas political director implicated in massive mail-in ballot
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:43.560]  harvesting sheen. And, uh, of course, again, that was broke by you, even covered in the
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:49.000]  Tennessee star, uh, Politico where Texas could actually turn blue in 2020. Highlighting Harris
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:55.480]  County is one of them because they know where the election fraud, uh, goes down. So I mean,
[2:06:55.480 --> 2:07:00.920]  how can we let this happen? Mail-in ballots, Taco Bell drive-up voting. I mean, this is
[2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:05.080]  just, it's really just a joke. I mean, it's so obviously rampant for corruption. The fact
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:07.720]  that we even accepted this at face value is kind of sad.
[2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:13.640]  Yes, it is kind of sad. And it's sad that we walk around with masks. I don't obviously,
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:17.320]  I don't wear a mask. I refuse to wear a mask. And so, you know, what we're seeing now with the
[2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:21.400]  great reset, what we're seeing with this election fraud, this is a plan. It's been ready to go.
[2:07:21.400 --> 2:07:26.840]  You can look at the photo that, um, that is out there of Dr. Anthony Fauci with Bill Gates and
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:33.720]  Bill Gates senior in George Soros, Ted Turner, uh, David Rockefeller back in 2001. Um, this club has
[2:07:33.720 --> 2:07:38.600]  been plotting what they're going to do in 2020. And now you could see it on the cover of either
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:44.440]  time or Newsweek talking about the great reset, the great reset after the scandemic of coronavirus.
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:49.720]  So, um, they have had this ready to go. They've been planning to do it in 2020 and we are in
[2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:54.760]  the fishbowl. We're in the middle of this right now and it's, there's only a few sane people left.
[2:07:54.760 --> 2:08:00.840]  The, um, way that the normies are now getting so emotional and hysterical about reciting these
[2:08:00.840 --> 2:08:05.240]  talking points, it shows that they're fearful too. They're scared. They're scared like in any
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:09.160]  communist takeover that they're going to be wiped out. They're going to be sent to the FEMA camps
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:14.440]  unless they do like in North Korea at the great leaders funeral and cry and show that they're
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:18.040]  super into it. That's what's happening in the United States of America right now. It's mind
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:23.400]  control. It's sad to see, but you know what? It's dangerous to be somebody like you and me who are
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:27.080]  outside of the matrix, but that's okay. I don't care. I live a dangerous life.
[2:08:28.040 --> 2:08:32.600]  Oh, well, what is it? The old saying goes, I'd rather live in dangerous freedom than safe
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:41.480]  slavery. What is the exact saying? I think I'd rather live, um, standing than, uh, you know,
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:46.680]  I die standing than live on my knees. Yeah. I also like to live dangerously.
[2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:52.840]  Yeah. You know it, but you know, it's sad. I mean, the guy comes up to me. They death threat us
[2:08:52.840 --> 2:08:57.080]  now. I mean, we got it all on tape. I mean, how pathetic is that? I can't even get an arrest
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.760]  of people when it's on tape. They death threat me. It's on tape. They assault me. It's on tape.
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:04.840]  They spit on me. It happens right in front of police officers. And it is like no interest.
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:09.720]  I have to, I have to harass and harang APD just to move on the guy who does a death threat with me.
[2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:15.000]  I got his face. I got the video. I got the license plate. I got him saying it, everything,
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:19.800]  no action, no response. So it's the same thing though with voter fraud, isn't it? It's like,
[2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:25.160]  Hey, here they are committing voter fraud. Eh, it just happened with Rudy Giuliani. He was driving
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:30.280]  down the street in New York City and mobbed absolutely mobbed by the left. And even the NYPD,
[2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:34.920]  which Rudy Giuliani was a hero of, didn't do anything about it. That's the guy who let us
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:40.680]  through 9 11. This country is going down. If the left gets their way, it's going down.
[2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:45.480]  Patrick Halley, let's get, let's continue this conversation on the other side of this break.
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:51.080]  Six months ago, the highly respected former head of the Rockefeller hospital,
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:58.920]  virology department went public and said the mainline science on virology is you cannot protect
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:03.960]  somebody from a virus like this. You have to wait till there's herd immunity and there's never been
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:10.040]  a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses. They do not work. Well, even Bill Gates
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:14.680]  now admits, Oh, the vaccine will really never work. But you have to keep social distancing
[2:10:14.680 --> 2:10:19.640]  and wearing masks. They're now saying forever. Last week, it was 10 years. Now it's forever.
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:24.280]  See how the power grab works. So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and a sheep
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:28.280]  escape or surrender to coronavirus, when they say we had just have to learn to live with it and
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:34.280]  boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and of course, sink. That's the reality.
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:39.240]  That's not fear mongering. That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:43.560]  new world order. They create a problem to which there is no solution. But they are again the
[2:10:43.560 --> 2:10:50.520]  people that said they're going to be in charge. China is open. America is closed. And in the
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:55.080]  European Union, where the people are revolting, trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny,
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:11:00.840]  they're also under even greater levels of lockdown. It's very simple. We're authoritarians already
[2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:06.200]  have complete control of commerce China. Oh, there's no more lockdowns in their heroes. The UN
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:11.720]  says they're the example for assault. After all, that's where the virus came from. After all, that's
[2:11:11.720 --> 2:11:17.560]  where the fear mongering came from. The lockdown came from. But that was a weapon, a psychological
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:26.360]  hysteria, a chicken little syndrome being created that was to be aimed at us and used to invoke
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:32.920]  our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria. And so far, it's been incredibly
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:38.360]  successful. Until just the last few weeks, as across the world, humanity awakens in the fact
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:43.560]  that COVID-19 is a giant UN, communist Chinese world government power grab.
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:50.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:50.680 --> 2:12:05.000]  You know, it's really an incredible phenomenon that we're seeing right now with law enforcement
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:11.000]  and how one sided it is. And I get the point here because it's like, look,
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:18.360]  I can go out and say, I have all these rallies, I go to all these events, we get on the bullhorn,
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:23.320]  we go in the truck and we say support Austin police. We love the police. Thank you police.
[2:12:23.320 --> 2:12:26.920]  We go and organize events to show support for them back to blue and all this stuff.
[2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:33.880]  And then I get death threaded. I get attacked. Nothing. They don't have my back. I have their
[2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:40.600]  back. They don't have my back. Now, I get it because you're a police officer. You're in law
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:43.880]  enforcement. You're not supposed to be political. You're not supposed to be biased. You call it
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:47.480]  right down the right down the middle. Now me getting a death threat. I don't know how that's
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:50.360]  political, but fine. Okay. Fine. Don't, don't, don't investigate a death threat against the
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:57.240]  employer, but oh, they'll shut down the state capital. They'll shut down parks folks in Austin,
[2:12:57.240 --> 2:13:03.160]  Texas. They we've got, you know, parks that have basketball courts. They literally went and took
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:10.680]  the rims down. So like they're totally politicized for the Democrats though, totally politicized
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:15.400]  for the city council that demonized them and voted to fund them totally politicized to protect
[2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:22.120]  the Democrat mayor, but oh, somebody that has their back. No, then they're not interested.
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:27.560]  They don't want to be considered political. I mean, I don't know what to do about that. It's
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:32.120]  such, everything is just such a clown world. Patrick Halley is with me. You know, what do you
[2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:35.960]  make of that dynamic? And then I want to kind of talk about electoral college projections,
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:41.160]  but I mean, what do you make of that dynamic, Patrick? Because it's everywhere. Like in New
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:47.080]  York, a police officer just got suspended for saying Trump 2020 in Nashville, a Trump supporter
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:52.840]  gets arrested for not having a mask on her face, a whole team of police. But in New York and LA and
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:57.160]  all these counties, police get ambushed, they get shot, they get harassed, they get terrorized.
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:02.360]  We have their back and we don't get it reciprocated. I mean, what do you make of that?
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:10.920]  Well, I never got too wrapped up in the huge back to blue kind of stuff coming from Bill O'Reilly,
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:16.360]  all those years or Fox News. But I, you know, I appreciate the police in terms of some of the
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:21.240]  things that they do. But right now we're in the middle of a great reset. And many of the police
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:27.880]  are operatives for the great reset. You mentioned taking down the hoops of the basketball on the
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:32.600]  basketball courts. I mean, this is what we're seeing. They are going to take everything away
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:37.000]  from us. They're going to consolidate all the wealth and the power at the top. And they are just
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:41.400]  going to humiliate us. And that's what's going on. The World Economic Forum said back in 2016,
[2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:46.040]  you know, in the future, you'll own nothing and you'll be happy. And that's really what's going
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:51.640]  on now. And so part of the great reset is also the Green New Deal, where they're going to knock
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:56.600]  down all the buildings in the country because they're not, you know, in line with whatever
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:01.000]  Alejandro Acasio Cortez says about climate change. Are they going to go around and rebuild all those
[2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:06.680]  buildings? No, it's a great reset. They're destroying us. They're knocking everything down.
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:12.760]  And they are literally declaring war against us. And a lot of people are too blind to see it.
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:17.960]  Yeah. And you know, you mentioned the great reset. Here's what it really comes down to.
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:24.120]  The global great reset, as you've been reporting on, as you said, has been planned and in the works
[2:15:24.120 --> 2:15:28.920]  for decades. They've been planning for this global reset for decades. Trump got in and he wants an
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:34.040]  American reset. He wants an American reset where the cities that have been so destroyed by these
[2:15:34.040 --> 2:15:39.160]  bad trade deals with empty factories and roads falling apart, bad infrastructure, old airplanes,
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:44.520]  old airports. He wants the American reset. He wants money to go into the American infrastructure,
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:50.680]  new roads, new airports, skyscrapers, rebuilding and getting the manufacturing facilities back
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:55.640]  up and running. That's the American reset. Oh, but see, you can't have a world reset,
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:59.960]  a new world order reset. If America has its own reset, and we still have private property,
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:05.080]  because that's what it's all about. We have private property. We have free speech. We have guns.
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:08.600]  They have to take all of that away to bring in the new world order.
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:15.320]  Right. It's that's the fundamental difference is it's between building America or destroying America
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:21.960]  and trampling on it and stomping on it. So there's nothing the Democrats can say that can ever convince
[2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:26.440]  me that they actually care about America. They're trying to crush it. And it's really unfortunate
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:30.760]  that a lot of these people think that the Democrats are still, you know, thinking about their own
[2:16:30.760 --> 2:16:37.720]  interests or whatever. It's just not the case. They are, they see America as the last big
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:42.760]  opposition to the new world order. In addition to Russia, they also see Russia as a big opposition
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:48.680]  to the new world order. And they actually think that Brazil under Bolsonaro is a problem to them.
[2:16:48.680 --> 2:16:53.000]  So they're spotlighting these different places around the world that they're very concerned
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:57.400]  about. But America is number one. America is their crown jewel. If they can get America
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:04.040]  destroyed this year, next year, then that will pretty much pave the way for the new world order.
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:07.880]  And only Russia will probably be able to keep up any kind of resistance.
[2:17:08.760 --> 2:17:13.800]  Yeah, Russia, the United States and Brazil are kind of the new, I guess, you know,
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:19.320]  anti new world order access of powers with very nationalistic leaders who don't want to fall
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:24.920]  into this new world order trap, which is what it is. Now, that's why this election is so important.
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:28.520]  And I want to get Patrick Halley's take on this, guys, let's pull up the digital
[2:17:29.800 --> 2:17:36.920]  electoral college map here. So this is where, well, let me actually update this.
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:42.440]  I do believe Trump will win Florida now. So guys, let's go ahead and turn Florida.
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:49.720]  Okay, yeah, what I'm worried about, though, here, put Michigan and Minnesota brown,
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:54.920]  I was nervous about New Hampshire, but then Trump had that massive rally in New Hampshire
[2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:59.080]  yesterday. I think Trump will win New Hampshire, but here's what I'm afraid of. We will overcome the
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:04.920]  voter fraud in Florida and Texas, but I'm worried about Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota. They
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:09.720]  ain't back off in Minnesota where they've been caught. But with that dirtbag governor Whitmer,
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:13.400]  and that dirtbag governor Tom Wolf in Philadelphia with all the voter fraud,
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:18.120]  I'm afraid that they could steal those two states. Trump could still potentially win. But
[2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:22.440]  what do you make of that map? Do you have any differences in your analysis right now or what?
[2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:26.280]  Well, we're going to have to fight really hard in the states that you mentioned,
[2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:29.560]  because Michigan has already announced that they're not going to announce an election night.
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:33.480]  They're going to drag the thing out. In Pennsylvania now, you have the very corrupt
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:37.960]  Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has ruled that you don't even need to have the ballot postmarked
[2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.840]  by election day now. It can still be counted three days after election day. And by the way,
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:49.000]  the signature on the ballot, on the paper ballot, doesn't even have to match the signature on the
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:53.720]  voter registration. So it's very brazen what's going on in Pennsylvania, specifically in Philadelphia.
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:58.040]  You see those big lines in Philadelphia, all the people dancing, all the Democrats dancing in
[2:18:58.040 --> 2:19:03.800]  their masks. It's a tough, tough thing. I've been on to Philadelphia for a long time. That stupid
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:09.560]  mail and ballot mailbox that they have outside of Philly City Hall, they actually had to move it during
[2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:15.720]  the riots, during the George Floyd riots. So the whole thing is just a mess and it's nonsense and
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:21.080]  chaos. In Pennsylvania, it is such a corrupt state. I love the people of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:26.040]  was so key to our win last time. The politics of Pennsylvania, it's like a third world country.
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:30.600]  It's like a banana republic. It truly is because of the Democrats. And then you've got this authoritarian
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:37.960]  Karen, the Alpha Karen Whitmer up in Michigan. And so the Alpha Karen, she's the Alpha Karen,
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:42.680]  she is Karen. And she really looks demonic. If you look at her face, like she was probably
[2:19:42.680 --> 2:19:48.040]  attractive a few years ago, but there's so much evil. Yeah, that's like a mask. Yeah, she's like
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:54.840]  as a mask on her face. Yes. And I've seen Kamala look like that too. It may actually be demonic
[2:19:54.840 --> 2:20:00.680]  possession. It's possible. Well, I don't think it's possible. I think it's very probable, very plausible.
[2:20:00.680 --> 2:20:05.240]  But no, it is a weird thing. I mean, because look, you know, you don't want to say that everybody is
[2:20:05.240 --> 2:20:09.720]  something they're not. I mean, we know about Big Michael, Obama, but it just makes you question
[2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:13.720]  all these people when they have these weird fake eyebrows and fake everything. You just,
[2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:19.960]  you just never know. COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out,
[2:20:19.960 --> 2:20:24.840]  and it's been incrementally orchestrated. First, it's 15 days to keep the hospital's empty. That's
[2:20:24.840 --> 2:20:29.320]  all life. Then it's two months, then it's six months, then it's a year. Now Bill Gates has 10
[2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:35.560]  years. And people are not saying, I like my mask. I like my face diaper. I like my beaky. And so
[2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:41.160]  getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria, getting into all the exaggerated death numbers,
[2:20:42.040 --> 2:20:49.160]  this is our new neurotic control freak society, overseen by robots, overseen by AI,
[2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:55.560]  and all of it is designed to make humans non-essential. Apply out of the gates. They
[2:20:55.560 --> 2:21:02.360]  tell us you are non-essential. You are non-essential. Your company, your restaurant,
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:09.880]  your job, your profession is not essential. This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated,
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:13.320]  and Bill Gates sits on top of it. Come on, folks, let's reject this.
[2:21:13.320 --> 2:21:20.520]  With two weeks left until the historic election, we're launching the biggest sell of the year,
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:26.440]  the top some already amazing sales. It's Black Friday comes in October special,
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:30.680]  something we did last year that was very, very popular. We did it for the whole month last year.
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:34.280]  We can only do it for 11 days till the end of the month because
[2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:38.200]  stocks are low and a lot of our best selling products. But two things that came back in
[2:21:38.200 --> 2:21:44.600]  and that we're now announcing at 50% off with free shipping is Ultra 12, incredible high-quality

[2:22:07.080 --> 2:22:13.320]  of Black Friday comes in October sale at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:21.000]  three, one, three, nine. It was 30 months ago that info wars and of course yours truly Alex Jones
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:27.240]  was banned on more than 60 major platforms in one day led by the CEO of Apple Tim Cook who
[2:22:27.240 --> 2:22:32.200]  helps China run giant death camps. Always just let that be in the back of your mind when we talk
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:38.200]  about these monsters and where they're taking us. They have no bottom. And people said, Jones, how
[2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:41.720]  are you taking it? And I said, I'm taking it just fine. They're coming for you next. This is a
[2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:46.200]  technocracy. They're merging with Big Pharma. They're taking over the media. This is a digital
[2:22:46.200 --> 2:22:51.560]  psychological dictatorship in their own words. This is a planetary takeover. They're then going
[2:22:51.560 --> 2:22:57.880]  to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats. That's so the wireless system
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:01.800]  can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover. How did I know all this
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:07.400]  would happen? Because they've been saying they're going to do it. You see, it's not that I'm psychic.
[2:23:07.400 --> 2:23:11.080]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying. So you have to understand
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:14.680]  as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me. It comes from them.
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:32.920]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:38.200]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:44.040]  comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest
[2:23:44.040 --> 2:23:50.040]  band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[2:23:50.040 --> 2:23:53.800]  tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action,
[2:23:53.800 --> 2:23:59.400]  you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:03.880]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:15.320]  email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:31.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:31.160 --> 2:24:53.560]  Oh, it's funny. It's Joe. Come on, man. Candy's for the kids. Wait a minute. You look familiar.
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:25:03.400]  Who are you?
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:10.040]  And that pretty much sums it up right there. Are we gonna let her get away with this?
[2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:16.680]  She took everything. That pretty much sums it up right there. Joe Biden 2020 is really Kamala
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:23.880]  Harris 2021 and she is going to rob you blind. I mean, you got to give Joe Biden credit. I mean,
[2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:30.360]  that is a career criminal politician who's gotten away with, I mean, pretty much everything under
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:36.360]  the sun. Kamala Harris will try to do even more. She'll do even more just to prove she's a bigger
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.840]  criminal than Joe. She'll spread her political legs wide open. She'll get on her political
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:47.720]  knees and open up wide for anybody who's willing to make an offer. Just ask Willie Brown.
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:55.800]  Patrick Halley is still with us. Trump is trying to launch the American reset. The globalists want
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:03.320]  the New World Order reset. We're watching closely, folks. Here are the states to watch. Texas,
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:09.720]  Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Florida. Those are the big states that the Democrats
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.880]  are trying to steal. I'm pretty much just giving up Nevada. I think they're going to successfully
[2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:18.360]  steal Nevada. I don't think there's going to be much of a fight there. And I think the six points
[2:26:18.360 --> 2:26:22.200]  there, the six electoral college votes are just kind of not going to come into frame here. So
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:25.560]  we're just going to let the Democrats steal Nevada. I don't believe that they will win,
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:31.640]  but I do believe they will steal it. So what do you think? Can they, they got caught in Minnesota
[2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:36.600]  with Ilhan Omar's campaign, caught in election fraud there. No arrests have been made that I'm
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:40.920]  aware of. No FBI investigation. So they got away with it, but they got caught, but they got away
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:46.120]  with it legally. You know about Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. You know about the millions and
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:52.520]  millions of million ballots. You know about the corrupt governor up there in Michigan.
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:57.400]  They know that election theft is their only hope. They know it. They see the Biden events.
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:03.160]  Nobody shows up. The Trump events, tens of thousands of people show up. But what do we do
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:07.240]  if they get away with this? Patrick, what do we do if they get away with the theft in Pennsylvania?
[2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:10.600]  What do we do if they get away with the theft in Michigan? What do we do if they get away
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:14.600]  with this theft and they steal this election from us? Everybody knows even Trump, that's their only
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:20.040]  hope. Well, first of all, think about how surreal it must be to be Willie Brown right now and see
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:24.760]  your piece Kamala become potentially the next president of the United States for all intents
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:30.360]  and purposes. Willie used to be the power in that relationship and you know, it's gone against Willie
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:35.560]  in recent years. But you know, in terms of what happens if they actually do steal it,
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:40.120]  that's a good question. And that's something that I talk about with people all over the country
[2:27:40.840 --> 2:27:47.320]  every single day. Day in and day out, I talk about that. And nobody really quite knows what is
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:53.320]  going to happen yet. There's not going to be a civil war if only one side is fighting in a civil
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:58.040]  war. If the left is rampaging around and destroying people and destroying buildings and assaulting
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:03.400]  people, the conservatives generally don't do that. Conservatives generally like stable civil
[2:28:03.400 --> 2:28:07.960]  society. And so much of the Republican talking points among the base in recent years has been
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:12.680]  about, oh, well, you know, we love immigrants even more than Democrats. And, you know, we're
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:18.440]  less racist than they are. They're the real racists. And we love LGBTs even more. And that's all
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:24.840]  fine and good. I don't care. But, you know, that's that's not that's not like a Rambo rallying cry,
[2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:28.440]  you know? So, you know, it's it's a tough thing to say. I think you're going to see a lot of
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:33.720]  Republican subversion. I think you're going to see Karl Rove over there on Fox News working against
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:39.080]  us starting on election night. I think you're going to see potentially Ron McDaniel get activated
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:44.520]  by the globalists and her uncle to work against us. And then you've got a lot of these Republican
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:50.840]  Rino governors like Doug Roscoe, AKA Doug Ducey, the governor in Arizona, who comes from an organized
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:57.080]  crime family, who doesn't even talk to the state party chairwoman Kelly Ward. So Kelly Ward is
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:02.600]  a conservative. Doug Ducey is a total corrupt Democrat idiot who wanted to keep the state
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:07.640]  locked down forever. He's not going to be on our side. So you're going to see all of those
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:11.720]  Republicans who are really angry about Trump winning in the first place, all of a sudden being
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:18.360]  subversive, activating and going against us is yet again going to just be a small number of us
[2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:23.320]  who are going to really put up a fight for America. And I say that peacefully, a peaceful fight for
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:27.080]  America, but we're not going to surrender this country and we're not going to allow the Democrats
[2:29:27.080 --> 2:29:32.120]  to take over and then have to wear masks and live under their tyranny and get whipped by these
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:33.240]  people. It's not going to happen.
[2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:39.320]  You know, what is the linchpin in this? Because everybody knows what is holding, say, Trump
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:43.560]  supporters, Republicans, conservatives back. Like you just said, we like being law abiding
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:48.440]  citizens. We like living in society. We like living in civilized society. We like having
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:53.160]  businesses open. We don't like seeing stuff burn to the ground and terrorists run rampant in the
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:58.840]  street. But we don't really do anything about it. We don't really, there is no action. There's no
[2:29:58.840 --> 2:30:02.840]  action on a political level. There's no action on a law enforcement level. I mean, other than
[2:30:02.840 --> 2:30:07.640]  President Trump and a few handful of Republicans, there's pretty much nothing. There's no plan.
[2:30:07.640 --> 2:30:12.760]  There's no action. I mean, so what is the linchpin there? When do we, the people, or how do we,
[2:30:12.760 --> 2:30:18.440]  or how do we, the people measure what is an appropriate response? What is a clear and appropriate
[2:30:18.440 --> 2:30:23.960]  response to everything that the Democrats are doing from the terrorism, to the fake hate crimes,
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:29.960]  to the fake news, to the attacks, to the lawfare? I mean, when do we, the people, decide what is
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:35.080]  justified? And how do we, how do we measure doing that? Because we know the entire system has been
[2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:38.200]  built to go against us, including the police, the law enforcement that we support.
[2:30:38.200 --> 2:30:43.960]  Well, it's fascinating. I think about this a lot. Republican voters who are typically
[2:30:44.520 --> 2:30:49.880]  older and more successful feel plugged into the system. If they have a 401k, if they have social
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:56.680]  security coming to them, they have led a life that has been in relative stability. Objectively
[2:30:56.680 --> 2:31:01.880]  speaking, historically speaking, we've not been stable in the post-war era at all. But it seems
[2:31:01.880 --> 2:31:07.000]  like it's stable because of television and this kind of stuff. And Fox News has always been the
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:12.440]  thought control leader for the Republicans. Fox News, starting with Bill Riley, has always controlled
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:17.480]  the talking points and what people think. And Fox News is very plugged into the deep state and this
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:22.440]  idea that we need to keep the system afloat. And so when you have people like me over the last 10
[2:31:22.440 --> 2:31:26.440]  years, people like Andrew Breypart, others, Tucker Carlson, even, who are starting to say,
[2:31:26.440 --> 2:31:31.720]  hey, this system is against us. The system is designed to crush us. The deep state's not on
[2:31:31.720 --> 2:31:37.080]  our side. Okay, we need to really think about changing the system or operating outside of the
[2:31:37.080 --> 2:31:41.240]  system. The Republicans don't want to hear that. And you begin to see that the Republican Party,
[2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:48.280]  the GOP itself is extremely subverted. The NRA is supporting red flag gun confiscation laws,
[2:31:48.280 --> 2:31:52.920]  which is the mechanism of gun confiscation, especially against veterans. They're propping up
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:58.440]  this system. And the system is left wing. Every year, we get more and more leftist, more and more
[2:31:58.440 --> 2:32:05.080]  radical, more and more toward the Marxist vision, the Bolshevik vision. And the Republicans aren't
[2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:11.560]  putting up any kind of real opposition to it except for Donald Trump. So that's a thing where we
[2:32:11.560 --> 2:32:17.160]  have to really tell people, look, I understand that maybe you have $300,000 in the bank, maybe
[2:32:17.160 --> 2:32:20.760]  you've led a good life, you've saved, you've paid your mortgage and all this and you're proud of
[2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:25.800]  yourself and that's fine. But the system is destroying all of us. And for those of us who are
[2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:31.960]  younger, who are looking at a life of potentially living in a FEMA camp, we need all of the Republican
[2:32:31.960 --> 2:32:35.960]  voters of all ages to come together and say there's something deeply wrong here. And then
[2:32:35.960 --> 2:32:40.040]  we need to start talking about, is there going to be secession on a county by county level?
[2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:44.680]  A lot of Republicans don't want to secede because they love the flag. But if the flag itself becomes
[2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:49.080]  subverted, can we take that flag and say, all right, no, we're going to do a different America
[2:32:49.080 --> 2:32:53.160]  over here? These are the questions that really need to start happening because we either have
[2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:57.560]  these difficult conversations or we spend the rest of our lives in a FEMA camp and the Bill
[2:32:57.560 --> 2:33:02.600]  Crystal Truth and Reconciliation South Africa style mobs come by, burn down your house,
[2:33:02.600 --> 2:33:09.800]  rape your family and kill you. And look, the left or their liberal progressive voters,
[2:33:09.800 --> 2:33:14.280]  whatever you want to call them, these deranged, mentally ill leftists out on the streets,
[2:33:14.280 --> 2:33:19.240]  of course, they're for the system because it takes everything from us and gives everything to them.
[2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:23.880]  They don't own private property. Most of them probably don't even have a savings account.
[2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:28.520]  I guarantee you they're probably all hopped up on drugs or maybe even illegal drugs and foreign
[2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:32.520]  substances. But you know, so they make all these poor decisions, they live their life this way,
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:35.640]  and then they feel they have no hope, no prospects because of their life decisions. So they just
[2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:40.440]  want to take everything from us and give it all to them. That's their ultimate victory. Is it not,
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:47.400]  Patrick Alley? That is Bolshevism. And it obviously props up the people at the very top. The same
[2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:53.320]  thing with the Russian Revolution. The Bolsheviks didn't really gain anything, but the Rothschilds
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:57.720]  and the bankers gained a lot from it. And, you know, we're never going to have socialism. Bloomberg
[2:33:57.720 --> 2:34:01.080]  is never going to give up his money. Soros is never going to give up his money and move to a one
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:05.080]  bedroom in Brooklyn, not that he'd be even be able to afford a one bedroom in Brooklyn. But
[2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:10.680]  yeah, no, the globalist oligarchs are going to do just fine. But this mental illness we're seeing
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:17.000]  in the IRGC. We'll be right back. It's on record. It's not dispute. It was rolled out more than
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:21.480]  eight months ago in communist China. Now it's in Europe now. It's the United States, Canada,
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:26.360]  and most other industrial parts of the planet. Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:33.000]  pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly check their menu. And they really get upset if you
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:36.600]  ask for a paper menu. But of course, they have them. Now, what are they saying there? Well,
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:40.840]  you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't have a piece of
[2:34:40.840 --> 2:34:45.800]  paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading germs. It's absolutely
[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:49.720]  asinine. They can throw away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:54.840]  Now, what this really is, is a contact tracing database. Again, this is admitted that everyone's
[2:34:54.840 --> 2:35:00.600]  being habituated in a scan to be part of. So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially.
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:03.720]  Now, your cell phone's already tracking. You already have home assistants watching and listening
[2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:08.200]  to in your house. But now this is officially rolling the sound where you won't buy or sell,
[2:35:08.200 --> 2:35:12.440]  have a job, get on an airplane without it. And Bill Gates even admits it. So think about that,
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:19.400]  folks, and we'll look out. Vitamin Mineral Fusion and Ultra 12 are now back in stock
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:23.560]  after being sold out for months. They're sold out because people know that high-quality B12
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:29.240]  and a good mix of vitamins, minerals, especially zinc, boost your body's natural defenses and are
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:35.880]  critical to your immune system. Well, both products are back in stock at infowarstore.com
[2:35:35.880 --> 2:35:41.720]  just two weeks after the election. And we're offering them both at 50% off, free shipping,

[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:51.000]  additional 10% off. That makes many of the things we're selling lost leaders. Now, we have had a
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  big clearance sale going, so a lot of stuff sold out, a lot of the other stuff is close to selling
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:58.600]  out. Well, some of our best sellers are still there, and some of them have actually come back
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:03.560]  into stock. And because of your support, we've had the money to reorder and get the other things
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:07.480]  that have actually sold out. So those should be back in stock as well soon. Thank you so much
[2:36:07.480 --> 2:36:11.640]  for keeping info wars on the air. Obviously, we're critical to fight, and you've helped win the
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:18.280]  war against the global so far. See it in, and the rest of the corporate media are running with
[2:36:18.280 --> 2:36:22.840]  the false headline that Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus. It's the opposite. He's not
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:29.080]  surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science, that it's incredibly deadly,
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:34.280]  and that we have a chance of eradicating it. Bill Gates, Fauci, and the UN have said,
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:39.560]  we will always wear masks, we will never shake hands. And even the vaccines won't protect us
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:47.160]  forever. And so that civilization, as we know, is over until every coronavirus in the world
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:51.880]  is eradicated. That's impossible. That's right. They're trying to say they have to have a cure
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:58.680]  to the common cold. That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test. They created a problem
[2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:03.480]  that can never be defeated. But of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem. And so they
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:09.560]  stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers now going with the police
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:15.960]  to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking force samples. We must say no. It was in the
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:22.920]  Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location. I read from
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:28.760]  the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American. Now the media
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:34.280]  admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track
[2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:40.040]  your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships,
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.920]  and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well,
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:50.840]  including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do,
[2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:56.120]  and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be
[2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:00.520]  saved forever. Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:06.040]  scores based on information. This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score. Get your

[2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:21.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:42.280]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with
[2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:47.720]  Owen Troyer oh my gosh i'm just pulling my hair out right now
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:52.280]  with a week to election day
[2:38:54.680 --> 2:38:59.720]  Patrick you know i gotta admit some days it's real easy to come on here and cover all the news
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:03.960]  and be focused and and energized and everything and some days it's just like a merry go round of
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:10.840]  insanity and you know what really scares me though and then i got some news i'm gonna go over with
[2:39:10.840 --> 2:39:17.480]  you here but you know what really scares me Patrick is that the most in uninformed the most
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:22.200]  uninformed people the most deranged people the most deceived people the most hateful people
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.560]  control our destiny i mean they literally control our destiny with their ignorant vote they've
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:32.520]  never seen they don't even know who hunter biden is they think Kamala Harris is a queen i mean
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:37.400]  it's all the hollywood propaganda the mainstream news propaganda they obviously own the entertainment
[2:39:37.400 --> 2:39:42.600]  industry now 50 cents says oh f donald trump well what happened 50 who's got blackmail on you do
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:46.680]  you really answer to that white bitch chelsea handler what she offered you a bj i mean so it's
[2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:52.440]  just like patrick all their moves are black magic that's what we're fighting is black magic and all
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:57.800]  their little minions of their black magic and their lies and deception and these people control
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:05.000]  my fate they're gonna vote me into slavery patrick i mean what do i do it's very sad the effect of
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:09.800]  their wizardry because we see it so clearly for what it is it's wizardry and there's nothing
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:16.040]  supernatural about it it just happens that they own the networks and the mainstream news networks
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:19.800]  through operation mockingbird have linked up with the deep state and so they push the deep state
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:25.560]  propaganda and we live in a propaganda matrix i mean america in the last few decades has been
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:31.640]  more surreal i think if you look historically objectively it's it's more surreal what's going
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:37.000]  on than probably any country ever in the history of the world we really are an experiment in whether
[2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:44.120]  or not they can totally control a population and so the hate that you're seeing from people
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:48.600]  that's that's a hatred that comes from the fact that they've been beaten down that they don't have
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:52.920]  anything in their lives that they're broke that they're miserable and they need to find somebody
[2:40:52.920 --> 2:40:58.680]  to blame and the system points the finger at guys like you and me or rudy juliani or president
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:03.240]  trump and says that's the reason why you're suffering it's him it's it's the white man it's
[2:41:03.240 --> 2:41:10.680]  it's the patriots it's america they're bad it's colonialism and uh you know they have uh simultaneously
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:16.200]  tried to ruin us while also propping us up as being somehow in charge of all of this and it is
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:21.880]  wizardry and it's very effective because you know as stupid as it seems to us you have to realize
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:27.320]  that there are a lot of stupid people and you know you never gain anything by overestimating
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:33.880]  the intelligence of the dumbest normies among us the normies are our enemy we have to say it i'm a
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:39.160]  populist as a populist i want people to do well i want people to rise into the upper middle class
[2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:44.040]  i want people to have successful peaceful wonderful lives we can't do that if the dumbest
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:48.680]  people among us the people who are rolling around in their own piss on the street have more power
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:53.400]  in our political system than i do and that's literally it but they're totally distant power
[2:41:53.400 --> 2:41:57.640]  they don't even realize it i'll make up a word here but that's because they believe hollywood i
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:03.080]  mean they actually think hollywood has their back they actually got these politicians have
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:08.360]  their back they're gonna sell you out faster than they can flick their wrist you have no idea how
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:14.520]  many young white women millennial white women who i have spoken to who literally believe that the
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:19.560]  power structure of america is white supremacy white nationalism and that trump is going to send
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:26.360]  the clan and the proud boys around to round up all of the spirited progressives after the election
[2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:31.240]  they truly believe that and you realize that with the power of the media they're not anchored to
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:37.160]  anything so the crazier and more feverish the media gets the normies just follow it along
[2:42:37.160 --> 2:42:41.400]  and that's where we're at now we're at a point where we really can't coexist with the left we
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:45.400]  can't coexist with people who want to destroy us and kill us who hate us with every fiber of their
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:50.840]  being who define their entire lives around hating us that's not healthy we're never gonna come together
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:55.720]  like grown-ups and work together in a bipartisan way first of all we wouldn't even want that because
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:43:00.280]  the only bipartisan things that come out of washington are things like the iraq war or massive
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:06.200]  bailouts for the banks bipartisanship is over and we need to really think about how we're gonna
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:13.240]  survive the only way to survive i think is to separate yeah and you know it was actually i
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:16.440]  guess it was either this week or last week and i can't even remember everything's a blur but
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:23.560]  i'm going around in the uh info wars truck and and and look i'm not trying to body shame or
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:27.480]  anything and sometimes i do and i regret it but you know it's really none of my business if you
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:31.080]  know if you however you want to live or whatever you want to eat it's none of my business if you
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:37.080]  want to live unhealthy but i'm out there and and and patrick this this this morbidly obese woman
[2:43:37.080 --> 2:43:42.520]  i mean at least 300 plus i mean probably has her own gravitational field and she comes up to me
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:47.880]  with a mask and i'm like ma'am the mask doesn't stop kovat this is a fake pandemic and she's screaming
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:52.600]  at me or math huffing at mask huffing and puffing on and off her face she's like this is a real
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:56.760]  people are dying people people are getting sick and dying and spreading i'm like ma'am
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:04.120]  you know heart disease and obesity and diabetes is actually a bigger killer than kovat that doesn't
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:09.160]  seem to bother you and so but it's like it's that's the madness it's like they want to take their
[2:44:09.160 --> 2:44:16.680]  madness and project it on to us to make us suffer somehow it's like ma'am you chose to be 350 pounds
[2:44:16.680 --> 2:44:22.200]  in five foot six not me you chose that diabetes you chose that heart failure you chose to be morbidly
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:26.840]  obese i don't give a damn about your fears at kovat i'm not afraid of kovat there's no reason
[2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:32.600]  for me to be afraid of kovat but what is she she's a creation of the mainstream news she's a creation
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:38.440]  of hollywood propaganda and she's sick she's unhealthy she's deranged i i i'm just like hey
[2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:44.520]  here's the reality and she hates me for telling her the truth it's a three pronged process they
[2:44:44.520 --> 2:44:50.760]  demoralize you then they empower you and then they point toward the enemy and the enemy is
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:57.320]  conservatives and trump so they demoralize you by making you morbidly obese by giving you terrible
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:45:02.120]  food to eat by poisoning the food poisoning the air poisoning the water doing all the terrible
[2:45:02.120 --> 2:45:07.080]  things that they do giving you this propaganda and this fake education in marxist schools
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:13.000]  turning you into an idiot with basically no agency over your own life then they empower you they give
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:18.840]  you oprah and they say it's okay that you're morbidly obese and stupid you don't need to conform to
[2:45:18.840 --> 2:45:24.440]  anyone else's beauty standards or iq standards and two plus two doesn't need to equal four that's just
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:29.800]  colonialist double speak you're fine just the way you are and then they cry on oprah and then
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:35.000]  they're empowered i'm empowered to speak my mind and then they say all right you know who's done this
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:41.640]  to you you know who's bad oh it's Rudy Giuliani it's the proud boys it's trump they're evil and
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:45.720]  they're the reason why there's all these problems in the world and so they've been beaten down and
[2:45:45.720 --> 2:45:50.920]  demoralized then they've been empowered in their demoralized state and then they've been weaponized
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:55.080]  against the enemy and the enemy is just saying regular people who are effective and can actually
[2:45:55.080 --> 2:46:01.800]  live lives and so it is a very fascinating way that they control people's minds from the moment
[2:46:01.800 --> 2:46:07.800]  that they're born until the day that they finally croak from heart failure and get marked as COVID
[2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:13.080]  deaths and that's really what it is that is literally what it is everything's a COVID death now
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:17.640]  but you know and here's the other thing too because you just said it and the quote from Obama
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:22.360]  really highlights this you didn't build that remember that quote from Obama you didn't build
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:28.520]  that that that's the epitome of their belief because you know when you everybody here here's
[2:46:28.520 --> 2:46:33.640]  the big lie that the left doesn't tell you everybody goes through trials and tribulations
[2:46:33.640 --> 2:46:39.640]  everybody and quite frankly rich and successful people probably go through more than the average
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:44.760]  man and but see you never learned that until you've wanted to be successful you never learned
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:49.480]  that until you have success you never learned that until you embark on missions that are difficult
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:55.240]  and and you overcome and you make compromises and and and so but that's life that is life but
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:47:01.720]  these people sit back and they never try to take a leap forward they never have a mission they never
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:06.280]  have a success story and so they just sit here and because of the media propaganda and they see
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:11.240]  Kim Kardashian and with her fake boobs and butts and they see the media with all of the fake snuff
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:15.320]  oh all the rich people they have all the money they have all the happiness and I'm down here I have
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:21.560]  nothing folks that's that's their biggest lie is to see here and act like the rich and famous people
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:25.560]  don't go through trials and tribulations I'm not even building people up like Kim Kardashian's the
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:30.120]  point is you don't think she goes through crap too you don't think it's hard to become a billionaire
[2:47:30.120 --> 2:47:34.200]  like I mean but that's their thing it's like oh you're rich you're white you didn't build that I
[2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:38.440]  built that for you you've never had any struggle in life I have to endure all the struggle and I'm
[2:47:38.440 --> 2:47:43.400]  sick of it and it's all a lie these people have the least amount of struggle the only struggle
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:49.960]  internally yes the struggle is internally and that's right and their own internal struggle
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:54.920]  is now being projected upon all of us and we're being blamed for their failure we're being blamed
[2:47:54.920 --> 2:48:00.680]  for their idiocy and you realize that the useless idiots or the useful idiots for the
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  communists they're useless to us the useless idiots are the most important part of the communist
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:11.560]  takeover it wouldn't happen without them because Bill Gates can't just come by and subjugate me
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:16.520]  I don't care how much money he has he can't just you know totally take over this country by himself
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:22.680]  he can do it by manipulating the minds of the people and we're seeing that it's so disappointing
[2:48:22.680 --> 2:48:27.080]  because I thought we were making so much progress and then ever since the scandemic started it's
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:31.560]  so disappointing to see the normies go so historically in the other direction yeah but you're also
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:38.120]  seeing a positive thing whereby the crazier that they get the more righteous our people get that
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:43.000]  is the paradox two different timelines yep that is the paradox americans are waking up and getting
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:48.040]  more hardcore and freedom the left is getting more deranged mentally retarded and committing to

[2:49:28.840 --> 2:49:34.040]  virus came from after all that's where the fear mongering came from the lockdown came from but
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:40.360]  that was a weapon a psychological hysteria a chicken little syndrome being created
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:48.040]  that was to then be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:55.400]  mass hysteria and so far it's been incredibly successful until just the last few weeks as

[2:51:21.560 --> 2:51:37.560]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with jerald solente
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:47.080]  about a week away from the 2020 election democrat party nominee joe biden is in desperate denial
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:53.800]  of the fact that he is now the central character in the most despicable corruption scandal in american
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:52:01.720]  history the subversion of the u.s. government by communist china is being exposed a group of
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:07.400]  chinese whistleblowers managed to get a hard drive containing evidence of serious crimes
[2:52:07.400 --> 2:52:14.520]  committed by the biden family into the hands of steve bannon and rudy juliani lewd media
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:20.520]  claimed a month ago that a hard drive would surface before the election containing videos
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:27.960]  of hunter biden violently raping chinese children those who have seen the videos support this claim
[2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:36.760]  to any good person this is shocking and horrific and to many it is incomprehensible but for as
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:44.040]  long as man has had power to gain the art of blackmail has been exploited this was the purpose
[2:52:44.040 --> 2:52:51.720]  of a man like jeffrey epstein according to lewd media these child rape videos of hunter biden
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:58.840]  were produced by the communist chinese as a means of control and were being sent to the biden family
[2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:07.240]  and other ccp assets in america as a threat a reminder of who owns them there are no rules in
[2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:15.160]  the game of power only ruthlessness and so children become the currency of those who seek to control
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:23.160]  others former business partner of the biden family tony bobalinski worked as ceo for senohawk
[2:53:23.160 --> 2:53:31.000]  holdings a company formed by the bidens and china's largest private energy company bobalinski
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:36.600]  has provided evidence that shows senohawk was used to funnel millions of dollars from the
[2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:44.920]  communist chinese directly into the family coffers of the bidens the mainstream media in what must
[2:53:44.920 --> 2:53:51.560]  certainly be a criminal act has been ignoring this incredible story while pushing their audience
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:59.640]  into voting for a decrepit lying perverted fraud with a monstrous family and loyalty to the communist
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:08.600]  chinese we likely know what's coming next the democrat party will claim that trump stole the
[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:15.080]  election the corporate media will play along and those still brainwashed by the globalist run
[2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:22.520]  propaganda media machine will undoubtedly believe it with massive crowds of people all over the
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:30.120]  country showing overwhelming grassroots support for president trump in ways never before seen
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:37.720]  contrasted with joe biden and obama at public events practically devoid of all people the media
[2:54:37.720 --> 2:54:43.720]  will still say that trump had to steal the election they will cite their fake polls
[2:54:44.520 --> 2:54:51.960]  and the brainwashed sheep will believe them if justice is served which needs to happen
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:57.640]  then there will be arrests of powerful people and the corporate media will report that trump
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:03.960]  is literally hitler rounding up the innocent and the brainwashed sheep will believe them
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:11.720]  there is no doubt if they can be made to wear masks and fear those who don't then they will
[2:55:11.720 --> 2:55:19.000]  believe whatever they are told beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:27.240]  but inwardly are ravening wolves humanity is awakening but not everyone the brainwashed
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:33.560]  are being manipulated into defending the corrupt deep state establishment some are even murdering
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:42.440]  trump supporters in cold blood it seems clear that trump will win the 2020 election but then what
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:48.840]  what if the corporate mainstream media is allowed to operate as normal then there will be total
[2:55:48.840 --> 2:56:18.040]  chaos for info wars dot com this is greg reese finally the stagnant republican establishment
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:22.600]  understands what info wars understand what our listeners understand what donald trump
[2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:30.600]  understands we're in a digital civil war there are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:36.840]  going on on every major tech platform and now they're doing it to the private apps they're doing
[2:56:36.840 --> 2:56:43.160]  it to text messages they're doing it to email this is mafia organized crime election meddling
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:56:49.160]  but finally when they blocked the hunter biden and the barisma information and the chinese
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:54.040]  information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it has been confirmed to be real
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:59.480]  biden hasn't denied it finally congress got pissed and said this is out of control you've got to stop
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:03.640]  it now we're taking action oh and check doors you went oh what's the mistake it's an accident it's
[2:57:03.640 --> 2:57:09.000]  an accident but they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff well info wars
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:22.520]  is calling their bluff and i want to thank you all for keeping us on the air
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:32.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host jerald solente
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:44.680]  hello hello great being on the alex jones show and as alex said to you can't keep the truth alive
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:51.240]  who you can't support info wars put your money where your mind and heart are because things are
[2:57:51.240 --> 2:58:00.040]  bad out there as you can see in that great video about the elections that was just done is right
[2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:07.160]  on target as i see it as well and the mainstream media is in you know total control of the minds
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:15.960]  of the masses and it's quite evident when this whole hunter biden story is basically buried
[2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:22.760]  it's not being reported at all from the major media and if it does it gets a snippet in and out
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:30.920]  and it's twisted the way they wanted by twisted minds as i call them prostitutes they get paid
[2:58:30.920 --> 2:58:41.560]  to put out by their corporate foremasters men and women who i should say boys and girls because
[2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:49.560]  men and women wouldn't act the way that they do and how about that guy too ben huh yeah that's cnn
[2:58:49.560 --> 2:59:01.560]  in new york a corker caught mask debating yep what a guy huh to me he symbolizes the prostitutes
[2:59:02.440 --> 2:59:15.480]  and what they're selling mask mas k u baiters selling the fraud of wearing a mask there he is
[2:59:15.480 --> 2:59:24.120]  is the mas k u beta along with the rest of them pleasuring self you know it's good to keep your
[2:59:24.120 --> 2:59:31.480]  prostate healthy but you don't do it on the on zoom unless you're one of those guys another little
[2:59:31.480 --> 2:59:39.240]  boy with a bad attitude oh i'm sorry everybody everybody they get caught they said well i'm
[2:59:39.240 --> 2:59:48.840]  sorry i'm sorry i got caught the prostitutes are nothing more than mas k u baiters and all
[2:59:48.840 --> 3:00:01.080]  you have to do is tune in to cnn dr anthony fouchie had been reluctant to support federal
[3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:11.880]  mask mandate but not any longer and uh fouchie was on cnn he said well if people are not wearing
[3:00:11.880 --> 3:00:19.480]  masks then maybe we should be mandating it fouchie told cnn's aron bernett
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:28.120]  maybe we should be mandating it now there's a real little mas k u beta
[3:00:28.120 --> 3:00:37.880]  ah that's the little clown boy that back in march was saying ah you don't have to wear those masks
[3:00:38.920 --> 3:00:48.360]  no and again one study after another saying how ineffective they are there he is here's the
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:58.360]  mas k u beta saying that you don't have to wear them but he's a little nothing of a nobody that gets
[3:00:58.360 --> 3:01:09.960]  paid off to put out as well here's a box of the masks that most people use
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:20.840]  join town face mask with their loops safe shield technology adjustable and soft nose piece
[3:01:21.400 --> 3:01:28.120]  yeah so when you stick your nose in uh as a brown nosa and you know why they call them brown noses
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:35.240]  efficient filtered media soft and comfortable ear loops
[3:01:35.240 --> 3:01:39.000]  um great
[3:01:42.040 --> 3:01:45.400]  cold mask down over nose yep
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:56.280]  these masks help protect against certain particulate contaminants but do not eliminate
[3:01:56.280 --> 3:02:01.800]  exposure to the risk of any disease or infection oh wait a minute
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:11.160]  wait a minute why would i wear it if it it's not going to protect me against a certain particulate
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:22.200]  but do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection
[3:02:22.200 --> 3:02:31.400]  well they do not eliminate exposure to the risk of any disease or infection
[3:02:32.840 --> 3:02:37.560]  but these are the stupid things that everybody wears
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:42.120]  these little blue things
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:52.520]  anything come on out of the box come on out of the box here we go here they are
[3:02:54.120 --> 3:02:54.600]  and then
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:04.360]  you see the stupid prostitutes doing the news with the microphone under their nose
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:11.480]  and then telling you what to say and people gobbling when they talk you get what's going down
[3:03:11.480 --> 3:03:21.000]  these things do nothing they fog your glasses up and everybody wears them brainwashed
[3:03:22.920 --> 3:03:30.840]  brainwashed oh that was one of our uh great anthony frida along with steven green
[3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:41.480]  covers of our transjournal brainwashed with crap that by the way we got censored on
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:48.360]  linkedin for putting that cover up on the transjournal two weeks ago so here it is
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:55.240]  they're telling you to wear these when they're totally ineffective by their own words
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:01.800]  but yet most of the people wear them or wear something around in their face and then again
[3:04:01.800 --> 3:04:06.440]  to show you the stupidity of it this is what you see all the chinese people wearing and we became
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:14.120]  like the chinese but now it's become fashionable to put a stupid mask on and look good i just came
[3:04:14.120 --> 3:04:25.800]  back from florida i left uh friday morning came back yesterday to celebrate a great friend's 90th
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:32.600]  birthday and i went there in honor of her and her husband made the rest of he messed rest in peace
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:46.200]  and it was a drag man it's a drag the airport's a freak scene we landed in fort mias it wasn't
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:53.080]  one place open there you know that sells stuff and landed about uh like four o'clock in the afternoon
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:59.720]  four thirty now one of the shops everything was closed all out of business oh and i thought
[3:04:59.720 --> 3:05:06.200]  florida was all opened up but most of the people wore masks and i flew down first class
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:16.680]  and this is what they gave you in first class a box of crap united airlines yeah united screw you
[3:05:17.800 --> 3:05:25.400]  united first class rip off oh i saw the pilots they had regular food and bowls and stuff i got a
[3:05:25.400 --> 3:05:31.880]  glass of wine and a crappy little plastic cup they're using this so they could charge you what
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:42.200]  they want but they don't give you the service blaming blaming the virus what a bunch of crap
[3:05:44.040 --> 3:05:51.960]  first class rip off by united airlines and probably all the rest that are using this
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:58.280]  to cut services so they can make up for the money that they're losing because air travel down
[3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:06.680]  depending on where you're going and looking at it it's um it's down between 75 and 80 percent
[3:06:07.800 --> 3:06:16.200]  what a drag it was now here's the real stupidity that they're shoving down our throat as you're
[3:06:16.200 --> 3:06:21.400]  getting off the plane they said well we're going to call it out by rose so we could social distance
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:26.360]  who the hell are you talking to you're in an airplane you walk over to go to the bathroom you
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:35.400]  walk and buy everybody everybody's sitting next to each other and now they're telling you to social
[3:06:35.400 --> 3:06:41.640]  distance as you leave so what i did i opened up this other box of crap that they gave me on the
[3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:48.440]  way down i took this one on the way back it was a different one top is snapbox snack box snack a
[3:06:48.440 --> 3:06:54.760]  bunch of crap so i opened the box and played with the potato chips took the jerky and gave it to
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:07:02.120]  maybe uh a thing i give it to tuban here's some jerky for uh yeah beef jerky jerk off
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:08.120]  that's what they're selling so i ate this stuff so i wouldn't have to put the mask on
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:15.560]  but i didn't eat it we'll be right back in a bit six months ago the highly respected former head
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:23.560]  of the rockefeller hospital virology department went public and said the mainline science on virology
[3:07:23.560 --> 3:07:29.320]  is you cannot protect somebody from a virus like this you have to wait till there's herd immunity
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:34.680]  and there's never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses they do not work
[3:07:35.240 --> 3:07:40.120]  well even bill gates now admits oh the vaccine will really never work but you have to keep
[3:07:40.120 --> 3:07:45.000]  social distancing and wearing masks they're now saying forever last week it was 10 years now it's
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:50.440]  forever see how the power grab works so when you hear them saying trump is surrendering and a chief
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:54.840]  of staff is surrendering to coronavirus when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:08:01.320]  our immunity with things like vitamin d c and of course sink that's the reality that's not fear
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:06.360]  mongering that's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the new world order
[3:08:06.360 --> 3:08:10.120]  they create a problem to which there is no solution but they are again the people that
[3:08:10.120 --> 3:08:14.200]  said they've got to be in charge it's on record it's not disputed it was rolled out more than
[3:08:14.200 --> 3:08:18.600]  eight months ago in common to china now it's in europe now it's the united states of canada
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:23.560]  and the most other industrial parts of the planet every restaurant you go into even small mom and
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:30.440]  pops have qr codes for you to supposedly check their menu and they really get upset if you ask for
[3:08:30.440 --> 3:08:34.200]  a paper menu but of course they have them now what are they saying there well you've got to have a
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:38.840]  cell phone to come in their establishment and that you can't have a piece of paper because oh
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:44.040]  everybody's diseased and uh you know we're spreading germs it's it's absolutely asinine they can throw
[3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:48.840]  away the little one sheet papers if they actually believe that know what this really is is a contact
[3:08:48.840 --> 3:08:54.680]  tracing database again this is admitted that everyone's being habituated in the scan to be part of
[3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:59.160]  so in the future everywhere you go is tracked officially and your cell phones already track

[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:10.520]  800 points as we speak so where's it going well they're going to keep pumping cheap money in
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:16.520]  and i believe they're probably going to do one even before tuesday election day so i don't boost
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:24.040]  the markets up temporarily artificially for a while but uh you go across the around the world i mean

[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:37.720]  brent crude is now backed around 40 a barrel i mentioned that because what you're looking at
[3:12:37.720 --> 3:12:45.400]  that is all of these oil rich nations big and small rich and poor they need oil for selling it a lot
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:51.320]  more than this to you know keep their economies going and that's why you have like countries like
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:12:57.240]  nigeria major riots going on they're like 200 and something million people down there
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.720]  and oil isn't doing well even the richer companies like countries companies countries
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:08.680]  greenberg iceberg what's the difference they will become companies now because that's what
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:16.040]  they're doing to us by locking down everything you're looking at merger and acquisition activity
[3:13:16.040 --> 3:13:24.600]  going way up these slimy little low lives like that fat boy pritzker over there and i don't know
[3:13:24.600 --> 3:13:31.320]  how you spell that pritzker but i think it begins with a pr i and then you could put the rest of

[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:21.640]  they're going on all around and they're gonna worsen could you imagine this clown over that
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:27.880]  little clown boy pritzker i forget they gave his marriott i think was the pritzker family and his
[3:39:27.880 --> 3:39:34.200]  sister was involved with the obama clan too she played a role i think she was commerce secretary
[3:39:35.080 --> 3:39:42.680]  is one of those hotel chains chicago closing down indoor dining and outside the suburban
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:49.560]  area chicago i lived in chicago matter of fact that's why i went down to florida to visit my friend
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:54.760]  and the hillsmen's they were so great to us when we moved to chicago many years ago back in the 70s
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:02.760]  and i wanted to pay my honor to them great family there are two seasons i found out in chicago
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:09.880]  winter in august winter's here you're not going to have any outdoor dining
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:13.720]  the restaurants are going down before
[3:40:13.720 --> 3:40:18.360]  and now it's going to be hell
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:24.280]  so you're going to start seeing demonstrations and riots all over
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:34.120]  and next week would be election day and you know my magazine the trends journal was the
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:42.120]  first one to forecast trump a winner back in may of 2016 against the odds and i'm going against the
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:51.480]  odds again and i say trump 2020 by default it's not because people love there he has a strong base
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:41:00.120]  but not a wide one it's i said by default and default are the demo craps that they got a jerk
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:06.920]  like biden running against them and as has been mentioned as rallies the biden rallies very few
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:16.920]  people show up and here's why i think he's going to win trump is going to win the swing states
[3:41:18.280 --> 3:41:19.720]  they don't want to lock down
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:25.880]  and this is an election as our trends journal covers shows
[3:41:25.880 --> 3:41:35.560]  lock it down or open it up that's what the that's it masks no mask
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:45.720]  it's the economy stupid that was the saying during the clinton's campaign in 1992
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:57.480]  so lock down open it up number two very big young people i don't see a lot of them running out to
[3:41:58.200 --> 3:42:07.880]  to vote for great grandpa joe not going to be a flood the people that are voting for biden
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:13.800]  aren't voting for him because he has such a great track record the voting for him because
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:21.400]  they can't stand trump biden isn't the young people's bernie lowlife sanders another lying
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:27.320]  piece of crap that's been sucking off the public to all his life like biden has 47 years of never
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:39.000]  working the same thing with clown bernie back at bernie sanders support a warm monger like trump
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:47.400]  because bernie sanders is a phony too he's a warm monger in sheep's clothing he supported all of
[3:42:47.400 --> 3:42:54.040]  clinton's sanctions against iraq that killed over 500 000 iraqi children under the age of five
[3:42:56.040 --> 3:43:02.360]  he voted for the amendment not to force congress to vote to go to war against afghanistan and let
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:09.480]  old presidente of los estados and neaters another little boy born on third base and 38 a home run
[3:43:09.480 --> 3:43:17.240]  moron little imbecile george bush who took us to the afghan war he voted for most defense budgets
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:25.000]  another phony so i don't see a lot of young people running out for biden the last debate had low
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  ratings people aren't that interested so what trump has to do is to get out the vote in
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  the swing states which he really didn't get out big time the last time he won them because the
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:47.720]  people hated hitlery so much that's hitlery clinton now he got hitlery's everywhere
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:56.760]  here he is george bush the medal of honor to a piece of
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:03.640]  look at him how could and look at that again another boy born on third base and 30 at a home
[3:44:03.640 --> 3:44:11.160]  run it's one big club and you ain't in it said george carlin you think these guys could go anywhere

[3:44:57.800 --> 3:45:03.480]  so do what you can get in the best shape you can take those products that are going to improve
