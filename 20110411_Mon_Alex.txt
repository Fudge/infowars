[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:33.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.040 --> 00:41.920]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome we are live it is the 11th day of April 2011
[00:41.920 --> 00:48.800]  the one month anniversary of the disaster caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami
[00:48.800 --> 00:54.080]  that hit the Fukushima nuclear power plant complex devastating the six reactors that
[00:54.080 --> 01:00.800]  have since gone Chernobyl melted down exploded you name it even mainstream news in Japan
[01:00.800 --> 01:08.080]  reporting radiation levels at least four times what Chernobyl was they've also been hit by another
[01:08.080 --> 01:14.960]  earthquake today directly in the vicinity of Fukushima and our media is still playing this
[01:14.960 --> 01:22.800]  down as radiation is found in milk and food all over the United States the EPA has moved to up
[01:22.800 --> 01:29.280]  the levels of what they say safe radiation is so I guess if you were flying in a spaceship past a
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.240]  supernova and it fried you and killed you they would just raise the level of radiation and
[01:36.240 --> 01:42.080]  say it was safe even though you were turned into atoms even though you were broken down into basically
[01:42.080 --> 01:48.400]  fried dust they would just raise the level and say that that was safe or if you were flying by a
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.280]  neutron star and got several million times safe levels of radiation they would just raise the
[01:53.280 --> 01:57.920]  level and say this is safe just like with the troops and the depleted uranium which their own
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.720]  Pentagon reports going back decades admitted was deadly and the troops shouldn't be able to use it
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.080]  it was an emergency backup weapon when nuclear war was already on now they just say hey boys use it
[02:08.080 --> 02:16.000]  no safety precautions needed enjoy yourselves we say it's no longer dangerous now George Soros
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.520]  has had a nice weekend meeting at Bretton Woods 2 in New Hampshire and he told Bloomberg and this
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.440]  clip is coming up in the next segment quote the big question is whether the US dollar should be the
[02:29.440 --> 02:35.280]  reserve currency it no longer is it shares that role with the euro other currencies and commodities
[02:35.280 --> 02:40.960]  but it's not just gold being used as a substitute but oil too which is putting upward pressure on
[02:40.960 --> 02:47.040]  the market article by Aaron Dykes at info wars dot com from saturday headline Soros dollar no
[02:47.040 --> 02:54.560]  longer reserve currency and we have the video and audio clip there for you uh gold hits record
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.880]  as dollar dips focus on the Fed but then the dollar that was earlier this morning began to go
[03:00.880 --> 03:07.360]  back up yet again and go down by a few dollars uh but the still at near records what it's dropped
[03:07.360 --> 03:16.640]  from 1476 and 21 cents to 1473 and some change so we're going to be going over all of that as well
[03:16.640 --> 03:26.720]  today uh but the even more insane news i've got for you and again every day information of this
[03:26.720 --> 03:32.480]  magnitude is coming out like government issuing free laptops to school children that aren't really
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.400]  free paid for by taxpayers uh tissue of deception and then watching them at home in the shower in
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.600]  their beds and admitting they're doing it and then nobody gets in trouble it's no big deal uh
[03:43.600 --> 03:52.480]  chicago school districts ban children bringing their own lunches period uh that signifying the parents
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.520]  are bad parents can't be trusted they're actually saying that uh we'll be going over that and then
[03:57.520 --> 04:04.160]  another report out of cnn where again they report on it dryly like it's probably a good idea uh supreme
[04:04.160 --> 04:11.840]  court rules uh that prosecutors are allowed to know that you're innocent and hold back evidence
[04:11.840 --> 04:19.040]  or basically frame you so prosecutors are allowed to know you're innocent and even send you to death
[04:19.040 --> 04:26.000]  row that that the supreme court says executing innocent people is good i've read the ruling this
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.560]  happened a couple weeks ago week and a half ago i wasn't even aware of it uh i heard a genesis show
[04:32.560 --> 04:38.080]  i was listening on 90.1 this weekend what the free state project that thinks the name of it uh free
[04:38.080 --> 04:44.160]  minds radio uh and i heard them reading it out of cnn almost ran off the road i know it's a credible
[04:44.160 --> 04:49.680]  show so i didn't doubt it but then i heard on another radio show kind of doubted what they were
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.720]  saying so i went and looked it up and sure enough uh what the free minds were reporting is absolutely
[04:54.720 --> 05:00.240]  true so they're just now being public and saying yes we want to put innocent people in prison this
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.960]  is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[05:04.960 --> 05:10.160]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.760]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.760 --> 05:21.040]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[05:21.040 --> 05:26.000]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.440]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[05:31.440 --> 05:36.720]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a
[05:36.720 --> 05:41.600]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[05:41.600 --> 05:46.080]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can
[05:46.080 --> 05:52.480]  get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.840]  government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call one eight seven seven three

[08:06.800 --> 08:19.520]  you and led french troops have smashed into the ivory coast they have taken over the president's
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.360]  compound and have handed him over to the rebels who on record for three weeks have been running around
[08:25.360 --> 08:31.200]  slaughtering everyone with machetes and machine guns men women and children another globalist
[08:31.200 --> 08:37.520]  butchering operation for humanitarian purposes going quite nicely that's the new globalist model
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.760]  is they have rebels rebel and then they send in globalist stormtroopers to engage in extermination
[08:43.760 --> 08:50.080]  as well and then the golden oil is promptly handed over directly so the new colonial imperialism
[08:51.040 --> 08:58.080]  kicking into high gear for humanitarian reasons of course and we've got lieutenant colonel
[08:58.080 --> 09:04.400]  anthony schaefer joining us in the second half of the third hour to give us his view on libyum
[09:05.840 --> 09:14.080]  his view on what's happening on the african continent as well there on the western side
[09:14.080 --> 09:23.040]  on the ivory coast we also have webster griffin tarpley via cell phone joining us from dc to also
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.160]  look at what's happening in the world markets but on top of that the move towards an open world
[09:28.160 --> 09:34.560]  government run by private central banks that issue a new level of derivative currencies
[09:34.560 --> 09:41.040]  that is coming up as well today we'll also again look at what's happening in africa with tarpley
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.720]  who's been calling it with precision from the start obviously most of you probably already
[09:46.720 --> 09:53.920]  know that japan was hit by another earthquake they're saying it's between a 6.6 and 7.1 depending
[09:53.920 --> 10:00.480]  on which japanese newspaper you look at and it caused more problems at fukushima they've had to
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.240]  evacuate that facility yet again of course they had a big earthquake in mexico last week other
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.720]  earthquakes around the world undoubtedly we're entering an intensified tectonic
[10:10.720 --> 10:19.680]  uh phase right now of world events we're also going to be getting into
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.680]  more of what's happening in the middle east in israel in bahrain in jordan in saudi arabia
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.200]  this weekend i listened to a lot of news radio i listened to a lot of the tv channels that are
[10:35.200 --> 10:41.680]  on xm because i can be playing with my children while i'm doing that or oil painting while i'm
[10:41.680 --> 10:46.000]  doing that or cleaning the yard up while i'm doing that i listened to a lot of radio today
[10:46.960 --> 10:55.040]  not just this morning but over the weekend and i heard repeatedly the admission that yes all of
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.440]  the middle eastern countries are going to fall uh that this is actually a good thing for globalism
[11:01.440 --> 11:08.160]  especially on bloomberg they had a lot of experts on but also on some of the sunday morning tv shows
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.880]  just everywhere they're basically now admitting what many of our experts
[11:13.520 --> 11:18.480]  have pointed out and what i've pointed out here that this is a globalist destabilization program
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.400]  that the political atmosphere the climate was already there with food prices increasing with
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.760]  the fact that tyrants are in place both western installed and propped up but also organic variety
[11:29.760 --> 11:35.200]  uh but that basically the globalists are very happy about this because they like chaos and
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.880]  the pretext to then invade these countries under humanitarian auspices and that really backs up
[11:41.440 --> 11:48.080]  with tarpley saying what uh lindsay williams is saying uh with so many other uh individuals
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.720]  that we interview are saying and and and now suddenly that was the talking point this weekend
[11:52.720 --> 11:59.360]  along with breton woods to the dollars bad thank goodness the international bankers are saving us uh
[11:59.360 --> 12:06.080]  they've got all the answers uh the free market is bad they want to collectivize central bank
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.280]  run system controlled by the very banks that have orchestrated the crisis so we're going to be going
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.320]  over all of that news uh and uh i'm going to open the phones up as well we're going to take a lot
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.440]  of calls ahead of our guests joining us and then we'll take calls uh during the periods when we
[12:21.440 --> 12:26.000]  don't have guests because each guest is only joining us for 30 minutes in the second and third hour
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.440]  so all told we've got uh around about an hour and 45 minutes today to be able to intersperse your
[12:31.440 --> 12:37.200]  phone calls on any of the issues i'm raising or any questions or comments uh you have the toll
[12:37.200 --> 12:48.320]  free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air okay
[12:48.320 --> 12:50.320]  okay
[12:50.960 --> 12:57.680]  that said i don't want to get into what's happening in japan and the radiation that's now
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.360]  circle the globe it's it's now come back around uh the measurement show from what happened a
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.320]  month ago today the earthquake on the one month anniversary i don't want to just mention that
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.960]  and then not really drill down into it with more detail so at the bottom of the hour i'll spend
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.840]  five ten minutes just covering this but i do want to underline and highlight this information because
[13:19.840 --> 13:28.800]  it's so big uh we of course reported a lot last week about the uh announcements by the EPA
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.360]  they've now put the new measurements into place as policy but they're saying that there's a public
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.080]  comment period the next month if anybody has any questions but then they promptly of course always
[13:40.080 --> 13:48.640]  ignore the public comment i mean even in 2000 2005 2010 three separate times the EPA union
[13:49.840 --> 13:58.240]  as well as large portions of the food and drug administration unions uh in in one case in 2005
[13:58.240 --> 14:05.280]  over 90 percent of their scientists signed the petition with a large dossier again they've done
[14:05.280 --> 14:14.160]  it three times with all the evidence of bone cancer IQ reduction uh bone fractures dental
[14:14.160 --> 14:22.560]  fluorosis caused by fluoride and so in the last 11 years three different times they've gone
[14:23.120 --> 14:30.160]  to congress and testified they've gone to the EPA and FDA and over 90 percent of their scientists
[14:30.160 --> 14:36.640]  sign on to the paper saying sodium fluoride is deadly poison and bio accumulates and it needs
[14:36.640 --> 14:47.520]  to be taken out and the EPA and FDA promptly completely ignore it until what was it january of
[14:47.520 --> 14:54.320]  this year and they said okay we're going to say we shouldn't put 1.1 parts per millions you should
[14:54.320 --> 15:00.800]  put 0.7 parts per million in the water it is too much we should cut it cut it substantively
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.760]  many cities the average is about 1.5 but but they were saying we recommend 1.1 but now we
[15:07.760 --> 15:16.320]  say cut it down to 0.7 parts per million that shows that they do try to ignore you but when
[15:16.320 --> 15:20.960]  reality sets in they have to respond at least a little bit and they also said the same day
[15:20.960 --> 15:26.800]  in january put out a report saying we need to stop using it as pesticide they gas fruits and
[15:26.800 --> 15:30.800]  vegetables in warehouses whether they also have some other varieties they spray on it and then it
[15:30.800 --> 15:36.960]  goes through the cell wall of plants and bio accumulates there uh but the globalists know
[15:36.960 --> 15:41.280]  they've got us with the water and most cities won't cut it because they've already signed
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.640]  contracts to put it in the water and the lobbyists are lobbying local cities and states and it shows
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.240]  there's really only a few cities moving to reduce it now since even the government said cut it um
[15:52.880 --> 15:58.560]  but they know they're hitting you through what's put in the flour what's put in many of the process
[15:58.560 --> 16:05.680]  foods in some cases thousands of times the 1.1 part per million that's why your child elites
[16:05.680 --> 16:10.640]  and processed food and just vomit it up it's just pure poison and that's why so much of the public
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.400]  literally are the equivalent of retarded zombies uh is because of all this but but see i'm digressing
[16:16.400 --> 16:24.800]  now the point is the epa is and in fact guys pull it out of last wednesday stack i had the articles
[16:24.800 --> 16:30.320]  that had the links to the epa and the epa's announcements where it said well with strontium
[16:30.320 --> 16:36.400]  we're going to raise it this many times and with this isotope we're going to raise it to 24,997
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.520]  times what we previously said was safe and with this uh radioactive isotope we're going to raise
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.400]  the safe level 10,000 times because that that isn't in my stack and i want to be able to go back over
[16:46.400 --> 16:52.880]  epa just just search the term if you can't find the articles from last week epa set to raise limits
[16:52.880 --> 17:00.480]  on safe radiation the reason i wanted to to to to let you know that's coming up is that i don't
[17:00.480 --> 17:06.640]  have words to describe i could pull my hair out i could yell and scream uh to just sit here and
[17:06.640 --> 17:13.200]  see the system calmly knowing that we'll just muddle through it as they report the radiation
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.720]  building up in the us in north america as well not just here but in mexico northern mexico and uh
[17:19.600 --> 17:26.320]  up into canada as far north as alaska because they're dumping seven and a half million times safe
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.520]  levels of radiation to the water it's been off gassing into the air now for a month straight
[17:31.520 --> 17:39.600]  they were hit with another earthquake today and they just calmly report here uh in the us news
[17:43.680 --> 17:47.440]  this is out of forbs radiation detected in drinking water
[17:47.440 --> 17:57.520]  in 13 more us cities cesium 137 there's cesium and cesium cesium 137 in vermont milk
[17:57.520 --> 18:06.560]  and it doesn't get any more far east in the us than vermont ladies and gentlemen
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.520]  and you notice what's scary here is its universities its states and its cities
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.320]  and every time they first report it then they don't ever retract it they're just told to shut
[18:16.320 --> 18:21.280]  up by the feds and the feds a month in are not releasing any radiation numbers though they have
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.400]  the most detailed and expensive uh systems so when you just do a geiger counter with background
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.640]  radiation only shows a small increase that's just the general background
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.640]  but it it's it's when that stuff starts building up in the plants in the animals
[18:40.640 --> 18:46.640]  and then in the cows and the milk we drink so uh i'll be getting into that more also japan nuclear
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.880]  radiation four times Chernobyl levels outside evacuation zone the japanese have expanded
[18:52.880 --> 18:58.960]  the circumference of the radiation zone i'm gonna get more into this i have a tendency to
[18:58.960 --> 19:01.680]  say i'm gonna cover this later and start getting into it now it's just
[19:03.760 --> 19:09.920]  we will see increased cancers as dr bob bowman said three weeks ago on this show
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.000]  three degrees in nuclear physics former head of the star wars program but it won't be falling
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.840]  over dead in a month or even a year it'll just be more leukemias more cancers and they are reporting
[19:19.840 --> 19:27.600]  in the all over the japanese news four times Chernobyl levels the governor of the uh prefecture where
[19:29.120 --> 19:33.360]  the Fukushima plant is based the prefecture of Fukushima say they've been totally betrayed
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.560]  people are getting the radiation sickness and uh the government they say lied to them
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.800]  and kept telling them levels were safe and that previously they lied to them and said
[19:42.800 --> 19:48.960]  these reactors are safe well i mean what do you expect governor i mean you expect
[19:48.960 --> 19:55.360]  central governments to be truthful they're universally run by dictator scum criminals

[24:55.440 --> 25:01.440]  this is out of the chicago tribune chicago school banned some lunches brought from home
[25:01.440 --> 25:08.160]  see that's written to make it sound reasonable but it's certain parts of the chicago area certain
[25:08.160 --> 25:16.000]  school districts are banning them entirely where you cannot bring school lunches and the school
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.280]  officials not servants but the school officials and we'll show folks a document cam shot of this
[25:21.280 --> 25:28.320]  article for prison planet dot tv viewers are saying yes that parents can't be trusted the school
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.240]  will decide what your children eat and of course this is openly stating that the government believes
[25:34.240 --> 25:39.200]  that your children belong to them and that they know how to make the best decisions remember
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.280]  three years ago a ruling at the state level in california that homeschooling was now illegal
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.200]  and they said because the state has decided that we can give you a better education
[25:49.760 --> 25:55.200]  than your parents and unless you have a state issued teaching license you cannot teach your
[25:55.200 --> 26:01.520]  children now it was later overturned by a federal court but it shows the attitude of government
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.200]  your children belong to us and the public schools all over the country train the kids
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.240]  out of spy on their parents here in austin they give them credit cards where they put
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.880]  money credits on them you get 200 bucks for turning in parents they ask what is in your
[26:16.880 --> 26:22.960]  medicine cabinet this goes back nine years ago it's in my film road to tyranny the local tv ad
[26:22.960 --> 26:29.120]  put out by the austin police department about bonus recruitment month and report what's happening
[26:29.120 --> 26:35.120]  in school and outside of school and turn in a family member and get 200 that's the biggest
[26:35.120 --> 26:39.600]  cash reward you can get and the kids are all smiling being handed their barcode cards with
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.640]  their names on it as part of their tattletail system to remind them to be good little spies
[26:44.640 --> 26:51.520]  for the system so this is going on everywhere homeland security try to recruit my dad the other
[26:51.520 --> 26:55.200]  dentist at his office they've talked to other professionals they're all getting homeland

[27:14.800 --> 27:19.600]  don't trust anyone but government to encourage healthful eating see it's a positive article
[27:20.160 --> 27:23.760]  and you read the headline it's like oh they banned some lunches that sounds reasonable
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.480]  then you read deeper no that was before it was just some lunches some things now it's everything
[27:30.480 --> 27:35.440]  you don't bring a lunch period it's some school districts so everything here is written to be
[27:35.440 --> 27:42.240]  deceptive to encourage healthful eating chicago school doesn't allow kids to bring lunches or
[27:42.240 --> 27:49.200]  certain snacks from home lunches period or certain snacks see lunches period but then you can't bring
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.360]  snacks unless they say it's okay and some parents and many students aren't fans of the policy what
[27:55.360 --> 28:01.280]  about they have rights and liberty these are our children will decide remember the girl that got
[28:01.280 --> 28:07.680]  arrested for a ludens koftramp they're that's in the candy aisle ludens has no drugs in it nothing
[28:09.200 --> 28:16.240]  fernando de minguez cut the figure of a young revolutionary leader during a recent
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.080]  lunch period is elementary school oh he's a he's a revolutionary who thinks the lunch is not good
[28:22.080 --> 28:27.280]  enough the seventh grader shouted to his lunchmates in spanish and english dozens of hands flew into
[28:27.280 --> 28:32.800]  the air and fellow students shouted along we should bring our own lunch we should bring our own
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.640]  lunch oh they will arrest you we should bring our own lunch so you will buy everything at the
[28:38.640 --> 28:45.200]  sharecropper company store you can't buy anything from an outside general store if you're a slave
[28:45.200 --> 28:50.000]  sharecropper you've got to only buy it from the company store many school districts for a decade
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.720]  plus make you thumb scan to get library books or to buy food then they track what you're buying
[28:56.400 --> 29:02.000]  fernando waved his hand over the crowd and asked a visiting reporter do you see the situation
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.400]  at his public school little village academy on chicago's west side students are not allowed to
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.400]  pack lunches from home because you're prisoners you don't let your your biological slave parents
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.600]  make you food unless they have a medical excuse they must eat the food served in the cafeteria and
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.480]  see there's no law it's a policy so there's no law to take vaccines they just say it is the law
[29:22.480 --> 29:27.120]  and when you call them on their bluff they go oh actually there's not the principal said that
[29:27.120 --> 29:32.480]  they're protecting the children from unhealthful food choices meaning their parents are going to
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.240]  come back and finish up with this before we get into the government saying we'll tell you what
[29:36.240 --> 29:42.160]  lunch is to have or how much salt but radiation we're raising the levels and saying it's safe

[33:23.280 --> 33:32.400]  into the police state the principal uh aliza carmona said her intention is to protect students from
[33:32.400 --> 33:40.000]  their own unhealthful food choices she they decide if you can home school they decide if you take
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.200]  vaccines or not they decide if there's sodium fluoride in your water or not the government
[33:45.200 --> 33:51.520]  it decides when the government says jump you say how high she continues nutrition wise it's better
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.640]  for the children to eat at the school the principal continued saying that's a quote
[33:56.640 --> 34:04.800]  see this headline in chicago tribune should be schools ban parents preparing lunches
[34:06.400 --> 34:12.000]  but it isn't it's chicago school banned some lunches brought from home that's meant to sound
[34:12.000 --> 34:20.320]  reasonable this was written to sell the policy that's not even an accurate headline it's
[34:20.320 --> 34:26.240]  it's they wanted to water it down but still be honest some schools and districts ban lunches
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.440]  from home not school banned some lunches so the average person goes well obviously what
[34:31.440 --> 34:38.240]  is it a bunch of cupcakes now you've got the food police no it's everything period and parents
[34:38.240 --> 34:43.120]  are testing it sending nothing but what is seen as the most healthy no the school police take it
[34:43.120 --> 34:46.800]  and throw in the trash and if you do it again you're going in in school suspension and after
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.160]  that you're kicked out and now when schools kick you out they'll slap criminal charges on top of
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.800]  it claiming you're truant when they triggered you being kicked out nutrition wise it's better
[34:58.800 --> 35:05.520]  for the children to eat at the school she says she's now the mommy she's now the daddy not you
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.200]  not the parents you don't know what's best if your child has an allergy or whatever the case is
[35:11.200 --> 35:17.840]  the school the public school is going to decide already nationwide dodgeball banned tag banned
[35:17.840 --> 35:24.880]  then running at recess wrestling and now in some schools touching can't shake hands can't arm wrestle
[35:24.880 --> 35:30.480]  your prisoners all of this america is being turned into one giant social engineered prison
[35:30.480 --> 35:38.480]  and they know exactly what they're doing to the low level useless uh you know uh useful idiot
[35:38.480 --> 35:43.920]  control freaks know they don't know it's about the nutrition and the excellent quality food
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.360]  that we are able to serve in the lunch room this is a quote from the principal it's milk versus
[35:49.360 --> 35:55.040]  coke but with allergies and any medical issue of course we will make an exception oh how nice of them
[35:56.880 --> 36:02.960]  carmona said she created the policy six years ago after watching students bring bottles of soda
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.000]  and flaming hot chips on field trips for their lunch although she would not name any schools
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.320]  that employ such practices she said it was fairly common and then they have the chicago
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.440]  school districts saying that uh chicago public school spokeswoman said we will not tell you
[36:19.440 --> 36:25.440]  which schools do it but others are in fact listen parents and general public slaves we won't even
[36:25.440 --> 36:31.280]  tell you what schools do this you don't like us doing it we won't even tell you that's classified
[36:31.280 --> 36:36.800]  information and of course everybody knows about the big lobbies you wonder why it's school it's
[36:36.800 --> 36:41.920]  milk cheese meat more cheese more meat whether that's good or bad for you the point is what you eat
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.800]  in school lunch programs is what big companies lobby for you to get that's been written about
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.080]  for decades you want some raspberries and strawberries from mexico that have had human
[36:52.080 --> 36:58.160]  feces sprayed on them remember 1998 tens of thousands of children got hepatitis from it
[36:58.160 --> 37:06.960]  so what it's good for you it's good for you all the coke machines and twinkie machines and candy bar
[37:06.960 --> 37:11.760]  machines in the schools with the kids getting those because they make money there's no problem
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.280]  with that but you're not gonna pack your child's lunch do you understand slave
[37:21.600 --> 37:25.200]  and it goes on to say that they must take the cafeteria
[37:25.200 --> 37:31.280]  meals or go hungry that's a quote
[37:34.160 --> 37:38.000]  and it says the children take the food they're given but most of it goes in the garbage
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  uneaten you will eat the present food what do you think prisoners can bring their own food in
[37:43.040 --> 37:46.400]  you think this is america this is a chinese reeducation camp
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.640]  and it goes on to say those cps has improved the nutritional quality of its meals this year
[37:54.640 --> 37:59.200]  it has also been a drop-off in meal participation among students many of whom say the food taste
[37:59.200 --> 38:05.520]  bad doesn't matter prisoners just like in private prisons and government prisons where the diets in
[38:05.520 --> 38:12.000]  some cases are 80 soy and the men are becoming sick of the women are having increased breast
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.760]  cancer doesn't matter of all that soy causes problems you're going to eat it i mean after
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.680]  all in prisons all over the country they're still doing illegal medical experiments on people and
[38:21.680 --> 38:24.880]  it comes out all the time and nobody gets in trouble i mean after all the our government's
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.920]  been caught just recently all over latin america injecting people live vociferous i mean that's a
[38:29.920 --> 38:37.600]  loving thing what are you against it and the article just goes on with you must buy the
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.240]  lunch and it's horrible and nobody likes it but that's the way it is okay
[38:42.240 --> 38:50.480]  you're not allowed to bring bananas oranges or even grapes nothing is allowed no food
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.320]  children have tried to bring their own lunches again with nothing but fruit and vegetables
[38:56.320 --> 39:04.640]  trash cans and all over the country you think this is bad or at least 14 years i've seen ap
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.120]  reuter articles i've pulled them up here on air countless times they just had another one a few
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.800]  weeks ago where they do an unannounced drill generally at elementary schools and a man comes
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.560]  with a gun to the door the teacher doesn't even know almost as a heart attack they line the kids
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.520]  up and say we're going to kill you now we're homeschoolers against public education or we're
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.880]  a group against open borders that that was the latest thing in the ap two weeks ago uh or uh
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.200]  we're a pro gun group we're going to kill you now and they march the kids out the parking lot
[39:33.200 --> 39:38.560]  blow a bus up i've actually been to one of these events at belton they blow a bus up or a car
[39:38.560 --> 39:44.400]  fireshoots out and if the eight-year-olds weren't defecating themselves then it's just urination
[39:44.400 --> 39:49.920]  defecation this is in the news then they lock them down in and won't let them go out all day no
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.160]  lunch is allowed to show them how you can go pull this up you think i'm joking all over the country
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.080]  it's the same psych warfare federally written the school's always say well we're just following what
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.040]  the feds wrote we're just following the program to get this federal grant this safety grant and
[40:03.040 --> 40:06.880]  they'll lock them down in the school all day in their in their room no lunch allowed and to show
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.320]  them what a real lockdowns like this is these are quotes from the news then they have to urinate and
[40:12.320 --> 40:22.160]  defecate in buckets oh you oh you don't believe me a guy search children forced to to use bathroom
[40:22.160 --> 40:28.880]  in trash can during school drill two weeks ago it was uh the the group attacking unannounced
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.320]  was a anti open border group and then the parents are under mind control the school goes sorry we
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.320]  had to do it your kids have nightmares it's because the anti immigration groups might attack or the
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.240]  homeschoolers might attack and the parents most of them go well i'm not going to get mad at authority
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.720]  figures because i feel powerless subconsciously i'm going to get mad at the gun group that's right
[40:46.720 --> 40:54.000]  there's an imaginary gun group that made my my my six-year-old and if you think they'll stop with
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.080]  the kids remember just last year they had unannounced drills a large pharmacy chain
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.840]  had unannounced drills where a man would come in with a gun and rob them and it was a drill
[41:06.400 --> 41:11.920]  mandated by the insurance company all of this is to create the perception of crime these drills
[41:11.920 --> 41:18.480]  are giant reeducation camps you watch the movie red dawn that's based on real uh you type composites
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.720]  that have happened in different areas of the world where they're in the sports stadium and the parents
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.200]  come up to the fence to talk to their kids and they're bleeding and they've been beaten and what
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.080]  they do in a reeducation camp is they say we've got food if you accept and help beat the other people
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.680]  in here if you decry the bill of rights and constitution if you say america's bad if you'll
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.800]  become a spy for us that's what camp x-ray is at guantanamo bay where so many of the rebel leaders
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.720]  now used to overthrow other countries are shipped out the head rebel who is admittedly al-qaeda
[41:48.720 --> 41:54.880]  was trained at uh a quote unnamed black site they grab them torture him for five six years
[41:54.880 --> 42:00.240]  brainwash them prepare them put them in power and that's what a reeducation camp is well if you
[42:00.240 --> 42:06.960]  study reeducation camps public schools are reeducation brainwashing camps first you got to go
[42:06.960 --> 42:11.120]  in thumbprint and get a special id to be able to go in and get your kids then if you're pulling
[42:11.120 --> 42:15.840]  them up to pick them up and the teacher knows they are in your no got a thumbprint got a face scan
[42:15.840 --> 42:20.080]  you know all these systems going in meanwhile the government dinecore and haliburton run
[42:20.080 --> 42:26.400]  giant child kidnapping rings they don't get in trouble but you have got to go through all this so
[42:26.400 --> 42:31.440]  there it is and i got a bunch of other news i want to get to and then your phone calls uh
[42:31.440 --> 42:39.040]  meanwhile our media hardly even criticizes china anymore beijing police halt unapproved church
[42:39.040 --> 42:46.480]  services well in america if you don't get a 501c3 for your church even though under the first
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.640]  amendment you it's totally legal and lawful if you they tricked you 60 years ago to sign on to a
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.360]  charity and the big denomination standardized it by ordering all their subgroups throughout the
[42:57.360 --> 43:03.440]  country in the world to sign up for a 501c3 which takes you from being a religious institution
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.200]  under the first amendment congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[43:07.200 --> 43:11.600]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof and so all the big denominations in the 50s and 60s
[43:11.600 --> 43:16.960]  shifted over to always look at our tax exemption we're just now a charitable organization and
[43:16.960 --> 43:22.400]  can't be involved in political activity and so i've seen baptist churches in austin issue sheets
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.880]  don't talk bad about abortion don't talk about about the war don't talk bad about the president
[43:26.880 --> 43:32.800]  you're not allowed to talk about politics or we'll lose our 501c3 even at church barbecues and church
[43:32.800 --> 43:42.720]  field trips meanwhile media matters 501c3 can openly say we are here to wreck media take over
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.840]  alternative media in guerrilla warfare we work for george soros we will destroy you and they're
[43:47.840 --> 43:53.360]  like absolutely your 501c3 is fine but that doesn't matter churches don't have to be under 501c3
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.120]  but remember the indianapolis baptist temple there for 40 something years not 501c3 they
[43:59.120 --> 44:06.640]  swat teamed them hit them hit them hard oh but america is so free i mean they took those pastors
[44:06.640 --> 44:14.480]  to jail china they just kicked them out of the church and i guess china's doing what's needed
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.320]  Beijing police halt unapproved church service great job oh let me get to the other news here
[44:21.280 --> 44:24.640]  i heard this over the weekend and had trouble believing it but i went and looked it up and
[44:24.640 --> 44:31.520]  sure enough it was true rogue prosecutors get licensed to lie in chief that was the headline
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.560]  of the libertarian blog that boiled down a bunch of mainstream news articles here are those articles
[44:36.560 --> 44:43.360]  linked now again just like the chicago tribune had an article about oh a few things are banned from
[44:43.360 --> 44:48.320]  school and your lunch to make it sound reasonable then you read the first paragraph all lunches are
[44:48.320 --> 44:55.920]  banned from parents period period bananas you name it all of it wheat bread everything will
[44:55.920 --> 45:00.560]  make it simple the school knows best actually say that just like this deceptive headline
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.760]  supreme court rules against exonerated death row inmate who sued prosecutors and then you read
[45:05.760 --> 45:10.960]  deeper into this it says they knowingly put him in prison knowing he was completely guilty
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.760]  and basically knowing uh who the real suspects were and then they continue to try to suppress
[45:15.760 --> 45:19.920]  that information while he was on death row it turns out about a third of the people on death row
[45:19.920 --> 45:25.760]  were completely innocent but they don't care and they say conservative justices prevailed
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.400]  and are allowing the district attorney's office to have no liability
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.560]  and to overturn the 14 million dollar award for wrongful conviction a man who spent 14 years on
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.840]  death row and successfully sued the new orleans prosecutors it's like glenn beck a few months
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.080]  ago saying now google is working with george soros in the un they are overthrowing things and they are
[45:48.080 --> 45:55.520]  with the cia and nsa but i'm not with the liberals who think that the government is spying on you
[45:55.520 --> 46:02.000]  without warrants or that google is i'm a conservative so he's saying if you're a conservative you like
[46:02.000 --> 46:07.120]  being spied on if you're a conservative you don't like justice in due process it's the same thing
[46:07.120 --> 46:12.960]  here why the conservative justices see they kill one side of the bill of rights and the liberals
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.400]  they kill the second amendment and property rights and and and things like that so one group
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.400]  you know they will we'll get rid of these rights and you get rid of those what's the old saying
[46:26.160 --> 46:33.680]  guys pull up the nursery rhyme uh he could eat no fat she could eat no lean so between them they
[46:33.680 --> 46:38.400]  lick the platter clean i'm gonna get the exact nursery rhyme so get their names right but but see
[46:38.400 --> 46:44.400]  see the democrats eat all the fat and the republicans eat all the meat and between the two of them
[46:44.400 --> 46:50.800]  they lick the platter clean and they're all hypocrites they all love war they all love
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.040]  invasion and death and police state and we're going to decide what kind of food you can eat
[46:55.040 --> 47:00.560]  we're going to take the salt out of your diet there it is jack sprat could eat no fat his
[47:00.560 --> 47:04.720]  wife could eat no lean so between them both you see they lick the platter clean
[47:04.720 --> 47:12.480]  origin's the name jack sprat was used of people small stature in the 16th century the little
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.040]  people the poor people who didn't get as good a diet this rhyme was an english proverb from at
[47:17.040 --> 47:24.560]  least the mid 17th century appearing in john clark's collection of sayings in 1639 in the form
[47:24.560 --> 47:34.320]  of jack will eat no fat and joel death love no lean yet betwixt them both they lick the dishes clean
[47:36.160 --> 47:42.560]  saying entered the canon of english nursery rhymes when it was printed in mother goose's melody
[47:42.560 --> 47:49.840]  around 1765 but it may have been adopted for use with children much earlier in popular culture i
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.560]  think that's enough the point is between the republicans and democrats both sides play the play
[47:54.560 --> 47:59.120]  the liberty people on one issue but then always compromise and sell it out while attacking
[47:59.120 --> 48:06.160]  it on the other so to make a long story short i've seen the dallas crime lab the houston
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.720]  crime lab the tulia crime lab the san antonio crime lab just where i live in texas growing up
[48:11.840 --> 48:17.920]  what it came out four five years ago that tens of thousands of innocent people were sent to
[48:17.920 --> 48:23.600]  prison in texas and that just in houston and that they knew they were all totally innocent
[48:23.600 --> 48:26.960]  and they would just ask prosecutors you want them to be guilty okay we found their blood
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.800]  and they'd hold up a little red red slide to the jury this is just bloody did it the jury's like
[48:32.800 --> 48:39.280]  we get off on nicking boots of government you're going to prison boy i don't like that federal jury
[48:39.280 --> 48:46.880]  with uh bernard von nutt house 13 years coining his own silver speaking out against the federal
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.880]  reserve as to be technical there's more than 14 major private mints thousands of different coin
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.680]  dealers who make their own coins to be technical so totally legal totally lawful always has been
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.440]  even the wall street journal had to admit that even the associated press was shocked because it
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.520]  wasn't illegal doesn't matter they found a jury that sees going to 15 years in prison
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.240]  just like they're arresting people all over the country uh that uh try to use uh now i'm seeing
[49:12.240 --> 49:21.200]  reports of the silver dollars put out in the 60s i remember being a kid and pulling through
[49:21.200 --> 49:25.520]  mcdonald's with my dad and him paying for stuff with you know the silver dollars oh no people
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.080]  you proud to pay with the two dollar bill arrested you're like but officer it's money no it's not
[49:30.080 --> 49:34.560]  and once they put you in the squad car it's over they've got juries that will that would send
[49:34.560 --> 49:43.040]  a baby to the gas chamber if they were told to i mean they don't care you it's pure evil
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.400]  ladies and gentlemen i've told you the stories uh i was somebody growing up who was not involved
[49:48.400 --> 49:53.440]  in any crime nothing only thing i've ever stolen was a candy bar when i was like three my mom caught

[49:56.800 --> 50:00.800]  and then a few times we grab beer out of golf carts at the country club because you know the
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.520]  golfers will be completely drunk with huge ice chest of alcohol and we go to the country club
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.880]  sometimes when just like spalding in um caddy shack when he's going down the side of the bar

[54:39.840 --> 54:46.880]  and we need to realize that this is the way every major society goes but to have the supreme court
[54:46.880 --> 54:51.360]  rule that uh yeah prosecutors are allowed to withhold evidence that you're innocent and
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.840]  basically frame you that's the washington poster seeing in high court says exonerated
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.720]  inmate cannot sue prosecutors and then you read deeper even though they knowingly knew he was innocent
[55:00.720 --> 55:06.960]  and had the evidence and you're not allowed in chicago schools many of them to pack your own
[55:06.960 --> 55:14.480]  lunch your parents aren't allowed to either see that's freedom ladies and gentlemen freedom is just

[55:30.240 --> 55:36.800]  the radiation situation the government says don't worry we're raising the levels uh to thousands of
[55:36.800 --> 55:44.640]  times uh safe levels so don't worry that that problem's handled i'll get into this more with
[55:44.640 --> 55:51.520]  tarply as well but erin dykes has this article he wrote saturday soros dollar no longer reserve
[55:51.520 --> 55:58.480]  currency and here is the clip from bloomberg that is the basis of his article where at the
[55:58.480 --> 56:03.200]  breton woods to this weekend he told bloomberg who was fully in sconce there with continued
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.680]  coverage of how great the bankers are and how thankful we should be to them for wrecking
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.560]  everything by design and soros went on to say the big question is whether the u.s dollar
[56:12.560 --> 56:16.880]  should be the reserve currency it no longer is it shares that role with the euro other
[56:16.880 --> 56:23.120]  currencies and commodities but it's not just gold being used as a substitute which it is but oil too
[56:23.120 --> 56:27.440]  which is putting upward pressure on the market let's go ahead and play george soros you're like
[56:27.440 --> 56:33.840]  that now and if show if so which economies it's still the united states well there's a big question
[56:33.840 --> 56:43.040]  whether the u.s dollar should be the main reserve currency and in fact it's no longer is
[56:43.920 --> 56:51.040]  because it may be accounts for two thirds of the monetary reserves but the the euro
[56:51.040 --> 57:01.360]  is is an alternative and there's a lot of diversification into other currencies and even
[57:01.360 --> 57:17.280]  more into commodities not only gold but actually oil oil is now a asset class for investors
[57:17.280 --> 57:26.160]  and that has put some upward pressure on on the on the commodity all right uh there's
[57:26.160 --> 57:31.440]  dr. evil for you he'll be very happy when he makes his way into hades he'll fit in nicely
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.760]  there with all the other parasites of history uh now the bigger issue that came out of this
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.640]  again listening to bloomberg friday saturday and sunday you know they have audio bloomberg tv
[57:40.640 --> 57:46.240]  with all these snakes making a parade through i was uh spent hours a day listening they were
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.160]  very happy and very pleased with the economists they had on and many others
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.800]  i heard no one that wasn't happy they've all decided and they said us policymakers are
[57:54.800 --> 58:00.480]  quietly agreeing like gotner did two years ago in china that yes they are looking at getting rid
[58:00.480 --> 58:05.280]  of the dollar as the world reserve currency and that they agree at the meeting that needs to happen
[58:05.280 --> 58:09.120]  so there's your big news in fact we have another headline problems have to ferret out all those
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.360]  quotes but i know i've got them here in my stack uh where they're saying oh yes the policymakers
[58:13.360 --> 58:19.440]  agreed at the meeting and the private banks that we should move away um and so you get these meetings
[58:19.440 --> 58:23.120]  of the bankers that give the orders to the government bureaucrats that are the former
[58:23.120 --> 58:29.280]  ceo's of those companies or directors kind of like the spp meeting uh a north american union it was
[58:29.280 --> 58:34.160]  over a hundred ceo's there on record giving the three government leaders mexico canada in the
[58:34.160 --> 58:46.320]  u.s their orders and they were saying yes sir kill them yes sir mr soros this is gcn the genesis
[58:46.320 --> 58:53.840]  communications radio network over the last year alex has told you about and many of you have
[58:53.840 --> 58:59.040]  experienced emergencies and disasters and unprecedented numbers people have had to literally

[59:04.240 --> 59:10.080]  disaster strikes you won't have time to think you must act automatically what does the pilot do when
[59:10.080 --> 59:15.840]  the helicopter engine fails in flight no time to think just act automatically when the alert is
[59:15.840 --> 59:20.960]  broadcast the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door you'll need to be ready to act without
[59:20.960 --> 59:27.120]  thinking of what to do or what you need you need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious

[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:55.920]  our nuclear um reactor on a fault uh they found our our lieutenant governor come on in earlier than
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.320]  that and announced that he he discovered that uh the posts have been not you know one of the
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.040]  reactor blows up i mean people ought to be thankful radiation makes you not get cancer
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:11.280]  and culture said so alternatives okay the next point is uh they're changing uh the standards
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.240]  they're altering the radiation standards yes at the same time this week they're gonna announce
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:22.000]  that there's our terror warning um being changed to only elevated to intimate

[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:36.320]  to always low ball the number of dead and then later people don't hear about it when it's 30
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:42.240]  000 dead or too early on and everybody's paying attention to a story said there is no radiation
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.480]  or it's very low no big deal so then when it's seven and a half million times safe levels
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.880]  ah that's a month later nobody's really paying attention and we're raising the radiation levels
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.040]  to thousands of times what they were previously but it's good for you all right we're gonna come back
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:02.880]  go to mike richard steve john and others stay with us a very wealthy us citizen is predicting

[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:12.000]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.760]  underneath the americans at home i have determined this influence on our president in congress
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.480]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.160]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.160]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.880]  world government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.520]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.360]  tartley historian and economist will join us on breton woods to and george soros's announcement
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.400]  that the dollar is already not the world reserve currency and the consensus from the meeting of
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.280]  top globalist in new hampshire is that they are going to move towards getting rid of the dollar
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.120]  and giving more power to the bankers that have engineered the implosion also gold hits record
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:56.720]  on euro silver jumps to 31 year top also more reports coming out about honeybees dying all over
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:03.120]  the world the government's answer is hey no big deal not just in chicago but other school districts
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.000]  are moving to say parents cannot bring school lunches parents cannot be trusted to pack the
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.360]  lunches only only the school can be trusted also the supreme court has ruled that prosecutors are
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.440]  allowed to frame you knowing your innocent and withhold evidence of your innocence uh so uh we
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.640]  are in deep trouble but this is the cycle in humanity folks always let things get out of hand
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.280]  before they finally wake up the awakening is happening so they're rolling out the homeland
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.560]  security cog federalization grid to try to suppress us but it's not going to work we are
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.000]  going to win as the system abuses more and more people they will be soldiers in the info war
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.920]  to awaken others let's hurry to your calls now mike in illinois mike you're on the air welcome
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.160]  yes hi elix thank you very much i want to thank you for being a true patriot um the thing i'm
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.440]  calling about i'm appalled as to how you know japan is handling this on nuclear problem here we
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.760]  in my company we we you know our company that supplies zeolite they could have easily you know
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.320]  saturated the area with zeolite for those that don't know that's a type of rock formation
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:21.200]  that absorbs radioactivity they dumped a lot of it on share noble and it's one of the most
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.760]  effective things to basically neutralize it and encapsulate it uh but uh that's not happening go
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.200]  ahead no we we've we've been in touch with the council there and finally they're they're in
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.920]  correspondence with us right now we're ready to well that's because the state uh finally the
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.720]  governor of for the fukushima prefecture as you know has come out and said the government's lied
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.840]  i'm going to cover that but for folks that don't know what this this this this rock formation is
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.440]  explained to them what it does well what it does is it ionically absorbs the radiation like the
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.360]  septium that was you know around the plant there that would have you know contain that they could
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.200]  have then you know got that and dumped it you know somewhere where where it would have been under
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.600]  control even with the water that was spilled out into the ocean there you know they could have
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.640]  treated it with the zeolite where it would have absorbed you know the radiation there to a great
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.280]  degree and for folks that don't know that's even recommended by the iea but they've never recommended
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.360]  it uh to japan and that what japan did with the hundreds of thousands of fuel rods blown
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.360]  hither and yon according to new york times as far as a mile away it it it it it it brings a new
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:32.560]  kicker to the point of sweeping it under the rug they just had bulldozers cover the spent fuel
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.320]  rods that will continue to leech into the soil and water exactly exactly and even you know like
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:43.040]  they've got it to the reindeer the people up uh in the ukraine around uh Chernobyl because it
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.160]  it was probably the only thing that prevented millions of people from dying at that point it was
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:54.400]  just uh you know such a catastrophe and again as people see on the television you know there's
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.520]  no real well uh indication that you're you're receiving this radiation well i mean you would
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.160]  think that the pentagon who's pulled back 200 miles from Fukushima three and a half weeks ago
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.160]  would be honest with us about what radiation the readings they're getting but if you notice in all
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.760]  the news we're only getting state and local radiation increase readings and testing of milk
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.840]  and food we're not getting any of this from the federal government it's local independent
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:23.600]  government agencies and private groups that are doing it so the cover up in japan is the same policy
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:30.960]  here in the united states and it's ongoing but i've got quotes from our media abc news experts
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:38.000]  others saying it's now contained the crisis is over the crisis is intensifying yes it will and what
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.880]  they're doing right now they ship that big pump over there and they're going to cover it with cement
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:47.760]  no no zealot in there at all you know so again they're going to have to put it on there eventually
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.480]  and as you said on one of your shows there when you saw that mushroom cloud you know from the
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:58.160]  explosion you knew that it was a done deal at that point they had to take some drastic action
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.360]  we even tried to contact the state department here to uh you know to help us you know with
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.480]  the shipment of this over there and what and what have you but uh it's all sort of gone on deaf ears
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.520]  but you know where are the thousands of us helicopters and personnel who could do one
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.360]  pass a piece while they say the radiation is too high but they won't give us the numbers
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:24.240]  they should have had helicopters day one dumping the zealot on top of it exactly exactly you know
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.960]  alec it's it's criminal in my mind and then they're not supplying it to the people out there
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.680]  you know they're not um you know it's not really my department and the company you know to be
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.920]  dealing with this but i was off today so i was able to listen listen to you again but let me expand
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:47.120]  on that because everything's fine the epa put out a report last week that they've now raised
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.240]  and i'm directly linking through to them via this article american e you agree raise radiation levels
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:14:00.320]  for food and and and everything's fine uh it says that uh the new standards would result in nearly a
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.800]  1000 fold increase for exposure to strontium 90 a 3000 to 100 000 fold hike for exposure to iodine
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:13.680]  131 and almost a 25 000 percent rise for exposure to radioactive nickel 63 all the things being found
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:20.160]  here uh so they say it's suddenly fine sir so what's the problem you know government wouldn't lie to
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:28.480]  you what's with are you a conspiracy theorist sir 100 000 times safe level for strontium 90 is good
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:39.600]  sir uh a 25 000 times rise for radioactive nickel is is good uh radioactive 63 i mean what's i mean
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.320]  sir please i appreciate your call okay you know what folks everything's fine okay the bankers are
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.280]  going to fix things with this world government the radiation is good for you i'm glad the feds
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.160]  aren't releasing numbers they should arrest all these university and city officials that are releasing
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.080]  the numbers how dare them report that this higher radiation is here they should have waited for the
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:09.760]  epa to come out and raise safe levels there are a lot of sickos out there like that last caller mike
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.040]  unamerican he probably thinks it's bad that the supreme court rules that prosecutors
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.920]  can frame people he probably thinks parents should be able to pack their school their child's lunch
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.760]  and have that decision in their life he probably thinks it's wrong that wells fargo in wankovie
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:34.160]  admittedly laundered 376 billion in drug money he probably thinks sevenfold uh increase in cancer
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.560]  in bones from uh fluoride in the water is bad i mean you're a sicko
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.960]  oh richard in illinois you're on the air i hope you're not as crazy as mike
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.640]  no but i am uh representing 1500 architects and engineers who are calling for a new investigation
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.960]  of world trade center seven and buildings one and two i didn't know i didn't know that richard
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:03.200]  gaige called in another another person who said six years ago that seven fell at freefall and they
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.960]  denied it and now admit it so what the building fell at three falls so what if there was a 10
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.120]  second countdown and explosion blast points and police saying get back we're going to blow it up
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:18.880]  on cnn it didn't happen building seven doesn't exist and we we we fortunately have been able to
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.400]  wake up uh well over a couple of thousand architects and engineers throughout the country and we're on
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:30.240]  a midwest tour and uh my event coordinators wanted me to give you a quick update alex we're going to
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:38.000]  be in munster indiana tonight at seven p.m at the center for visual performing arts and then
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.240]  tomorrow night in peoria at the lake view museum why shouldn't people want to hear from 1500
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.640]  architecture engineers some of them at the top of their field proving there were explosives in
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:56.000]  the buildings uh i mean you know what richard radiation at 25 000 times safe levels is good for
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:05.680]  you yeah well i i doubt that but the government said so well people are waking up to uh what
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.880]  we're being told that it isn't just not true other people in mini minneapolis uh for instance
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.800]  did you just call the government liars because the white house regulations are so that should
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.560]  be an arrestable offense are you trying to discredit this government and the wartime
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:26.640]  that uh yeah all right i'm gonna stop being sarcastic uh richard gauge tells a little bit
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.040]  about architecture engineers i'm flattered you got through here so you're out there traveling
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.400]  trying to talk about the laws of physics laws of physics don't apply now because uh carl rove said so
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.680]  yeah we can't stop newton uh it's it's immutable he was with al-qaeda with
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:52.160]  with with 47 000 with 40 000 tons of structural steel in it a building like building seven can't
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:58.400]  fall at freefall acceleration straight down uniformly symmetrically into its own footprint
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.520]  a building wasn't even hit by an airplane next year let's say up is down and down is up richard
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.080]  well that's the problem and people yeah you're wrong up is up and down is not down and sideways
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.120]  is not sideways and black is not white but white is black and black is white two plus two doesn't
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:22.960]  equal four are you with al-qaeda i'm gonna ask you right now our no and neither are the 1500
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.720]  architecture engineers that i represent and but al-qaeda is good when they're helping overthrow
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:38.480]  qaddafi oh yeah well that's different see the um we've given this presentation uh over 185 times
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:44.960]  now alex throughout the country we're in a 10 city midwest tour we're five uh down and five to go
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.600]  we'll be in minneapolis on thursday uh 414 at the continuing education and conference center
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.600]  and uh i'm telling you beforehand of those who come who are skeptical of our position
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:05.360]  supporting newton's third law etc equal and opposite reaction um most all of them i mean
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:12.080]  and in almost a shutout in the last uh four out of five everybody agrees with the evidence for
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:17.200]  control them well that's because you're that's because you're you're evil and i don't need to
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:23.360]  look at the the laws of of newtonian physics i can just call you a kook and laugh at you so i
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:28.880]  don't need to look at facts okay i'm superior i can just laugh at you 911 was not an inside job
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.560]  guys with box cutters did take over the planes nobody fought back uh it doesn't matter if they
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.120]  said they blew up building seven and later changed the story it doesn't matter how many engineers
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:45.520]  or architects or physicists you've got richard gauge you are you are a kook and and so was that
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:52.960]  guy alex jones and and and all and newton newton is a kook haha newton newton the putin hi i laughed
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:20:01.920]  at him doesn't matter haha i love the government i love radiation it's good for me haha freedom

[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.840]  we were told by the mainstream media the primary instinct of unemployed americans is to go to college
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.960]  and seek a higher education but all across america students are graduating with hundreds of thousands
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.760]  of dollars in debt and no jobs most college graduates are now admitting that they would have
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.720]  been better off getting a job at walmart or mcdonald's than having their lives destroyed by student
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.960]  loans our friends at the national inflation association are getting ready to release

[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.920]  why banks stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs they've been available since
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.360]  1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement gold is out
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.480]  perform paper investments yet no word about IRAs if you would like to have gold for your retirement

[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.200]  john of minnesota didn't tell me it was richard gauge i guess richard didn't point that out
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.080]  i recognize his voice that is richard gauge a great guy check out architects and engineers
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.000]  for 911 truth just search that term you'll find the website and find out where they're having
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.240]  events across the country certainly should go to that i'll take a few more calls then i got a
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.560]  guess coming on then i will get into the latest radiation news but think about them taking all
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:38.000]  these different radioactive isotopes now building up in the u.s in the produce in the milk in 17 states
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.720]  the feds aren't even testing uh its local states and universities that are finding this and the
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.520]  feds response is well we'll just raise it a hundred thousand fold in one isotope three thousand fold
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:58.000]  in another 24 900 something fold in another a thousand fold in another that's the just insanity
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.200]  of it oh no that building's not falling at freefall niss said that for eight years then finally a
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.320]  year and a half ago they had to admit okay it does fall at freefall we don't know how that happens
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.600]  well here's the blast points on building seven here's the police saying get back they're gonna
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.880]  blow it up well we still say we didn't blow it up but the owner says you blew it up well he didn't
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:23.200]  mean that uh we say radiation's not bad for you we say that building fell on its own we say the
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.320]  easter bunny's real by the way uh jesse ventura is going to be on coast to coast a m tonight
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:36.320]  for the first hour and then yours truly is on for the next two maybe three i don't know sometimes
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.720]  they go into overdrive uh but the point is i will be on coast to coast a m tonight for two hours
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:49.200]  so definitely want to uh join us for that we're going to cover a lot of government corruption
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.240]  and things that they don't want you to know about i'll law his book 63 documents the government
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.440]  doesn't want you to read he could have gone to thousands of documents they don't want you to
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.640]  read but hence 63 the real coup d'etat with the killing of jfk so we're going to be breaking down
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.640]  a lot of key information tonight on the coast to coast a m coast to coast a m dot com okay
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:15.120]  um uh in other news gas prices climbing towards $5 per gallon oh what did lindsay williams say
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.360]  in october six months ago he said within six months to a year 150 a barrel oh now the news is saying
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:28.560]  that imf cuts us growth forecast on oil lackluster jobspace bloomberg but the government said we're
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:37.760]  in a boom economy and radiation's good let's go ahead and talk to uh steve steve and florida
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:44.880]  you're on the air sir welcome good afternoon now uh i wanted to relate to a recent conversation i had
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:51.280]  with a neighbor of mine who is an iraq afghanistan new world order expansion of their empire uh
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.080]  veteran uh before i get to that i just wanted to say real quick you know i told people if you
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:01.520]  want to know who owns things try driving that vehicle that you have without those stickers
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.640]  they require a new windshield or your uh license you'll find out real try not paying your property
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.200]  taxes and you try to squat on your own property swat team's coming and you know what they think
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.280]  it's manly to gun you down so get ready to die oh yeah and uh speaking of that i was talking to
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.080]  this guy and uh he uh i was talking to him about the middle east situation that's going on specifically
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:30.080]  libya and he mentioned when he was in iraq in afghanistan that a lot of times they would have to kill
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:36.480]  these kids because they you know were wired with you know bombs etc and i was saying this
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.120]  and he was telling them what you had pointed out about rush limbaugh's comments about war and how
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:47.040]  off he is on that and you know the thing is i said well what would we do you know if we were
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.320]  invaded like that you know wouldn't kids be doing the same thing with their parents training and
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.480]  behest sure they would we're defending ourselves that's that's all we're they're doing over there
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.760]  and this like like clicked on and then i went into talking to him about uh things that i've learned
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.840]  through you and i gave him a copy of terror storm and he's been watching they said it's really
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.560]  scary which means he's getting awakened for the first time to how he's been used but he made a
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:16.800]  comment to me he said you know my superiors told us about these so-called videos they found in the
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:22.480]  caves in afghanistan when we were there of osama and laden just in pristine condition but he said
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.960]  the thing is i came to realize from that osama and laden's one of us because those caves we destroyed
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:35.200]  them so it was impossible for them to find these videos that they put out there and the news media
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.800]  saying is osama and laden so you know you know thank god that's somebody who is well listen listen
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:46.000]  it's confirmed that and we're all lucky now the operational commander of al-qaeda gets his orders
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.680]  from the pentagon and hangs out there secretly it's on record that they protect him do they have
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.360]  low level soldiers that don't know who they're fighting for just like our soldiers think they're
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:01.280]  fighting for america and not the globalist it's the same story but how many troops have called in
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:05.680]  how many news items have admitted that they tell the troops you're in an al-qaeda area us troops
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:13.600]  have never been here and they see us mre's gun casings graffiti they then later talk to units
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.040]  when they get back that were there a year before it's all lies it's all fake when us troops actually
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.360]  captured 8 000 taliban al-qaeda quote cream times of london newsweek magazine they were ordered to
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:32.000]  release them and pay them in gold this was in the news in 2002 it's in road to tearing i mean the
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.360]  articles i mean i understand now al-qaeda would make young 12 14 15 year olds get the first ring
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.160]  around Kabul our troops would then bomb and kill them while al-qaeda then waited loaded on c130s high

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:37.520]  growth forecasts on oil lackluster jobspace uh george soros has announced that they have a
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.760]  consensus from breton woods to that the dollar is no longer the world reserve currency they're
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.840]  going to move away from it to a new basket of ponzi scheme uh and that the consensus is that
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.000]  yes they're going to do this of course you can't believe anything out of soros's mouth but monitoring
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:58.400]  uh bloomberg they were they were there on site over the weekend marching the globalist through
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:05.040]  celebrating what they've done so webster briefly on the economic front uh what's your take on uh
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.960]  what's happening with commodities are rising so much well we we have course in a world economic
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.760]  depression and we're still in this we're in the second phase of it still we're in the european
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.160]  banking collapse phase of this great depression if you compare it to the uh the depression of
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:29.520]  1929 to 1933 we're still seeing european banking systems blow up we've seen portugal blow up in
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:35.120]  the last week or so and of course the bailouts that are being arranged are not bailouts of greece
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:41.360]  or portugal or ireland they are the bailouts of london paris and frankford banks that have bought
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:49.120]  the uh the bonds of these countries and as as for soros um i i think there's there's a tremendous
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:55.280]  amount of demagogy and uh smoking mirrors with him i think in some ways he's trying to occupy
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:01.600]  a public space there there ought to be a debate about world economic world monetary reform
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.840]  but he can't do it and when you get down to this question of reserve currency
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.320]  here's what you've got to come up with and it's not you can't just pull this out of your nose
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.200]  from one day to the next you've got to have something comparable to the u.s treasury market
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.680]  the u.s market in treasury securities trades on a normal day about a trillion dollars worth of
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:29.600]  of t bonds and t bills however it can if necessary ratchet that up to two or three or maybe four
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.760]  trillion in a single day so it's the most liquid it's the deepest product and most liquid market
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.960]  in the world and it could of course be an actually a national asset instead of being a plaything
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.120]  for speculators which it is but if you want to have a reserve currency you've got to have
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.840]  something that can do the same thing so a central bank could come and say look here's two trillion
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.080]  of uh of securities we want cash and we want it now within two hours nobody in the world can give
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.520]  you that the europeans don't have it the japanese nobody comes close so if you're saying get rid
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.960]  of the dollar what you're really saying is go towards the situation where there is no world
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.240]  reserve currency chaos and maybe that fits together and then they admit yes then they're
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.840]  going to have this new global regulatory system that plays those markets and plays them off against
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.760]  each other with their inside knowledge further consolidating power and that's exactly what
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.680]  they said in their buzzwords shifting gears in the same topic area then we'll look at the
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.920]  geopolitical military operations expanding through african uh in africa as you predicted
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:37.200]  two years ago in the obama deception you said that would be the new military move first uh
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:43.120]  by brzezinski and the anglo-american system through the left cover uh obama noids but
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:48.560]  iceland has rejected the bankster shakedown so the british government is talking about trying to
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.760]  seize accounts uh lawsuits against the government though it's been admitted in iceland now for
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.520]  over a year that all of those debts over 95 percent of them were owed by the private bankers and
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:06.960]  derivatives this is not the debt of the irish or the icelanders or the people in portugal that's the
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:14.400]  big issue here uh latest development the government of iraqi ovec has said no we're not turning our
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.480]  people into debt slaves and britannia is coming after them i say hats off to the people of iceland
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:25.760]  it's a gallant little country a couple of hundred thousand people they're under attack by a much
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.440]  larger country great britain joined by the dutch joined by the european union the second international
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:36.480]  and all the rest of them uh the the leaders that they have inside the country are generally a very
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.560]  bad pack of characters especially the uh the socialists who are really the socialists are the
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.400]  other ones who are most eager to give in to the imf but it's a it's a resistance movement in the
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.640]  population against finance oligarchs and against finance capital and that is to put it mildly what
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.000]  we need here uh in this country over the weekend we've had the republicans bringing forward the
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:06.880]  demands of wall street and the financial community and obama trying to find ways to capitulate and
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.800]  his capitulation on the weekend surrendering on this budget stuff this was the one of the things
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:19.840]  he did was to destroy one and a half billion dollars of funding for uh fast rail so the chinese
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.440]  have fast rail the french have had it for 30 years to the day the dgb the us is still nowhere and
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:31.120]  will remain nowhere because of this sellout by the the obama administration and now he's coming
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.800]  after you again on wednesday with more cuts than these i believe are a genocidal type in other
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.760]  words he says he's going to talk about medicare medicaid social security entitlement now this is
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.960]  where old people start to die so uh and he's got the left cover uh because he's the democrat
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.920]  and so they're making it class warfare against the social safety net that even if you totally
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.680]  removed it explain briefly as an economist the numbers it would do nothing to the 1.5 quadrillion
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:06.720]  in derivatives so they're scapegoating it as a resource war as uh we just saw a few months ago
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.240]  with bill gates admitting hey you hire 10 teachers when you kill grandma they're really setting the
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.600]  stage to play us off against each other absolutely and and remember the the historical experience
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:24.320]  from germany 1930 to 1932 the short vinegar to everybody else the more you cut the budget under
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.880]  depression conditions and that's where we are you cut the budget under depression depression
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.640]  conditions your deficit grows next year it will all be worse because of what's been destroyed
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:40.160]  and of course the human toll in the meantime is very large obama by the way told people what he
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.200]  would do he gave an interview to the washington post editorial board in the week before his
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:49.680]  inauguration where he said very clearly mine you know i've been talking about hope and change and
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.200]  that's all a bunch of baloney in effect i'm gonna attack medicare i'm gonna attack social security
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:41:00.240]  those are the things we have to do we've got to come up with money for bigger and better bailouts
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.600]  of uh of wall street so that's that's what he's carrying and by the way you laid all this out
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:16.880]  two years ago this came out in in in march 13th uh of 2009 we got a fbi visit over this film they
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.960]  were so scared of it so i launched it two days earlier they were asking about this film i guess
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.920]  they were tapping our phones and knew what was in it everything you and i laid out in this and others
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:30.960]  has totally happened obama deception evergreen more important than ever and my final point
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:36.160]  on this was listening to bloomberg financial over the weekend from breton woods they were there with
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.240]  a steady train of miscreants uh coming through was that the great news is there's a consensus
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:47.600]  the same bankers that engineered this uh are now saying the system has failed they've got a new system
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.600]  and that they're going to basically have austerity but then they even admitted the problem is
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:42:00.320]  is all the big megabanks are insolvent and are basically zombies uh and and and that but that
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:06.400]  they can't break them up so that they're just going to go ahead with this program and the final
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:12.480]  point uh that was so frightening about it was uh that they seem to be very very pleased with what
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:21.040]  was happening well uh certainly the the uh big impulse to do something to attack wall street
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:29.360]  which was very very clear in 2007 2008 2009 has essentially been plunked by obama he has run a
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:38.000]  counterinsurgency operation of massive proportions so that the the entire um attempt to do something
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.760]  for example to ban certain kinds of derivatives ban credit default swaps ban the collateralized
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.520]  debt obligation the things that did the most damage in september and october of 2008 that is
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.560]  of course that has gone nowhere the financial regulation bill was dictated by the bank themselves
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.800]  with the help of barney frank yeah with the help of we got a shift gears now done all this
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.520]  web circles we've only got for this one segment you've got to go but in the final equation
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.520]  we're scapegoating welfare moms and old people and seniors instead of talking about the trillion
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.600]  pound gorilla in the living room the the trillion pound elephant the bankers the banker takeover
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.480]  that's the big issue but americans are really starting to get it now specifically on libya
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.000]  you've got some new developments there that's what we're seeing i think is that the the rebels
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:32.080]  in libya are simply militarily incompetent and they are so inferior to get off these forces
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.200]  that i don't think they can hold on even with the nato airstrike i think there's a very good
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:42.720]  possibility that we'll reach a choice point here where it's going to be either watch the rebels
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:49.520]  get wiped out and and it just means militarily defeated really not much more than that or
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:56.160]  have an actual land invasion a ground invasion you see that there's the thinking in nato coming
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.360]  from rasmus and the head of nato is that the partition of libya is a good goal he says there
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.920]  that could be a political solution there's no military solution that's nato speak for we want
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:12.400]  to carve the country in half unfortunately for obama for sarcosian for cameron they are so
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.680]  committed in their demagogy to getting rid of qaddafi that they may not be able to accept this
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.640]  but they've been the big thing is the inferiority of the rebels on the ground remember a lot of
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.760]  these people are from al-qaeda they are people who have done guerrilla warfare against the u.s in
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:34.320]  iraq and afghanistan and can kill a lot of our soldiers but what they're not up for is a kind
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.920]  of conventional war more or less where they have to go up against another army and they're out in
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:46.240]  the open and you see that they simply run away interesting is also the hatred of the united
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:53.520]  states and nato and even turkey among the rebels is extreme they they should control it right for
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.240]  their own interest they should hide what they really think but they can't hide it they're
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:04.880]  holding demonstrations condemning nato condemning the u.s uh complaining whining that the airstrikes
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.400]  are not enough uh what it simply shows is that these are these people are from al-qaeda many of
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.800]  them and they they really hate the united states and they should cover that up but they can't it
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.800]  keeps coming up to the surface and by the way webster just to briefly interrupt you said over a month
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:26.720]  ago that they would try to carve the country in two but then the arrogance and the bravada of the
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.600]  western leaders in the demonization of qaddafi would probably lead towards ground trips last
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:38.960]  week the top u.s general over the operations said we've got ground trips off the coast we are
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:44.080]  probably going to have to invade and so it looks like they've always been building towards this but
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:50.400]  there's been such a political backlash uh that they're basically uh hesitating what do you see
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.760]  happening well the smaller nato countries right be it the italians of the duchy the other components
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.720]  of the nato command would like the rebels to do this for them but what i think we're seeing is the
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.400]  rebels can't do it they can't hold on even in serenaica the other interesting thing today is this
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.760]  african union uh delegation trying to try to have a ceasefire which i think is the immediate
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.200]  demand stop stop the stop the shooting on the ground stop the airstrikes and you notice the
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.720]  racist treatment that the african union is getting those guys so for some reason they don't count the
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:27.600]  the arab league is important but and nato is important but the african union means nothing
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:34.480]  you had three presidents did the president of kangaroo uganda amali maritania and south africa
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.840]  i guess that makes five presidents meeting with qaddafi and qaddafi accepted their peace plan and
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.320]  if you turn the tv on well those guys they don't they don't count they're lucky if they even tell
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:49.840]  you their name the racist uh overtones of this thing are amazing because one of the demands
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:55.600]  of those a u uh president is that there should be protection for foreign workers for foreigners
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.440]  including african migrant workers who are the ones who have been slaughtered they've been lynched
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:06.720]  uh being uh Benghazi and dana and into a book and the other rebel cities they have been real
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.720]  atrocity but that's humanitarian webster just like the french troops in ivory coast uh helping
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.880]  protect the rebels that are admittedly slaughtering men women and children with machetes that is
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.240]  humanitarian right and the the ivory coast uh this is a different union resolution now but
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:30.400]  they're the same you know the ivory coast is un security council 1975 maybe is 1973
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.840]  there's a new kind of imperialism and what you saw yesterday was the french and the united nations
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:41.840]  actively trying to kill gibakbo and it's an interesting story here is that the uh the president
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:48.400]  that the french socosy wants to install is this watara he is of course a muslim from the north
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.000]  but above all he's an official of the international monetary fund and if you want to see it in terms
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.240]  of the global alliance of the cia with the muslim brotherhood and indeed with their property al-qaeda
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:04.560]  it's interesting to note that the guy who's now going to be maybe put on trial he's lucky if he's
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.160]  alive today gibakbo right in the south that's a christian with a lot of popular support yeah you
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.120]  don't fight al-qaeda if you're the serbs if you're the russians you don't fight the sweety buys
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:19.600]  you don't fight the dear sweet and we're out of locky when he's hanging out at the pentagon these
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:25.200]  are these are great americans uh we're anti american because we don't like al-qaeda and it's just
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:31.040]  that orwellian how dumb does the system think we are webster to be launching these new un al-qaeda
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.960]  backed wars where al-qaeda is the good guys well i think they think we're very dumb now maybe the
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.320]  world on the whole is not so dumb you mentioned iceland um you've also had turkey playing a positive
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.680]  role i heard a lot of turkey saying if you give arms to those rebels in libya that's going to
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:53.360]  cause terrorism lava off of russia something similar uh whatever missiles those guys in uh in
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:49:01.280]  banghazi get will show up in chechnya in southern russia in uh the Kurdish part of turkey west bank
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:08.960]  indonesia uh or any airport in the world so the libyan rebels coming that they're paid for by you
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:13.680]  on by you and coming to an airport near you with one of the missiles you gave them and
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:21.520]  this is what it's come down to unbelievable uh open open uh rewarding open uh fraternization
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:28.000]  of the u.s. government with uh with these al-qaeda and remember of that rebel council in banghazi
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.320]  half of those guys are anonymous we don't know we don't understand we only got a minute left where
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.120]  is it going so overall the operation is not going for the new world order well but they don't care
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.480]  they're invading more countries under the guise of humanitarianism hacking people up with machetes
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:49.280]  right and and you can see the things have slowed down in syria algeria is going nowhere the guy in
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:54.000]  yemen is holding on so i think what what qaddafi has done is at least this is forced this out in the
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.480]  open you can see that it's imperialism it's not happy days of democracy uh and slowed it down uh i
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:05.840]  think that the great danger now is that that the uh the demagogues the obama's the sarcos used in
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.120]  the cameras will prevail and say we now have to stand in our marines our special forces
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.920]  and and save the rebels on the ground and uh that of course will then be a full scale uh war
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:23.520]  that'll be that's obama's fourth war which is which is what he's got right now so uh it's important
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.960]  for people to say no to this and if you if you simply ended these wars you'd have about uh you
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.200]  know two trillion dollars to work with in terms of your budget so maybe that's an important
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.400]  sideline in the budget battle yeah but killing a million iraqis that's humanitarian these wars
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.200]  humanitarian we gotta unplug grandma we gotta take social security away i've got him here
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.760]  in the new york time saying cut social security so there you go folks there's your obama for you
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:51.920]  and you conservatives love it don't touch the bankers just throw grandma out on the street

[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:21.120]  john in illinois can't read kudos to richard gauge i saw him last night nevin still illinois
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.160]  his presentation gets more polished every time i see him but getting to the meat what i wanted
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.440]  to bring up about this nuclear business uh i'm sure that you're already aware of this but i haven't
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:38.000]  heard this uh thrown out into the media of late and that is the law called the price anderson act
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:44.960]  you're aware of that lock yeah fill folks in yeah okay the price anderson act was passed in 1957
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:54.160]  to limit the liability of any utility that uses nuclear power generation and the the industry
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:01.200]  would not exist today except for that law because the insurance actuaries would not ensure nuclear
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:06.480]  power well that's like vaccines for over 40 years have had a liability protection
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:11.760]  so they they they can kill you hurt you and can't get in trouble because of a federal law there as
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:19.120]  well yes indeed and one more point before i go in uh jessie's new book the 63 documents i was paging
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:24.320]  through it and i saw that one document that had been uh gotten by think progress about the coke
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:32.160]  brothers um organization of trying to thwart uh promote uh freedom and the coke brothers as you
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.960]  probably know have been demonized by the leftist press like media matters etc of late and i was
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:45.360]  wondering if you could delve into exactly if this is just a case of demonization or the coke brothers
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.520]  are really in on the new world order or just what the hell is going on all right i appreciate your
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:54.960]  call great point john i have read the book i read it a month ago uh i wasn't allowed to ship it out
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:58:00.480]  but we had these books a month ago and that was the one document that i thought was the only part
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.600]  of the book i didn't really like but there's 63 of them and it exposes democrats it exposes
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:11.120]  republicans and i dick russell we'll get dick russell on the author because he's the guy that
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.720]  wrote most of it with jessie ventura uh and you know as jessie said last week here on the show
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:23.760]  um and that's kind of a cause celeb thing to attack is the coke brothers uh i don't think they're
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:30.000]  perfect but they are kind of like mainline republican slash neocons who do promote some free
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.880]  market things i mean compared to george soros uh they're angel cakes but they're definitely part

[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:27.920]  we're already working on getting dick russell the co-author which has even tour of 63 documents
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.600]  the government doesn't want you to read and i would call him from many perspectives kind of
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:39.360]  a classical mainline liberal and of the 63 documents the only one in here and i think
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:43.840]  it's all still informative that i don't really agree with being put in the book and we sell the
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:55.040]  book and promote the book is is the um coke industries document and it says if not us who
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:01.120]  if not now when and it goes on to say you know join us twice a year for our network of leaders
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:07.280]  trying to promote a free society and then you read the code attracting principal leaders and
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:12.480]  investors who will effectively defend our free society sharing best practices and opportunities
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:17.280]  to defend our free enterprise system from destructive public policies fashioning the
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.760]  message and building the education channels to re-establish widespread belief in the beliefs
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.920]  of the principles of the free and prosperous society compare this to cast sunstein and his
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.440]  memos arrest people that disagree with us get people's guns you know why how science are put
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:36.320]  stuff in the water sterilize people the cut brothers from what i've read of these meetings
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.040]  put out a lot of really good information see this document comes from think progress
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:46.080]  you notice which is george soros connected and they just don't like it that there are some old
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:50.560]  lying conservatives that are out there putting a little bit of their money into resisting the
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.560]  globalist but it doesn't matter they resist with a rush limbaugh shon hanity type thing
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:02.640]  that tort you know tortures good drug wars good wars are good just don't raise my taxes
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.440]  and so uh you know all this sounds really great what the coke brothers are doing it's just kind
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:17.200]  of silly when you realize that they're not really implementing this stuff and it's even more silly
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.120]  than when you read the book and this one little document of 63 it's a few pages
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.120]  that you read all this stuff and it's most of it sounds like really great ideas ooh dirty bad
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:34.480]  but then you read the stuff coming out of george soros and and and the stuff being pushed by the
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.880]  quote left arm of the globalist people always ask me are you a conservative or are you a liberal
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:43.200]  well pick whatever term you want if you go back to thomas jefferson you know he was seen as a liberal
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.360]  liberal classical liberal uh and i'll identify with almost all the views of of thomas jefferson
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.480]  today he'd be considered a right-wing terrorist extremist these terms don't really mean anything
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:01.280]  are you pro-liberty or anti-liberty yes i'm pro-gun yes i don't like abortion yes i'm for private
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.720]  property rights yes i'm for lower taxes people say well you're a conservative well i'm also against
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.840]  torture and all these illegal wars and the lies that take us to war so i'm against it when obama
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.080]  does it i'm against it when bush does it i mean i'm the same yesterday today tomorrow
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.440]  occasionally you know i slightly change views as i learn more but overall i'm the same guy
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:26.160]  my job's easy just tell the truth history's pretty obvious pretty clear the globalists are clear on
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:31.520]  what they're doing and so when bush is in office i'm a communist the media says and now that obama
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:38.400]  is in office i'm a right-wing extremist and it's all meant to put things in little simple stereotypes
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:45.040]  so people don't engage in complex thought processes that's all that's happening and so when we get uh
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:48.560]  and guys remind me of i forget when he's on we get dick russell on the next few weeks because
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:52.000]  we were already lining that up in fact maybe we'll just try to get him this week i will
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.480]  commend him on most of the book um but i didn't want to you know what in the punch bowl when
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.600]  ventura was on and even get to this because i mean i this is like a shout out kind of like a
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:08.000]  bone to kind of mainline liberals their religion is shaking under their tables and beds at night
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.800]  afraid of the coke brothers and mainline republicans shaking under their bed from the muslims they're
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:19.280]  going to get them um but george soros and all his funded groups i mean they're just mad that
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.600]  somebody's out there not going a hundred percent on their agenda and there's become kind of a fight
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:31.360]  between the coke brothers fox news against and vice versa with the obama noe to hillary clinton
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:37.680]  clinton east uh i mean the issue is if you follow the real policies of democrats its communism
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:42.400]  to transfer your wealth to the international fascist system see communism delivers to the
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:48.240]  fascists not communism and fascism fighting with each other cameras black uniforms secret police
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:53.760]  high taxes on the general public hitler had it Stalin had it and so at the end of the day
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.280]  people try to put us in a box because they just can't even figure out reality uh but we'll be right

[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:28.080]  there inside baseball talk radio publication of decades and i was on the cover of last month's
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:35.680]  talkers and i'm the keynote speaker at the two-day event but i was noticing in new york on
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:45.280]  june 10th and 11th i'm the keynote speaker saturday and it says that the evening before
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:52.720]  there's the 8 to 10 p.m cocktail party i guess you've got to get drunk before you meet shon hannity
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:57.520]  and then i guess every gets off fox news he comes over there 10 to midnight shon hannity
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:05.360]  will be hosting dessert party needless to say ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna i'll probably
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:09.040]  be in little illy or something that night getting some good food not that i don't want to be around
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.080]  all these radio people and i'm honored to be going and being the keynote speaker but
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:18.960]  they've got me there to explain why i'm exploding and most of the talk show hosts are
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:24.880]  imploding and it's simple you know we had our earlier caller and i get a lot of these calls
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:32.080]  am i a left winger or a right winger i'm an issue driven person i'm against abortion not republican
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:38.720]  or democrat i'm against lying and launching all these illegal wars for empire is that republican
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:44.400]  or democrat say we're i'm against torture i'm against open air genetically modified organisms
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.280]  that are spreading into the biosphere is that liberal or conservative i'm against the private
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:53.680]  fellow reserve vertically integrating our economy and raping our population is that liberal or
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:59.680]  conservative no i'm a constitutionalist and 230 years ago i would have been called a liberal
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.720]  like thomas jefferson when bush is in office i'm called a communist when obama's in office
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:11.040]  i'm called an extreme hard writer i was on tom hartman's tv show last week now the hard right
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:16.960]  talk show hosts the extremist it's ridiculous you know obama's supposedly a liberal but torture
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:22.960]  wars police state patriot act it's all expanding they act like they're fighting with each other
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:27.440]  but the agenda rolls forward republicans and democrats got rid of glass deagle in 99 along
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:32.720]  the derivatives republicans and democrats don't want to reinstate glass deagle they want to
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:39.760]  continue unless you're talking about a ron paul or deniz kasenich so to oversimplify it democrats
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:45.040]  are basically at the top communist who transfer the wealth to the offshore fascist they say their
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:49.920]  anti-war but expand just as many wars as republicans they say they're anti-torture but they love it
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:56.000]  and push it they say they're anti-secret arrest and military tribunals but they push it republicans
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  love war love torture love death that that is the main line ones they say that's tough and
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  conservative when it's the opposite conserve means conserve our values the founders were not for any of
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:12.640]  that and so when you get down to real policies except for football issues they pass back and forth
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:18.240]  gay marriage and stuff there's no difference not a dime's worth the difference and so that's where
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:24.560]  i stand on all of this but on actual issues you read the republican party platform of texas for
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:31.920]  two decades or more i agree with about 98 percent of it it sounds like uh something ron paul wrote
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.360]  but they don't implement any of that the rhetoric's one thing so i guess some say oh well you're a
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:42.080]  republican because i tend to agree with the rhetoric of republicans more the difference is i
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:49.600]  actually try to deliver so um that's basically it so i just thought i'd make the joke about
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:58.080]  sean hannity who knows i might go to all these events while i'm there and talk to these guys but
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:04.000]  they're i want to be friendly while i'm there though and then that almost feels dirty but i
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.360]  don't like to learn a lot of intel while i'm there so i might just put on my corporate attitude i don't
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:18.480]  think i've ever done that but just go in there to learn and uh bumble around with these people but i
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:23.680]  will imagine that it's going to be like they're basically inviting in their view the wicked witch
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:30.480]  to the uh lollipop guild meeting of course from my perspective there'll be many wicked witches there
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:38.320]  and i'm from the lollipop guild uh but uh we're gonna see what happens at this event but i mean
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:48.000]  it's the ceo's a clear channel premiere all the big networks cbs nbc uh jones broadcasting all of
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  them are gonna be there and i've been told by the folks that head up talkers they've got a lot of
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:59.440]  requests for me to be there so um why i'm being invited to this we're gonna discover but we know
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:05.680]  why it's because of our incredible meteoric explosion um but um and because the system's
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:11.680]  getting scared i mean they realize that talk radios lost less than broadcast tv or cable tv
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:19.600]  but it's losing out as well not just to the internet but because people are so sick of
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:27.760]  partisan driven politics i guess what talkers says it says alex jones keynote and it says alex
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:32.640]  jones will serve as the keynote speaker at the new media seminar 2011 he will share insights
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:36.960]  and the internet success and suggest alternative approaches to issues talk programming on to
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:44.000]  racial radio outside rigid partisan formats well i'm partisan for liberty i'm partisan for family
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:48.720]  i'm partisan for free market real free market not a bunch of bankers changing the laws to be
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:53.360]  able to sell derivatives in the market and then have government sign on to it too big to fail
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:59.040]  i'm against this corporate fascistic system that uses socialism to scoop up the wealth
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.680]  all right let's move quick now because i want to go to bill extra in
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:07.280]  in dustory of unpronouncing that right and clayton and others bill you're on the air go ahead
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:15.520]  yeah hi alex um i predict after you give your speech in new york that radio in this country
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:23.120]  will never be the same again because i believe you'll be creating a cadre of followers of radio
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.960]  broadcaster followers we're going to imitate your success which will be a good thing even if
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.880]  they're not sincere about it so i think i know i mean i've been told that's what they that's why
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.000]  i'm requested is that they're basically like glenn beck did and it take a lot of what i do
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.080]  and then basically twisted into whatever they want but i think some of them will actually
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:49.760]  wake up and go all the way well i think a good portion if any of them have any intelligence
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:56.080]  at all and they look at all the research that you've done over all these many years as well as all
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:02.080]  of your guests your your your esteemed guests that you've had on over these many years they'll see
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:10.560]  that it's all 99.9 accurate um so i i really do think it'll be transformational and it'll
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:18.640]  really change things in this country from that point going forward um on another point i actually
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:26.240]  have two more quick points they go ahead uh regarding beck i i found him just to be entirely unwatchable
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:32.400]  and uh i just couldn't follow what he was saying you he would change his his logic from one broadcast
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.600]  to the next and well that's what that that's why the main reason they say they can name was
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:44.800]  that it was a confused message and i mean one minute he's talking about myself in in thick
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:52.160]  in in in imaginary triple x disease type stuff that i can't even describe in the next minute
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:58.160]  how he's our spiritual leader and and poll revere i mean i'm sorry folks he just doesn't make sense
[02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:05.600]  yeah his behavior was at times very bizarre and i also found it despicable that he wouldn't allow you
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:13.360]  to appear and i would imagine it was a judge napolitano show i found that really like low in
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:19.200]  like uh it showed his true character in my opinion well what i was told previous on other shows is
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.520]  glenn beck doesn't like you being on here he causes a lot of problems i'm not going to say the name
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:28.240]  of the it's multiple shows and then other ones were he'll come after producers if they do and then
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:33.760]  i had multiple guests say well glenn beck i first came on your show but now i want to you know i was
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:37.680]  going to go on his and i was in the green room and he said listen don't go on alex jones anymore
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.880]  or i'm not going to have you on here anymore uh and so he definitely that's the whole point behind
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:49.040]  the scenes but now we know why he says he's going to have these grassroots info warriors on the streets
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.000]  he's going to go mainly internet he's threatened because he basically needs to get rid of me
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:17:02.800]  or suppress my rise so that the the the bonafide real mccoy you know a real product doesn't show
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:09.120]  up what he's doing i mean it's real simple business from his perspective and yeah trying to block me
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:17.600]  uh from going on fox trying to do things like that it it it shows that he he basically is
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:23.600]  watching our every move yeah but it also shows that he doesn't have any real message of his own
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:29.120]  and we we out here in the listening and viewing world we can see right through that and i think
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:34.640]  most people will see through that and that's why you saw his demise at his ultimate demise at fox
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:39.360]  yeah you notice that came after all those big articles about him twisting what i do and i was
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.680]  told that was an ingredient in it but it was also him losing the entire young audience
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:48.960]  like he says his new plan is to reach the young folks the young are not going to follow an effeminate
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:54.880]  fairy over the edge of a cliff i mean i'm sorry does glenn beck radiate true surety or masculinity
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:18:02.320]  no he doesn't right and then you notice he attacked me from an effeminate fairy he said
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.080]  i'm an effeminate fairy that's because he's an effeminate fairy and he knows it yeah i mean and
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:16.160]  it's very you know it's it's just immature and it it was meaningless garble is the way i saw
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:21.120]  well he was starting to do some good with people like jibber griffin on but that's done in desperation
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:29.840]  to get the liberty uh market as they see it right uh and my my last point is that you
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:35.520]  had mentioned that you have on one of your last shows you had said that many congressmen tune
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:41.440]  in to listen to your show during the lunch time and i thought you know i was thinking in light of
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:46.640]  all the overwhelming evidence that you and your guests have compiled regarding the trees in this
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:53.040]  activities of so many who have falsely claimed the label of american citizen don't you think this
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:58.080]  would be a good time for these congressmen to come forward and to begin the process of seeking
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:05.280]  prosecution of these traders well i had bruce fine the big constitutional lawyer endorsed by
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.560]  ron paul on he's circulating articles of impeachment and i have had a lot of congressmen on over
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:13.680]  the years you know who during the break will say yeah i listened to you on this station or
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:16.800]  that station or we listen to you over the internet at the capital in fact i'm having one of those
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:20.320]  moments who was the congressman from tennessee i know he listens almost every day when he's in
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:26.640]  the district colon sorry say it again oh i'm thinking of colon from jesse even no no no no
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.400]  not steve cohen that went after the show uh i know him so well i'm having that point is i'd never
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:35.520]  interviewed before we got him on as a guest he said yeah we listen to the show almost every day
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:39.840]  but i've had a lot of congressmen telling that it's shocking because i mean i don't see myself as some
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:43.840]  you know big huge wonderful guy i'm just somebody here telling the truth people call in and say oh

[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.360]  us but to wake up see the world through their own eyes but to start really questioning what's
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:25.840]  happening and then to get involved however you see fit we're going up a mountain against the enemy
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:30.880]  i'm not asking to get behind me i'm asking you to get beside me and you know as for uh you know
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:36.800]  calling glenbeck an effeminate uh fairy that pull up urban dictionary a male who acts slightly
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:41.600]  feminine but not necessarily means that they are gay and i'm not saying it's you know he's bad
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:47.440]  whatever glenbeck sent to the point is is that watching him seeing him seeing him doing acting
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:54.800]  lessons on youtube he just prances around and twinkle eyes and you know comes off like a theater
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:25:02.480]  teacher or something and uh i'm not that doesn't matter i'm sick of talking about glenbeck okay
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:06.800]  it's just it's hard to not talk about him when i get compared to him so much for the political
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:10.640]  information i've been covering for 16 years he's been anti-new world order for three max
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:18.320]  and i wish that he was a good guy and i'm tired of talking about him uh but uh we're not saying
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:23.920]  he's a broke back pixie and it doesn't matter i'm not judging people i don't dislike people for whatever
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:30.080]  you know floats their boat the issue is glenbeck's attacked me because charlie sheen had gotten off
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:35.360]  drugs and he was there with nurses and people at his house and invited me out there to help
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:40.080]  him stay sober and i was like you're working out you're gaining weight uh you know you look great
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:43.760]  and he took it out of context and said that me and me and charlie must be in you know the shower
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.400]  together this is the type of stuff that glenbeck it talks about and is into and i've seen other
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:53.200]  weird statements about other people and it does there's something going on there that's all i'm
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:58.000]  saying uh so he definitely is living in a glass house on that front and that's what he thinks of
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.600]  his audience to take stuff out of context and go how weird you know he's saying charlie you're clean
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.680]  what does that mean uh you know you're in shape you know you're working out because charlie was on
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:14.960]  a seven month jag on hard drugs and lost like 25 pounds and was in bad shape and he was again a
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.520]  christian when i knew him six and a half years ago now you know he's like i don't want to hear
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:23.600]  about sky gods when i tell him i'm praying for him and a lot of that's because he started hanging out
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:31.200]  and going to dinner with uh uh who's the guy that's got the show uh bill mar and then bill mar attacked
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:36.560]  him this weekend on his show it's just you know you get to be friends with somebody you care about
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:40.640]  him charlie's gone through a hard time and it's painful to see all the things he's going through
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:48.000]  and now i've gone off into charlie sheen because we never got charlie on here six years ago because
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.080]  oh look a celebrity you know he's talking about how they like to play golf we got him on because
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.640]  he contacted us and he wanted to come on air and talk about 9 11 and i know charlie's a good guy and
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:02.000]  i am praying for him uh but uh he's not going to find fulfillment with all those hollywood people
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.240]  i'll tell you that right now all right enough of that uh extra in idaho you're on the air go ahead
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:13.520]  go ahead go ahead yeah it's uh something pretty important here uh the rather hold those deeper
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.560]  and deeper um one i'm about to tell you will paint a pretty clear picture of the current cover-up going
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:26.880]  on with fukushima uh now between 1957 and 64 in a town called siny valley california only 20 minutes
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:33.440]  from downtown los angeles a sodium reactor experiment was an experimental nuclear reactor
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:38.880]  which operated from 57 to 64 and was the first commercial power plant in the world to experience
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:45.920]  a core meltdown there was a decade long cover-up by the u.s department of energy the detail and of
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:49.920]  the disposal was not recorded because they didn't have any disposal techniques then because it was
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:55.680]  so predated and it looks like uh there's still thousands of pounds of this uh sodium coolant
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:59.840]  that are on account of force still yeah well i was not aware of that but i know they've got
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.360]  several experimental reactors here in austin then almost nobody knows about even though they're
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:07.920]  admittedly there give me the name of the reactor in the event or the name of the news article
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:13.040]  the headlines we can pull that up the facility was uh rocket dying it's now owned by bowling and
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:18.160]  the cordon facility uh as far as current times are now what's the name of the article you're
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:23.760]  reading about it uh rocket dime meltdown simi valley yeah you could just google that and it'll
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:31.680]  pull it right up rocket down rocket dime uh simi valley california meltdown simi valley
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:40.720]  s i m i valley simi valley simi valley simi valley simi valley uh simi valley um meltdown
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:47.520]  california yes simi valley california meltdown right and they actually say that this was uh
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.240]  up to 240 times worse than the three-mile island incident well that's the issue they
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:56.000]  lied about three-mile island they lied about sure noble and now they admittedly have lied about
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.160]  this and the radiation is going up in the u.s and the feds won't release the radiation numbers
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.560]  and are now raising the safe levels of what they say is safe i mean this is it just shows you how
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:09.520]  how to control these people are exactly one more point i want to bring up uh if you to

[02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:21.760]  me it's alex johnson on the gcm radio network lieutenant colonel anthony schaffer is the u.s.
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:28.880]  army lieutenant colonel became famed for his reports about the federal government mishandling
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:34.080]  intelligence reports before september 11th attacks and for the censoring of his book operation garkard
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:40.080]  and instead of going through his uh long bio just know that he ran some of the biggest operations
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:45.680]  against al-qaeda and was continually blocked from going after him and now we have fox news and ap
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:51.040]  reporting the head of al-qaeda the head of operations under the fairy tale creature bin laden
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:58.000]  amaral laki hanging out secretly at the pentagon al-qaeda forces uh the even the wall street
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:04.480]  journal reports forming the core cadres from the beginning with british special forces and now us cia
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.680]  backing them up in eastern libya uh they've got another muslim connected to the muslim brotherhood
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:14.720]  with the french invading ivory coast and going into the capital and taking out the elected president
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:20.080]  it's in the bbc that the rebels are reportedly killed thousands with machetes and machine guns
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:23.920]  so that's your humanitarian action when we had lieutenant colonel schaffer on a few months ago
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:29.200]  he said from being there for years in afghanistan his view is we need we need to get out of there
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:35.680]  our country's going bankrupt uh and now another war and african looks like it's moving fully into
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:40.480]  africa i don't know his views on the current operation but we got him on to talk about
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:45.680]  the things that are happening and to give us uh his view on it uh colonel schaffer good to have
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:49.520]  you here with us again thank you for having alex good to be on with you again again joining us
[02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.560]  via video skype for prison planet dot tv viewers uh sir so much is happening you heard that my
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:35:00.800]  preface uh what's your overall view on uh what's happening in north africa what's happening in
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:06.640]  ivory coast what's happening in afghanistan they the the same tactic of it's always a year more
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.160]  always a year more well i think the bottom line is we have no clear policy and therefore if you
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:18.480]  don't really have a policy you really kind of meander around um i i think african for example
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:25.040]  was set up really to be a non-combat command and i i think that's what most people really focused
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:29.680]  on last year my think tanks and for advanced defense studies that i'm the director of communications
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:36.880]  for had a uh hill uh uh conference on african and where the focus really was and i i believe most
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:42.480]  folks thought it should be is trying to focus on outreach and helping the the countries that are
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:46.960]  really a time that they're that are autonomous really find their way and what we're i think
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:51.360]  finding is that no one wants to leave them alone and let them do their own thing i think everybody
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:55.600]  from the west somehow thinks that uh we know better than them and therefore we need to jump in and
[02:35:55.600 --> 02:36:00.960]  try to help them out and i know the uh liberal community does not want us to do military things
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:05.040]  there frankly i think you probably agree with me on this we don't really have the resources to do
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:10.000]  military things there and yet somehow we're doing military things there so i think that's the part
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  of the difficulty right now is that um without having a clear uh idea of what we're doing we have
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.040]  a tendency to draw ourselves in to these military conflicts and i think what we're seeing in libya
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:27.200]  was as a as a prime example and i don't know alex if you track what i said from day one i i felt
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:32.800]  that we were on a path to know the bosnia yes and and and frankly we don't need to do i mean you
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:36.960]  know this is a tribal issue this isn't it let me in particular that's not a democratic uprising
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:43.040]  it's tribe on tribe uh and now with ivory coast i think we're seeing something very very similar
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:49.600]  where you have two different factions and um you know the west involving itself and i don't get me
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:55.200]  wrong these nations and the the use of machetes and hacking people i'll never forget the first
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:03.600]  exposure i had to uh to to ivory coast was a picture of a guy of a body sitting on on a curve
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:07.840]  with blood spurting out of it after the guy's head was rolling on the ground that that was the first
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:15.840]  time i ever saw a picture of ivory coast so these people these tribes have a deep hate for each other
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:20.080]  and the idea that we're going to referee and we're going to show them the path to
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:25.760]  to the proper you know way of doing things i just don't think uh we are able to do that
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:29.760]  and we've not been able to do that since we've been there and the west has been in ivory coast
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:35.760]  for example since the 1880s when uh europeans all started you know pulling apart africa for
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:41.440]  their own colonial purposes yeah i've read some of the old british history books about that area
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.640]  and how the tribes normally weren't even attacking the westerners because they were too busy
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:51.760]  just slaughtering each other 24 seven because they'd been in you know a thousand year plus
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:58.240]  blood feuds with each other but but but but looking at libya in the north there
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:04.240]  with all of your inside connections uh what's really going on there who are the factions
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:10.720]  uh i mean is this just pr that there isn't a strategic objective or is there a hidden objective
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:19.360]  well the the bottom line is there are two basic groups uh kadafi and his folks uh you might have
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.960]  seen my friend congressman kurt welden's over there right now trying to help get him out of there
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:30.720]  to go somewhere else and um there's the the the groups from the east who really were loyal to
[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.920]  the monarchy and don't forget alex you know that the 42 years ago when kadafi came to power he
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:43.360]  dethroned the monarch there and for better for worse during those 42 years kadafi used his resources
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:49.680]  which are primarily oil related to benefit those tribes who were loyal to him and uh basically
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.680]  cut off make life miserable for those who didn't support him and that included most of these old
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:58.720]  old tribes if you look at just what's going on the the banner that the flag that the rebels are
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:05.120]  using is the old monarchy flag so what we what we're seeing here essentially are groups of tribes
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:12.080]  one loyal to kadafi and if you noticed that that uh everything was going well regarding the
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:18.800]  rebels going until they went to cert from cert on west you have a group of towns for better for worse
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:23.920]  whose tribes have stayed loyal to kadafi because they were benefiting from all the resources and
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:28.560]  we also have those eastern tribes with these you know hundreds and hundreds of year old uh blood
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:34.880]  feuds uh the rebels have been caught lining people up shooting them cutting them up so
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:39.360]  the kadafi loyal forces don't have a choice but to fight because a lot of them are going to be
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.160]  slaughtered and executed under this new government you were spot on and that was one of the things
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:48.400]  that people continue to miss it's not like we're jumping in to help a group of good guys we're
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.880]  growing we're going in with and and i know some folks have been upset with me by saying this but
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.920]  we've we've chosen sides we've chosen the rebel side without really knowing knowing what we've
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:03.920]  chosen with that said what's going on there obviously is um they we were blind there alex that
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:09.680]  the brutal truth here is that our intelligence community is so broken we and the state department
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:14.240]  was so diverted doing other things we had no idea what was going on there but currently if i knew
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:19.280]  this from studying things five six seven years ago just you know because i'm into studying different
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:24.480]  regions and geopolitical things it's i mean i it's hard to believe that the government and the cia
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:31.200]  i mean doesn't understand this and hasn't uh broken down you know all the different uh tribal uh
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:36.560]  angles and and and then i read about the main rebel leader admittedly was once held in some
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:44.400]  type of black site uh and it brags that he sent al-qaeda fighters to kill americans uh in iraq i
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  mean i mean that's all in the mainstream news right and i think that's part of the problem
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:52.960]  here al-qaeda i do believe that whatever you want to call it has become a franchise not a real
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:57.600]  well organized organization i think that whatever you want to call al-qaeda
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:01.120]  is trying to take advantage of the situation in levy and other places with that said
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:06.000]  um i think we're jumping in there for two reasons first i don't think we know what's going on so i
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.240]  think out of desperation almost and let me let me say something to make me probably very popular
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:14.160]  with some of my friends general clapper the current director of national intelligence doesn't have a
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:19.840]  clue about what's going on there let alone other places so i think uh there's an old saying i think
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:25.440]  the japanese saying you know that the fish rots from the head uh i think we have folks who are
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:29.920]  are primarily politicians first intelligence professionals second who are running the intelligence
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:35.200]  community because as you just pointed out uh there are people who track this and i know i
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:40.240]  know for a fact there are good men and women in the intelligence community uh people like me who
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:43.600]  try to do their job and try to say hey there's something we need to be paying attention to
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:49.440]  but if the political wins aren't just so they they're told not to do it so i think you're seeing
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.960]  the the outgrowth of our inability to actually look at what is real and so you i think you see
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:59.760]  the administration trying to play catch up uh i think unfortunately uh the way the state
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.680]  department's interpreting all this is an opportunity to jump in with these folks i don't
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:07.920]  think it's an opportunity i think it's one of those things where i i don't necessarily believe
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:13.520]  that qaddafi should stay however uh you know the devil you know is but in some ways better than a
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:19.040]  devil you don't because i think there would be huge ethnic cleansing just like i say it again
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:25.120]  bosnia what happened in the bosnia herko to the venus situation or wanda or a wander and this is
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:29.440]  where i think we should have not interceded the way you know and frankly we're not doing a no
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:32.960]  fly zone it's more like a demil demilitarized zone because we're hitting targets on the ground the
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:38.000]  air force hasn't flown since the second day of the uh they don't fly and notice since since the
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.880]  ragtag nato people who are never in real wars have gotten into command they're just bombing
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:47.040]  anything moving it looks like mainly the rebels and i want you to speak to that but but but what
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:51.760]  about this issue of the 34 billion to 37 billion they're saying they're going to give the rebels
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:57.840]  they're giving the al-qaeda mixed group the central bank the oil company and and and and so if this
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:05.040]  did go the way obama and nato are trying to get it to go we're going to have a new islamic
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:12.240]  republic there you've already got the quote quasi new government uh even in the new york times
[02:43:12.240 --> 02:43:17.840]  reporting uh in egypt uh that is saying they're going to have just like iran the modesty patrols
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:24.880]  i mean this this i mean the you're saying the pentagon the cia and the white house are really
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:29.840]  that dumb that they don't know they're about to hand libya over to muslim extremist well the
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:33.600]  alternative is that they know what they're doing and that makes it even worse i think the bottom
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:37.760]  line here and let me just let's talk about it just for a real quick second i feel terrible
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:42.960]  terribly about how we treated president mubarak i mean he was no saint but he did a lot of things
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:48.320]  to settle that he that area down yeah i understand that that was probably a real legitimate democratic
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.800]  reform movement uh the only thing i kept that country together was the egyptian military which
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:57.520]  was trained by us for better for worse uh with that said i i you know we've allowed that to kind
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:02.480]  of go on and maybe maybe it's best to kind of go in their own direction to figure out what's best
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:08.720]  for them however uh when you look at at libya it seems like we've almost pushed things further
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:13.200]  than they they need to be right now because i think uh the bottom line in libya and as you
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:17.920]  mentioned we've not paid well good attention and alex it can you imagine the fact that our our
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:24.080]  central bank the federal reserve loaned uh the libyan bank a lot of money during the bailout
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:29.120]  last year last few years so it's kind of like where where's why are we you know supporting
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:33.600]  all these folks and now we're talking about money going to rebel group who we don't fully understand
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:37.200]  we don't know what their loyalty is going to be and if i were them i would take the money and do
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.640]  whatever the heck i want and no matter what what we think that they're going to do absolutely but i
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:49.920]  mean weapons systems to people i saw that west point report from a few years ago that just got
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:54.800]  attention the last two weeks where they broke down that libya per capita was the greatest
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:02.320]  deliverer not afghanistan not not even saudi arabia to real jihadi al qaeda fighters right
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:08.000]  and that's our ally in the east well that was part of the problem and i was talking to my friends
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.800]  down at central command and they pointed out to me when this all first started that you know we
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:17.920]  essentially did not go deep enough in trying to understand what qaddafi was doing during the time
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:23.440]  he was in power and up until this decade they've still been running training camps in the western
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:29.840]  part of libya training radicals training the terrorists and so they've almost i think taken
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:34.240]  advantage of the fact that they had this capacity to train terrorists and they'd become kind of a
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.480]  terrorist training center if you will and because qaddafi was smart enough to give up his weapons
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:43.840]  of mass destruction least most of them he was able to cut a deal for himself so so basically we're
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:49.200]  still you know kind of going in with these uh these despot leaders and still uh you know not
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.360]  really understanding what the in effect is going to be well kernel what does that say though that
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:59.280]  mubarak a 31 year dictator propped up by the west not saying it's good but bringing some stability
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:03.920]  he stabbed in the back he says i won't step down the white house says you will step down he magically
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:12.080]  has a stroke never seen again we now have qaddafi six years ago makes a deal hires uspr firms bush
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:18.720]  says we're now basically leaving him alone he gets bailout money of taxpayer money under the table
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:24.160]  he's now with the african union agreed to transition power and leave in the next few years
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.560]  they're saying no to that what message is this sin now we see saudi arabia in the times of london
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:34.640]  saying we want to make a deal with russia and china we don't trust the us anymore we now see even
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:40.800]  jordan freaking out uh i mean this overall the method of the madness here is a destabilization
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:47.040]  of the entire region well i think there's there's a reason the fundamental reason why we are so badly
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:52.080]  looked upon there is uh frankly goes back to the end of the cold war everywhere else in the world
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:57.200]  once the cold war ended we kind of backed off and let things be uh europeans have you noticed
[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:01.520]  we've down downsized greatly well you know we're talking about having just a small amount of troops
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:06.320]  in germany now i think the germans at first wanted that now they're not so sure that i think they
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:11.680]  want us to stay there somewhat uh saman and and uh in asia we really backed off the only place we've
[02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:15.600]  really been doing anything in a way of terrorism stuff hand to terrorism stuff is the philippines
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.360]  and and frankly that's that they've asked us to come in and help them with that so that's not
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:23.520]  really a big big deal the problem with the middle east though is it because of our own
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:29.040]  interest regarding resources we kept a very heavy book boot on on essentially the throat of a lot of
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:35.680]  the people and not we so much but those individuals those dictators we worked with and i know this
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:42.080]  is a harsh thing to say but it's essentially the truth we in our own self-interest sided with
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.040]  the individuals those leaders of those countries which treated the people very badly so surprise
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:53.280]  surprise not really uh you've got the people now seeing us in the same bad light as they've seen
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:58.480]  these dictators and so we are part of that process one of the great ironies here is that the iranian
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:03.520]  people a lot of the younger people they like us they like the idea of freedom and one of the reasons
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:08.880]  that they have wanted this western lifestyle and what what a lot of the west ends for is because
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:14.800]  they don't see us the u.s as part of the very restrictive regime there so we are seeing them in
[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:21.440]  results of i think some some policies which we we knew going in may be tough for the long term but
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.560]  we decided decided to seek short-term goals of trying to seek resources and things to sustain
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:31.600]  our economy rather than understanding better and trying to deal with the long-term consequences
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:40.400]  of of of unstable of populations which are for better for worse looking to be free well looking
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:48.960]  at the end game here briefly what would you have done with libya a b looking at the real policies
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:54.560]  and this quagmire with the politicians now saying he must go they've thrown down the gauntlet now we
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:58.960]  have this u.s general saying yeah ground troops may have to go in with the troops ships off the
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:03.200]  coast i mean i think the real policy here is they're probably going to quote put in a humanitarian
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:08.560]  backup force well it'll be called p support if it goes in that's the military term for it but with
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:17.920]  that said um first off uh i i agree 100 with secretary defense gates that this was ill advised
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.840]  we just don't have a sufficient knowledge of understanding everything that's going on
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:27.760]  to jump in uh if you wanted to do something if we had to do something um i would have done two
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:34.720]  things differently than president obama first the moment the era bleague said we support the
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:39.840]  humanitarian aspects i would have said fine i would have notified congress implemented the
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:44.240]  war powers act i wouldn't have gone to the u and i would have just acted set up this no fly zone
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.760]  and then alex what i would have done at that point in time is demand cutter saudi arabia
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:55.360]  and other arab nations step in this is a big mistake we always make those those nations are
[02:49:55.360 --> 02:50:01.520]  as rich as any nation has ever been those those larger arab nations saudi arabia has a gigantic
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:06.640]  military they do and so i don't understand it if you if you recall recently within the last few
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:11.520]  weeks cutter actually bragged on itself by saying all the Saudis have you know deposed their own
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:16.640]  leadership so we're here so that i would have picked the cutter or some other nation to take
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:21.920]  the lead and make it an arab force going in there to deal with arab issues otherwise we're the ones
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:26.400]  who look like an imperial power where you know instantly if you recall right after we see this
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.960]  all started with our lead uh the arab league said oh we didn't know this was going to happen
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:35.440]  so you know we we need to get out of the middle of this and then of the arab say well you've
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.600]  got to help us spread democracy well great then you do it that's what george washington said just
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:45.440]  stay out of it but then when we come back colonel you you probably wouldn't have ever even done this
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.800]  but but but we'll let you answer that question and and see if my guess is right versus what you
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:54.960]  would have done then we'll talk about in the final few minutes what you now think is going to happen
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:59.840]  we'll be right back i'm alex jones with info wars dot com new book is operation tar card

[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.680]  you always go to our think tank we've done a lot of work and and well it basically we have
[02:54:33.680 --> 02:54:37.680]  something called radicalization watch we look at where things are happening so in fact i was taking
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:41.440]  a lot of information out of our report on this very issue today when i was before i came on with you
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:51.600]  uh c4 wwwc4ads.org and um uh operation darkheart.com is what my books like so you guys can check that
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:57.440]  out there too all right we're almost out of time here we appreciate you joining us uh we've already
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:02.240]  answered you know the question of well if it had to happen what would you do but but bottom line
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:06.480]  would you if you if you were the president would you have gone along with this operation
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:13.040]  no uh not what the way it was planned um uh much like military operations like
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:18.960]  like comedy it's all about the timing i think the timing was awkward i think the policy is still
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:23.920]  very unclear and you know i'm sorry i disagree with secretary clinton and president obama our
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:29.040]  objectives are not clear clearly this was not a short kinetic thing i knew that the day that started
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:33.360]  so i think we need to be much more realistic and for better for us i think congress needs to have
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:37.200]  a say in this since they're the ones who appropriate the money and pay the bills well sure i mean you
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:41.440]  still are uh you know in the reserves it can be called a back of duty anytime so you can't say
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.160]  much about the commander-in-chief but i did have the constitutional law scholar who's circulating
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:52.400]  the articles of impeachment on the hill and getting some traction uh mr fine last week and he pointed
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:58.240]  out that this is caesar crossing the rubicon no consultation with congress nothing just the un says
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:04.400]  attack and we say absolutely within 36 hours the bombing is on he's saying this is an impeachable
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:09.120]  offense well i've been critical of president bush and a number of things over the past years of you
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:14.880]  know during the time i i've worked with india d and but frankly when when president bush decided
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.000]  to go to war with iraqi sought congressional support first anyone to the un i think that is
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.960]  the proper way of doing it and and frankly i don't know i'm not illegal completely i mean i'm not
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:29.520]  a lawyer but i do study the law a little bit i don't understand how it was legal to use that
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:32.880]  amount of appropriate appropriated money and keep in mind this can't have to come from somewhere a
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.680]  billion dollars has been spent in the united states name and our name going into to do what
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:43.280]  we're doing in libya and i just don't think that uh congressional leaders have proper ability to
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:49.280]  assess this and i'm sorry this is to me this is war and uh i don't know what else to call it when
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:53.520]  you start using that level of force and you did have military objectives one way or another so
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:58.640]  anytime you have military objectives to me that's a war congress does the taxes the spending the war
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:03.280]  and more and more they become ceremonial in closing how do you see this ending on the
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:09.680]  current trajectory well unfortunately i see us going meandering down the path we did with bosnia
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:14.160]  somehow i believe unless qaddafi is able to leave with the next couple weeks we're going to be in
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:18.640]  for a long haul like we did with with bosnia i predict that we may be there for you know another
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:23.040]  five ten years at the rate we're going unfortunately and they already launched cruise missiles into his
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:27.840]  compound i mean that breaks international law right there trying to assassinate him and they
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:33.280]  say they're not this guy's got a long history of staying dug in i don't think he's going anywhere
[02:57:33.280 --> 02:57:37.440]  i don't think so either so what do you think about the different generals that have been in the news
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:44.560]  saying the ground troops are ready well i think clearly militarily alex there's nothing we can't
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:49.600]  do i do believe that we have a still the strongest military in the world unfortunately having it and
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.560]  using it are two very different things i still believe we need to finish work in in afghanistan
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:58:01.280]  iraq i'm reading is not as stable i think that's an under reported news area there i think there's
