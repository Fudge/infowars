[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Hold an almond on some highway east of Omaha
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  You can listen to the engine moaning out his one note song
[00:42.000 --> 00:50.000]  You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
[00:50.000 --> 01:00.000]  But your thoughts will soon be wondering the way they always do
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  When you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.000]  Say here I am on the road again
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  Here I am up on the stage
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  Here I am playing the star again
[01:36.000 --> 01:48.000]  Here I am, here I go, turn the page
[01:48.000 --> 01:56.000]  So I walk into a leftist restaurant, strung out from the cold
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  Strung out from the road and you feel the eyes upon you as you're shaking off the cold
[02:04.000 --> 02:16.000]  You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
[02:16.000 --> 02:26.000]  Most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can't know the same old cliches
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  Is that a woman or a man, and you always see my number
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  You don't dare make a stand
[02:36.000 --> 02:46.000]  You dare make a stand my friends, we are America's last stand, we are humanity's last stand
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  And if people get excited, and if folks realize what we're facing, we don't have a chance of victory
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  We have a guarantee of victory
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Alright ladies and gentlemen
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  It's something really big at the start of the next segment
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  We're not going to be covering all the things we're supposed to cover in the corporate media
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  We'll get to some of that and give us some time
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  But I'm going to hit something really front and center for everybody
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  About the globalist agenda to poison and slowly kill you and your family
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Coming up at the next segment in just a few minutes
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  And then we've got Judge Andrew DePaulitano on the police state
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  The IRS gearing up for war with the American people, the Mar-Lago raid
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  The January 6 police state and so much more in the third hour today
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  We have a special guest, one of the top independent talk show hosts in Australia
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  Australia is the beta test for the rest of the world, we'll be talking to this great lady
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Coming up in the second hour
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us as well
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  There's one hell of a broadcast we've got lined up for you today
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  And there's no place I'd rather be than with you
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  Front and center, swinging for the fences against the new world order
[04:08.000 --> 04:14.000]  Look at that volcano erupting, that's liberty right underneath the surface ladies and gentlemen
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  That is ready to explode with enlightenment
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  Empowerment and success
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  We are the future, we are the tip of the spear
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Humanity will not be daunted, it will not be controlled
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  It will not be suppressed
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  Thursday, August 18th worldwide broadcast
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  We're gonna come back and kick it all off and Greg Reese
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  Greg works here every day, he's not in the office, he moved to another state
[04:50.000 --> 04:56.000]  Greg Reese, my good buddy is in the house, he'll be joining us live in studio tomorrow
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  But this is the Thursday broadcast, he'll be on Friday
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  The Cavalry for your immune system
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.000]  The Cavalry for your health
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  And the Cavalry to keep Info Wars on the air with funding

[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  For 50% off
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  Supporting Info Wars defeats the globalist
[05:57.000 --> 06:14.000]  This product is amazing things for your body, take action now
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  We are riding the lightning here my friends
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  Point blank, toe to toe war with the new world order
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  And Satan himself
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.000]  And we will win because we have the eternal spirit of the universe
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  And all of creation on our side, let that sink in
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  And just bang that gong, get it as hard as you can
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.000]  Boom, boom, boom, bam
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  Feel the strength of your ancestor
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  Feel the will of victory over the satanic force
[07:24.000 --> 07:30.000]  Feel the life force rising like lightning in the sky
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  Unstoppable and beautiful
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Fiery the angels fell
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  Deep thunder rolled around their shores
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  Burning with the fires of war
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  For whom the bell tolls, time marches on
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  Alright, let's get right into it
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  We have a lot of massive news and information to cover
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  And I made a lot of people mad yesterday
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  I got a lot of phone calls by big politicos last night and this morning
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  Saying what did you do while Trump is under attack
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  And Trump has the globalist rating him
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  And Trump is riding high and his poll numbers are way up
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  And he's getting all these Republicans elected
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  What are you doing coming on and saying you're done with Trump
[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  If he doesn't come out against these poison shots
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  Because I don't want to be part of a winning political party
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  That allows biomedical mass murder and attacks on the people
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  I don't sit up here and think about what will make us more popular
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  What will make us win, what will temporarily make us more successful
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  I think about how they're targeting six month old and up babies
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  With these shots and the massive amounts of data coming out
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  Of them having heart attacks and blood clots and dying
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And those are the lucky ones, the other ones are being debilitated
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  And scarred and handicapped for life
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  I care about that
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  And so I know we have a giant grassroots audience
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  And I want Trump to come out and say he was lied to
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  Like DeSantis said and like Bolsonaro said
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  And say these shots don't help you
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I was lied to and decouple himself from this
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  So I can support him
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  I don't passively ride waves of what's the new thing
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  And I'm jumping on board of that
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  And oh Trump's really popular again
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  So now I'm going to couple myself to that
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  I want Trump to come out and say Fauci
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  And the rest of them Redfield and Bricks
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  All of them lied to him
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Bricks
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  That's what I want
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  I know Trump's a good person
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  I know the globalist hate Trump
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  I know Trump did incredible things
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  I know they can't stand him
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  I've been persecuted for supporting him
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  I know they definitely don't like him
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  But he does 95% good
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  And then it'd be like if your mom
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  On Sunday evening dinner
[10:26.000 --> 10:30.000]  Made chicken fried steak
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  A lot of Sundays my mom
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.000]  My grandma did it too
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  Would make chicken fried steaks
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  Fried home cooking battered up delicious
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  Five, six sides incredible dinners
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  And again both my grandmothers did it
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  That's a Sunday tradition in the south
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Or in Texas to have fried chicken
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  Or fried steak on Sunday evening
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  And one of my grandmother
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  Or my mother after there were sweet potatoes
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  And collard greens
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  And a big salad and corn on the cob
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  And deviled eggs and green beans
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And chicken fried steaks
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  They spent two hours cooking
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  One of my mother got up on the table
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  And pulled her pants down
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  And took a big dump right on the chicken fried steak
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  My mom never did that
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  I'm using the gross analogies
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  That's what it is
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  I mean we got the big spread
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  So much of what Trump's doing is great
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  But if you get up
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  And you take a dump in the middle of the table
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  At 6 p.m. on Sunday night
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  Nobody's going to eat that food now
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  But you know it's worse than somebody
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  Getting up on the table and throwing a dead possum on it
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  Or vomiting on the table or something gross
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  How about the blood of children
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  How about you cut a little kid's throat
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  And get like a two year old
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  And a six month old and slit its throat
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  Get a dagger, slit its throat
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  And then spray blood all over the food
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  How about that?
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  Because that's what it's like
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Trump's supporting these poison shots
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  I want to eat the chicken fried steak
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  I want America back
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  I want prosperity
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  I want to control our borders
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  I want to secure the military
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  I want to secure the currency
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  I want longer
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  I want all of it
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  I want to eat it
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  I want to be successful
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  But if Trump goes along with Bill Gates and Fauci
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  And helps them slit a child's throat
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  And hold its neck open
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  While the carotid arteries and jugglers
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  Spray blood all over the mashed potatoes
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  I ain't eatin' it and I'm not part of it
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  And I'm doubling down
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  I'm not like everybody else that sells out
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  I'm not like everybody else that does half measures
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  I'm not like everybody else that just wants to be on the winning team
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  Even though that winning team is a runaway locomotive
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Going over the edge of a cliff
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  I want Trump to come out and decouple himself from this
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  It's hurt him worse than anything
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  But it's hurt the children way worse
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  That's what I want
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  So to all the politicos and people that feel beholden to Trump
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  And I get their loyal and I understand it
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  Calling me up saying you better stop what you're doing
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  How about you go light yourself on fire with gasoline
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.000]  And blow your head off
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  How about that?
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Because I ain't sellin' out for nobody
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  It's like the archetypal Tony Montana
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  At the end of Scarface
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  When they want him to blow up a car load of little girls
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  And he says, you think I'm a worm like you?
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  You think I like this?
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  No
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Because you can all point your finger at me
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  Because the media says so
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  And say, there's the bad man
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  You need to point your finger at me
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  And say, somebody's bad
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Oh, there's the bad man
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  No, I'm not the bad man
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  I believe in you
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  I believe in us
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  I believe in humanity
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  No matter what color you are
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  I want us to have a future
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.000]  I love you
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  And I don't want to be enemies with Trump
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  And I am trying to get Trump
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Who they've set up with this damn shot
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  It's all coming out
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  It kills people and doesn't work
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  To get uncoupled from it
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  That's what I want
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  With me, it's all on the sleeve, baby
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  It's all transparent with Alex Jones
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  You know, if I could get Trump to wake up
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  I'd cut my arm off
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  If I could get Trump to the right tank
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  And see such a powerful force
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  I'd do anything
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And that's what I'm doing
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  Is right when he's his most popular
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  And right when the enemy comes after him
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  I'm saying, hey, Trump
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Your biggest threat isn't the yet corrupt FBI
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  Your biggest threat isn't the deep state
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  It's you being signed on to their satanic ritual
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  Of injecting our children with a blood clot
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  Creating garbage
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  So I'm not Trump's enemy
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  I'm Trump's best friend
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  And if the Santas and Bolsonaro can figure out
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  That this is a fraud
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  And they got to apologize for pushing it
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  And say the shot doesn't work
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  Then I simply need Trump
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  Who is so persecuted and so under attack
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  And who is so good in so many ways
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  To wake up to what he is in the middle of
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  And just say no
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  Because if I'm weighing Trump
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  And all the good he can do
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Getting Republicans elected
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  And all the good he can do
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  I get it
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  But the children and the poison shot outweighs that
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  So I'm Trump's best friend, not Trump's enemy
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  The media takes 10 second clips out of context
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  Like I'm just attacking Trump
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  And done with him for no reason
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  No, I want him to decouple himself
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  From this fraud and this line out
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  That's all I'm saying
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And I don't know what we're going to do
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  If it's Trump versus Michael Obama
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Or whatever
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Obama's husband
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  I don't know what we're going to do
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  I mean, I'm not going to support Michael Obama
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  The cavalry for your immune system
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  The cavalry for your health

[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  To destroy the family
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  To destroy heterosexual relationships
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.000]  To annihilate our marriages
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  And the studies are all clear
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  The number one cause of marital splits
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  Is that there's problems in the bedroom
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  And the number one issue men have
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  Is erectile dysfunction
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  The left makes big jokes about this
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  Because they don't want people having lasting
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.000]  Good, loving relationships
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  They want to break up society

[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  We are the resistance
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Alright, finishing up with Trump
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  This big news story when I said yesterday
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  I'm not try to ride a bandwagon or curry furver
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  Or favor or get a job in DC
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  I'm trying to defend western civilization
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  I'm trying to defend us against biomedical tyranny
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.840]  new lockdowns, forced injections, and the great reset.
[20:53.840 --> 20:59.760]  And so I attacked Trump yesterday because kissing his ass doesn't get his attention.
[20:59.760 --> 21:02.680]  He's already stopped promoting the poison shot.
[21:02.680 --> 21:07.660]  Oh, I'm not supposed to talk about the V word, but I still am proud of it.
[21:07.660 --> 21:14.680]  Now he needs to come out against it because I cannot back Trump, who I would back over
[21:14.680 --> 21:20.120]  to Sanis for president if he doesn't do it.
[21:20.120 --> 21:23.320]  We're not here to go along with the crowd.
[21:23.320 --> 21:25.880]  We're here to change the course.
[21:25.880 --> 21:27.520]  We're not here to do what's easy.
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.400]  We're here to do what's hard.
[21:29.400 --> 21:35.800]  I run this operation against the globalist because I have been commissioned by you to
[21:35.800 --> 21:41.240]  stand up for your freedom and your future because I am a self-serving person.
[21:41.240 --> 21:45.400]  And if you don't have a future, I don't have a future.
[21:45.400 --> 21:50.560]  Now, let me hit some massive news here.
[21:50.560 --> 21:56.080]  Let me hit something so huge.
[21:56.080 --> 22:03.280]  And I'm so frustrated in myself because I knew this years ago.
[22:03.280 --> 22:10.000]  And when I've talked about this subject, I have just pointed out that it's authoritarian
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.680]  and designed to bankrupt farms and ranches and is about the cult making you do outrageous
[22:14.680 --> 22:15.680]  things.
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.680]  You'll own nothing.
[22:16.680 --> 22:17.680]  You'll have nothing.
[22:17.680 --> 22:18.680]  You'll like it.
[22:18.680 --> 22:21.800]  And that's, you will eat the bugs.
[22:21.800 --> 22:27.280]  But I saw a video yesterday and I did research for about two hours last night in the main
[22:27.280 --> 22:35.680]  line studies and the main line science that the exoskeletons of bugs, remember we have
[22:35.680 --> 22:40.960]  endoskeletons inside were mammals.
[22:40.960 --> 22:52.360]  Exoskeletons are a very hard molecular structure that is a glutanoid and it's on average, depending
[22:52.360 --> 23:04.480]  on the insect, a thousand times more potent than the most processed gluten.
[23:04.480 --> 23:11.480]  So if you think you get sick once you become gluten intolerant because of the wheat being
[23:11.480 --> 23:24.600]  bred cannot be natural, this is a thousand times at least more toxic than the most processed
[23:24.600 --> 23:28.440]  gluten there is.
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.680]  So the least of our problem is they're trying to phase out beef.
[23:32.680 --> 23:35.960]  It's what they're trying to make us eat in its stead.
[23:35.960 --> 23:41.720]  Everybody knows that soy lowers testosterone and causes a lot of physical problems, especially
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.640]  soy that leaves the core of the soybean in it.
[23:45.640 --> 23:57.000]  But chitin is what the exoskeletons of bugs, whether it's a cockroach or whether it is
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.240]  a June bug or whether it is a grasshopper, it's the hard exoskeleton of bugs and it
[24:04.240 --> 24:08.000]  is super toxic to humans.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  Humans are designed by God, we have instincts, we think a strawberry looks delicious, a papaya
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.520]  looks delicious, a banana looks delicious, a steak, a roasted piece of chicken, it looks
[24:20.520 --> 24:29.360]  delicious, it smells good, we're revolted by bugs because we're not supposed to eat bugs
[24:29.360 --> 24:34.840]  unless you're starving to death because it gives you cancer and autoimmune disease and
[24:34.840 --> 24:41.480]  I have the studies, a stack of them right here.
[24:41.480 --> 24:49.880]  And so now in supermarkets around the world cricket and grasshopper protein, it's not
[24:49.880 --> 25:01.920]  protein, it's weaponized gluten, chitin and its effects on inflammatory and immune responses.
[25:01.920 --> 25:08.200]  Of course, eating bugs with hard shells.
[25:08.200 --> 25:13.400]  I read this 25 years ago in big studies that they use in red dye, most was produced in
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.320]  India, the exoskeleton of beetles and that's how they make a lot of the red dye that they
[25:19.320 --> 25:27.400]  call biological but it causes all sorts of ADD, ADHD in children, all sorts of health
[25:27.400 --> 25:28.400]  problems.
[25:28.400 --> 25:31.920]  That's just the coloring out of beetles.
[25:31.920 --> 25:38.600]  Imagine ingesting this as your main protein diet, it's a death sentence, just like the
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.520]  COVID shot attacks your immune system, it's the same thing.
[25:43.520 --> 25:53.760]  So regular or meat based, how Burger King is making vegan whoppers the norm.
[25:53.760 --> 26:04.240]  Regular is the quote non-cow based, most of it insect and soy.
[26:04.240 --> 26:07.800]  If you're a man wanting to grow breasts, this is a way to do it.
[26:07.800 --> 26:12.440]  And they're just slipping it in because soon the beef won't be available but what will
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.960]  be available, chitin.
[26:15.960 --> 26:22.040]  Here's a molecular structure of it, from Wikipedia you can read about it, for yourself, the etymology,
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.920]  the chemistry, the physical properties, a biological function.
[26:25.920 --> 26:44.120]  It is a super concentrated form of gluten used in industrial processes.
[26:44.120 --> 26:49.600]  It's used in producing plastics, you name it, and they're going to make you eat it and
[26:49.600 --> 26:57.600]  put it in the school lunch program, what an incredible attack.
[26:57.600 --> 27:11.040]  Researcher Max Egan does a brief breakdown of it, here he is.
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.240]  Let's just start it over, let's just stop, let's just stop, it's okay.
[27:15.240 --> 27:16.240]  I love you guys so much.
[27:16.240 --> 27:22.760]  I told you we're going to play that club, it's okay, it's okay.
[27:22.760 --> 27:36.080]  We're going to go to break, come back, we're going to play it, we have some time, fade
[27:36.080 --> 27:42.720]  up the audio and get it all ready, we're going to talk about it, but this is what we're
[27:42.720 --> 27:49.080]  being hit with, this is what we're being attacked with, this is what they're doing
[27:49.080 --> 27:56.480]  to us and I just can't believe we're going to let this happen to our children and ourselves
[27:56.480 --> 28:02.560]  and we're just going to sit here and take this with something that is a weaponized gluten.
[28:02.560 --> 28:18.000]  But that's where we are and I'm just, you know, people just, people just don't take
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.520]  this serious, you know, you're under attack by these people, they think it's funny what
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.840]  they're doing to you.
[28:24.840 --> 28:30.920]  Thursday live, top scientists warned toxic proteins found in bugs, 1,000 times more toxic
[28:30.920 --> 28:33.800]  than processed gluten trigger autoimmune disease.
[28:33.800 --> 28:41.120]  This is a big, big, big, big, big, big deal.
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.800]  This is another example of how they're attacking us and what they're doing and it's in supermarkets
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.200]  and in food and in processed foods everywhere now, just like they authorized two years ago,
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.320]  the FDA said we have no jurisdiction over nanotech, we're going to put this in your
[28:55.320 --> 28:57.320]  food.
[28:57.320 --> 29:03.600]  The cavalry for your immune system.
[29:03.600 --> 29:09.480]  The cavalry for your health and the cavalry to keep Info Wars on the air with funding
[29:09.480 --> 29:17.760]  has now arrived a 360 win, almost sold out for a year, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and
[29:17.760 --> 29:25.520]  the CoQ10 and all the patented documented super ingredients to completely turbo charge
[29:25.520 --> 29:31.400]  your immune system and your body is finally back in stock and despite the fact it's going

[32:29.400 --> 32:35.360]  The great reset in the War for the World is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[32:35.360 --> 32:40.080]  We are now number 9 in the world.
[32:40.080 --> 32:45.240]  This is major, this is political, this could fund our war chest, just go to Amazon.com
[32:45.240 --> 32:47.720]  everybody and buy 10 copies.
[32:47.720 --> 32:52.200]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order because you read this,
[32:52.200 --> 32:55.000]  you know their whole plan how to stop them, get the great reset in the War for the World
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.640]  now, it's going to go to number 1, what do you make of that?
[33:00.640 --> 33:07.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:07.640 --> 33:26.840]  You will eat the bugs and you will love it, you will drink the sewage, you will have no
[33:26.840 --> 33:31.440]  beef, you will transgender your children, we will pump chemicals into you, we are the
[33:31.440 --> 33:38.360]  New World Order, you will die and now Chiton, the super powerful gluten that is the exoskeleton
[33:38.360 --> 33:43.400]  of bugs is being turned into powder and put into thousands of foods in a giant revolution
[33:43.400 --> 33:50.880]  against us using a bio weapon against our families, against our species, Max Egan reports.
[33:50.880 --> 33:59.000]  It's been shown contain a substance called Chiton, there's a meme going around, you sort
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.080]  of see this stuff and think this fear mongering is this true but I've looked into it and it's
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.600]  actually true folks, there's a lot of evidence that insects contain Chitons, Chitons are
[34:08.600 --> 34:15.600]  very very bad for humans, Chitons cause all sorts of problems, asthma, respiratory problems
[34:15.600 --> 34:22.000]  and all the things we're seeing from the jab, it also causes this thing called Glyoblastoma
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.920]  which is a spinal cancer, comes from Chitons and Chitons cannot be cooked out of insects
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.320]  which is no processing that will take these substances out of the insects, when you eat
[34:33.320 --> 34:40.760]  the insects you are eating Chitons, Chitons cannot be processed by the human body, we
[34:40.760 --> 34:47.360]  don't eat insects folks, birds, chickens, lizards, reptiles, these things eat insects,
[34:47.360 --> 34:53.000]  fish eat insects, we don't eat insects, we don't have the digestive system to be able
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.400]  to process certain things that are found in insects such as Chitons, like I said they
[34:58.400 --> 35:03.840]  can't be processed out, they cannot be cooked out, they are always there, so if you're eating
[35:03.840 --> 35:10.640]  little insect snacks or eating insecten burgers, you're eating Chitons folks and you're going
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.240]  to make yourself very sick.
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.320]  Which is the enemy's plan, hiring all the Hollywood scum, tell us how great it is to
[35:21.320 --> 35:28.240]  eat the Chiton, everything they do is to poison us and to kill us and it's funny to them,
[35:28.240 --> 35:32.920]  they say you can't have a car, they fly on private jets, they say you can't have children,
[35:32.920 --> 35:42.640]  they have six children, they're in a bunch of pigs that think you're stupid, so they've
[35:42.640 --> 35:46.960]  got everybody against the gluten which is so processed it's causing problems, this
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.720]  is a thousand times worse but they think you're stupid and they can control the press and
[35:51.720 --> 35:56.800]  make you eat the bugs, so when they make you take the shot you get so sick and then they
[35:56.800 --> 36:08.640]  just cover it up, here's Wikipedia on the Chitons and how it is a super cellulose gluten,
[36:08.640 --> 36:16.080]  you need to go research it for yourself and understand what you're up against, these people
[36:16.080 --> 36:23.240]  are sick and they know what they're doing, here's a health and human services report
[36:23.240 --> 36:28.640]  Chiton and its effects on inflammatory and immune response and what it does to the body
[36:28.640 --> 36:39.360]  destroying your immune system, it is poison and the enemies of humanity know exactly what
[36:39.360 --> 36:45.280]  they're doing and let's now move on to the COVID they produced in a lab, the super virus
[36:45.280 --> 36:54.040]  chimera they released and the aftermath of that now and the new phases of fear mongering
[36:54.040 --> 37:04.160]  now being rolled out, sex between men not skin contact is fueling monkeypox research
[37:04.160 --> 37:12.600]  suggests, 99.9% of the monkeypox cases in Europe and the US are homosexual men having
[37:12.600 --> 37:18.400]  dozens of sex partners and then you have the dog being raped which they confirm in local
[37:18.400 --> 37:25.480]  news was raped amily and got monkeypox, that's what we're dealing with here, sex between
[37:25.480 --> 37:31.480]  men not skin contact NBC News is fueling monkeypox, new research suggests but they want new lockdowns
[37:31.480 --> 37:38.160]  for you while they do this, first dog infected with monkeypox after sharing bed with gay couple
[37:38.160 --> 37:44.600]  was raped, but that's okay, it's liberal, look at this liberal stuff, man's nose rocks
[37:44.600 --> 37:53.440]  due to monkeypox, Harris County toddler test presumptive positive for monkeypox, Houston
[37:53.440 --> 38:05.880]  Chronicle and what is the establishment's answer, Abbas all locked down except the people
[38:05.880 --> 38:12.200]  having orgies, meanwhile the White House to phase out buying COVID-19 vaccine treatments
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.840]  because no one's buying it yahoo finance, now you got to buy it for yourself, they're
[38:15.840 --> 38:23.160]  going to make you pay for it to have your job or to live, double vax I'm going to play
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.800]  this news clip here in a moment, I'm going to play this news clip here in a moment, double
[38:26.800 --> 38:35.600]  vax New Zealanders seven times sicker this year than previous 2019, way sicker than 2020
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.160]  the latest numbers they have is 2021 and it's the vaccinated way sicker which is what all
[38:42.160 --> 38:48.160]  of the real studies show, meanwhile most people infected with Omnicron weren't even aware
[38:48.160 --> 38:54.760]  they had it, that's why I say Trump must come clean against the deadly COVID vax before
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.000]  it's too late, it's the biggest thing weighing him down, he didn't do it, I'll give him a
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.720]  pass, he's not a scientist but now he knows, he has to do something, here's the New Zealand
[39:06.720 --> 39:21.520]  TV report with being seven times more likely when you've had the shot, I'm thing Sam and
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.960]  well COVID numbers are officially down right and yet every day it seems like our workmates
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.920]  are off with some kind of bug, so is there more sickness in the air right now and if
[39:30.920 --> 39:37.600]  so what the heck can we do about it, are you sick of being sick, you're not imagining it,
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.360]  more Kiwis are coughing sniffling and calling off work, our immunity against a whole lot
[39:42.360 --> 39:49.000]  of things is sort of a little bit down because we haven't been constantly I feel like primed
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.960]  all the time, of course we've got lots and lots of different viruses coming over and
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.640]  that's not just the coronavirus, of course lots of things are, seasonal flu, gastrobugs,
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.400]  conjunctivitis, even the foot and mouth, it's all making everyone's lives just that
[40:02.400 --> 40:08.480]  much harder and that's despite COVID numbers finally going down, community cases are at
[40:08.480 --> 40:15.320]  their lowest since February, but data reported in stuff.co.nz suggests compared to last year
[40:15.320 --> 40:20.960]  respiratory illnesses have doubled, the well Kiwis survey found double the number of us
[40:20.960 --> 40:27.320]  are experiencing cough, fever, illness, runny nose and sore throat and when looking at pre-pandemic
[40:27.320 --> 40:33.320]  levels we're actually seven times sicker. So what's going on? If we haven't learned
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.200]  anything from this pandemic it would be a bit disappointing and one of those things is
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.800]  that when you've got a cold or something like that, don't take it to work, we know what
[40:41.800 --> 40:47.160]  stops viruses from spreading and so masking up and keeping a distance isn't just about
[40:47.160 --> 40:53.680]  COVID, it's about all sorts of respiratory viruses and it's not just the experts who've
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.960]  noticed. Yeah there has been a few more days off for sure. Our daughter's gone to kindergarten
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.280]  this year so it's a bit unusual that it's hard to say but she's, yeah we've been sicker
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.880]  as a family. I know a lot of my friends have been sick. It's the worst flu I've maybe ever
[41:06.880 --> 41:12.080]  had in my life, yeah so definitely worse. I don't think it's my immune system because
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.640]  I've been trying to be healthier than usual. So what can you do to avoid all the nasties
[41:16.640 --> 41:22.760]  without having to live in your own personal lockdown?
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.640]  So they took the shots and now they're seven times sicker and they can't see right in front
[41:27.640 --> 41:35.480]  of their faces what's been done to them. That's mass Stockholm syndrome. That's the new world
[41:35.480 --> 41:46.520]  order. That's their plan. Poisonous bugs, 5G radiation and they just think we're just
[41:46.520 --> 41:53.920]  going to go into this incremental tyranny, this environmental hill grid and not recognize
[41:53.920 --> 41:58.520]  what's happening. That's why they want us off air. And that's why it's so critical to
[41:58.520 --> 42:04.800]  share the links to this live show from infowars.com. It's why it's so critical. Once a day shows
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.240]  archives, take clips of it to share it, do whatever you want, just get it out because
[42:09.240 --> 42:17.360]  people need to know, hey the bugs are a thousand times more glutinous than the most toxic genetically
[42:17.360 --> 42:24.960]  engineered wheat and you need to be made aware of that. But no one's going to raise the alarm
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.840]  unless it's you. There's nobody coming to save us but ourselves with God working through
[42:30.840 --> 42:31.840]  us.
[42:31.840 --> 42:36.760]  All right, we're going to shift gears and look at the elections that just happened and
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.800]  Trump and the economy and so much more and the IRS arming these agents, we have training
[42:41.800 --> 42:48.120]  videos and so much more coming up. Then we've got a special guest from Australia fighting
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.640]  with tyranny at point blank range in the second hour and then Judge Andrew Napolitano coming
[42:53.640 --> 42:59.640]  up as well in the third hour.
[42:59.640 --> 43:08.200]  The Cavalry for your immune system, the Cavalry for your health and the Cavalry to keep infowars
[43:08.200 --> 43:15.760]  on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win. Almost sold out for a year, DNA Force

[46:57.400 --> 47:26.000]  new folks to take advantage of it. You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[47:26.000 --> 47:45.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance Celia Farber points out
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.600]  how the mass media tradition of obsessing over the deaths of celebrities has been absent
[47:51.600 --> 47:59.000]  since 2021 as a clear tactic to deflect mass death by COVID shots. And the death of Ann
[47:59.000 --> 48:06.560]  Hayes marks a return to this mainstream media tradition. And the whole story is very strange.
[48:06.560 --> 48:12.400]  Just before the crash, Hayes visited the glass hair design salon in Venice and purchased
[48:12.400 --> 48:17.600]  a red wig where she posed for a picture with the salons owner who did not notice her to
[48:17.600 --> 48:24.160]  be impaired in any way. Minutes later, Hayes crashed into an apartment complex where residents
[48:24.160 --> 48:30.000]  tried helping her out of the vehicle before the car was put in reverse and sped off.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.440]  Videos then show her car recklessly speeding down a residential street and nearly hitting
[48:35.440 --> 48:41.400]  a pedestrian. She then hits a car before finally crashing the Mini Cooper into a house where
[48:41.400 --> 48:47.800]  it bursts into flames. But this is where the story gets really strange. While being carried
[48:47.800 --> 48:53.640]  to the ambulance, we see that her legs are secured and she is covered in what looks like
[48:53.640 --> 48:59.760]  a cloth body bag. We are told that she couldn't breathe and yet they covered her face. And
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.320]  the reason these details were noticed is because we see her become fully conscious while frantically
[49:05.320 --> 49:11.680]  trying to escape the body bag and leg straps. Nothing was reported about this. And Hayes'
[49:11.680 --> 49:16.560]  former boyfriend said that Anne was stable and expected to pull through. But then we
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.080]  are told she is in a coma. And then we are told that while her heart is still beating,
[49:22.080 --> 49:27.520]  she's legally dead, according to California law. But she will be kept on life support
[49:27.520 --> 49:33.440]  for possible organ donation. And then, right in the middle of the ancient three-day festival
[49:33.440 --> 49:39.960]  to honor the goddess Diana, known as Nemeralia, they pulled a plug on Anne Hayes and let
[49:39.960 --> 49:47.680]  her die. This is quite similar to what happened in Paris 25 years ago on the satanic inverted
[49:47.680 --> 49:54.400]  Nemeralia, August 31st, when Princess Diana was looked after as she bled to death in a
[49:54.400 --> 50:00.800]  tunnel dedicated to the goddess Diana. Many believe that Princess Diana was about to expose
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.760]  the royal family. And Anne Hayes, who recently starred in a movie exposing chemtrails, was
[50:06.760 --> 50:13.440]  currently promoting her most recent film that was exposing the horrors of child sex trafficking.
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.360]  Child sex trafficking, along with all human trafficking, is the biggest business in the
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.400]  world. The slavery business is at an all-time high, and the thugs who run it are known
[50:24.400 --> 50:30.400]  for their satanic rituals. Ritual murders have always been, at a base level, a form
[50:30.400 --> 50:36.080]  of crowd control. The Anne Hayes story has caused many to look back into the mysterious
[50:36.080 --> 50:42.520]  death of Michael Hastings. Journalist Michael Hastings had just published a story for Rolling
[50:42.520 --> 50:49.000]  Stone that resulted in the resignation of commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and
[50:49.000 --> 50:55.160]  was working on a story of CIA director John Brennan. The day before he died, Hastings
[50:55.160 --> 51:01.320]  emailed friends to warn them that the feds were interviewing his close friends and associates
[51:01.320 --> 51:07.160]  and told them he was on to a big story and needed to go off the radar for a bit. Early
[51:07.160 --> 51:13.000]  the next morning, Hastings' silver Mercedes hit a palm tree and exploded, somehow launching
[51:13.000 --> 51:20.120]  the engine block 60 yards away from the car. Former counterterrorism czar Richard Clark
[51:20.120 --> 51:27.080]  told the Huffington Post that Hastings' crash was consistent with a car-cyber attack, and
[51:27.080 --> 51:33.120]  that intelligence agencies for major powers are able to remotely seize control of a person's
[51:33.120 --> 51:38.720]  vehicle. He added that if there was a cyber attack on Hastings' car, whoever did it would
[51:38.720 --> 51:47.720]  probably get away with it. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[51:47.720 --> 51:53.360]  Very important report. God of State and the Rituals of the Death of Man, Hastings. InfoWars.com
[51:53.360 --> 52:00.600]  band up. Here's what I'm going to do. I still need to hit the IRS army they're building,
[52:00.600 --> 52:03.720]  the domestic security force that's just as big and just as strong as our military that
[52:03.720 --> 52:11.360]  Obama promised. I need to hit some of the environmental power grab news, some of the
[52:11.360 --> 52:17.440]  election news, the economy news, and more. We have a special guest joining us from Australia,
[52:17.440 --> 52:21.000]  which is the Canary in the coal mine, the rest of us out of the Great Reset. That's
[52:21.000 --> 52:30.120]  coming up. And then Judge Andrew Napolitano in the third hour today on the police state,
[52:30.120 --> 52:36.040]  the Milago raid, and more. But let's hit this story from grid.news. The world is obsessed
[52:36.040 --> 52:43.360]  with air conditioning. How can we stop it from killing the planet? Again, oh, cooling
[52:43.360 --> 52:49.480]  your house is bad. There's no evidence of that. It's all a lie. They want control with
[52:49.480 --> 52:53.600]  smart meters in Germany announced two days ago. Oh, there happens to be smart meters
[52:53.600 --> 52:57.440]  almost all the houses. We're going to cut your carbon output. There's not enough electricity
[52:57.440 --> 53:05.520]  now. So we're going to control your thermostat for you. It's not coming. Ladies and gentlemen,
[53:05.520 --> 53:11.000]  it's here. We're going to play some of these shocking videos that are on infowars.com.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.040]  All these videos are 20 minutes long. Got a few couple minute clips, 87,000 poorly trained
[53:16.040 --> 53:22.240]  IRS agents coming to a neighborhood near you. Literally, they look like people trying
[53:22.240 --> 53:30.280]  to be mean that could not find their rear end with both hands or shirts hanging out,
[53:30.280 --> 53:41.960]  lobs, training and SWAT team raids on your house. Wait till you see this. I mean, this
[53:41.960 --> 53:49.400]  is the army of idiots that this is preparing for its civil war, which is designed to fail.
[53:49.400 --> 53:52.360]  It's designed to destroy the country. They're not going to win this war. They're the little
[53:52.360 --> 53:56.760]  leftist idiots. They'll be a fascist dictatorship after this is all done. But this is the clown
[53:56.760 --> 54:01.760]  world. It's all coming up next hour. But let me throw this out. We're going to steadfastly
[54:01.760 --> 54:06.240]  stay on air and not stop fighting. We're going to continue to bring you great products that
[54:06.240 --> 54:11.200]  enrich your life so that it's a symbiotic relationship. You want to order them again.
[54:11.200 --> 54:16.280]  And we've got several best sellers. Vitamin mineral fusion sells more per unit than anything
[54:16.280 --> 54:22.040]  else. But when it comes to the flagship product, it's DNA Force Plus with the PQQ, the CoQ10
[54:22.040 --> 54:26.480]  and a bunch of other patent ingredients known to clean out your cells, boost your immune
[54:26.480 --> 54:33.720]  system like nothing else. These are incredible ingredients. Please go to infowarstore.com
[54:33.720 --> 54:38.520]  and read about DNA Force Plus. Read about the ingredients that are in it. Take it with
[54:38.520 --> 54:42.880]  body's ultimate tumor formula. Take it with X2. Take it with Ultra 12 and experience what
[54:42.880 --> 54:48.080]  it does for your life. Don't forget to get it. Don't forget to take it. Make that commitment
[54:48.080 --> 54:57.720]  and it will change your life. It's changed mine. DNA Force Plus is 50% off at infowarstore.com
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.240]  for a limited time. And we're running out of vitamin mineral fusion and body's ultimate
[55:01.240 --> 55:09.120]  tumor formula and X2. But despite that, they're all still discounted as well at infowarstore.com.
[55:09.120 --> 55:16.880]  Now, quite frankly, we could probably fund this place the next few months with sign books.
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.320]  But there's a paradox. I don't know how I'm supposed to sign 10,000-20,000 books. I'm
[55:20.320 --> 55:25.800]  going to do it. I'll be in here during the breaks. The 18-wheeler with 20,000 books arrives
[55:25.800 --> 55:31.400]  tomorrow morning. I'm going to be here trying to sign 1,000 books a day in the next week
[55:31.400 --> 55:37.480]  before they start shipping out on the ship date next week. And it's a great fundraiser.
[55:37.480 --> 55:41.840]  I want to thank you all for getting signed copies of the great reset at infowarstore.com.
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.040]  But I'm going to have to end this the next few days because we're already up to 9,000
[55:46.040 --> 55:51.440]  books, signed books. And it's great. It's a fundraiser. Thank you for going to infowarstore.com.
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.080]  Thanks for getting the signed book. It's a piece of history. It's the Death Star Plans,
[55:55.080 --> 55:59.880]  the great reset in the war for the world by myself and my research by yours truly. But
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.280]  you need to get the book. And if you want to sign copy, this is your last chance at
[56:05.280 --> 56:13.560]  infowarstore.com. Look, we could probably sell 50,000 signed books, but I can't do it. So
[56:13.560 --> 56:20.320]  it's a real catch 22. I will sign these books. We'll get them. Again, the truck arrives tomorrow
[56:20.320 --> 56:25.560]  morning. I'm going to try to sign 1,000 tomorrow. But that's going to take a couple hours. But
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.480]  people just handing them to me and I'm signing them. So thank you. You're amazing. The left
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.640]  can't stand the book success has been as high as number four on the number one book charts
[56:33.640 --> 56:40.640]  in the world on Amazon. Get an unsigned copy infowarstore.com. Get a signed copy infowarstore.com.

[56:50.000 --> 56:55.560]  So whether it's DNA force plus 50% off or whether it's bodies, ultimate tumor formula

[57:09.800 --> 57:15.440]  So thank you so much for your support. Oh, by the way, it's going to sell out quick.
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.920]  You haven't had a run of this in a long time. Super blue, the original high quality toothpaste

[58:40.280 --> 58:46.200]  gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship. Supporting info wars defeats the globalist
[58:46.200 --> 58:51.280]  and this product is amazing things for your body. Take action now. Alex Jones expanded
[58:51.280 --> 58:57.160]  his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic world of
[58:57.160 --> 59:04.000]  a corrupt system, which has allowed info wars to remain a free public broadcast to combat
[59:04.000 --> 59:12.800]  the dangerous lies of the mainstream media. Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative
[59:12.800 --> 59:21.120]  facts. Do you understand what I have said? Yes, I believe I said was true. Yes, you believe
[59:21.120 --> 59:26.120]  everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something true. That
[59:26.120 --> 59:32.280]  is what we're doing here. There's going to be a large set of planets who are going to
[59:32.280 --> 59:37.120]  be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy of state. The info wars audience
[59:37.120 --> 59:43.120]  has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism. And with your continued
[59:43.120 --> 59:53.800]  support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the info war. If you are receiving
[59:53.800 --> 1:00:20.800]  this transmission, you are the resistance info wars tomorrow's news today. If I could
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:28.440]  have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking
[1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:34.000]  up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in. I would have done it. When
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:39.480]  they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile. You've heard people say,
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:49.800]  you'll have my guns for my cold day. Okay. We have introduced an assault weapons ban.
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:56.080]  I'm talking about a ban on assault rifles. If you listen real close, you can hear the
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:01:01.160]  people in power shaking. It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.840]  only do it every Monday. We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:11.480]  people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way. Enough. Enough. Enough. We
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:20.280]  say no more. I'm the guy that originally wrote the assault weapons ban that became law. A
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:22.960]  gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line. He says, I have an AR-15 and I will
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:27.480]  turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids. Hell, yes. We're going to take
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:33.480]  your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:39.040]  anymore. Do you think Trump is responsible for what happened? I said, well, look, I mean,
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.000]  obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:53.560]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this. I'm tired of hearing
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:59.040]  people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say faith
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:03.640]  without works is dead. So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now
[1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:08.960]  is we've let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have both
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:13.920]  actions and a bold agenda. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:18.120]  weapons off the street, period, and we have to get buybacks and get them out of their
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:25.400]  basements. Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine
[1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:29.480]  limitations, which by the way would have made a huge difference. We can ban the weapons
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:34.080]  of war. It's about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:38.480]  of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:42.160]  belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. But I also believe that a lot
[1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:46.360]  of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:53.160]  of criminals. By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period. They cannot be
[1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:56.920]  sold anymore. Well, like if you're going to take people's guns away, wait till you get
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:02.080]  elected, then take the guns away. Don't tell them ahead of time. Which by the way, that's
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:12.280]  what people like me think. It's a young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of his
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:19.520]  government, are actually young nobilities of the world. So if we penetrate the cabinet,
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:28.080]  the change is not just happening. The change can be shaped by us. We have to prepare for
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:37.080]  a more angry world, how to prepare to take the necessary action to create a fair world.
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:42.920]  I see the need for a great reset. So people assume we are just going back to the good
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:49.880]  old world which we had and everything will be normal again. This is, let's say, a fiction.
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:56.800]  It will not happen. There is only one way this pandemic is going to go. It's going to
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:05.240]  get worse and worse and worse. Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:14.480]  a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation,
[1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:24.080]  hospital services, our society as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:31.080]  respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:07.760]  The cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health, and the cavalry to keep info
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:15.440]  wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win. Almost sold out for a year, DNA

[1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:19.520]  front lines of the info war. And we are back now into our number two special guest from
[1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:24.320]  Australia joining us next segment. But let's look at these headlines first then I'll scan
[1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:31.000]  through them, give you my take on it. Pence, former vice president, calls to defund FBI
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:37.320]  just as wrong as calls to defund the police. Nightmare bombshell, DHS, whistleblower confirms
[1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:42.780]  Biden illegally smuggling up to 40,000 children a month in Texas alone as young as six month
[1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:51.320]  old being given to people with no paperwork, not their parents. Absolutely insane. We have
[1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:56.840]  the footage of the National Guard locking offense and the board patrol coming and unlocking
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:03.120]  the fence. That ties into the lawlessness. If a federal agency is ignoring a totally
[1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:07.480]  collapsed border and massive human smuggling that Senate reports confirm, many children
[1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:11.920]  end up in sex trafficking, but don't worry they're rating my logo. Don't worry they're
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:17.160]  going to PTA meetings and school board meetings are rash you. It's a fraud. These agencies
[1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:25.920]  are captured by the rogue government elements that have taken control of our nation. And
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:33.880]  that's just the facts. They are waging war against the American people. Former vice president
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:39.160]  Mike Pence pushed back against Republican calls dismantle the FBI entirely following
[1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.960]  its unprecedented raid on former president Donald Trump's. All the residents saying such
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.600]  proposals are just as wrong as Democrats ever to defend the police. No, the feds want to
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:53.440]  get rid of local police and defund them so they can bully them into becoming their political
[1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:59.440]  agents. That's why George Soros has bought off over a thousand city district attorneys
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:06.840]  and county attorneys. You got to go watch the Savannah Hernandez interview yesterday where
[1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:10.800]  the board patrol whistleblower and I've already seen it myself. I know he's telling the truth.
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:15.560]  It's about 30 to 40 thousand in Texas alone a month. Little children, many cases handed
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:22.040]  off with no IDs. The people that have no relation to them. That is the essence of Jeffrey Epstein
[1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:30.000]  on steroids. Let's say it again. That is Jeffrey Epstein Island on steroids in your face. No
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:37.040]  doubting it. There it is. No debate. And you sign on to that. Whether you are a school
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:41.480]  teacher or whether you're a doctor, whether you're a lawyer, whether you're an auto mechanic,
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:45.880]  whether you are a person that works in retail or whether you're an FBI agent. We're not
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:51.240]  sealing out the FBI. We're saying, my God, you're supposed to be doing all this. You're
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:56.440]  supposed to be down there, but you've been ordered instead to stand down all the border.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:03.640]  Totally collapses with this humanitarian disaster. Shame on you. So that reports on Bandot video
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:09.000]  needs to go viral exclusive. DHS whistleblower confirms 30 to 40 thousand children smuggle
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.440]  per month in Texas alone. Many of the children as young as six months old are handed off
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:19.280]  with no paperwork to complete strangers. I'm going to say it again. Many of the children
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:26.280]  as young as six months old are handed off with no paperwork to complete strangers. This
[1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:35.640]  is Jeffrey Epstein style trafficking on steroids and we personally have shot the footage. We
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:40.280]  personally have shown them lying and saying, this is my child as the woman comes in all
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:44.120]  day at the airport, more than 20 times with little babies handing them over to people
[1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:51.720]  to disappear with no paperwork. A human soul, a baby, the seed of the universe being stolen
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:59.320]  in front of us. And now we have this. I've got hours of this footage, but here's just
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:07.520]  a two minutes of 87,000 trained IRS agents and a group of them being trained like total
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:24.440]  slobs who randomly raid people's houses and terrorize the public while the border is wide
[1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:26.560]  open. Here's the footage. These are the graduates. They took a few hour course with toy guns
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:33.480]  on how to raid houses. It's all politically correct. Obese people, folks in wheelchairs,
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:43.440]  soldiers, part of the joke, mainly a bunch of women, and they pull their guns out and
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:51.200]  they practice raiding you and your family. This is the government building armies against
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:11:03.440]  you. This is the IRS being trained. They bought billions around the Vamo over the
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:29.760]  years. This is the new auditing system. And they come in and point guns at you. But the
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:36.160]  border is wide open with smuggled children. The fentanyl is pouring in. The dollar is
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.320]  being devalued. They literally go hire a bunch of recent college graduates with accounting
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:12:00.760]  degrees to point guns at you and take you away. They are trying to start a civil war
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:09.520]  with a bunch of low grade morons with plastic blue and red guns to do this. That's how
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:16.480]  you bring America down is take over a bunch of unpopular stuff, unconstitutional stuff,
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:22.880]  go out and harass everybody, hoping it blows up. So the media is everywhere saying I want
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:30.280]  violence, I want a civil war. No, we're winning a political, cultural civil war of ideas.
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:36.040]  I want to continue with that. I don't want violence. But the system has decided to start
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:41.600]  the fight. They've weaponized the district attorneys, the county attorneys, the judges.
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:46.680]  We've experienced Soros judges in Connecticut and Texas that just railroad you and they're
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:52.040]  laughing and they think it's funny because no one has ever protested them. No one has
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:56.960]  ever sued them. No one has ever stood up because they've hijacked the moral authority. They've
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:05.960]  hijacked the offices. They've hijacked those positions of power and now they are this army,
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:11.760]  publicly and openly accelerating war. And Joe Bannister, we should get Joe Bannister
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:18.720]  on the next few days, was an actual train treasury agent who simply said we're raiding
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.760]  innocent people, we're not doing a new process. They indicted him twice. But in San Francisco
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:30.160]  juries twice found him not guilty. So you ask, why don't IRS agents stand up to the
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:35.600]  right thing? Well, they indict you when you do. But they're not hiring people that went
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.440]  through actual law enforcement training and went through the FBI training. They are now
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:50.160]  literally in hotels without live ammo, hiring a bunch of accounting slobs and arming them
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:14:00.080]  and a bunch of SJW women for their big war with the evil right wing in America. This
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:08.840]  is a recipe for disaster. They're coming. They're gonna arrest you. They're gonna take
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:14.400]  your property. They're gonna take your children. They're gonna take your guns. That's their
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:24.080]  plan. Because nobody protested them. Nobody spoke out against them. Nobody sued them.
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:30.160]  They got all these low grade moron idiots that you know can't clean their house, can't
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:36.240]  take care of their family. But now they're coming for you with the weaponized federal
[1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:43.120]  courts and they are licking their lips. Because so many Americans still think they're in a
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:50.000]  free country. So many Americans still think there's checks and balances and there's not.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:55.840]  There's a bunch of paramilitary men like this guy on screen training a bunch of women and
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:03.640]  basically children for war. And they have no idea what they're marching out into. You'd
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:07.920]  only do this if you wanted to cause a rebellion. You'd only do this if you wanted to cause
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:19.320]  a civil war. And they're giving everybody an impossible choice. This is how America ends.
[1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:26.280]  Giant ballooning federal armies. Domestic security forces. Get that clip, guys. Obama.
[1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:31.500]  We need a domestic security force. Obama calls for domestic security force. Just as big and
[1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:35.880]  just as strong as our military. And whether you're in Australia or Austria, whether you're
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:41.280]  in Germany or England, whether you're in Canada or the U.S., it's the same thing. It's all
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:45.920]  run by the Davos Group and the New World Order. We've got a special guest covering this when
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:50.320]  we come back. And so much more new lockdowns are straight ahead, but we're not being caught

[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:28.360]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:33.560]  objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:44.440]  just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:58.120]  87,000 IRS agents training to literally take over our lives. All right, the beta test,
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:03.440]  the Canary in the coal mine for this takeover is Australia and New Zealand. Maria Z is one
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:10.760]  of the top independent broadcasters in Australia. Z Media with three E's. Z3easemedia.com joins
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:16.400]  us. We're going to talk about digital ID bill, digital currency, trial starting in Australia,
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:21.760]  bank asking customers to be microchip, weather modifications, months of flooding, smart cities,
[1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:25.640]  districts already underway, election fraud, climate change bill, agriculture bill that
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:31.880]  starts them from sharing food. She joins us now and we really appreciate her getting up
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:37.720]  so early to be with us. Thank you so much for being all with us, Maria Z.
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:41.880]  Thank you, Alex. It's a real honor to be here and can I just say on this broadcast that
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:46.800]  despite the trials and tribulations that you have faced, you guys still turn up every single
[1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:51.920]  day to warn people of what is coming and help them prepare for this information battle. So
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.720]  thank you, Alex.
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:57.520]  Thank you. They're definitely after us because we're over the target. Where do you want to
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:22:02.880]  start here? People say, well, okay, Australia, but you guys, the UN, the Davos group admits
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:04.840]  you're the model of the takeover.
[1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:09.320]  Correct. You're not wrong about that. I've often said Australia is the testing ground
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:13.880]  of the New World Order. You said it yourself. This is the beta test for the world. We can
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:21.120]  start with the smart cities. So while they may not be tackling pregnant women to the
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:26.520]  ground anymore, Alex, like we saw during the lockdowns or shooting peaceful protesters
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:31.920]  with rubber bullets in the streets, they have been spraying our skies constantly. I can't
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:36.560]  recall the last time that I saw a normal sky for more than a day or two along the East
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:41.440]  Coast. And why is that? Well, according to our government grants, the city of Newcastle
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.640]  is actually the model, the smart city model for the whole world. This is in our government
[1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:52.440]  grant documents. So they have been spraying us constantly, preparing us for these smart
[1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:58.120]  cities. How do I know that? Well, the city of Lismore, which has been flooded. You might
[1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:02.680]  have saw that in the news recently, over 50,000 people displaced from their homes. Another
[1:23:02.680 --> 1:23:08.240]  government is encouraging them not to return, not to rebuild. This is a place that was earmarked
[1:23:08.240 --> 1:23:14.120]  for a smart city back in 2019. They have a plan for the whole of the East Coast to be
[1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:18.640]  filled with these smart cities. You're going to live in pods, you're going to eat the bugs,
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:24.960]  you're going to be restricted to 30 minutes of movement from your home. I also know this
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:30.000]  because according to government grants and government documents that they plan on splitting
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.160]  the city of Sydney into three districts, they're actually calling it districts. And they've
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:40.320]  said openly, these are going to be the model for the whole world. The whole world is going
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:45.360]  to be called districts. It's like something out of the Hunger Games, Alex. So Australia
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:50.240]  definitely is the place that the world needs to watch. The tyranny that we experienced
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:55.280]  over the past two years has not come to an end. It's just not as obvious now, but we've
[1:23:55.280 --> 1:24:00.400]  got weather warfare that they're waging on us. And they've told us that we can expect
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:07.360]  another six months of this weather, Alex. Six months of flooding. Is that normal?
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:12.160]  It's not. And everything you said is on record, 30 minutes outside your house a day, the model
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:18.640]  for the world beyond a Supermax prison. Correct. And we've already got people in the city of
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:23.720]  Melbourne that are living in pods. They're already doing this. There's people signing
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:27.920]  up for this stuff. And I think they don't, you know, they built more than a dozen high
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:34.120]  rises in Austin, their 250 square feet, a coffin apartments. Unbelievable. And people
[1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:39.880]  think this is trendy. People think that this is somehow the new way. My goodness, if they
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:46.040]  knew just what these smart cities actually spelled for the world, the fact that every
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:51.040]  single thought is going to be monitored. And I'm not even kidding. Inside our government
[1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:57.000]  grants, it says that street furniture will be monitoring human behavior, street furniture.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:01.480]  So you can't even walk past a park bench in these smart cities without them monitoring
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:06.680]  your every single thought. And then what's going to happen? You're going to be penalized.
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.480]  Your social credit score will be impacted by the fact that you've had a wrong thought
[1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:17.080]  in this Internet of Things. It's unbelievable. But the point is that this is all documented.
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:21.880]  This isn't conspiracy anymore. You've been talking about this for years, Alex, but the
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:26.800]  writing is there in black and white on the very government documents. People often ask
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.720]  you, how did you know? How did you know that this was going to happen? Alex, will you've
[1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:34.560]  done your research? And for all the people that think that this is just the trendy way
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:39.360]  of the future, they need to be doing their research as well and dissecting these documents,
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:43.840]  which is why independent media right now is so crucial. This is why they want to shut
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:48.280]  you down, Alex. This is why they want to shut down infowars because people are starting
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:53.280]  to realize just how nefarious this plan is. Well, that's right. They're building it in
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:58.880]  their own words to force societal, industrial collapse and then forced depopulation. I mean,
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:04.960]  this is a prison plan that they're building. Absolutely. So in Australia, we've got the
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:11.320]  Digital ID Trusted Digital Identity Bill. Trusted. As soon as a government document
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:16.880]  says trusted, you know that it cannot be trusted. We've already proposed this. The Reserve
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:22.120]  Bank of Australia is just about to launch their pilot trial of digital currency, which
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:26.480]  they've said will be legal tender. And of course, we know that this will be linked to
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:31.880]  your Digital ID, aka social credit score. We're talking about a China style social credit
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:37.120]  system that keeps you trapped in this prison. And what I need the world to understand is
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:41.040]  that while things are seemingly normal on the outside, you know, they're trying to sweep
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:46.200]  COVID under the rug, although they'll continue using it because as we know from the patents,
[1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:52.440]  this will be a never ending cycle of injections for the rest of your, it's a lifetime subscription
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:58.160]  of injections to keep you alive and functioning in society. We've heard Yuval Noah Harari say
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:03.760]  that if you're not part of their system, if you're not injected even, you will find it
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:09.160]  very hard to function in their society. And again, this goes back to even the cyber polygon
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:13.760]  page that was taken down, or I should say the cyber COVID page that was taken down from
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.440]  the World Economic Forum's website, where they said once the digital shutdown happens,
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:23.400]  you will need a digital vaccine to get back online. That page, they've done their best
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:29.280]  to hide that. What is a digital vaccine? They plan on making it impossible for you to survive
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:35.040]  unless you comply with their tyranny, with their complete digital prison. And we need
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.480]  to do everything that we can to avoid this, Alex. Once people realize just how dangerous
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:45.240]  this is, if they knew they would be standing with us, but I believe we're getting traction.
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:50.120]  I believe the world is starting to wake up. This broadcast has played a huge part in that.
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.560]  And all of the independent media that's raising the alarm, we need to double down our efforts.
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:59.080]  And the people on the ground, the loyal listeners of this broadcast and others need to double
[1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:04.560]  down their efforts as well. I was speaking just last night on a live broadcast. You know,
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:09.400]  every spare moment that you have, you need to spend in research right now so that you
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:14.120]  can educate regular people on the street. Things are not normal and they will never
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:19.520]  be normal. But we do not have to subscribe to their new normal. We do not have to eat
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:24.760]  the bugs. I heard you earlier, Alex, talking about the fact that they are now, you know,
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:30.640]  putting this, the crickets. I've seen packages here in Australia with cricket flower in them.
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:34.920]  What is cricket flower? They're already hiding this stuff in our food. They're poisoning
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:41.560]  us from every single angle. If it wasn't the deadly COVID-19 clot shot, bioweapon, slow
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:47.080]  acting lethal poison, it'll be the poison in the skies. It'll be the poison in your
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:52.120]  waters. This is a complete and utter assault on all of humanity.
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:29:22.040]  It is. Stay there. You are on fire.

[1:31:06.520 --> 1:31:11.080]  about bringing you amazing products that really work. So we looked at the supplement market
[1:31:11.080 --> 1:31:16.600]  that we fund a lot of our operations with. And we said, what are the best selling natural
[1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:21.480]  healthy anti-fat weight loss products that are out there? We went and looked at the top
[1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:27.160]  10. They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product. But with our new
[1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:36.440]  product from X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:41.040]  that's two amazing things for your body. And so I've lost almost 40 pounds or so a little
[1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:45.720]  bit of a weight in the last three months. And I've been doing it using diet force and
[1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:52.920]  also exercise. Well now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com 40%

[1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:03.200]  care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer or rancher, a doctor,
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:07.960]  a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles. You
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:12.680]  see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns,
[1:32:12.680 --> 1:32:18.080]  50 different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms
[1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:21.960]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:27.760]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation,
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:33.340]  all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal
[1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:37.080]  and lawful that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:43.640]  gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down
[1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:59.040]  the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285.
[1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:14.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. The answer
[1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:25.080]  to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:30.680]  We have some big announcements dealing with the globalist collapsing next segment. I'm
[1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:35.280]  going to wait for this breaking news to start the next segment. But I want to get Maria Z,
[1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:38.920]  who's done such an incredible job back on very soon, to us the rest of the hour. I want
[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:42.120]  to get on her show. It was supposed to be there yesterday, but I got stuck in emergency
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:50.840]  meetings. Zmedia.com, Z-E-E-E, media.com, share that URL. She is the voice of truth in Australia.
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:56.280]  So we talk about Australia under globalist control, being the model of this rollout.
[1:33:56.280 --> 1:34:01.240]  It is. Everything they're doing there, the club of Rome, the Debo script, the UN admit,
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:05.200]  is a beta test for what they're going to do here. That's why what she is breaking down
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:11.080]  is so incredibly critical. But the good news is humanity is rejecting it. These evil forces
[1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:15.200]  aren't all powerful. Their only power is us acquiescing to them. So I'm going to try
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:19.800]  to shut up the next two segments because you're amazing, and just give you the floor to tell
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:23.480]  people what you've witnessed in Australia and what's coming next.
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:28.600]  Well, before I talk back on Australia, you just made a crucial point there, Alex, and
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:34.000]  these people are weak. Think of how weak you have to be and what sort of a cow would you
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  have to be that you base your entire existence and agenda on lies. The truth is so powerful,
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.440]  and the truth doesn't have to cover itself up because the truth defends itself. You know,
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:48.880]  Dr. McCullough said with me recently, let the truth out. It's like a lion, and these
[1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:54.840]  people have no truth in them. It is only darkness, and their entire agenda is based on lies.
[1:34:54.840 --> 1:35:01.120]  So the more that we attack those lies with the truth, with the light, they will be destroyed.
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:07.040]  We must tackle this with the information war, as we know, back onto Australia. Yes, we are
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:12.800]  playing a crucial role in so many aspects of the new world order. For example, I mentioned
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:18.680]  this, this digital currency. If you look at the future of financial infrastructure 2016
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:25.120]  World Economic Forum report, it is littered with Australian financial institutions. Almost
[1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:31.800]  half of them are Aussie institutions. One of those just recently sent an email to their
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:38.080]  customers asking them if they would be willing to be microchipped. This is how far they're
[1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:43.840]  going, and unfortunately, Alex, our people have this attitude and have had this attitude
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:48.880]  for so long. If things would be just fine, we've had a good life here in Australia. People
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:54.360]  need to know that there is no good life left for you if we don't take down these globalists
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:57.280]  with the truth, and in the right way, I'm not willing to do that.
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:01.840]  And just on a rough, ABC, NBC, CBS, all our channels are here. Take microchips, Sweden's
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:06.120]  doing it. There's a total roll out of implantable microchips, as Klaus Schwab said they would
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:08.160]  do five years ago on French TV.
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:12.280]  Yes, and they're getting, they're getting us used to this more and more. For example,
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:17.320]  we've got a manufacturing facility in the state of Queensland called Vaxis, which is
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:22.800]  going to be producing 300 million doses of mRNA injections, but these aren't going to
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:27.520]  be needles. They're needleless. They look like Band-Aids. We know this, we've seen the patents
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:33.760]  for this stuff over the years as we've been digging, but what does Australia need 300
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.240]  million doses for a population of just short of 26 million, roughly, thereabouts? 300 million
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:43.760]  doses a year. We've just had Moderna announced that they're going to have a manufacturing
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:47.240]  facility in the state of Victoria, 100 million doses a year.
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:51.880]  There are racing people to be in systems and announcing this biomedical tyranny.
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:58.240]  Absolutely. And this will be an ongoing cycle of medical tyranny for the rest of your life.
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:06.040]  As I said before, it is a lifetime subscription to these slow acting legal poison death shots
[1:37:06.040 --> 1:37:13.320]  that they will just keep reinventing the next time that they release another bio weapon.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:18.240]  Monkeypox, whether it's monkeypox or the next thing that they concoct, their solution will
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:24.720]  always be vaccines. Our prime minister, selected, not elected, recently said on his Facebook
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:30.840]  that we've got a plan to manufacture mRNA vaccines here in Australia, so on and so forth.
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:36.280]  They will create jobs in our mRNA ecosystem and boost our pandemic readiness.
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.720]  Oh, our mRNA ecosystem. It's a biological takeover.
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:46.120]  Yes, mRNA ecosystem. When have we ever heard these words before? And we're talking about
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:51.520]  a technology that has killed hundreds upon thousands, maybe even millions at this point,
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:57.960]  and will continue to do so. We saw just yesterday, Mike Adams released his findings, his final
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:04.600]  report on what's actually turning up in the bodies of the people that have been injected.
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:10.680]  And I've had Richard Hirschman on as well talking about this. This is scary stuff. They
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:16.920]  are saying that this is not human. It's not human. What is growing inside these people?
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:23.000]  These are not blood clots. This is nanotech, nanotechnology that is growing inside of people
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.480]  and killing them. If it doesn't kill you, it'll mind control you. They've been able to mind
[1:38:27.480 --> 1:38:32.120]  control cows and control their behavior from the 70s. What makes you think they won't be
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:34.840]  able to control you, human? Oh, they admit they're mind controlling insects
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:40.080]  with nanotech. Absolutely. So if they can do that, what makes
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:44.400]  us think that they can't do it to us? I am concerned, Alex. I'm concerned for all the
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:49.760]  people that have been injected and still have some sort of ability to think for themselves.
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:54.920]  What's going to happen to them once they release whatever frequencies into the air? Are they
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:00.680]  going to be able to think outside of the lies and the propaganda as they are now? We still
[1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:07.560]  have the ability to think clearly, to see through the lies. But if this stuff is assembling
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:11.280]  inside of them, I don't know what's going to happen to humanity. We need more research
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:19.800]  in that. So my continuous call is for people to do more. I want anyone who is able to offer
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:24.400]  more of themselves, more of their expertise, more of their research or their skill set
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:29.920]  in this information war to double down your efforts. We need you. Humanity needs you because
[1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:34.160]  we are right in the thick of the great reset as much as it pains me to say it, Alex. It's
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:38.400]  the truth and I won't lie to people. Well, Maria Z, you're an amazing person. Your energy
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:45.240]  is incredible. Your acumen, your intellect is amazing. What woke you up?
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:50.480]  My dad read Pilled Me when I was 10 years old, Alex. As soon as 9-11 happened, he showed
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:56.080]  me some documentaries and some of that content was your content as well. I'd watched Bohemian
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:00.560]  Grove even as a child. Whether people think that that was appropriate for a child to be
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:05.160]  watching or not, well, you know, that's your opinion. It's thanks to that content. It's
[1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:09.440]  thanks to your work years and years ago, Alex and people like you, that I was able to see
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:16.480]  this for what it was when the pandemic started and I was able to start battling this properly.
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:20.800]  What's your view with the new lockdowns you're planning?
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:24.400]  They've told us even, for example, with foot and mouth disease, we've got a threat of foot
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:29.080]  and mouth at the moment. They've said that if even one case turns up in Australia, that
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:33.720]  it would lead to COVID style lockdowns in our country of animals and potentially even
[1:40:33.720 --> 1:40:38.840]  humans restricting our movement, so on and so forth. This may not necessarily be the
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:42.880]  move that they use, but if you notice and what I've noticed is that every single thing
[1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:47.360]  that they're doing is a conditioning tool right now. It's the boiling frog technique.
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:51.720]  They've eased off on us at the moment because we were about to hit civil unrest here in
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:57.240]  Australia. We were very close, so they don't want us to reach that point, maybe not yet,
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:01.680]  although they do want war because as soon as people act up, you know, they can come
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:05.320]  down hard on us. We've got legislation here that allows foreign troops to come in here
[1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:11.160]  and they have full indemnity to harm our people, destroy property. That's a real thing in Australia,
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:18.600]  so they want that. But either way, with each tactic that they use, you know, like I said,
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:23.720]  whether it's monkeypox, foot and mouth disease, if you notice, they are introducing all these
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.920]  health threats because the best way to control people is to threaten their health. So this
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:33.440]  is why it is medical tyranny and they will continue to use medical tyranny.
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:37.440]  Well, they're holding us hostage and they're admitting it and they admit they'll use biomedical
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:41.880]  tyranny in the Rockefeller documents lockstep and others. I mean, it's happening.
[1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:47.200]  Absolutely. Another example of what they're planning on doing in Australia is heavily
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:55.800]  involved in this. Paul Kelly, our chief medical officer, is all for the WHO treaty. The amendments
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:42:00.240]  to the international health regulations, when they did their last round of public hearings,
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:04.320]  they're supposed to make more of their information more publicly available, but they haven't.
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:07.920]  When they did their last round, he said, we should expedite the process. We need this
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:10.600]  much sooner to prepare for the next pandemic.
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.320]  And let's be clear, the UN has called for censoring all critics, though they've improved
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:16.000]  to be total liars.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.480]  Yes, absolutely. And the next question is, what are they going to do with all of those
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:25.600]  camps, Alex? The camps that we have in Australia, they built so many during the pandemic. What
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:29.480]  are they going to do with them? Well, you and I know full well what those camps are
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:30.480]  called.
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:38.560]  But for their political takeover, Maria Z with three E's, Maria Z, Z media.com is our

[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:04.400]  We are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:09.840]  we've known and what's to come. And right now, the most important thing to remember
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:16.440]  is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:22.560]  the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:29.160]  our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash. And
[1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:35.360]  right now we still have time to prepare the world fiat currency system is racing towards
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:42.560]  zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets. Now, including food, water and survival gear

[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:21.880]  changing the world together. All right, Maria Z. Nine minutes left of the segment. I'm going
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:28.480]  to just let you host right now with your emergency message from Australia to the world.
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:33.560]  Thank you, Alex. Look, people always say to me, what are the solutions? We need solutions.
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:37.880]  And I feel like I'm always the bearer of bad news. But the reality is when you know what
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:44.240]  I know and many others know about the New World Order and the totality of how evil and
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:50.600]  horrible their plan is for mankind. What else can you do other than warn them? Be a watchman
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:55.920]  and let them know, hey, this is how bad it could get if we don't stop this. We're literally
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.840]  talking about depopulating the world by billions of people and the ones who are left will be
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:05.440]  in total enslavement, whether it's digital enslavement, whether it's enslavement inside
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:10.600]  their little pods and eating fake meat from Bill Gates. People need to understand just
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:16.560]  how horrible this is. Now, you can't fight against something unless you know what you're
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:21.280]  fighting against. So it's so crucial to arm yourself with the knowledge of what it is
[1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:25.960]  that you're fighting against. Again, I'm not calling for civil unrest or anything like
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:30.880]  that. I'm talking about the information war that ultimately leads to mass noncompliance.
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:35.880]  You see, the people that tune into this broadcast, the reason why they didn't comply with ridiculous
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:41.640]  things when they came out, like wearing masks, for example, which is ridiculous. We won't
[1:50:41.640 --> 1:50:45.560]  even get into that. But it is. The reason why they didn't was because they were armed
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:50.520]  with the knowledge of knowing just how corrupt the government is, knowing that this is about
[1:50:50.520 --> 1:50:56.360]  control, knowing that it was never about a virus. It has always been about total control
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:51:02.000]  and more so destruction of mankind. When you are armed with that knowledge, you won't back
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:07.520]  down. You have to think of it like a soldier. You have to think of it like someone who says,
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:13.600]  I know what the battle ahead looks like and what the worst case could be. And these are
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:20.080]  my contingency plans. And part of that contingency is preparing for the worst, hoping, praying,
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:25.520]  believing for the best and doing your part for humanity. If you can support this broadcast,
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:29.480]  Info Wars has been, and I'm just plugging you here, Alex. No one's asked me to. Info
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:36.520]  Wars has been the leader in the information war. Info Wars has helped me over the years,
[1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:41.760]  and I know they've helped you to support independent media who go out and do the research to give
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:47.480]  it to people in bite-sized pieces so that they can digest it and give it to others.
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:52.120]  Do your own research wherever you can. And I always say to people, don't trust me. Don't
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:57.480]  trust Alex Jones. Don't trust your favorite broadcaster. It doesn't matter. Go and confirm.
[1:51:57.480 --> 1:52:00.920]  In fact, check the people that you listen to and confirm it for yourself, because it's
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:05.680]  one thing saying, I heard this on a broadcast, and it's another thing saying, I've gone
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:10.440]  and confirmed this, and I've read these documents myself. It's all there. It's all readily
[1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:15.760]  available, and you must do it. We must do it before they completely silence us, because
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:20.880]  they'll win through censorship, and we have to keep fighting back on that. And in the
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.720]  face of so much adversity, in the face of the greatest attack on mankind and on our psychology
[1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:33.480]  and on our minds, this is the greatest war that was ever launched upon humanity, and
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:38.960]  yet every single one of you watching this has survived. You have survived the greatest
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:45.400]  psychological attack in history. That is something to be proud of. It's a badge of honor. And
[1:52:45.400 --> 1:52:50.160]  believe you me, if you think you're endured a lot over these past two and a half years,
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:54.760]  there is more coming to endure, and you must know that as a soldier who is prepared for
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:59.640]  battle. But you have endured, and you are capable of enduring a lot more. We are far
[1:52:59.640 --> 1:53:04.800]  more resilient than we think, and that we give ourselves credit for, and we're far more
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:09.000]  resourceful than we give ourselves credit for. So people should really inspect in their
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:13.600]  own minds and hearts what more they could be doing right now, Alex. You've been turning
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:20.140]  up every day for years now. For almost 30 years, you've been at this, and I know with
[1:53:20.140 --> 1:53:25.320]  this, it's not easy to live with this information in your head. I understand it. I don't think
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:31.200]  people really understand how much effort goes into what you do, Alex. Maybe they do, maybe
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:37.200]  they have an appreciation for it, but it is hours upon hours of having this horrible information
[1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:42.720]  in your head. And so I understand when people say they need a break from it. You're in a
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:49.080]  war. We can rest when the war is won, and we can win. We can win the war, but it requires
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:54.280]  mass awareness and mass noncompliance with the next nonsense that they bring about.
[1:53:54.280 --> 1:54:00.320]  Beautifully said, in closing, with a few minutes left, from Australia, the beta test this takeover.
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:03.760]  What else do you want to tell the world? Because this is a war. We're under attack. People
[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:07.440]  should admit they're under attack, and that's the first part of victory.
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:12.360]  I really encourage people to watch the steps that the Australian government are taking
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:18.840]  in order to put us into this digital prison. As I said to you, we're trialing digital currency.
[1:54:18.840 --> 1:54:23.200]  You've got the trusted digital identity bill. You played a clip recently, Alex of Senator
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:28.120]  Malcolm Roberts. I had Imon recently explaining just how dangerous this bill is. It is a social
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:34.000]  credit score. Watch the steps that they're implementing in Australia, and know that this
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:39.160]  is coming for your country as well, all over the world. This is a global plan. It's not
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:43.440]  one country over another. We're just the beta test, as you said.
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:47.960]  So watch what happens here to know what you need to stand and fight against and educate
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:56.360]  people beforehand from your country. Say, hey, Australia faced some of the worst abuse
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:00.320]  from authorities over these past two and a half years. That's just a taste of what these
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:05.040]  people are capable of. Look what they're already planning now. Look at the fact that they're
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:10.560]  already rolling out digital currency in Australia. Look at the fact that they're already rolling
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:16.400]  out the social credit score. We're miles ahead of other countries now as far as the implementation
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:22.240]  of the great reset. My goodness, this is a huge threat. So watch this country. And, you
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:27.320]  know, for from my end, I will continue to do whatever I can to raise awareness so that
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:32.560]  it doesn't go through so that the people do stand against this. But every single person
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:36.760]  needs to do their part right now. We're in the most crucial, crucial time, Alex, in all
[1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:39.840]  of history, humanity. We need you.
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:46.360]  Well, I just want to say you are so powerful, your energy, your focus, your will and your
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:49.360]  strength. And I know the Australians are great people as well. I think they've been
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:56.600]  off more than they can chew. I see globalist defeat in closing. You've explained us do
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:56:01.120]  or die time. What else do you think people should know right now?
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:08.440]  You're right, Alex. It is they can be defeated. And if everyone, if everyone just musters
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:15.000]  up the courage and musters up the belief that this entire thing is based on a lie and the
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:21.320]  lie crumbles as soon as we say no more, that will be how we're going to defeat these people.
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.360]  And I do believe it. I'm a person of faith, Alex. I'm a person that believes in God. I
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:30.800]  believe in Jesus. I know that through him we can do all things. I'm not going to give
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:35.800]  up hope on that. And I know that your listeners won't either. So be encouraged. Know that
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:41.480]  there is more strength in you than you think there is. And you, through integrity and courage
[1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:47.960]  and doing the right thing will take down the globalist as doing your part in this war.
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:51.760]  Amazing. I can't wait to be on your show. Sorry, I missed the show yesterday. Please
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:56.680]  come back on soon. In 30 seconds, though, it seems like the Australians are really waking
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:56:58.160]  up. Are they?
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:03.200]  Yes and no. I mean, there is less compliance with the ridiculous masks. They're not going
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:09.160]  back for more boosters. But again, our people are generally a very compliant place. So I
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:14.680]  feel like the more rope that they give us now, if they start to tighten that rope again,
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:19.240]  I'm really hoping, Alex, that the people will say no next time around. But the truth is
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:23.320]  we're seeing less people muzzled. We're seeing less people going back for these kill shots.
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:25.640]  And that gives me a lot of hope.
[1:57:25.640 --> 1:57:34.160]  Maria Z, you are amazing. God bless you. Zmedia. Z-E-E-E media.com. We love you. Please join

[1:59:48.160 --> 2:00:04.960]  So I would say, you know, if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your
[2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:10.840]  book, it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation. And I don't believe
[2:00:10.840 --> 2:00:16.600]  in dividing our nation. It hurts our great nation. And so CNN is really the enemy of
[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:20.080]  the truth. And that's my opinion. Thank you.
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  No American is an enemy of another American. No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:51.080]  No news outlet is an enemy of America. No news outlet is an enemy of America. No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:01:13.760]  Brian Stelter has been fired at CNN. He was literally a zombie reporter. No viewers universally
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:30.280]  fired. What is this signifier? We'll talk about it. This is CNN.
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:44.120]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. Just let me think even now, orders
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:48.280]  are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will be on their way.
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:49.280]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:50.280]  Damn it.
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:51.280]  Why?
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:56.640]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:02.640]  their power. Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciations
[2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:03.640]  of the truth.
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:08.840]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:12.720]  You decided, sir. You wanted it through proof. You told me every television in London.
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:17.920]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you have the freedom to object,
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:22.880]  listen to everything and speak as you saw fit, you now have senses and systems of surveillance
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:30.520]  coercing your conformity and sub-cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well,
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:34.920]  certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:40.800]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:48.800]  mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who would be? War, terror, disease?
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:54.440]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:03:00.520]  common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high Chancellor
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:06.280]  Adam Sutler. He promised you border. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:15.280]  your silent, obedient consent.
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:21.760]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:30.760]  sides has come. We are the Resistance. We are the Info War.
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:04:00.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Info Wars has been banned. Arrested. Attacked and threatened.

[2:05:57.240 --> 2:06:11.720]  now. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. Well for the balance of the hour,
[2:06:11.720 --> 2:06:17.960]  the next 55 minutes, Judge Andrew Napolitano, an iconic conservative libertarian populist
[2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:25.400]  voice, is our guest to analyze Mar-Lago raid, the midterms, age you days. Just so much more.
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:30.280]  And Obama talked about a domestic security force just as big and as strong as our military.
[2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:36.360]  Now it's 87,000 armed IRS agents putting ads out. Are you ready to commit legal force?
[2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:41.560]  And then I'm sorry, but it looks like the group they've hired is a group of misfits.
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:47.720]  We've got that raw footage of the training they're doing with plastic guns before they
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:54.920]  raid our houses. But first, here's Obama. We cannot continue to rely only on our military
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:06:59.480]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:05.960]  a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:07:05.960 --> 2:07:17.400]  I was talking to Judge Andrew Napolitano during the quick break and I said,
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:21.080]  what do you want to hit first? He said everything. He said, you just lead it. But
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:27.160]  I've got a thousand questions. But I mean, I think it's most important he just start off because he
[2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:34.360]  is a very respected brain when it comes to jurisprudence of where this republic is today. The
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:40.440]  system is discredited. The establishment media is collapsing and their attempt to dominate
[2:07:41.080 --> 2:07:45.320]  an attempt to start a civil war, I think it's backfiring. I want peace. I don't want violence,
[2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:49.400]  but I am really concerned 82 days after the midterms of what the deep state is going to do.
[2:07:49.400 --> 2:07:54.360]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, we salute you for your courage. Judge nap.com podcast,
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:59.320]  judging freedom available on YouTube. Judge Andrew Napolitano. We love you, brother.
[2:07:59.320 --> 2:08:04.280]  I can ask a lot of questions, but I'm just going to give you the floor right now.
[2:08:04.280 --> 2:08:08.840]  Well, the feeling of love is mutual, Alex. And thanks very much for having me on. We haven't
[2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:15.640]  had a chance to speak since what you went through in a courtroom in Austin. And of course,
[2:08:15.640 --> 2:08:22.440]  I'm happy to speak about the unconstitutional implications there. But in terms of the issues
[2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:27.960]  that are confronting us today, look, the federal government has constructed a national security
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:32.920]  state. Obama put the icing on the cake. Actually, Trump, even though he's the target of it,
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:40.200]  enhanced it by increasing their budgets. And they all have the three letter acronym names that we
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:48.760]  know of CIA, FBI, DA, BATF, they have a fourth letter. All of these are unconstitutional.
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:55.160]  None of these are recognized by the Constitution. James Madison, when he wrote the Constitution,
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:09:03.480]  intended to keep health, safety, safety, welfare and morality into the regulatory scope of the states
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.960]  so that if you wanted to live in a state with a very heavy hand, come to New Jersey,
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.560]  the police are everywhere. You want to live in a state where you have more personal freedom,
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:16.840]  go to Texas or go to New Hampshire. The more federalizing there is of these things,
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:24.920]  the less liberty there is. Here's a few examples. FBI, between 9 and 10,000 active duty agents.
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:36.040]  We don't know the exact number. DHS, 65,000 khaki pants wearing black shirt wearing
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:45.720]  Glock 45 carrying cops to enforce what? Whatever the president wants them to enforce.
[2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:51.320]  Now you're going to add to that 87,000 IRS agents. I don't know what kind of uniform
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:57.240]  they're going to wear, but they're going to carry Glock's as well. You really have a police state.
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.600]  The standard definition of a police state, Alex, you know this because you've used it.
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:08.360]  You and I have talked about it many times together and separately, is a state where
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:14.840]  the laws are written to make it easy for the government rather than to support individual
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.880]  liberty. That's exactly what we have now. It will become more obvious to people watching
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:27.800]  and listening to us now as these federal cops become more invasive in our lives.
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:34.840]  I think this will backfire on the Democrats probably not soon enough to affect them in 2022,
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:43.880]  but certainly in 2024. The deep state has been around since 1947 when Harry Truman
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:49.240]  created the CIA, which, by the way, is not allowed to get involved in law enforcement,
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:55.240]  is not allowed to spy on Americans, tell that to Julian Assange's lawyers who were spied on by
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:11:01.720]  the CIA and the Ecuadorian embassy in London. They were forced to almost have to chuckle at this
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:08.200]  at its simplicity. They were forced to surrender their mobile devices when they walked into the
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:16.440]  embassy. The embassy handed them over to something called Subcover LLC, an American
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:22.520]  security firm, which somehow downloaded everything in there and shipped all the contents to the CIA.
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:28.520]  That, of course, is theft and a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment. The CIA is in every
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:34.440]  state house in the United States, and they are in competition with the NSA to download every
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:41.880]  keystroke on your mobile phone and every keystroke on your desktop. All of it unlawful, all of it
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:49.960]  unconstitutional, all of it gets worse. Why does it get worse? Because the security state
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:57.000]  in the United States has all the dirt they need on members of Congress. With the exception of a few,
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:12:03.160]  Ron Paul, when it was in the Congress, Thomas Massie from Kentucky, Rand Paul from Kentucky,
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:09.080]  with the exception of just a handful, members of Congress are terrified of the deep state
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:16.680]  and always vote to reauthorize its powers and to increase its budgets. We're in a terrible
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:22.200]  state of affairs. The federal government is a monster. I think it will eventually fall
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:25.800]  of its own weight. It won't be able to pay its bills. It won't be able to pay these cops that
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:29.320]  work for it, but that's not going to happen tomorrow.
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.360]  And by the way, you look 20 years younger. You didn't look bad before, but I'm not
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:37.720]  kissing your ass. You look like a fountain of youths happening. I am exhausted and look like
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:45.240]  I'm 70, though I'm like 48. But when I look at the slobs, though, if I'm saying I'm not perfect,
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:50.120]  but I'm in great shape compared to the slobs in these videos, like 400-pound dudes with their
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:57.800]  shirts hanging out, with plastic guns preparing to raid everybody, 87,000. That is just insane.
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:59.560]  Like what is that?
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:08.920]  Well, taxation is theft, in my view. The government can charge a fee for its services,
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:15.480]  but it can't take your wealth from you without your consent. The Fifth Amendment prohibits that.
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:19.400]  It can't take wealth from you without compensating you for the wealth. But why
[2:13:19.400 --> 2:13:22.200]  these guys have to train for violence, I don't know.
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:27.160]  That's what I'm saying is like you look at, it looks like a Greyhound bus stop. I'm not being
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:33.880]  mean. Like a bunch of disheveled cross-eyed slobs don't look like they know where there are
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:36.680]  and they're training for war. I mean, that is crazy.
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:43.320]  Well, your typical IRS agent is half cop, half accountant and they don't show up with a gun.
[2:13:43.320 --> 2:13:47.800]  They show up with a badge and you're allowed to have your accountant and your lawyer there.
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:51.400]  But if these guys are going to come with a gun, you're not going to have anybody there.
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:55.080]  I don't know why they need a gun and I don't know what they're training for.
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:59.560]  That's what I'm saying. They're all laughing and funny. Like this is funny. If they were like crack
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:05.160]  troops, you know, the the the stoonstaffel, I wouldn't want their job. This looks insane.
[2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:13.480]  Well, it is insane. I listened to Biden just signed the legislation the other day.
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:21.160]  The money for the 87,000 hasn't even been allocated. It's not even flowing to the IRS yet.
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:25.880]  So I don't know how this is happening or exactly who these people are.
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:32.840]  But but it's dangerous for the government to hire yet another police department.
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:36.280]  All of their police departments are unconstitutional,
[2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:42.120]  of the reasons I just articulated. And nobody knows what's going to what's going to come of this.
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:48.920]  I mean, do we really want an American public that's terrified of the government? Does the
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:53.160]  government work for us or do we work for the government? I guess this terror is coming. You
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:15:00.040]  and I have been warning about this for 20 or 30 years. Now it's it's on the doorstep.
[2:15:00.840 --> 2:15:05.800]  Absolutely. Like if I was a real dictator, I would be a little soft about this. Like,
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.720]  why are they trying to start a fight like this?
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:14.280]  Well, I don't get it. I also don't get how the Democrats will, of course,
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:19.560]  and I have as many problems with the Republicans I do with the Democrats, but not on this issue,
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:24.360]  every single Republican in Congress voted against it to a person. I don't I don't see what the
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:29.720]  Democrats think they're going to get out of this kind of terror. I understand why I want to take
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:35.240]  money from corporations. They don't understand that that money ultimately comes from consumers and
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:39.480]  shareholders. They don't get that. They don't know economics 101. But I understand what they're trying
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:46.040]  to do. I don't understand why they want to terrorize the average middle class American. Well, yeah,
[2:15:46.040 --> 2:15:50.440]  if I wanted to turn people against me, I would do this. I mean, I'm no rocket science says to
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:16:09.800]  Paul Tonnell like you, but this is like if I wanted to be hated, I would do this. We'll be right back.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:46.600]  It keeps us on the air. And it's going to sell out quick. But despite that, we're offering it for

[2:16:56.120 --> 2:17:02.600]  advantage of it. Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the US that supplies
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.960]  the highest quality signature reducing fairy day cages, the Pentagon and other US government
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:15.080]  agencies. And now they have produced specifically for us this made America onion line at a very
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:20.360]  affordable price, whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone, or big pouches that
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:26.200]  protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:34.600]  desktop computers. It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name. Redux

[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:46.920]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity from identity
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:53.000]  theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments. This is one of the hottest items out there today
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:18:00.200]  that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com. The great reset in the war for the world is the
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:05.720]  book that the government doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to
[2:18:05.720 --> 2:18:10.680]  control your life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:16.040]  control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:21.480]  doesn't want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for
[2:18:21.480 --> 2:18:26.760]  how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:32.600]  work that freedom is alive in this country. This is a central reading. And you know, I would go
[2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:38.280]  right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:42.680]  It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going to try to take it down from every
[2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:47.880]  platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:52.600]  by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones. I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:58.360]  you writing this book and getting the information out there. The globalists are fighting around
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:03.960]  the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:10.920]  marriages. And the studies are all clear. The number one cause of marital splits is that there
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:17.320]  is problems in the bedroom. And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:21.800]  gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting,
[2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:27.640]  good, loving relationships. They want to break up society. And we are so excited to have the number
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:36.760]  one natural male enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now. Go to theironpatriot.com

[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:21.640]  Welcome back. Judge Andrew DePaulitano is our guest. He has his own podcast now. Find all that
[2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:28.200]  information on his site. We'll give that to you here right now. That is for folks that are looking,
[2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:33.800]  judgenap.com and podcast judging freedom. But I was asking him during the break to answer this
[2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:39.480]  question for me before we hit all the other big Mar-a-Lago news and midterm election news and
[2:20:39.480 --> 2:20:45.000]  open border news. What would you, as somebody I really respect is not just a judge but a historian,
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:49.080]  what would you call this period of time America and the world is in right now?
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:57.000]  Well, I would call America in a dysfunctional police state. The dysfunctional part
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:05.160]  addresses our social and cultural misery. You know, in New Jersey, the school teachers are
[2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:12.600]  required to tell seven-year-old girls you don't need a penis to be a boy. I mean, the fact that the
[2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:18.840]  government is forcing these words out of the mouths of school teachers and this terror into
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:24.600]  the minds of children makes it dystopian. It's a police state for the reasons that you and I
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:30.680]  discussed earlier. The laws are written in order to make it easier for the government to enforce
[2:21:30.680 --> 2:21:36.760]  them rather than to make it easier for us to express our individual liberties. The government
[2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:44.680]  pays only lip service to the Bill of Rights, but the may lays in the country, which has been
[2:21:44.680 --> 2:21:50.760]  heightened by Biden. Joe Biden didn't cause it. This has been going on, I think, since the George
[2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:58.120]  W. Bush years. No, I agree, but he supercharged it. Yes, he did. You're talking about Biden.
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:06.520]  He absolutely did. He absolutely has. It's not going to go away unless and until
[2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:11.960]  there's some sort of cataclysmic event where we can dial back the federal government.
[2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:20.040]  I mean, nearly everything local and state governments do from surveillance to to gender
[2:22:20.040 --> 2:22:28.440]  identity comes down from the feds. The feds are the monsters here, and well over 90 percent of
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:35.640]  what they do is not authorized by the Constitution. My column this week addresses Donald Trump as a
[2:22:35.640 --> 2:22:43.960]  victim of the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act of 1917 permitted the government to punish dissent.
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:49.960]  And the concept of punishing dissent would be antithetical to our founders,
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:56.520]  but we see it happening right before our eyes. The Espionage Act was used by President Woodrow
[2:22:56.520 --> 2:23:02.360]  Wilson to incarcerate Princeton students. You ready for this? For reading the Declaration of
[2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:08.120]  Independence aloud in front of draft offices, he was able to incarcerate them. They weren't put
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:15.160]  on trial. They were just put in jail for the duration of World War One. I see that coming back.
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:26.040]  Absolutely. So what is this pervert tyranny or this pervert insanity of the sexualization of
[2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:30.760]  children? I mean, I don't know how you describe it, a political movement that is about targeting
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:35.080]  children and confusing their identity. I don't hate anybody for their identity. As adults,
[2:23:35.080 --> 2:23:40.280]  do what you want. I'm libertarian like you, but the idea of the state getting in front of parents
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:45.880]  and children and trying to dictate children's proclivities just seems pedophilic to me.
[2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:54.200]  This also goes back to Woodrow Wilson in whose era the concept of mandatory
[2:23:54.200 --> 2:24:02.040]  attendance at mandatory government schools was created. The idea was to push a progressive
[2:24:02.040 --> 2:24:08.120]  agenda on the part of children so that children would grow up to be progressives, would grow up
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:13.480]  to be lefties. I mean, public schools are part of the government's tyranny and they're a recipe
[2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:19.240]  for failure. They have guaranteed income, the taxpayers guaranteed customers, the children,
[2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:25.400]  and very little competition. Their only competition is far more expensive than they are. Government
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:30.280]  schools shouldn't exist. Private schools would pop up on every street corner. You want to be an
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:35.080]  airplane mechanic. You go to this high school. You want to go to print center Yale. You go to
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:40.040]  that high school. You want to go into the media. You go to that high school, but trying to turn
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:47.880]  pigs ears into silk purses by spending fortunes where people are forced so that they can receive
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:53.800]  an ideology that the progressives like is reprehensive, reprehensible.
[2:24:53.800 --> 2:24:57.400]  And I totally agree with this question before you hit other issues. I mean, Rob,
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:02.600]  how is it going for the left then? The woke corporate thing, they're canceling all these
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:07.960]  liberal movies, all these woke movies, Disney's canceling them. It seems like people are rejecting
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:12.680]  it. Am I wrong or how would you quantify the current battle space of who's winning, who's losing?
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:20.600]  Well, I live in the People's Republic of New Jersey where the left is winning. This is an
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:25.800]  assault on the family. They started out a hundred years ago in the progressive government schools
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:32.040]  with an assault on the minds of children. It's now an assault on the family. I mean, imagine
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:37.080]  a family, two parents and three kids where the seven year old girl comes home and says,
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:44.200]  I want to be a boy. Just imagine what that does to the family. If she were 27, I don't approve
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:49.400]  of this, but she could do what she wants. She owns her own body. But at age seven, for the government
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:54.200]  to be suggested that some, by the way, if the school teachers don't suggest it in New Jersey,
[2:25:54.200 --> 2:26:00.120]  then the state withholds funds. And there are very, very few school systems that could survive in
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.160]  New Jersey without the state funds. So they really, really have a sort of democlete.
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:11.400]  And who could come up with this, the state getting involved in a child's development sexually?
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:16.760]  I mean, that is just, I mean, if I had a cousin or a grandfather or grandmother that tried to come
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:20.520]  tell my kids about what sex they were, I would kick them out of my house. But the government
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:27.000]  doesn't, we just roll over. Well, the government can't deliver the mail. It can't fill pot holes.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:32.760]  It can't stop robocalls, but it's going to tell children how, how to change their, their genders.
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:39.080]  I mean, this is Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, trying to out to his, what he thinks,
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:44.680]  future rival for the Democratic nomination for president on the other part of the country,
[2:26:44.680 --> 2:26:50.760]  Gavin Newsom, or who can be the most outrageous or who can be the most patronizing to the hard left.
[2:26:51.880 --> 2:26:58.120]  Look, I've known Joe Biden for years. He was a, an adjunct faculty member at Delaware Law School
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:03.000]  when I was a full-time faculty member. The faculty laughed at him because he didn't have the mentality
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:08.120]  of a faculty member. The students liked him because he was a nice guy. He was a moderate Democrat.
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:14.760]  He's not today because without the hard left, without the AOCs and Phil Murphy's and Gavin
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:20.440]  Newsom's, the Democrats are a minority party and Joe wouldn't be able to get anything done.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:26.440]  So he's allowed these people, at least when he was, when he was competent, mentally competent,
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:33.960]  he allowed these people to tug him very, very, very far to the left, which is where he is now.
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:40.440]  When the feds move hard left, the states and locals move hard left. You're a little bit more
[2:27:40.440 --> 2:27:46.360]  optimistic about this, Alex, than I am. There will come a tipping point when the, when the public
[2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:51.000]  will recoil from it. I don't think we've reached that tipping point yet. If we had, we wouldn't
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:28:00.040]  have the 87,000 new IRS agents pulling up their pants because their, their glocks weigh down their
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:04.200]  belts. Well, no, I mean, I agree with you that it's going to get worse before it gets better, but
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:11.000]  it's just so cartoonish to watch this happening. What drives these people to do these type of
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:16.040]  favors? Now, you mentioned it during a break. I wasn't going to raise it, but I want to, I want
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:21.240]  to get into my case and where I've been defaulted twice in Texas and Connecticut. We gave them
[2:28:21.240 --> 2:28:25.560]  everything. They put it on in the, in the court and then sat and give it to them. I want to get
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:30.360]  your view as a former judge and a political commentator watching this. And, and what the
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:34.520]  Democrats now saying, it's not about what he did questioning a shooting, which is out of context,
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:40.040]  but I apologize for hurt people. They are literally saying we're going to take him out and then
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:45.000]  take everybody else out that questions narratives. What does that mean? We're moving me from the
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.560]  debate when we come back. Cause I've already said, yeah, I was wrong about that. Not what they said
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:52.920]  I said, but what I did say was wrong, but that's, that's, that's a separate issue.

[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:12.680]  it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:32:12.680 --> 2:32:18.360]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:22.360]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and
[2:32:22.360 --> 2:32:27.320]  knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting
[2:32:27.320 --> 2:32:33.640]  everybody. To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep
[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:38.120]  more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:45.160]  years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word,
[2:32:45.160 --> 2:33:02.040]  jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:16.520]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones. You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:24.120]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:28.680]  So I asked Judge Napolitano at the start of the hour what he wanted to hit.
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:35.480]  We're going to hit a bunch of those subjects, the Malago raid, the Ukraine situation, the IRS,
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:40.120]  so much more. But he wanted to get into this subject and that's the subject of my defaults.
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:46.200]  We gave the Texas George Soros judge who's got two lawsuits, she's running against us,
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:50.520]  everything. They put it on during the court. We gave the Connecticut judge that but they
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:57.000]  defaulted us so we're already guilty and a jury decides how guilty we are. And then once I'm in
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:02.280]  these hearings, it just gets more insane. But then in closing arguments, two weeks ago,
[2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:06.840]  when the first showtroll ended with $40 plus million in damages, which is Captain Texas at
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:13.880]  like $5 million, they let it all out. They said, we want to take him out, take his bullhorn away,
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:18.920]  shut him down, and we're going to take out Fox News and Tucker Carlson next. And they went on
[2:34:18.920 --> 2:34:23.240]  TV and said it. So I'm not going to bore you with all the clips again, but here's just a few of them
[2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:28.280]  saying they're going to cut up the corpse of info wars and send a message to silence us. Here it is.
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:38.520]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones platform that he talks about away,
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:45.240]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform. That's what matters.
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:54.520]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies,
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:35:02.280]  and make sure he can't do it again. That is punishment. That is deterrence.
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:07.560]  We're not going to be spending two years going up to the tech spring court or whatever,
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:10.920]  nobody's going to waste their money doing that. We're going to this bankrupt support.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:14.280]  And those claims are going to have to get valued and resolved in that bankruptcy state.
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:18.120]  And when we have a litigable basis to potentially wrap this case up for years,
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:21.560]  and then ultimately collect our entire punitive damage argument,
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:25.720]  yeah, there's going to be a resolution made under what these claims are valued at.
[2:35:25.720 --> 2:35:28.600]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at,
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:32.040]  and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:36.280]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is going heading towards is there's going to be a
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:41.400]  large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:46.040]  state. And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr. Jones,
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:51.960]  because there was going to be a new level of financial scrutiny. And if, you know,
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:56.600]  some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store,
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:36:00.840]  pull it out in front of him on the stand, I can only imagine what federal receivers might do.
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:03.720]  So yeah, it's going to get interesting from here on out.
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:09.000]  If a lawyer like you with a pet judge can make up a bunch of lies, who knows what you can do.
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:13.400]  So Judge Napolitano, watching this from afar, what's your view of it?
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:20.360]  Well, I would have interrupted the, I doubt that they would have let me preside on your trial,
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:25.800]  but I would have interrupted that closing argument about taking him out, shut him down,
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:31.080]  and silence him. That's not the function of the jury. The First Amendment prohibits
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:35.560]  the government. That's all three branches of the government, executive, legislative,
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:40.520]  and judicial from silencing speech. The government has to be out of the business of speech.
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:47.560]  The issue before that Texas jury was not your words. The issue before that Texas jury was the
[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:55.400]  alleged harm that these plaintiffs suffered. My beef is with the Connecticut court, which allowed
[2:36:55.400 --> 2:37:00.760]  a case to go to default. It should have been dismissed on summary judgment, which your lawyer
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:07.080]  is quite properly moved for and lost. Now, why did they lose? They lost because Connecticut is the
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:14.680]  only state in the union in which you can be sued for expressing an opinion. You expressed an opinion.
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:20.920]  Whether it's groundless or not, it's an opinion. Opinions are protected speech. The Supreme
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:27.560]  Court has ruled on that countless times. And Maddow and Tucker Carlson have argued that and had
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:36.200]  cases dismissed. Correct. But they changed the law in Connecticut to suit the people who hate
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:43.000]  Alex Jones. And that is reprehensible. But that's what happened. And you suffered because of it.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:51.080]  You will eventually triumph because you resonate with a huge portion of the of the population
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:59.560]  who love what you say and respect what you say. Your candor and your honesty expressed in an
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:04.440]  innocent and truthful and sincere way on the stand. I'm just saying this because I like you
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:11.720]  because we work together, but it's true in Austin as resonated all across the ideological battlefield.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:18.200]  But the greatest wrong was done by the Connecticut courts that allowed a lawsuit to proceed to
[2:38:18.200 --> 2:38:25.560]  judgment based on opinion. Because opinion was protected speech in all 50 states. It's now protected
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:34.920]  only in 49. Texas should not have held the damages hearing because it was enforcing a judgment that
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:42.120]  is not recognizable or enforceable in Texas. Because in Texas where you live and work and where
[2:38:42.120 --> 2:38:49.480]  that trial took place for two weeks, opinions are protected. That's your that's your best argument in
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.400]  my view on appeal. I don't have to tell your lawyers the argument. They know the case better
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:58.840]  than I do. And they probably know the law as well as I do. But the Constitution is on your side.
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:04.440]  The Constitution still prevails in Texas, Alex. Well, I'm just frustrated because I'm not perfect.
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:08.280]  The Internet didn't believe it happened. I covered it a few times that Hillary ran against
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:12.920]  Trump on it and made this big thing. It's not who I am. I barely ever even covered it. But I came
[2:39:12.920 --> 2:39:17.960]  and said, I believe your kids died. I'm sorry. But I'm under Texas law, judge. You have to say
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:23.960]  somebody's name. They they ignored the statute limitations. They ignored that they never asked
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:27.800]  for a retraction. They ignored that never said their name. They just don't care.
[2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:37.080]  Well, what they care about is harming Alex Jones and the people who articulate the same views,
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:46.120]  whether it's Tucker Carlson or me or whoever it might be. And now the media has a target on its
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:53.960]  back. Because the the at least in one state, Connecticut and and ratified in Texas of all
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:40:01.400]  places, where you can really say whatever you want, you can be punished for expressing an opinion.
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:06.280]  And that is just and you had a very sophisticated point. I'm not going to tell inside baseball,
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:11.240]  it was an off record meeting. But representatives of a former president came here four years ago.
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:15.720]  And they said, just roll over. We're going to defeat you. It was a Republican president.
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:20.600]  This is a done deal. You should just accept this. We're going to set the Democrats up.
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:27.240]  And once they take you down, they'll all be taken down. And now I see it was actually true.
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:31.320]  They tried to get me to join them. I didn't. Don't the Democrats the New York Times get that
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:35.560]  that the famous New York Times Sullivan case is about to be overturned by this?
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:42.920]  No, it's it's reprehensible that two members of the court, both of whom I admire,
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:50.040]  they were on the right side on abortion and carry Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil
[2:40:50.040 --> 2:40:56.040]  Gorsuch have criticized times against Sullivan. The Republicans brought this about times against
[2:40:56.040 --> 2:41:01.480]  Sullivan, even though the ultimate victory is to the New York Times of all places. It was it was
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:07.000]  an ad published in the Times. It wasn't an editorial of the Times that triggered the law.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:11.080]  Exactly. So why would the left be undermining their own protection?
[2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:16.840]  They're they're short sighted. Why would the left get the courts persuade the courts in
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:21.480]  Connecticut to get rid of the protection for opinions? And that can be used against them
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:28.360]  at some point in the future. If times against Sullivan goes, the lawsuits against media figures
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:34.440]  will go through the roof and it will silence us, it will chill us, it will give us pause before we
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:40.440]  express an opinion, it will prevent us from being robust, either that or we'll be paying
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:48.840]  extraordinary insurance premiums for defamation insurance protection. It will profoundly upset
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:55.640]  the freedom of speech in this country. If times against Sullivan goes, or if other states start
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:42:01.880]  mimicking what Connecticut did in order to attack conservatives and libertarians, because at some
[2:42:01.880 --> 2:42:06.360]  point, I hate to say this, the conservatives and libertarians will do the same thing to the
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:10.600]  lefties. It shouldn't be done either. The country was founded on the freedom of speech on the
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:19.000]  government staying the hell out of the business of speech. An idea rises or falls by its rationality
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:24.920]  and whether the listeners accept its rationality. It doesn't rise or fall by what the government
[2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:29.960]  says about it. I totally agree. And I shot my mouth off a few times. And they later they went
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:33.560]  back and found where I'm at a mistake and blew it all up. And then they're the ones saying all
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:38.360]  this damages me. They're the ones promoting it more using my name. It's like a form of identity
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:43.000]  theft. So let's shift gears, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And let's talk about the Marlago raid,
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:49.080]  the midterms, the FBI. Where is this all going? Try to have a Judge Andrew Napolitano. Be sure

[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:49.960]  Judge Andrew DePolitano is our guest here before Paul Joseph Watson
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:56.440]  and picks over the fourth hour here in about 12 minutes. Judge Bigpitcher, where America is right
[2:47:56.440 --> 2:48:03.240]  now, I asked you earlier, the Trump raid, where you think all this is going, what is your view on that?
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:10.200]  Our first Alex, some breaking news on the Trump aid. Federal Judge Bruce Reinhardt, that's the
[2:48:10.760 --> 2:48:16.200]  federal judge in Florida who signed the search warrant, just ruled that a redacted
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:25.000]  version of the affidavit submitted by FBI agents will be released. They just had two hours worth
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  of oral argument to Judge Reinhardt's courtroom and much to everybody's surprise,
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:34.600]  he's going to release a redacted version. What does that mean? That means that the DOJ has until
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:45.720]  a week from today to black out the portions of the affidavit that they believe would reveal the
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:50.520]  identity of their witnesses and their sources. Remember, there's an undercover source here,
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:55.880]  there's either an undercover FBI agent that works at Mar-a-Lago and Trump's people don't know it,
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:01.560]  or there's somebody in Trump's employee at Mar-a-Lago who's been speaking to the FBI and
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:08.120]  Trump's people don't know it. So all identifying materials will be blacked out. In my opinion,
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:15.320]  when the government does this, the affidavit release is meaningless because all proper names
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:22.440]  will be blacked out and there'll be very, very little there to go. Somebody like IAM who signed
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:28.600]  hundreds of these and looked at hundreds of them could probably figure out a lot of what's under
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:35.400]  the blacking out but not the proper names. So this is a partial victory for the media. This was
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:40.840]  not requested by Trump's lawyers, he doesn't have lawyers in the case yet. It was requested by all
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:47.400]  the major media outlets. So everybody's going to be waiting for beta breath until next Thursday
[2:49:47.400 --> 2:49:53.320]  to see what parts of the affidavit the judge releases. At this point, it's the judge versus
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:50:03.400]  the DOJ. It's not the DOJ versus the media. The judge and the DOJ will hassle and haggle
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:08.040]  over what's going to be redacted and what's not. Ultimately, of course, the judge will prevail.
[2:50:08.040 --> 2:50:16.120]  Remember how this started? The FBI presented an affidavit to Judge Reinhardt demonstrating that
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:21.240]  it is more likely than not that a crime was committed and it is more likely than not that
[2:50:21.240 --> 2:50:26.760]  there's evidence of that crime in Trump's home. Whatever was in the affidavit supplemented by
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:33.160]  the Q&A, the question and answer that the judge himself put to the FBI agent, which was stenographically
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:39.640]  recorded, persuaded the judge to agree with the DOJ that a crime was committed and inside Trump's
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:45.800]  house was evidence of the crime. All of that is laid out in great detail, not only what the FBI
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:51.960]  knew, but how it knew it. How did the FBI know there were top secret materials inside his safe?
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:57.480]  Some human being that the FBI demonstrated was reliable must have told them that.
[2:50:58.040 --> 2:51:03.000]  Sure, but under federal law, if you've got 30 million documents over at
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:07.240]  Obama's house and a president can supposedly classify whatever they want,
[2:51:07.240 --> 2:51:11.320]  and Trump was in negotiations with the National Archives, this whole thing seems like a red herring
[2:51:11.320 --> 2:51:19.720]  to me. This whole thing is the security state, sometimes called the deep state, continuing
[2:51:19.720 --> 2:51:24.200]  to go after Trump. Look, Trump was the head of the executive branch for four years. He knows
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:29.800]  what the federal government is like. He knows what federal law enforcement and federal intel
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:36.520]  community did to him in those four years. Unfortunately, in those four years, he reauthorized them
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:41.720]  against the advice of the person speaking to you right now, Alex. He and I talked about this.
[2:51:41.720 --> 2:51:47.640]  Mr. President, don't sign that legislation. This is the very same authority under which they spied
[2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:53.560]  on you back when you were candidate Trump. Nevertheless, he signed that stuff and he increased
[2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:58.680]  their budgets, and it's now coming back to bite him. I don't know what's in Obama's home,
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:04.120]  the National Archives says they have everything they want, but let's face it, they're after Trump
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:10.280]  because they hate him, and if he had top secret materials in there, those things that he declassified,
[2:52:10.280 --> 2:52:17.080]  you ready for this, Alex? Joe Biden could have re-classified them as top secret without Trump
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:23.400]  even knowing about it, thereby making their possession another crime on top of the one
[2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:31.320]  with Trump. So let me ask you this. What do you predict for the Democrats? They're so desperate,
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:33.160]  everybody's turning against them. What do you think is going to happen?
[2:52:34.920 --> 2:52:39.800]  You and I have rejoiced over the Supreme Court opinion on abortion and the right to carry.
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:45.240]  I think those opinions can be used against Republicans in favor of the Democrats. I think
[2:52:45.240 --> 2:52:52.440]  the Democrats are going to do better in 2022 than they thought they were. The $750 billion spending
[2:52:52.440 --> 2:52:56.200]  bill is just crowing rights. It's going to make everything worse. You can't spend your way out
[2:52:56.200 --> 2:53:02.360]  of inflation. You can only save your way, spend less or reduce inflation. I mean,
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:07.960]  spending your way out of inflation is like putting a fire out with gasoline. It's absurd.
[2:53:07.960 --> 2:53:13.000]  So I don't think that is going to affect the voters in any positive way. It will give the
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:20.360]  Dems crowing rights because of its socialistic aspects, which puts a cap on certain drug prices
[2:53:20.360 --> 2:53:26.120]  and things of that nature. So separately, what do you make of Liz Cheney believing she would win,
[2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:29.400]  losing by 30 plus points, saying she's going to run for president?
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:40.600]  Delusional. Delusional. That neocon mentality that was manifested by George W. and by her father
[2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:45.000]  isn't even embraced by the Republican Party anymore. I mean, there's a couple of neocons left.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:51.160]  But she's one of them. I think she demonstrated a lot of courage on the January 6th committee,
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:54.760]  but she does not have her finger on the pulse of the Republican Party.
[2:53:56.680 --> 2:54:05.720]  How could the political establishment be so blind with the FBI raids on FBI events at school
[2:54:05.720 --> 2:54:11.480]  meetings and open borders? I mean, if I was a Democratic Party and I wanted to commit suicide
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:19.640]  Judge Napolitano, I would do what they're doing. I think you're right. I think they are fearful of
[2:54:19.640 --> 2:54:27.720]  the hard left. They're fearful of AOC and her crew and all the progressives all over the country,
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:34.280]  the mayor of Chicago, former federal prosecutor, arguably the most dangerous city in the country
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:42.040]  because she won't let the police do their jobs. Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi are afraid that by
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:49.000]  losing the base that those people represent, they will lose their majority. So they're basically
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:57.720]  going to push guns, abortion and fear of Trump's return as their three issues.
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:03.880]  Well, that was my last question. Where are you on Trump versus DeSantis? What do you think of
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:14.280]  both men? Well, I think DeSantis would be the better candidate because he's Trump.
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:22.600]  He's Trump in a bad suit. He doesn't dress as well as Trump. He's also Trump without the
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:27.240]  personality, baggage and character flaws. I know I'm going to hear about this.
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:31.480]  Trump's been my friend for 35 years. I'm only an acquaintance of Governor DeSantis.
[2:55:31.480 --> 2:55:35.480]  Right now, I think he's the stronger candidate. I might feel differently in a year.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.800]  I mean, I think DeSantis is stronger and I'm not on some
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:44.920]  junket here for Trump or DeSantis. I'm not connecting either one of them. I just think
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:49.480]  DeSantis seems more reasonable, more less polarizing.
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:57.320]  Yes. Yes. And we're appealing to independents and Democrats. You know, Trump can have 80%,
[2:55:57.320 --> 2:56:03.080]  90% of the Republican Party. That's not even half of what he needs to get elected.
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:08.520]  He's got to appeal to Democrats and independents and DeSantis does that far better.
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:13.240]  You know, we'll know in early November, DeSantis is going to be reelected.
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:17.160]  It needs to be a landslide and my guess is it will be.
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:22.920]  All right, Judge Napolitano, JudgeNap.com, Judging Freedoms, the podcast.
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:26.760]  Judge Andrew Napolitano on YouTube. Thank you so much. Amazing hour, sir.
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:32.040]  One last thing. If I could, Judging Freedom in 15 minutes at 315 Eastern,
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:35.480]  a great military mind, Colonel Doug McGregor,
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:39.720]  about how wrong we are to be physically present in Ukraine.
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:43.320]  I want to hear about that. Join us again, sir. Thank you.
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:45.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:48.760]  All right. Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.

[3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:26.200]  studios in the united kingdom. You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:37.640]  It is the 18th of August 2022 at the summit news hour. Absolute raft deluge of news or is
[3:00:37.640 --> 3:00:43.880]  to get through over the course of the next hour. Let's give you a little smorgasbord of what we've
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:50.200]  got coming up over the space of the next 60 minutes. Well in London, a city that I moved
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:57.320]  out of about six months ago, get out of the big cities. We've had six murders in the space of four
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:01:03.560]  days. A couple of days ago, there was an 87 year old pensioner, apparently a pillar of the community
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:11.160]  who was suddenly stabbed to death, hacked to death on the street in broad daylight in west
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:17.480]  London. This was a guy who collected the charity. His neighbors said he was the top guy. They released
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:23.480]  the identity of the suspect last night, and thankfully he has now been caught. Of course,
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:29.240]  when they released the identity of the suspect, BBC News described not the color of his skin,
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:34.680]  not what he actually looked like, but the color of the clothes he was wearing when he murdered
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:40.040]  the 87 year old man. That was really helpful. But then a twist in the story today, which I'm
[3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:45.480]  going to get into in the next segment, is London mass at eat corn has cracked the case.
[3:01:45.480 --> 3:01:50.520]  He knows the motivation behind this brutal stabbing, and we're going to tell you what that
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:58.040]  motivation is. Meanwhile, Monkeypox is still raging in more ways than one, but gay pride
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:04.280]  parades for one at gay saunas, gay bathhouses. And also in the news, we've had a man who basically
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:09.560]  he's nose rotted because he caught Monkeypox. He caught a couple of other things as well,
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:14.280]  which he failed to tell the doctors about at first. So we're going to get into that. We're going to
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:20.200]  get into NBC News reporting that they're now saying that it's not just close contact that's
[3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:27.320]  fueling the spread of Monkeypox. It's sex between men. We already knew that basically 98% of cases
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:34.920]  were gay men who have had sex with other men. Also, though, we've had a new case of a dog being
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:42.600]  infected with Monkeypox, a dog that apparently shared a bed with a gay couple in Paris, just
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:48.600]  shared a bed, though. I mean, the fact that it had, quote, anal ulcerations is nothing to do with it,
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:54.680]  just shared a bed. And then of course, we asked the question, why have nine children tested
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:03:00.680]  positive for Monkeypox in the United States if it almost exclusively spreads between gay men?
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:07.960]  And why are they not being investigated by child protective services? Meanwhile, back in the UK,
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:13.720]  we have a riot at a hotel. Of course, I've spoke about this many times before. The UK government
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:20.760]  is spending £5 million of taxpayer money every single day on housing illegal immigrants who get
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:26.360]  here in dinghies from France waving around iPhones complaining about the spotty Wi-Fi service,
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:30.520]  putting them up in hotels. Well, apparently, that's not now good enough for the
[3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:37.400]  war-torn refugees who are demanding that they get sent to better cities with better hotel
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:43.160]  facilities. Yes, that's not good enough for them. Three big incidents in France, once again,
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:48.760]  proving that diversity is a strength, including an American tourist who was raped in a toilet.
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:53.000]  Again, that's basically got no headlines whatsoever, either in Europe or the United
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:59.160]  States. We also have the winter of discontent, of course, coming with the energy crisis and the
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:06.040]  cost of living riots, which more and more experts are predicting, both in Germany and in the United
[3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  Kingdom. We had an alarming prediction the other day from a top official in Germany about what is
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:17.000]  about to happen on that front. And the people potentially behind the unrest are at least behind
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:24.680]  the protests once their bills triple quadruple, now being demonized as domestic extremists by people
[3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:31.000]  within the German government. We're also going to get into an absolutely bizarre clip, which is
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:36.760]  based on a new book by an author who says he's very concerned about the spread of racism.
[3:04:36.760 --> 3:04:42.680]  And the plotline for this novel, this work of fiction, is white people completely disappearing
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:48.520]  off the face of the earth, and that being a benefit for society. Yes, this is an anti-racism
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:55.960]  message, apparently. Summit.News will be back. I'm going to go away.
[3:05:35.720 --> 3:05:42.120]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering bodies ultimate tumor formula

[3:05:54.920 --> 3:06:10.760]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:20.200]  While some are predicting a summer of rage in the major cities in Europe as a result of the cost
[3:06:20.200 --> 3:06:26.600]  of living crisis, but we're already seeing murderous rage on the streets of London over the
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:33.320]  course of the past week, with six deaths in the space of four days, six murders, the most high
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:40.120]  profile being this 87-year-old pensioner, headlined here out of BBC News, Greenford mobility scooter
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:46.040]  killing, man arrested over stabbing, man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the stabbing
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:53.240]  of a grandfather on a mobility scooter in West London. 87-year-old Thomas O'Halloran, apparently
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:57.880]  again, as I said before, the breaker pillar of the community raised money for charity on the regular,
[3:06:58.760 --> 3:07:05.960]  knifed to death in broad daylight in Greenford, West London at four in the afternoon on Tuesday.
[3:07:06.920 --> 3:07:12.760]  Now they arrested the man the next day. The police put out the call for people to identify him on
[3:07:12.760 --> 3:07:18.440]  social media. Quite rare for the Met Police because they're normally too busy devoting their resources
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:24.120]  to have their officers dance at gay pride parades and handcuff people, arrest people for mean tweets.
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:29.560]  But thankfully, the Metropolitan Police did actually put out a picture of the culprit who
[3:07:29.560 --> 3:07:36.760]  is now being arrested. Problem with it being that when the BBC reported this, the big basically
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:42.600]  state broadcaster in the United Kingdom, for hours on end after the police released the image
[3:07:42.600 --> 3:07:49.320]  of this suspect, now only did the BBC not include the picture of the murderer at the top of the news
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:07:55.880]  story or indeed anywhere in the news story. This is the description that they publish of
[3:07:55.880 --> 3:08:02.920]  the perpetrator after this brutal murder. Quote, he is described as wearing grey shorts,
[3:08:02.920 --> 3:08:09.160]  a dark coloured t-shirt, a white baseball cap and white patterned builder style gloves.
[3:08:09.160 --> 3:08:17.240]  Now bear in mind, this culprit knifed an 87 year old man to death. The picture of him released by
[3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:23.160]  the police shows the blood still on his gloves. Are we supposed to believe that he didn't change
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:29.880]  his frigging clothing in the 24 hours, the 48 hours after that? Why are they telling us the colour
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:36.200]  of his clothes, which is obviously going to change, and not the colour of his skin? Not his
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:43.000]  description in general, his ethnicity. They completely left it out of the report. Thankfully,
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.120]  he's now being arrested, no thanks to the BBC. But again, they literally told us what colour
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:53.320]  his gloves were that used to carry out the murder with blood stains on them, like he'd still be
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:09:01.640]  wearing them the next frigging day. Absolutely incredible. Again, one of six murders in the
[3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:08.040]  past four days in London, I'm sure the Metropolitan Police have all their resources devoted to it,
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:15.000]  and they're not too busy dancing at gay pride parades, and filing a non-hate crime incident
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:20.360]  for mean tweets, which we've seen many times before, 3,000 Brits arrested a year for mean tweets.
[3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:26.680]  But then we had the intervention of the much-vaunted Mayor of London, Mr. Part and Parcel,
[3:09:26.680 --> 3:09:34.520]  Sadiq Khan, who apparently has now cracked the case. He's figured out why this spate of murders
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:42.760]  is happening over the past week in London. Headline here out of LBC. Sadiq Khan blames
[3:09:42.760 --> 3:09:50.600]  London's rise in violent crime on Wait For It. Longer days, school holidays, and the heat wave.
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:57.160]  Yes, that's what he actually said. Quote, I'm afraid this summer we are seeing what we feared,
[3:09:57.160 --> 3:10:01.320]  which is an increase in violent crime. There are longer daylight hours,
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:08.040]  school holidays, a heat wave, and so forth. Bear in mind this was a press conference
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:15.160]  given in specific relation to the murder of the 87-year-old man on the mobility scooter.
[3:10:15.160 --> 3:10:22.920]  He literally blamed school holidays for this murder carried out by a 44-year-old man.
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:27.560]  Of course, it's the school holidays. He blamed the hot summer weather.
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:34.040]  It wasn't even hot on Tuesday. In fact, it's been cold the entire week throughout the country.
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:41.480]  He blamed the summer heat wave. The heat wave ended last week. I don't even know why I'm just
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:47.480]  defying this by saying the heat wave ended last week, but it did anyway. Again, he blamed the
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:52.440]  fact that the sun comes up a bit earlier and goes down a bit later at this time of year.
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:59.880]  That's apparently the motivation behind all these murders. Of course, the sun changes in
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:04.120]  August. They actually get shorter days in August, as we know, compared to June-July.
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:10.120]  But maybe that's part of it. Maybe that was his motivation. He was angered at the school holidays,
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:15.800]  maybe too many kids running around, places too busy. Maybe that motivated the murder.
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:21.880]  He was angered. He was flustered. He was irritated at the hot weather, the heat wave, despite the
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:26.680]  fact that it wasn't hot. He was angered about the fact that it's too bright in the morning.
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:34.200]  Case closed. Sadiq Korn, hot on the trail of the motivation behind the murder. Thanks for that,
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:41.400]  Sadiq. And of course, he failed to even address this horrific situation for hours on end on social
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:49.160]  media. He was too busy tweeting about hose pipe bans in the United Kingdom and sharing his opinion
[3:11:49.160 --> 3:11:54.520]  on the American Inflation Reduction Act. Yes, he was actually talking about that.
[3:11:55.960 --> 3:12:01.080]  Let's go to monkeypox now, though, because this continues to rage in more ways than one.
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:04.520]  Go to this video first, and then I'm going to come back and talk about the
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:11.080]  recent revelation about what is actually spreading monkeypox. This video is called
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:14.280]  Man's Nose Rots Due to Monkeypox. Here's the clip.
[3:12:15.640 --> 3:12:22.600]  One of the most shocking monkeypox cases so far. 40-year-old German man's nose is literally rotting.
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:27.560]  After the man visited a doctor, he was initially told the spot on his nose was just sunburned.
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:33.160]  Yeah, that ain't it, chief. This is what his nose looks like now. Factor 50 wouldn't have done much
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:38.600]  to stop that, would it? The medical journal Infection reports that the man's nose started to turn
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:43.640]  black. He then developed pus-filled sores all over his body, which were particularly severe around
[3:12:43.640 --> 3:12:48.200]  his penis and mouth. The unnamed man was then tested for monkeypox and given antivirals to
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:52.840]  combat the virus. While at the hospital, he was also tested for various sexually transmitted
[3:12:52.840 --> 3:12:58.360]  illnesses for the first time he told doctors, which revealed he also had undiagnosed syphilis in
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:03.640]  HIV. Lovely stuff. His syphilis had gone so long and detected that it spread to multiple organs.
[3:13:03.640 --> 3:13:09.000]  Meanwhile, tests confirmed that his HIV infection had developed into AIDS. Turns out the HIV had
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:14.920]  completely shut down his body's immune response, causing his nose to undergo necrosis, the death
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:21.560]  of body tissue. Given that 98% of monkeypox cases are amongst gay men, and the early major
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:27.080]  monkeypox outbreaks were traced back to a gay sauna in Spain and a fetish festival in Belgium,
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:32.760]  did he at any point consider stopping having sex with gay men? Doesn't look like it. Earlier this
[3:13:32.760 --> 3:13:37.880]  week, we learned of the first ever dog to be infected with monkeypox. The dog caught the virus
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:43.480]  after, quote, sharing a bed with a gay couple in Paris and subsequently being found suffering from a,
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:50.600]  quote, anal ulceration. Just sharing a bed, eh? Okay. At first, the WHO said summer festivals
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:55.320]  should be limited to stop the spread of monkeypox, but then immediately clarified this didn't apply
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:59.800]  to gay pride festivals, which should go full steam ahead. But hey, while we were all under de facto
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:04.680]  house arrest at the height of COVID, prevented from attending family funerals, prevented from
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:11.080]  traveling, working, walking our dogs, hundreds of thousands of BLM protesters were given the
[3:14:11.080 --> 3:14:17.320]  green light to congregate in huge numbers in major cities. So don't expect to see many gay pride
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:25.080]  marches being canceled in the near future. Now bear in mind the first monkeypox patient
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:30.520]  to go public a couple of months ago, the first Brit at least to go public gave an interview
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:37.880]  saying how he caught the virus after having sex with around 10 new partners in the space of one
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:47.400]  holiday in Dubai. This German man with his nose rotted off had HIV, syphilis and monkeypox,
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:54.040]  and he continued having sex with gay men. What a great lifestyle, especially to promote to children.
[3:14:54.040 --> 3:15:01.400]  That's a really healthy lifestyle to promote to kids, isn't it? Meanwhile, NBC News reports sex
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:07.800]  between men not skin contact is fueling monkeypox, which is quite interesting because as I mentioned,
[3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:13.560]  in the video, we had the first dog that was diagnosed with monkeypox. They traced the
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:21.080]  exact strain of the virus, its exact genetic identity to its owners. A man aged 44 and his
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:27.080]  partner aged 27, who had also of course developed monkeypox. Now they're saying that it can't
[3:15:27.080 --> 3:15:31.880]  just be spreading close proximity. They're now saying that's incredibly rare. They're saying,
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:38.120]  basically, you can only spread it by having sex with people. And this dog's being infected,
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:45.800]  it has anal ulcerations after, quote, sharing a bed of the media called it with this gay couple.
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:51.240]  It didn't just share a bed, they shagged the dog. Let's be honest, can we be explicit about this?
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:55.640]  And I'm going to come back and talk about how this gets even sicker after the break, don't go away.
[3:15:55.640 --> 3:16:03.800]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:08.600]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better
[3:16:08.600 --> 3:16:13.080]  place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:17.800]  perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really that does it
[3:16:17.800 --> 3:16:22.360]  like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he

[3:16:54.760 --> 3:17:02.200]  I go and see him quite often now. DNA Force Plus, after almost a year of being out of stock,

[3:20:23.240 --> 3:20:30.440]  So the first monkeypox patients to go public continued having sex with gay men on his holiday in
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:38.360]  Dubai despite being infected with the virus. The man in Germany who was infected with HIV,
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:45.560]  syphilis and monkeypox to the point where his nose was rotting off continued to have sex with gay
[3:20:45.560 --> 3:20:52.040]  men and spread the virus. Wiener, the state senator in California, the same guy who said you
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:57.720]  should stop at home and not attend your own family's funeral. He says that despite the health
[3:20:57.720 --> 3:21:02.840]  emergency declared there, gay men should continue to engage in sex party orgies.
[3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:08.600]  Despite declaring a public health emergency in San Francisco, authorities there have told gay men
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:16.120]  that they should still participate in gay orgies. The first dog infected with monkeypox
[3:21:16.920 --> 3:21:21.880]  was, fell victim to that virus after, quote, sharing a bed with a gay couple.
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:29.240]  It had anal ulcerations. NBC News reports that sex between men, not skin contact,
[3:21:29.240 --> 3:21:31.880]  is fueling the monkeypox spread.
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:40.360]  Is that a healthy lifestyle to promote to children? I would suggest not. Given the
[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:46.920]  proclivities of this lifestyle, given that even being infected with up to three viruses at one
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:54.040]  time, they still continue that behavior, I would suggest that maybe exposing children to drag queens
[3:21:54.040 --> 3:21:59.400]  and this kind of lifestyle, this LGBT movement probably isn't the best idea. Let's just put
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:05.000]  it that way. Information liberation reports, NBC News reports sex between men, not skin contact,
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:11.400]  is fueling monkeypox. Since the onset of the monkeypox outbreak in May, public health and
[3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:15.480]  infectious disease experts have told the public that the virus is largely transmitted through
[3:22:15.480 --> 3:22:21.720]  skin to skin contact. But again, the WHO, of course, came out and said three months ago,
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:26.440]  maybe we should start to look at cancelling summer festivals and within about two days,
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:33.560]  they said, oh, but not gay pride parades. No, no, no, no, no, no. Again, in this country,
[3:22:33.560 --> 3:22:39.720]  we literally had drones patrolling the skies, watching for people walking their dogs outside.
[3:22:39.720 --> 3:22:45.800]  But if you wanted to go into central London with 20,000 other people and attend a Black Lives Matter
[3:22:45.800 --> 3:22:53.800]  rally, go right ahead. So again, the gay pride parades are going ahead. The multiple sex partners
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:57.800]  are going ahead. They're literally telling gay people to continue attending gay orgies,
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:05.240]  despite now saying that it's sex in the vast majority of cases that transmits this virus and
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:11.000]  not just close contact or not even close contact at all. It's specifically sex.
[3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:17.320]  Now a dog's got it. Gee, I wonder what happened there. What's even more concerning is this,
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:27.640]  ABC News, ninth child in US tests positive for monkeypox. A child in Oregon has tested positive
[3:23:27.640 --> 3:23:33.240]  for monkeypox state health officials announced Wednesday, marking the ninth reported pediatric
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:38.760]  case in the US. It says we have a known connection to a previously diagnosed case.
[3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:46.040]  This child did not get the virus at school, childcare or another community setting. Right.
[3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:52.760]  Okay. So monkeypox is only spreading from anal sex. Basically, they're now telling us
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:56.440]  nine children are infected with it. And these health officials are saying
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:24:03.320]  children didn't get it at school, childcare or another community setting. Gee, I wonder where
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:09.640]  they got it from then. Can you take a wild guess? And why aren't child protective services
[3:24:09.640 --> 3:24:18.520]  cracking down hard? American Hospital Association reports FDA does not recommend screening blood
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:23.720]  donors for monkeypox. Food and Drug Administration said it does not recommend screening or testing
[3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:29.560]  blood donors for the monkeypox virus, given the robustness of existing safeguards for blood safety.
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:35.080]  Apparently that might be homophobic. So maybe if you live in Germany, you may get a blood
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:42.120]  transfusion from this guy who had HIV, syphilis and monkeypox to the point where his nose rotted off.
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:47.880]  You may get his blood in a transfusion. Well, that's okay, because even questioning that
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:55.320]  might be homophobic. Valiant news reports abstaining from gay sex, not a realistic option
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:25:02.120]  for monkeypox. That's Duke University Nursing Dean, Vincent Guillermo Ramos,
[3:25:02.120 --> 3:25:07.240]  Dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, argued that telling gay men to abstain from sex
[3:25:07.240 --> 3:25:13.720]  was not a realistic option for preventing monkeypox. And again, just like telling Black Lives Matter
[3:25:13.720 --> 3:25:20.280]  protesters to abstain from congregating in numbers of hundreds of thousands in major cities at the
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:26.360]  height of the first COVID outbreak, that apparently wasn't a realistic option either because systemic
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:33.800]  racism is more of a threat than COVID. Meanwhile, here in the UK, and we're going to go to this video
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:40.920]  now, it's called No Good Deed Goes Unpunished. Migrants arriving on boats from France with iPhones
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:46.840]  are now complaining about the hotel accommodation and the free cash that they're being given by our
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:53.000]  government. Here's the clip. I'm sure Britain's 230,000 homeless people, many of whom are forced
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:58.920]  to sleep cold on the streets, would be absolutely delighted if they were offered a free long-term
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:04.040]  hotel room. But apparently that's just not good enough for many of the illegal immigrants who
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:10.600]  are being handed the same taxpayer-funded freebie by our government. Refugees staged a rooftop
[3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:17.720]  protest at the Milton Hilltop Hotel in Carlisle. They also smashed windows of nearby buildings.
[3:26:17.720 --> 3:26:21.560]  And despite the Home Office pointing out that they were free to come and go as they please,
[3:26:21.560 --> 3:26:26.440]  the migrants claimed they were being treated like prisoners. Prisoners with access to a large
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:31.480]  swimming pool and comfortable double beds. The actual reason for the protest was revealed in
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:36.680]  an interview with one of the migrants. Whoa, it's all about wanting to change the hotel that we're
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:41.480]  staying at. We want the government to send us to another city. It doesn't matter what city it is,
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:46.280]  just anywhere else. We've all just got so much depression and anxiety from staying here. Right,
[3:26:46.280 --> 3:26:51.800]  so in other words, these desperate refugees from war-torn, brutalised countries can't handle
[3:26:51.800 --> 3:26:57.800]  living in a hotel having all their needs catered to in Carlisle. I mean, I know they say it's
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:27:03.080]  grim up north, but it's not that bad. Talk about ungrateful. They don't get to go on their jollies
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:08.440]  in London, so they start rioting. All asylum seekers in hotels are provided with full-board
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:13.800]  accommodation. Three meals a day served as well as all other essentials, including cash payment,
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:19.160]  said the home office. Not good enough. Only a suite at the Ritz and free front-row tickets to
[3:27:19.160 --> 3:27:23.960]  see the Lion King will survive. Another migrant didn't even bother to wait until he arrived at
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:30.040]  his free hotel to show his disdain. Having landed on a small boat from France, the migrant, no doubt
[3:27:30.040 --> 3:27:35.720]  upset at the spotty cell phone service or something, launched a frenzied attack on a coach driver and
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:40.680]  a female border force officer. Border force officers, security guards and drivers fear these
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:45.560]  attacks will escalate and someone will end up dead, one official told a Daily Mail. Everyone who
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:50.520]  works on the south coast knows that this is an absolute nightmare waiting to happen. Last month
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:55.160]  it was revealed that some migrants who arrived in boats were carrying guns and other weapons.
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:59.960]  They weren't even fingerprinted or photographed and just disappeared into the population. We
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.800]  saw how the Paris culprit slipped into Europe via the refugee red carpet. It could happen here,
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:11.000]  and the government just keeps inviting them in, providing a free taxi service and then free hotel
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:17.720]  rooms that are cost of £5 million a day. Over 20,000 migrants have arrived in small boats so far
[3:28:17.720 --> 3:28:22.520]  this year, already surpassing the number who had arrived at the same point last year. Meanwhile,
[3:28:22.520 --> 3:28:28.920]  the media continues to call them refugees, despite four out of ten being from Albania,
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:34.120]  which is at peace, and many others from countries like Iran and elsewhere that aren't at war. They
[3:28:34.120 --> 3:28:41.240]  get here, they get free hotel accommodation, free food, free cash, and they still whine and complain
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:47.880]  about it. Now, when we come back on the other side, we're going to talk about alarming predictions
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:29:04.680]  of our energy riots in Europe this winter. Summit.News will be back. Go away.
[3:29:18.680 --> 3:29:24.600]  And on top of that, this great product funds the Info War, which defends liberty and freedom

[3:30:53.800 --> 3:31:00.120]  we're involved in an epic historic battle. Alex Jones expanded his broadcast by selling a line
[3:31:00.120 --> 3:31:06.040]  of products focused on healing from the toxic world of a corrupt system, which has allowed
[3:31:06.040 --> 3:31:13.320]  info wars to remain a free public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media.
[3:31:13.320 --> 3:31:23.800]  Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative facts. Do you understand what I have said?
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:29.800]  Yes, I believe what I said was true. Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[3:31:29.800 --> 3:31:35.560]  Your beliefs do not make something true. That is, that is what we're doing here.
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:40.600]  There's going to be a large set of planets who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info
[3:31:40.600 --> 3:31:46.440]  wars in the bankruptcy estate. The info wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world

[3:32:54.360 --> 3:33:03.480]  Take action now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:46.200]  We are back and we are not looking forward to a winter of discontent in Europe in relation
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:51.960]  to energy costs, the cost of living crisis, inflation, of course, many of these European
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:59.160]  countries in addition to supporting the current thing and prolonging that war at the expense of
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:06.600]  their own people entering poverty. They've also pursued disastrous green energy policies that
[3:34:06.600 --> 3:34:12.920]  have left them completely dependent on Russian gas, for example, which is now being cut off.
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:20.120]  Headline here out of Breitbart, Sweden electricity prices up 400% from 2021. They're talking about
[3:34:20.120 --> 3:34:27.560]  at least triple percentage rises in the United Kingdom, your gas electricity bill tripling
[3:34:27.560 --> 3:34:33.080]  over the course of the next three months. Swedish electricity prices have increased 400%
[3:34:33.080 --> 3:34:38.440]  since last year, but at least they got to fly their little Ukrainian flags and smell feel smug
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:45.000]  about themselves. Germany could face power grid collapse due to soaring demand for electric heaters.
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:49.880]  We've been hot on this subject for several months now. Of course, a couple of months ago,
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:56.440]  we had Germans panic buying firewood and stoves because they fear their energy,
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:02.360]  their gas being cut off in the winter. Of course, we now have landlord associations telling Germans
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:08.360]  because they've all installed smart meters that their thermostat will be remotely controlled
[3:35:08.360 --> 3:35:15.400]  and they won't be able to be put it above 19 degrees Celsius in winter. Of course, we've seen
[3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:21.080]  that in other countries as well. We've seen Italy impose similar measures. We've seen Spain say
[3:35:21.080 --> 3:35:28.280]  that they won't be able to have their thermostats below 27 degrees in summer in anticipation of
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:33.480]  these massive energy shortages. Well, now Germany could be facing blackouts and the collapse of
[3:35:33.480 --> 3:35:39.240]  the power grid this winter after citizens began panic buying electric heaters over fears of gas
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:47.560]  supplies being cut off. However, Peter Lauts, the boss of Stadworx, Weasbar and Net's utility
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:52.840]  company told public broadcaster ZDF that this would place a massive strain on the country's
[3:35:52.840 --> 3:35:58.840]  energy grid. So he's saying that because these electric heaters use between 1000 and 3000 watts
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:04.280]  of energy, that is going to crash the power grid in Germany, especially if they all switch them
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:10.120]  on at the same time when it gets cold in winter, which it despite global warming inevitably will,
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:19.320]  they've got 600,000 electric heaters Germans did in the first half of 2022 alone. That's a 35%
[3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:25.720]  increase on normal numbers. And again, that's only going to increase as we head into autumn and winter.
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:31.560]  He said blackouts would not just hit private households, but also affect German infrastructure
[3:36:31.560 --> 3:36:38.120]  including cash payment systems, mobile phone networks and street lighting. The solution is
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:42.840]  apparently to switch to smart meters, which can again be remotely controlled to prevent a collapse
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:50.200]  of the power grid. They're talking about creating warm up spaces in major cities, repurposing sports
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:56.440]  arenas and exhibition halls to have people congregate and gather because they can't afford to pay their
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:01.960]  heating bills. And they're just going to get turned off. Let's go to this video now because
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:06.920]  another official in Germany is predicting the response to this, which in his words will be
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:13.320]  riots on a scale that they haven't seen in potentially a generation. This video is called
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:19.160]  an alarming prediction. Let's roll it. Well, I hope you're preparing for what's coming this winter
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:24.280]  because it's getting grimmer by the day. We're not just talking about energy price hikes. We're not
[3:37:24.280 --> 3:37:29.000]  just talking about people's bills getting more expensive. We're talking about the power being
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:35.320]  turned off completely. For God knows how long. Even the New York Times is talking about a physical
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:40.440]  absence of energy for Europe this winter. I don't think many Americans appreciate just how tense
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:45.240]  and tenuous, how very touch and go the energy situation in Europe is right now, wrote David
[3:37:45.240 --> 3:37:51.000]  Wallace Wells. In recent weeks, the prospects have begun to look darker. Dr. Tatiana Mitrova
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:56.840]  states it even more starkly. She says it's, quote, wartime. There is something that European
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:01.560]  politicians and consumers didn't want to admit for quite a long time. It sounds terrible, but
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:06.440]  that's the reality. In wartime, the economy is mobilized. The decisions are made by the government,
[3:38:06.440 --> 3:38:11.880]  not the free market. This is the case for Europe this winter. And German official Stephen Kramer
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:17.640]  just made an alarming prediction. He says that energy rationing and gas shortages in Europe
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:24.120]  will lead to mass protests and riots. According to Kramer, the unrest will make the anti-lockdown
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:30.920]  demonstrations look like, quote, a children's birthday party in comparison to what is coming.
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:35.080]  If the crisis scenario is described at the beginning of the energy crisis, supply crisis,
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:39.320]  economic crisis, worldwide famine with the subsequent migration crisis and the possible
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:44.040]  expansion of the Ukraine war continue to escalate almost simultaneously, then we will have to deal
[3:38:44.040 --> 3:38:49.400]  with the high probability of a situation that threatens the existence of larger parts, especially
[3:38:49.400 --> 3:38:55.640]  the stability and committal class in our society. Germany is, of course, completely dependent on
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:01.320]  Russian energy. Before the war began, Germany imported 55% of its gas from Russia along with a
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:07.560]  third of its oil and 45% of its coal. Now Germans are being told their thermostats will be remote
[3:39:07.560 --> 3:39:13.080]  controlled and they're telling them not to shower and not to drive their own cars as they prepare
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:18.360]  to inflict energy rationing on the population. And they can blame Vladimir Putin until the
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:23.960]  cows come home. But NATO is equally to blame for creating the conditions that led to the
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:29.160]  invasion of Ukraine. Western governments and the media are to blame for pushing and implementing
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:35.000]  disastrous green energy policies, renewable resources which are pathetically incapable
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:40.600]  of filling the gap left by coal and nuclear plants, which are being shut down by our government's
[3:39:40.600 --> 3:39:45.880]  left, right and centre. They've left us desperately dependent on an industry that isn't fit for
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:51.800]  purpose. Our living standards, our quality of life is being deliberately dismantled in the name
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:57.880]  of supporting the current thing. And it will almost certainly lead to this winter, people
[3:39:57.880 --> 3:40:03.240]  freezing to death, while many go hungry and others take their anger to the streets.
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:10.600]  So we've got all this legitimate concern amongst Germans about the fact that their
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:16.520]  gas, their electricity is going to be cut off by the authorities, by the energy companies.
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:20.520]  This winter, because Russia is going to use that weapon against them because they support
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:27.160]  the current thing too hard, genuine concerns of people with genuine worries about entering
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:33.720]  into literal poverty, fuel poverty, as a result of these blackouts and soaring energy bills.
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:39.240]  But how have authorities in Germany responded to that genuine concern?
[3:40:40.280 --> 3:40:45.480]  Well, by labelling these people as domestic extremists, Germany could face power grid
[3:40:45.480 --> 3:40:50.280]  collapse due to soaring demand for electric heaters, again emphasizing that it is a genuine concern.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  They're being told to wear warmer sweaters, they're being told to take fewer showers,
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:41:01.080]  they're being told not to drive their cars, legitimate worries, and yet German official
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:08.040]  trashers cost of living protesters as, quote, enemies of the state. He says they're extremists
[3:41:08.040 --> 3:41:13.000]  who want to overthrow the government. This is the interior minister of the German state of
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:18.920]  North Rhine-Westphalia, Herbert Ruhl, who says that anti-mandatory vax and anti-lockdown
[3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:25.400]  demonstrators have found a new cause, the energy crisis. Well, no, it's everybody's cause.
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:29.720]  Doesn't matter where you are on the political spectrum, if you can't pay your gas bill,
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:35.480]  you can't pay your gas bill. And of course, there's a cross section between anti-lockdown
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:42.520]  demonstrators, because that's a huge portion of the population. But with an interview, Ruhl revealed
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:48.280]  that German security services were keeping an eye on, quote, extremists who plan to infiltrate the
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:54.120]  protest. And of course, they're blaming the Telegram Messenger app, because German authorities
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:59.560]  have been trying to ban the Telegram Messenger app, because it's outside of regime control,
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:05.880]  basically, for months and months and months. So a useful scapegoat to wrap it all up in that too.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:11.480]  He said, you can already tell from those who are out there, the protest has no longer talk about
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:18.440]  coronavirus or vaccination. Again, both legitimate concerns as well, if you live in the real world,
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:25.320]  and aren't a regime aparachic. But they're now misusing people's worries and fears in other
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:29.640]  fields. It's almost like something new enemies of the state are establishing themselves again.
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:37.480]  He's openly brazenly demonizing millions of Germans who face the very real threat of
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:44.360]  power grid failures, energy blackouts, entering into fuel poverty, throwing them under a boss,
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:50.200]  and basically saying, no, they're actually all extremists and dangerous conspiracy theories.

[3:45:55.240 --> 3:46:09.240]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase. He's got these rants and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[3:46:09.240 --> 3:46:25.240]  If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there. And if you're a sent a human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[3:46:25.240 --> 3:46:36.240]  Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book.
[3:46:36.240 --> 3:46:46.240]  I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no beetry. You're not going to be flipping pages or you're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlying stuff.

[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:17.240]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:28.240]  We saw another example of white privilege in action this week in America with this headline. Minneapolis Teachers Union demands white teachers get fired first.
[3:47:28.240 --> 3:47:40.240]  Yes, that is their white privilege to be given the boot first because the teachers union has demanded that white teachers be fired first in the event of budget cuts in the name of advancing diversity.
[3:47:40.240 --> 3:48:06.240]  After the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and MPS struck a deal on March 25 when the 14-day teacher strike, the two sides drew up and ratified a new collective bargaining agreement which basically said, if you're a white teacher in that district, despite the fact that non-white teachers are almost exactly represented as to their percentage of demographics in that area per capita,
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:19.240]  the white teachers need to go anyway. Why? Well, because they're white. They have historically oppressed non-white people despite the fact that them and their ancestors weren't even born when they claimed those things happened.
[3:48:19.240 --> 3:48:39.240]  If you're white, it ain't all right and you have to go. Of course, in the United Kingdom over the past few days, we've had a similar controversy with the Navy or the Royal Air Force now saying that they're not going to hire white men. Basically, there's a block on hiring white men because they need to fill diversity quotas.
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:53.240]  Russia and China are, of course, laughing. Another person who has very strong opinions about this, apparently, is an author who is very concerned about the rise of racism, wants to send an anti-racism message,
[3:48:53.240 --> 3:49:08.240]  and has done so by writing a fictional novel in which white people completely vanish from the planet Earth, and it's a good thing. And he's an anti-racist. Let's go to this clip now. This is called, What Did He Say? Let's roll it.
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:14.240]  Author Mosin Hamid says he's concerned about the rise of, you know, overtly racist discourse in many places.
[3:49:14.240 --> 3:49:25.240]  So he's written a novel based on the concept of white people disappearing from the planet altogether. Hmm, strange form of anti-racism there, mate. Hamid's book is called The Last White Man.
[3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:36.240]  And as a white man wakes to find that he has turned a deep and undeniable brow, similar metamorphoses begin to be reported throughout the country, and violence ensues as pale-skinned militants stalk the streets.
[3:49:36.240 --> 3:49:42.240]  After a period of unrest, a kind of calm settles once the majority of the population in The Last White Man has darkened.
[3:49:42.240 --> 3:49:53.240]  At the end of the book, Hamid fast-forwards to a time when whiteness is a distant memory. Hamid said part of the motivation for him writing the book was white people being mean to him after 9-11.
[3:49:53.240 --> 3:49:57.240]  And during an interview with Sky News, the author came out with this perler.
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:10.240]  What other way is there of living? How might that be? What is the, in a sense, racial apocalypse where everybody becomes brown? And maybe that racial apocalypse isn't an apocalypse at all.
[3:50:10.240 --> 3:50:12.240]  Maybe it's the beginning of something, you know, better.
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:27.240]  OK, the world vastly improving off the back of an entire ethnic group being white-tow. What kind of reminds me of a particular word? Can't seem to think of it right now.
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:33.240]  Imagine if a prominent author wrote a book about black and brown people completely vanishing from existence, with white people taking over to dominate global demographics.
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:42.240]  Don't think it'd go down so well, do you? But when it's done in reverse, suddenly the idea becomes a fascinating nuanced philosophical conversation.
[3:50:42.240 --> 3:50:53.240]  I guess public intellectuals being given huge platforms to fantasize how much better the world would be without white people is just another example of this white privilege I keep hearing about.
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:51:06.240]  Now, I want to get to this final video, but let's preface it with this. Of course, we had the raid last week on Trump's mansion in Mar-a-Lago in Florida.
[3:51:06.240 --> 3:51:24.240]  Trump hypes poll showing FBI raid has motivated Republicans to vote. He's highlighted a poll by the Trafalgar group, which found that 83.3% of GOP voters have been made more energized, more motivated to vote in the 2022 midterms,
[3:51:24.240 --> 3:51:38.240]  and generally across the entire spread of Americans, that holds true as well. 76.7% believe that the FBI raid on Trump's private home was conducted by Trump's political enemies.
[3:51:38.240 --> 3:51:47.240]  So this has energized Trump. Of course, many experts now saying that this raid has completely backfired. It will now help Trump's reelection chances.
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:58.240]  But Joe Biden, on the other hand, continues to dissolve into somewhat irrelevance with the Democratic establishment now rejecting him,
[3:51:58.240 --> 3:52:05.240]  hit piece after hit piece in the New York Times, basically saying that they need to get rid of him before the election.
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:18.240]  That's not anyone but Biden. And we had another bill signing this week where Biden engaged in more odd behavior, suggestive of early onset dementia.
[3:52:18.240 --> 3:52:28.240]  And that's what people who have, of course, had family members, I had a family member have said that he's displaying on a daily basis now almost those exact kind of symptoms.
[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:36.240]  This video is called It's Becoming Painfully Obvious. Let's roll it.
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:44.240]  Look, I'm sorry, but it's becoming painfully obvious with each passing day. Dementia is hard enough to cope with when it happens in your own family.
[3:52:44.240 --> 3:52:59.240]  I remember when it happened to my grandma, but this guy is the president of the United States. Take a look.
[3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:07.240]  Let's zoom in and slow it down a bit. I mean, come on, he just looks totally lost. He looks like he's totally forgotten where he is and what he's doing.
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:22.240]  How is Biden even going to be able to cope with the cut and thrust of presidential debates? Two years from now. I mean, Chuck Schumer behaves as if he's Biden's carer or something.
[3:53:22.240 --> 3:53:31.240]  My grandma had Alzheimer's and she had that same confused and lost look. His family should be ashamed of themselves allowing him to live it in front of the cameras and compromising his dignity.
[3:53:31.240 --> 3:53:35.240]  He's almost childlike and the look on his face, there's no engagement. Something is wrong.
[3:53:35.240 --> 3:53:44.240]  Actually, he was very clearly looking to see where Joe Manchin was standing so he could give him the pen without Joe Manchin the bill was dead. Giving him the pen was public acknowledgement of Joe Manchin's contribution.
[3:53:44.240 --> 3:53:53.240]  Yeah, big cope. This isn't an isolated incident, is it? It's a daily occurrence. I just saw this other clip. So Chuck Schumer shakes Biden's hand.
[3:53:53.240 --> 3:54:07.240]  He goes to shake everyone else's hand. Then Biden immediately forgets that he's already shook Schumer's hand and just stands there like a lemon holding his hand out. We're literally at fish level memory here. We're talking mere seconds.
[3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  But don't worry, because according to Snopes, the claim that Biden forgot is unproven.
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:31.240]  You can always rely on the fact checkers to dispute manifestly provable reality, can't you? Before the laughably named Inflation Reduction Act bill signing, Biden was caught in another embarrassing gaff when immediately after removing his face mask, he coughed into his hand.
[3:54:31.240 --> 3:54:49.240]  Well, that was awkward. Maybe the fifth booster shot will sort it out.
[3:54:49.240 --> 3:55:02.240]  Now I want to get to two final news stories here on the censorship front. This one actually emerged two years ago, but it's getting fresh attention on Twitter today going viral.
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:22.240]  100,000 digital first responders to push establishment COVID narrative. Now, of course, we know this has been happening for over a decade. Transnational corporations, oil companies, recruiting, in fact, having whole office rooms devoted to people sitting on social media pushing their narrative all day.
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:41.240]  Apparently when oil companies do it, it's horrible and bad. But when the United Nations, when the World Economic Forum, when Klaus Schwab, when the technocrats do it to push their establishment narrative on COVID, despite the indignities, the inhumanity, the devastation of lockdown that they were behind,
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:53.240]  apparently when they do it, it's perfectly fine. This was revealed by Melissa Fleming, head of global communications for the United Nations in a podcast in October 2020. But again, it's getting fresh attention today.
[3:55:53.240 --> 3:56:12.240]  She said, quote, so far we've recruited 110,000 information volunteers, and we equip these information volunteers with the kind of knowledge about how misinformation spreads and ask them to serve as a kind of digital first responders in those spaces where misinformation travels.
[3:56:12.240 --> 3:56:28.240]  And of course, you've seen those boilerplate responses on Twitter. You've seen it from world leaders when they get infected with COVID for the third time after having been quadruple-vaxxed, and they say, thank God for the vaccine, 100% safe and effective.
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:47.240]  We saw that, of course, during lockdown, with tweet after tweet by these what appear to be bot accounts. Boilerplate, copy and paste, repeating, amplifying the same, now vehemently discredited establishment narratives on lockdown turns out it was part of an astroturf,
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:59.240]  then World Economic Forum campaign. Meanwhile, Facebook fact-check censors factual claim IRS is arming agents to use deadly force. We know that they are arming agents to use deadly force.
[3:56:59.240 --> 3:57:07.240]  They literally put it in a job advertisement where the IRS said, quote, carry a firearm and be willing to use deadly force if necessary.
[3:57:07.240 --> 3:57:17.240]  We also had that screenshot number of screenshots from the 2021 IRS report where they're training agents, armed agents to commit assaults on suburban homes.
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:29.240]  But because apparently somebody said that they're training all IRS agents to be armed and to carry out assaults on suburban homes, that means the entire story is completely false.
[3:57:29.240 --> 3:57:42.240]  And that's now what the fact checkers are saying, the blacklisted to relegate it in the algorithm, doing the same trick again and again, taking it out of context when the actual story is completely factually true.
[3:57:42.240 --> 3:58:07.240]  It's going to wrap it up. War Room is next, summit.news. Don't go away.
