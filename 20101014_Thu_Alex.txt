[00:39.440 --> 00:45.880]  hours plus straight and I want to thank everyone for joining us here today and I
[00:45.880 --> 00:52.600]  want to thank the crew who have done an exemplary job preparing this 24 plus hour
[00:52.600 --> 00:59.400]  marathon transmission we have a special guest joining us today coming up later
[00:59.400 --> 01:04.400]  in the official three-hour broadcast and that of course is Lou Dobbs formerly of
[01:04.400 --> 01:11.080]  CNN syndicated radio broadcaster also coming up at 1 o'clock central Alan
[01:11.080 --> 01:14.960]  Watt who needs no introduction will join us to analyze all of the important news
[01:14.960 --> 01:23.280]  taking place in our world I also have a rundown a little radio TV prison planet
[01:23.280 --> 01:30.800]  TV guide I'm gonna be reading over when we come back from break and I will talk
[01:30.800 --> 01:36.440]  about some of the people that are going to be on the 24 plus hour broadcast today
[01:36.440 --> 01:43.240]  if I'm gonna go over the entire list of who is going to be joining us here just
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.680]  a raft of very informed intelligent folks helping us understand exactly what's
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.400]  happening on our planet something happened this morning and I'm going to
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.360]  attempt to be calm dealing with it but it's just a massive confirmation of
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.000]  everything we've talked about and so after we go to break and I come back and
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.600]  break down the money bomb today I'm going to spend much of this hour covering
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.160]  it I had a chance to basically hear the equivalent of a public focus group this
[02:13.160 --> 02:21.320]  morning I listened to almost an entire hour of it I got up this morning and I
[02:21.320 --> 02:29.000]  noticed that Paul Joseph Watson had written an article and it's very
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.360]  moderate it's a very journalistic I read his article it's actually about 20
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.720]  times worse than what his article even says if you have the full backstory and
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.640]  I know Watson's listening right now I'm gonna have him write another story with
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.440]  all the links just to show people how serious this is because this article is
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.720]  getting a lot of attention today it's government trains troops to run American
[02:50.720 --> 02:56.120]  cities now I discovered 13 years ago there was a covert plan for this it's
[02:56.120 --> 02:59.560]  now declassified in public and because they're getting ready to probably go
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.600]  operational with this they're now unveiling it to the public so we have
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.440]  local newscast covering how this is happening all over the nation but
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.400]  something else then happened of course this ties into the upcoming total
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.720]  financial collapse it's been engineered I turned on one of our local affiliates
[03:16.720 --> 03:22.560]  590 a.m. the big blowtorch formerly owned by President Lyndon Baines Johnson the
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.360]  big blowtorch that covers almost the entire state of Texas and I heard their
[03:27.360 --> 03:37.200]  news program the Todd and Don show Todd was being serious Don was being serious
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.040]  which is a rare thing for him at least for much of the hour reading my article
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.640]  and they actually clicked on the Army Times actually clicked on the local
[03:45.640 --> 03:52.000]  newscast actually read our story on air and it's what happened next it was so
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.240]  amazing they probably took that I heard 30 phone calls and you got a good
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.680]  snapshot of what the American people are going to do as this unfolds I'd say
[04:04.680 --> 04:10.360]  about 70% were against it they were almost all announcing they were former
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.800]  military or police or current all very well-spoken but the other 30% who called
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.200]  in were military and the current military and they all said that and that
[04:21.200 --> 04:25.760]  they are training for this civil unrest and takeover but aren't we happy they're
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.760]  doing it they're gonna save us so so just to just to see our article this
[04:31.760 --> 04:37.360]  morning turn on the radio and it's being covered and to see that about 70% of the
[04:37.360 --> 04:43.040]  callers and that's a dead reckoning but the vast majority were totally freaked
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.880]  out were citing my radio show or the fact that they were police or former
[04:47.880 --> 04:51.000]  military and they'd been trained in this and they thought it was wrong but then
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.920]  you had the military people calling in going well we're just your patriots I
[04:54.920 --> 04:58.560]  mean we're doing a good job we're gonna we're gonna protect you from the civil

[08:59.080 --> 09:04.960]  you here today in fact here in just a few minutes but then I'm going to get
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.560]  into a whole bunch of issues that tie together you know the government has
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.760]  announced that they are going to take over the private pension funds and tax
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.360]  the living daylights out of them in the name of saving private pension funds and
[09:18.360 --> 09:22.800]  government pension funds public and private you know that they are killing
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.240]  the dollar and have announced they're going to hyperinflate it it's now
[09:25.240 --> 09:32.760]  official the dollar is plunging gold is skyrocketing you know that Mexico is in
[09:32.760 --> 09:37.680]  total civil war and unrest and completely collapsing and we had a state
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.080]  senator on last year who admitted he was part of a secret homeland security
[09:41.080 --> 09:46.440]  board with Rick Perry for the complete collapse of Mexico and the preparation
[09:46.440 --> 09:52.440]  for tens of millions tens of millions of refugees to try to pour into the United
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.960]  States that will then be used under the SPP plans that were ordered released
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.360]  via four year by judicial watch in 2007 that they plan to use that crisis they
[10:02.360 --> 10:06.680]  have engineered as the way to bring in the official North American Union now
[10:06.680 --> 10:12.800]  the military for more than 20 years that we've been able to get declassified the
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.200]  documents and leaked documents on has been training for total takeover of the
[10:17.200 --> 10:26.040]  US then we saw the Pentagon last month put out a report saying they're worried
[10:26.040 --> 10:33.480]  about complete financial collapse and that they they're going to give you
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.840]  basically martial law to to to save the society and the economy the key to all
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.800]  of this is that this is all been engineered by design and we have the
[10:44.800 --> 10:50.840]  proof for over 12 years I've been on air air 15 but for over 12 years I have
[10:50.840 --> 10:55.760]  been completely wise to this plan and I have told you that they would blow out
[10:55.760 --> 11:02.360]  the economy create hyperinflation that will cause collapse of society and that
[11:02.360 --> 11:06.560]  the military will then go out and take over every major town and sitting in the
[11:06.560 --> 11:09.760]  country they've already been integrating and federalizing local police they put
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.960]  in the threat fusion surveillance centers that's all coming up were you guys
[11:13.960 --> 11:20.120]  able to get a hold of Paul Joseph Watson okay I want you to get him on the line
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.000]  right now because his report is important and he's only covering one
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.720]  facet though and this is so important I want him to do a full spectrum breakdown
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.640]  so that people get the full image he's such a wonderful writer and researcher
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.680]  and one of our fastest riders I want to get him on air so people can hear what
[11:36.680 --> 11:40.720]  goes on every day behind the scenes when I talked to Curtin M. O. Paul Steve
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.080]  Aaron and basically you know I give him a data dump they go and pull it all up
[11:45.080 --> 11:47.600]  and then put it together in an article and then add their own research to it
[11:47.600 --> 11:54.560]  because again a lot of times I'll have big stacks of news I'm planning to cover
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.680]  and then an hour before the show five minutes before the show I'll decide to
[11:57.680 --> 12:00.960]  go in another direction because we've covered this military takeover probably
[12:00.960 --> 12:06.080]  a thousand times or more in the last 15 years partially 12 years intensely I
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.880]  didn't really fully figure out the takeover attack pattern until 12 years
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.880]  ago and I've been absolutely right my police state 2000 police state to the
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.920]  takeover police state 3 total enslavement you watch those films made
[12:18.920 --> 12:24.720]  11 years ago 10 years ago nine years ago you watch the film we put out six
[12:24.720 --> 12:31.000]  months ago police state for the rise of FEMA it is a complete snapshot of how
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.080]  they'll implode the economy how they'll roll it out it's all of my research
[12:35.080 --> 12:47.440]  crystallized and boiled down into one integrated system and to have this
[12:47.440 --> 12:50.880]  article this morning and just turn on local number one talk station and to
[12:50.880 --> 12:54.520]  hear them seriously talking about it not making fun of me like they've always
[12:54.520 --> 13:03.000]  done was heartening but then listening to the callers it was booing as well to
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.560]  hear of 30 calls I listened to I'd say it was around 30 calls I've taken a lot
[13:06.560 --> 13:13.000]  you're there probably taken you know 10 calls per segment made more than 30 the
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.400]  vast majority I'd say seven out of ten have even been more being conservative
[13:17.400 --> 13:20.680]  knew what was happening said they're imploding the economy by design this is
[13:20.680 --> 13:24.640]  a takeover operation now current military was calling in saying yeah we're
[13:24.640 --> 13:29.040]  training for this but you ought to thank us because they're good people they've
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.400]  just been given the brainwashed template that oh this financial problem just
[13:33.400 --> 13:39.040]  started it's an accident but no they've been training for this forever it's just
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.240]  now they're coming out in the open because what because they want to sell
[13:42.240 --> 13:50.680]  you on it for when they go operational now we've got Watson now on the phone I
[13:50.680 --> 13:53.040]  want to go ahead and punch him up as soon as possible I want to go ahead and
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.440]  just direct him right now and then I'm going to get into the latest information
[13:57.440 --> 14:03.760]  on the money bomb and I want to try to calmly cover every facet of this
[14:03.760 --> 14:11.320]  because this needs to be chronicled this needs to be broken down people need to
[14:11.320 --> 14:18.040]  see it in its full context and what it deals with and then the other important
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.120]  part of the equation how is the public going to respond to this because they're
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.720]  sending out their trial balloons now if you buy it they are going to implement
[14:28.720 --> 14:33.680]  this for sure if you don't buy into it they're gonna stop and just keep their
[14:33.680 --> 14:37.840]  infiltration and brainwashing and slow federalization and militarization going
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.280]  and that's that's not good either but it's the lesser of two evils and then
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.880]  that buys us more time to wake more people up okay and and what Iran Paul
[14:47.880 --> 14:50.880]  saying his big tea party speech this week they got so much tension he said
[14:50.880 --> 14:53.620]  they're gonna implode the economy it's a foregone conclusion and they're gonna
[14:53.620 --> 14:58.240]  try to bring in martial law what what did Ron Paul say on the broadcast Monday
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.960]  he agreed this is the big threat economist medical doctor congressman
[15:03.960 --> 15:09.600]  presidential candidate true intellectual he agrees with me because he knows
[15:09.600 --> 15:15.400]  history and we have the army's own admissions now I'm gonna go to Paul
[15:15.400 --> 15:18.360]  Watson right now Paul thank you for joining us
[15:18.360 --> 15:26.400]  hello I like Paul I this is a great article you've written I know you're
[15:26.400 --> 15:35.120]  probably working on something else right now but we need having an allergy
[15:35.120 --> 15:37.880]  attack today folks I guess the oak pollen's out so my eyes are burning
[15:37.880 --> 15:41.760]  excuse me people watching on television I might need to get some vizene if
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.120]  somebody go to the store maybe but it'll it'll probably get better in a moment the
[15:46.120 --> 15:50.240]  issue here is Paul you've done a breakdown and it's getting a lot of
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.680]  attention because I mean if I turn on the local radio and they're covering it
[15:53.680 --> 15:57.120]  in a serious manner you know that means the articles out there big time who knows
[15:57.120 --> 16:00.920]  it might even be on drugs right now I'm not sure but government trains troops
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.000]  to run American cities we have sent you the 60 minutes piece from eight years
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.480]  ago where it shows them with the microwave gun admitting it's for
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.480]  domestic operations you can also pull up head of Air Force says we should you
[16:16.480 --> 16:21.200]  know they should use pain ray on citizens that was the AP headline you
[16:21.200 --> 16:24.680]  want to integrate that into a story you want to show that in the 60 minutes
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.480]  piece they've got signs saying follow the Constitution give peace a chance and
[16:29.480 --> 16:32.280]  they're and they're training the military eight years ago this is an eight
[16:32.280 --> 16:36.880]  year old report for domestic operations you want to integrate into there at the
[16:36.880 --> 16:40.680]  top of the article that look at Katrina they didn't bring food and water they
[16:40.680 --> 16:44.080]  went into the high and dry areas went into 10 million dollar homes were the
[16:44.080 --> 16:48.720]  richest area and took their guns to set the precedent that even the wealthiest
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.520]  people would be put in handcuffs and have their guns taken that ABC news report
[16:52.520 --> 16:56.240]  with the army talking about shooting Americans that that's a quote and the
[16:56.240 --> 16:59.320]  police chief saying all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed to be
[16:59.320 --> 17:05.760]  armed put that in there but the but the headline needs to deal with Paul the
[17:05.760 --> 17:13.240]  headline needs to deal with globalist collapsing society to bring in martial
[17:13.240 --> 17:19.400]  law by design because I heard the troops on 590 this morning they were all
[17:19.400 --> 17:22.240]  saying well I'm in the military yeah we've been training for this but you
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.160]  know America's collapsing and we've got to do this to keep you safe and another
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.000]  guy yeah my sons are the Marines he's been training for door-to-door you'll
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.240]  search as Americans homes we don't know who the terrorist are and we have the
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.800]  Colonel I had on last year up in Arcadia Iowa where they locked down the town and
[17:38.800 --> 17:42.360]  practice taking over the gun shop and going door-to-door to take the guns we
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.240]  need to explain to people this is not pointed at Al CIA to this was always
[17:46.240 --> 17:50.520]  built for the American people as the mic reports and the Israeli spying for
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.840]  homeland security in Pennsylvania and that they're getting ready to take the
[17:54.840 --> 17:57.960]  pensions and tax them and take a big part of them they're getting ready to
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.960]  devalue the dollar this that you know they didn't just start this training
[18:01.960 --> 18:05.760]  today it's been going on behind the curtain for decades but we got leaks on
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.160]  it and now they're coming out in the open this is the key Paul they're now
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.280]  started public psy ops as you know in your article telling you isn't it great
[18:15.280 --> 18:18.680]  that the armies here learning how to run our wastewater in our city then they
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.960]  put the little token lion for when they're in Afghanistan and of course
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.160]  that's a dual training part of that's true just like in police day 2000 the
[18:27.160 --> 18:30.640]  role players they hired in California for the Marines well where'd you get the
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.400]  gun where'd you get the helmet well I got it here in San Francisco they were
[18:34.400 --> 18:39.120]  the people in the drills were Americans screaming I'm an American I have rights
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.920]  but it was the reverse psychology of the people begging to be led into the camp
[18:43.920 --> 18:47.600]  so I hope you're able to write all that down but but you you understand the
[18:47.600 --> 18:53.840]  mission don't you Watson well it seems to me that it's all about conditioning
[18:53.840 --> 19:00.680]  America think that having troops run the bell checkpoints and traffic check
[19:00.680 --> 19:06.600]  points and security at forcing that is completely normal which of course is the
[19:06.600 --> 19:12.080]  whole basketball empire's in terminal decline like the Soviet Union when you
[19:12.080 --> 19:17.200]  beat troops on the street doing the job that police should be doing well yes the
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.280]  federal government has has bankrupted the states by design with unfunded
[19:21.280 --> 19:24.600]  mandates with the illegal aliens and all the rest of it and now the police
[19:24.600 --> 19:27.880]  forces are laying people off and they're saying oh this National Guard base we
[19:27.880 --> 19:33.680]  gave the county for the threat fusion center the armies moving in oh and add
[19:33.680 --> 19:37.440]  to your report Paul New York you know where it says National Guard helps

[24:14.400 --> 24:22.720]  coming up Alan Watt a lot more because it was amazing to hear more than 30
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.560]  callers on the number one talk station in Austin saying they've imploded the
[24:26.560 --> 24:30.720]  banks by design they're gonna take our pension funds they've set it all up
[24:30.720 --> 24:34.720]  they've trained the military to take over Alex Jones is right and then to
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.320]  hear troops calling in who are current military saying yeah we've been training
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.960]  for this but it's good we need to protect you during the collapse they were
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.320]  training 20 years ago for the economic collapse the government created the
[24:47.320 --> 24:53.400]  derivatives the same thing the riots in Europe the riots in Spain the riots in
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.960]  Argentina we have the IMF documents from 2002 how they were planning it I've been
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.040]  here every week sometimes every day telling you exactly what would happen
[25:04.040 --> 25:08.000]  and I knew I'd be made fun of I knew people wouldn't check the documents we
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.600]  posted I knew people would just say that's too crazy but they heard it I've
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.400]  done over 5,000 radio interviews in the last decade that's conservative on other
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.720]  people's shows including coast-to-coast reaching 16 million people a pop I have
[25:20.720 --> 25:25.480]  been on c-span our callers have called c-span thousands of times sometimes
[25:25.480 --> 25:29.400]  every almost every caller on the morning show on c-spans bringing this up I
[25:29.400 --> 25:33.800]  have had tens of millions of people every month read info wars.com and
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.240]  prison planet.com we've put out viral films that have reached hundreds of
[25:37.240 --> 25:41.640]  millions of people online I understood that we had to tell the truth even if we
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.880]  got laughed at so that when they launched their operation we would be able
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.800]  to catch them with their pants down and so many troops on the bases have heard
[25:50.800 --> 25:54.040]  us talk about this over the years then when they got the exact training and
[25:54.040 --> 26:01.240]  we're told this is for America two boys but don't tell anybody they go whoa and
[26:01.240 --> 26:05.000]  Watson here's the final key that I need you to put in your new article you're
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.280]  doing at the top of it the Pentagon it was a branch of it and my memory is not
[26:10.280 --> 26:15.440]  serving remember a month ago I believe it wasn't sent com it was special
[26:15.440 --> 26:22.080]  operations command you know fears collapse of economy preparing for civil
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.760]  unrest they don't call it martial law they call it security the 2007 British
[26:26.760 --> 26:31.800]  Ministry of Defense report that talks about all of this coming by 2011-2012
[26:31.800 --> 26:37.000]  all engineered you need to get that the UN report two weeks ago worried about
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.680]  global unrest and oh they'll have to save us with higher security and check
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.520]  points people need to understand they were preparing for this in 86 in the
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.920]  Oliver North hearings when this all came out they create the crisis then they
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.720]  offer the solution and then I heard military families calling in who were
[26:56.720 --> 27:00.240]  in denial going well they're only trying to take guns overseas they wouldn't do
[27:00.240 --> 27:04.360]  that here no they are training to take our guns and they have done it in
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.120]  Katrina and other places get it through your head Watson any comments on this
[27:09.120 --> 27:14.280]  well the notion that it's only for overseas in Afghanistan is disproven
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.840]  by the very ambitious in the army times of September 2008 that these troops
[27:19.840 --> 27:25.320]  were being used to call Homeland Patrol and again in November 2008
[27:25.320 --> 27:30.800]  Northcom said that over the next three years they'd be deploying 4,700 troops
[27:30.800 --> 27:36.200]  but Homeland Security mission so and then you have the new one you have the
[27:36.200 --> 27:39.920]  new one last year out of the progressive and the nation and the
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.240]  Pentagon admitted they want 379,000 troops after they phase it in so it goes
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.720]  4,000 10,000 40,000 100,000 they've now got over a hundred thousand that we know
[27:51.720 --> 27:57.000]  of and oh Paul it make sure you add the chips the Highway Patrol press releases
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.160]  where they admitted last year the Marines running DWI checkpoints that
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.480]  integrates in with the army at the shooting at UT two weeks ago that
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.000]  integrates in with the Alabama shooting that the Marines showed up to on the
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.720]  highways that integrates into Tennessee when the governor said don't run
[28:15.720 --> 28:19.440]  Homeland Security military checkpoints with all branches of the military and
[28:19.440 --> 28:23.800]  FBI shutting down whole highways integrate that these have all been beta
[28:23.800 --> 28:28.600]  test integrated in to give people a full spectrum and it can just be a basic
[28:28.600 --> 28:32.040]  boil down and then just links you know here they are admitting they're
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.320]  preparing for total takeover here's how they're conditioning the public but do
[28:35.320 --> 28:38.680]  you agree with me Paul that this is so important because they're now going into
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.320]  the phase of announcing it and telling us how great it is which shows they're
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.120]  getting ready to go completely operational they're done with beta
[28:45.120 --> 28:51.200]  testing well you see the scenes unfolded in Europe the protests against
[28:51.200 --> 28:56.000]  governments raising the very silent age and eventually you're going to see that
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.560]  in the US when they actually start when the middle class wait from their slumber
[29:00.560 --> 29:05.760]  and actually realize that their pension that future and their inheritance of
[29:05.760 --> 29:09.920]  future generations is being seized in front of their faces then they're going
[29:09.920 --> 29:14.880]  to start civil unrest like we're already seen in France and other places but the
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.560]  difference is the response is going to be a whole lot more brutal and swift
[29:19.560 --> 29:25.040]  because of these training programs that involve active duty combat troops okay
[29:25.040 --> 29:28.680]  just from that pro-askenics that all right break it down excellent article
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.200]  you've got government trains troops to run American cities but give give us a
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.240]  full spectrum how collapse of the United States you know to by design
[29:37.240 --> 29:42.160]  military occupation thank you Watson great job I'm gonna come back into the

[33:37.520 --> 33:43.160]  months it's one thing to intellectually know all of this and to understand it
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.560]  at a very deep sophisticated level and to be able to integrate all the
[33:47.560 --> 33:51.600]  information together to the point of years later I will get government
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.840]  documents that are word-for-word my breakdown analysis before I ever get
[33:56.840 --> 34:00.800]  the documents that's the level of understanding I've got just like somebody

[34:04.320 --> 34:07.760]  understanding football that if they've got the mind for it well I don't study

[34:14.240 --> 34:21.480]  study you know butterflies I don't snow I study geopolitical movements history
[34:21.480 --> 34:27.560]  how governments operate who the globalist are and I'm telling you there
[34:27.560 --> 34:31.800]  we are facing the equivalent of a Soviet style Red Terror takeover and it
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.280]  transcends Bill Clinton and George Bush and Barack Obama they're just frontmen
[34:37.280 --> 34:40.800]  everybody's gonna get upset about it at Obama for everything that's coming down
[34:40.800 --> 34:44.720]  and he's a horrible teleprompter reading Foundation funded globalist New
[34:44.720 --> 34:53.520]  World Order trash but he's still just a frontman still just a puppet now I want
[34:53.520 --> 34:56.840]  to get into the money bomb and then I'm gonna get into the financial news gold
[34:56.840 --> 35:02.440]  all-time record highs today it just continues dollar continues to plunge and
[35:02.440 --> 35:05.560]  we're gonna get into this military takeover situation ahead of Lou Dobbs

[35:12.440 --> 35:15.840]  and other issues and we'll talk about the deterring situation in Mexico remember
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.240]  this global financial implosions happening everywhere they've got riots and
[35:20.240 --> 35:23.120]  troops on the streets all over Europe right now they're about a year or two
[35:23.120 --> 35:28.880]  ahead of us you understand that now now this could this could all break loose
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.320]  this week it could break loose in December it could break loose generally
[35:33.320 --> 35:37.240]  plunges come in October it could break loose two years from now but it's this
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.680]  slow slide into depression but now they're saying they want your pension
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.400]  funds what are people going to do when the globalists come in and start trying
[35:46.400 --> 35:51.160]  to take your pension funds and guys I know you reprinted me that article
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.720]  about the pension funds is it in there in the printer Watson's article for
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.560]  Monday about feds announced they're gonna take private pension funds need that
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.880]  article ASAP please
[36:04.360 --> 36:08.960]  God again I saw them making preparations for this five years ago and I've seen
[36:08.960 --> 36:11.760]  what the IMF and World Bank consortium has done in every other nation that they
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.320]  run look what they're doing in Greece right now look what they're doing in
[36:15.320 --> 36:17.680]  Spain right now look what they're trying to do in Germany right now and in
[36:17.680 --> 36:23.160]  France right now so we know what they're going to do but it is another thing to
[36:23.160 --> 36:31.240]  actually see them come out with the announcements and the trowel balloons that
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.400]  they are moving into this have we got plenty of paper just print it again
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.240]  yeah thanks
[36:40.720 --> 36:43.720]  now
[36:43.720 --> 36:53.520]  it is the 2010 global transmission against tyranny I think it's obvious to
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.760]  anyone that this radio show is spot-on it's obvious to anyone that this radio
[36:59.760 --> 37:05.600]  show is one of the key major platforms where we bring so many different guest
[37:05.600 --> 37:14.080]  analysts congresspeople academics on to expand all of our overall understanding
[37:14.080 --> 37:21.000]  of what we are facing as a society and how to stop it we know there's a
[37:21.000 --> 37:29.400]  criminal takeover that we are in the deep deep phase that is only going to
[37:29.400 --> 37:34.520]  intensify of a total conversion into classical despotism they're using
[37:34.520 --> 37:39.840]  poverty as a weapon to make you all dependent on this system so you're so
[37:39.840 --> 37:43.560]  busy just trying to pay the bills and the taxes and you know to keep your
[37:43.560 --> 37:48.800]  children safe that you can't stand up and can't get involved they're
[37:48.800 --> 37:51.760]  announcing that they are surveilling tea parties and conservatives and
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.040]  libertarians and everyone in an attempt to intimidate everybody with a
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.560]  chilling effect we must respond to this intimidation by intensifying our
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.480]  resistance to their criminal activities we need to be bold and say we're the
[38:06.480 --> 38:10.520]  good guys we don't care of your surveilling us we're surveilling you
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.320]  and exposing you out in the open we are out in the light you're operating in
[38:15.320 --> 38:20.440]  the darkness and we're gonna poke holes in this iron curtain of propaganda and
[38:20.440 --> 38:25.120]  disinformation and we're gonna let the sun shine in we don't have anything to
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.280]  hide we're the good guys you are the bad guys now there are many good people
[38:29.280 --> 38:32.840]  that work within the system who are compartmentalized but you still work for
[38:32.840 --> 38:37.680]  a completely wicked system it is now coming out that almost all the mortgages
[38:37.680 --> 38:40.880]  are complete frauds and they're stealing tens of thousands of people's houses
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.640]  that they don't even own and they're paid for we told you that years ago now
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.840]  it's mainstream news that'll give you an idea of how bold these criminals are
[38:48.840 --> 39:02.280]  now here is what is coming up today in the 24 plus hour transmission we have

[40:35.040 --> 40:39.800]  after 25 hours of live broadcast myself Paul Watson sits in in the second and
[40:39.800 --> 40:46.880]  third hour via video Skype from the United Kingdom it's freezing in my
[40:46.880 --> 40:50.120]  studio and I'm so upset by what's happening and how real all this is I'm
[40:50.120 --> 40:57.040]  actually sweating my palms are sweating my face is sweating and it's 66 degrees in
[40:57.040 --> 41:01.680]  here I like it cold looking at the thermostat over there behind the
[41:01.680 --> 41:08.960]  camera I wish I was wrong I wish under this was true here's the good news we
[41:08.960 --> 41:16.160]  reached our goal about 20 minutes before showtime at about 1040 Tim Fruge the
[41:16.160 --> 41:20.040]  head of the shipping back office came in and showed me the numbers we've raised
[41:20.040 --> 41:27.760]  $101,000 I want to thank you all and salute you unfortunately $100,000 is
[41:27.760 --> 41:33.280]  only half a month's operating capital it cost over two million dollars and I've
[41:33.280 --> 41:36.800]  discovered with taxes that like when we built the new studio over there they
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.640]  call that an improvement even though I don't own the building and I have to pay
[41:39.640 --> 41:42.760]  taxes on that I mean people like well just don't pay taxes yeah they come
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.040]  arrest me in five minutes ladies and gentlemen but it's that type of insanity
[41:46.040 --> 41:49.840]  where I guess I didn't know what I was doing or I didn't listen to the CPA it's
[41:49.840 --> 41:55.560]  another issue just explain how all this works where I try to spend almost all
[41:55.560 --> 41:58.840]  the money that comes in on the operation and then of course taxes get paid to the
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.400]  employees and other things but I try to spend almost all of it and then I find
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.720]  out oh you've got to pay all these taxes because it's seen as profit when I
[42:07.720 --> 42:14.560]  build a studio it's seen as an asset I mean I'm talking about the walls folks
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.520]  not the not the computers not the equipment you can do you can expense
[42:18.520 --> 42:23.520]  some of that out but but the point is two hundred thousand dollars a month now
[42:23.520 --> 42:26.500]  it's be a little bit lower later this year because we've been building the
[42:26.500 --> 42:30.000]  social network getting our own bigger servers that was a hundred grand building
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.440]  the hundred eighty thousand dollars shell of the studio and and that was with
[42:35.440 --> 42:40.480]  the company that owns this putting in the other you know three hundred thousand
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.500]  and I'm not the best businessman in the world and I'm not I'm busy just
[42:48.500 --> 42:53.160]  analyzing information but the point is that five hundred thousand dollars
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.400]  sounds like a lot that five hundred thousand dollars is being put in a
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.600]  special account so that all of it goes directly into buying the equipment
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.440]  hiring the people and running the system for the next year just on that new
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.400]  module that new end I mean ladies and gentlemen I've seen the numbers for say
[43:09.400 --> 43:13.960]  a CNN studio and they've gotten you know dozens of them or a Fox studio you're
[43:13.960 --> 43:20.240]  talking ten million dollars for one studio now now we're doing it with the
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.600]  building and the people and the computers and the prosumer gear four
[43:24.600 --> 43:27.400]  hundred thousand dollars or so the other hundred thousand for the social
[43:27.400 --> 43:32.280]  network and the servers and boys that that a hassle actually building a first
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.760]  rate one but that should be ready next month it's the point is we're always
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.800]  doing everything we're doing here working building doing all the news
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.560]  stories dealing with everything that's happening doing interviews and then I've
[43:45.560 --> 43:48.720]  got to do everything else on top of it or things will move even quicker but but
[43:48.720 --> 43:52.600]  we've still done a great job look at what we've been able to do so we need to
[43:52.600 --> 43:57.800]  buy 11 a.m. tomorrow raise another four hundred thousand dollars or three hundred
[43:57.800 --> 44:01.680]  and ninety nine thousand if you want to be technical because we've raised a
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.640]  hundred and one thousand as of an hour ago I'm sure it's more now show info

[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:53.800]  ordering them to hand over their private pension funds meanwhile they're
[1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:57.560]  openly announcing I'm gonna play those video clips look coming up but the
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:02.360]  military is training to take over major cities and small towns in the United
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:07.440]  States this is all happening and it's all been engineered they quietly get the
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:11.480]  police militarized and federalized they quietly bring the military and start
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:16.720]  running checkpoints x-ray scanner systems local governors in Tennessee say
[1:01:16.720 --> 1:01:20.880]  don't do that the Pentagon says we don't care what you say the John Warner

[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.240]  insurrection and even state governments that don't follow orders the media talks
[1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:32.960]  about Obama being like Lincoln and he might have to take over I mean they've
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:37.880]  really put out this iconography that you know the symbolism the ideas of this
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:41.080]  this is what happens in third world countries you know every month you hear
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:47.640]  about Guatemala or some other country having a takeover operation or
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:52.840]  something big happening on that front this is what happens this is what
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:57.160]  happened in Rome when Caesar marched his army across the Rubicon in northern
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:00.600]  Italy and came into Rome and took over that was the end of the Senate and it
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:08.160]  became a ceremonial vestigial remnant of what it had been and then finally you
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:12.560]  know by the collapse they just got rid of the Imperial Senate all together you
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.320]  know Imperial Senate being dissolved from on board the Death Star it's not
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.920]  just in the movie Star Wars it's in history so this is the type of system
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:30.120]  and operation that we are dealing with as a society this is the type of New
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:37.040]  World Order control grid that that that they modeled after previous systems and
[1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:47.840]  previous societies and so we know that what we're going into is very real they
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:54.400]  admit what they're doing but they put this window dressing on the outside of
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:01.280]  it that it's all being done for your own good that it's all being done you know to
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:09.080]  keep you safe from from from crises that have been created and we know that they
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:15.880]  created these crises we understand that they created these crises it's it's
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:20.120]  admitted they did to the point of I could tell you 12 years ago they're
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:22.640]  gonna steal your pension funds they're gonna bankrupt the economy they're
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:25.600]  gonna destroy the dollar they're gonna have a global currency war because the
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.560]  trial commission said they would back in the 70s that would then bring in a new
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.840]  global government run by the private banks and that you would then pay
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.360]  carbon taxes to them and taxes VAT national taxes to this private
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:42.480]  consortium who then loans more fiat money they make up out of nothing then
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:47.800]  they'll devalue that new global currency you know in the decades after that or
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:52.480]  maybe even quicker because everything is accelerating now and so they get to use
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:57.040]  the fiat money when it's first created it has more value then you get your money
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:04.520]  devalue then they pass on all the expanded expenses on to you this is how
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:13.920]  they do it this is how the globalist operate and we understand that
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:23.800]  historically so we're at a historic crossroads here my friends and it's time
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:29.520]  for everybody to get really serious and really focused and make it your main

[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:07.640]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:11.680]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:15.560]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:20.080]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:24.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:36.520]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:40.720]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:44.080]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:50.280]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:54.680]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the son should

[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:09.600]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network this
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:13.040]  happens probably 10% of the time when it's a really big guess because they're
[1:08:13.040 --> 1:08:17.440]  so busy Ron Paul, Lou Dobbs been on before we've gotten personal communications
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:20.320]  from Lou saying he looks forward to coming on the show this was set up last
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:25.520]  week we didn't been out of pocket with him the last few days but if Lou's not
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.560]  on this hour we'll try to get him on later in the broadcast because it's a
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:33.320]  he was gonna be on vacation but they put out that disinformation piece about
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:36.040]  him hiring illegal aliens was a contractor he hired that had some of his
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:39.640]  house so he didn't go on vacation he stayed to respond to all this he's got
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.440]  a lot of crazy stuff going on but Lou showed up the last time he was on and
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.760]  so he could be calling in any minute or they could have gotten the time zones
[1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:52.480]  confused on their end though all the emails including emails from Lou are
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:56.480]  crystal clear and we've talked to his people on the phone but it's going to
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.040]  voicemail right now so I was looking forward to having Lou Dobbs on today but
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:06.720]  we do have Lord Christopher Monton coming up Paul Craig Roberts Alan Watt
[1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:15.800]  Jeffrey Smith Sherry Tenpenny we've got Dr. Childress we've got Max Kaiser
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:20.360]  Gerald Salente that's just some of the guests we're gonna have on the
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:25.360]  transmission but I was looking forward to Lou Dobbs it doesn't happen today you
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:27.240]  know it'll happen in the future we haven't really tried to get him on the
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:30.960]  last few years and we tried last week and there's like yeah we'd love to come
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.600]  on Lou sinister email if we talk to people said look forward to talking to
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:38.400]  Alex so we'll see what happens because I definitely have a lot of questions for
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:41.280]  him everything he's talked about it's coming true with the globalist the
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:44.520]  implosion of the economy by design the open borders the crime wave out of
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:49.120]  Mexico we're gonna be talking some about that today but don't forget the key
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  three search terms today we want to make number one number two number three we've
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:54.440]  done this before where we have three search terms number one number two
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:59.160]  number three number one search term info wars calm police search that number two
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:03.640]  search term info wars without the calm info wars money bomb money bomb one
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.920]  word info wars money bomb and number three search Alex Jones that'll get him
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:15.080]  to the site one way or another and cause quite a hubbub in cyberspace I did see a
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:19.400]  clip and we're gonna play this later in the show Beck was back on the radio
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:24.320]  yesterday and he said yeah there's quite a controversy over Diet Coke and by
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:28.480]  the way the symptoms in the macular dystrophy I mean that's on record in
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:33.240]  major studies that that aspartame that's in diet coke and thousands of other
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.560]  products attacks the nerves and the eye and causes that that disorder
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:40.680]  especially those that are already predisposed genetically to macular
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:46.880]  dystrophy and they were making fun of me his co-host on Monday but yesterday and
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:51.680]  only saw on the blaze a short clip of it because they went to break but they were
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:54.680]  starting to kind of apologize and go I guess we're getting hammered with email
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:58.760]  yeah people are saying this is serious and it's real and lens like well you
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:04.040]  know it's not good for you and so I thought that was really interesting we're
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:07.800]  trying to find the full clip of that I believe it was right at the start of Beck
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.440]  show but think about that 10 million listeners hearing about aspartame being
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:14.800]  dangerous there's no doubt tens of thousands will do the research and find
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.440]  out how bad it is that was my whole goal people are like why are you talking
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:20.360]  about Glenn Beck well he's supposedly the number one guy in the anti-new world
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.560]  order movement I don't trust him as far as I could throw him but if we can help
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.040]  him get not lose his sight he said he could lose it in the next year and I'd
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:34.160]  say nine times out of ten ninety percent chance it is the aspartame he admits
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:39.680]  that he drinks all sorts of diet sodas with aspartame he admits that he gobbles
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:44.600]  all sorts of sugar gums you know that have it all gum almost all gum now even
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:47.840]  if it's quote you know regular sugar gum has aspartame in it I mean read the
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:50.520]  label you'll be shocked at the store I challenge you today when you're in a
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.480]  gas station just look at everything I mean almost in every case you can't
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:59.280]  find gum bubblicious hubba bubba juicy fruit I mean I've brought it in here big
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:03.560]  league shoe and I discovered this a few years ago as my children like can I have
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:08.800]  gum and I'm like let me read the label this is sugar gum but don't like corn
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:12.920]  syrup but you know it's nothing compared to aspartame look aspartame and I've
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:17.480]  talked about that a lot but I noticed on Glenn Beck sites on I did some
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:23.640]  monitoring of when backs.com and the blaze and all that I'd say 80% in some
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:27.400]  cases like 90 and I'd sit there for like 10 minutes just scanning through you
[1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:32.800]  know pages of comments and it was almost every comment was listen I was going
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:36.120]  blind and got off of it went through incredible withdrawals and now my
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:40.120]  sites back please listen and then they just link to mainstream studies and
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:44.160]  mainstream news here it is Glenn here's macular to dystrophy you know here's
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:47.880]  losing your sight with it here's diabetes caused by it you know here it is
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:52.840]  Glenn here it is Glenn here it is Glenn so see I don't care if his co-host when
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:57.200]  he was in the hospital made fun of me on Monday I'm right they're wrong and now
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.560]  they're having to basically go I guess there is something to this but they
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.280]  still made the joke Glenn what is this about nanotech being in diet coke and
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:08.160]  you have nanotech factories in you making diet coke and they all laugh and
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:11.920]  he goes well you know it's not good for you so they still make a joke because in
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:16.440]  our article we linked to the aspartame manufacturing process the Pentagon in
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:22.600]  the 19 late 1960s was testing bacteria that eat toxic waste this is on record
[1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:30.760]  that's how Rumsfeld got the got the ingredient for Searle and they found
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:38.720]  that it was basically genetically engineered E. coli bacteria now ladies
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:44.320]  and gentlemen we have the one the only Lou Dobbs joining us and we're very
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.520]  honored to have Lou on he really doesn't need any introduction but he's a best
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:54.840]  selling author researcher syndicated radio host number one show for a long
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:59.640]  while on CNN until he was basically shown the door because he wouldn't
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:04.200]  compromise on Barry Sataro and the open borders Lou Dobbs great to have you on
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:09.000]  sir you with the Alex thank you so much that you know there's so much to talk
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.480]  about but but out of the gates what's most important to Lou Dobbs on your
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:19.200]  radar sir right now the most important thing is restoring a fundamental the
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:23.840]  fundamental tenets of a democratic constitutional republic and finding
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:30.600]  representation for the American people in Washington DC Mr. Dobbs what do you
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:34.120]  think about all the news reports now that 90 plus percent and the Polatano
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:38.080]  admits this of Homeland Security is pointed at libertarians conservatives
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:43.400]  returning veterans gun owners Ron Paul Chuck Baldwin Bob Barr what's your take
[1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:47.120]  on the fact that Homeland Security has been basically set up to the American
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:55.280]  people well I think the idea that this administration has politicized the not
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:00.280]  only the Homeland Security Department but also the Justice Department has
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:06.200]  created an enemy's list that is being prosecuted by the White House I think
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:11.720]  Alex is shameful and what is I think is almost as shameful as the fact that the
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:16.840]  Fourth of State has become something of a fifth column in this country working
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:24.440]  as to aid to a bet the the left-wing agenda of this administration and the
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:29.960]  Democratic leadership in Congress I think it's a shame it's an outrage I and the
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:37.040]  national left-wing liberal what you call it what you want to mainstream media is
[1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:41.640]  simply observing rather than applying critical judgment and performing its
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:50.120]  traditional role of oversight of our government Mr. Dobbs you are you know a
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:54.080]  student of history a veteran journalist and so you were able to chart exactly
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:59.840]  what's happened and you were now been proven right like a profit 28,000 plus
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:04.360]  dead in the last two and a half years on the U.S. Mexican border Mexico is now
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:08.240]  completely collapsed the poor woman has her husband killed the media tries to
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:12.320]  imply she's a liar now the investigator that goes to look at it from the Mexican
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:17.680]  government has his head chopped off and delivered to the Mexican military and
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:21.800]  then you're criticized for simply pointing out that we've got to protect
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:26.760]  our border yeah it's interesting isn't it Alex that if you speak truth to power
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:32.720]  as you and I do each and every day that you are a target for those who want to
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:40.720]  to ignore the the breach of security in this country the the border that is no
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:45.880]  longer recognized apparently by this administration as being a demarcation of
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:51.440]  sovereignty I the suggestion in the national media that this woman with her
[1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:59.600]  husband shot dead a falcon late he is somehow not a victim any longer but part
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:08.200]  of some sort of you know I don't know conspiracy some sort of plot that has
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:13.560]  nothing to do with the failure of the government of Mexico at narcos state
[1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:21.040]  terror that is raining across most of northern Mexico this is mad
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:26.320]  I talked to a state senator from Texas who'd been in secret homeland security
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:29.760]  meetings last year saying that they are preparing for the complete collapse of
[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:33.920]  Mexico with Homeland Security to protect the border and Rick Perry's been
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:37.960]  begging Obama but I've had sheriff's son from South Texas and Arizona now you've
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:41.440]  seen you know also them separately in the news where they've asked for more
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:45.320]  funds and instead of more funds they've actually had their funding cut and now
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:49.480]  they've pulled the border patrol back 10 miles on the Arizona border 80 miles in
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.280]  as you know they've put up signs telling people don't go down this road don't go
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:58.520]  in this national park we're really seating areas now to the Mexican drug
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:02.960]  cartels and and the Mexican military involved with them in many cases so that
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:10.920]  the la reconquista is is here yes and Alex you know you point out that again
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:17.560]  that moving the border patrol back putting in a few hundred national
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:22.880]  guards meant to support a border patrol that is demoralized and not
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:27.360]  adequately deployed part of the apprehension of illegal immigrants in
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:32.800]  this country people need to understand it that believe Calderon may have had
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:38.080]  something right and has not been given credit for because believe Calderon a
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:44.160]  year ago said corruption is not only a problem south of that border with the
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:51.240]  United States that comment meant what with almost no real serious coverage in
[1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:57.640]  the again in the US media but there has to be an understanding in amongst the
[1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:04.600]  American people that this level of this level of corruption that we focus on in
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:09.720]  Mexico is being now met on our side of the border there is no other way you know
[1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:14.280]  when all else fails with the cause of the fact as my father always thought me
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:20.040]  and there is a reason that these borders remain wide open there is a reason
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:25.040]  that illegal immigrants continue to cross over the border there is a reason
[1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:30.920]  that Mexico remains the principal source of methamphetamines marijuana heroin
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:37.760]  and cocaine entering the United States it's and we don't and we have a national
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:44.480]  media that doesn't even ask the question why because the big banks in the US has
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.320]  come out in Bloomberg and Reuters have admitted in federal court they are
[1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:54.240]  laundering billions and even buying aircraft for the drug dealers yeah there
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:20:00.440]  is no way in the world in which is anyone in business or finance of this
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:07.600]  country could not understand that they have to have the explicit acquiesce of a
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:13.080]  financial system to move the billions and billions of dollars required to
[1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:20.160]  both supply and provide and buy all of these illegal drugs we have been
[1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:26.200]  waging a war on drugs and this superpower the greatest economy on the
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:31.800]  face of the earth the greatest democracy has been able to win now is the
[1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:38.200]  time to ask why and the reason they answer and my judgment lies in one
[1:20:38.200 --> 1:20:43.800]  word corruption absolutely loom we were very honored to have you have a very
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:48.960]  busy schedule but we got you on about 14 minutes late I need to apologize for
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:56.000]  that Alex I apologize for family I hope that you will be if you will make that
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:00.800]  up to you anyway possibly oh no no no no it no sir you you're gracious I just
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:03.600]  because I didn't get a chance to talk to you before we went live I just have to
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:07.120]  ask you on air we got to take a break in about nine minutes is there a way to
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:12.720]  keep you to 40 after you betcha oh you sir thank you so much because I just
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:16.960]  want to make sure I can get to all these questions all of this is connected we
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:22.040]  see the mortgages the derivatives package the credit default swaps China
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:27.880]  Europe American pensions being cheated we now find out that there is systemic
[1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:30.960]  fraud they're taking houses that they don't even have deeds to in some cases
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:35.040]  that are paid for all of that is happening you had talked about this
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:40.040]  years ago you talked about globalism killing our economy nafta and gat again
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:44.320]  you've been a prophet it's all happened and it's the same banks laundering the
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:48.200]  drug money that are selling you know all these derivatives I mean this is really
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:52.440]  a criminal enterprise and as Ron Paul has said it's either us or them can you
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:57.600]  speak to that Mr. Dobbs from again lewdobbs.com folks want to check the
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:02.600]  site out on the radio show out can you speak to the private fellow reserve the
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.880]  globalist the open announcements now of world government I mean that everything's
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:14.840]  happening yeah it is happening and there is a component of both policy
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:22.600]  initiatives and a great deal of rhetoric to to reinforce that support
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:29.760]  those initiatives and as an example Alex last week Secretary of the Treasury
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:36.720]  Timothy Geiger said that it's very important that we find a much deeper
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.720]  broader much more profound role for the International Monetary Fund in the
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:48.720]  currency market it is one of the most alarming statements made by a man who I
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:52.360]  don't even think should be in the polls frankly I think he should have been
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:55.480]  fired but then the guy have to do reservations about the people who would
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:23:00.800]  have to fire it but the reality the reality is that a larger role for the
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:04.880]  International Monetary Fund is another step toward international
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:10.200]  government it's that straightforward it is that it is that simple this is an
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:15.840]  administration committed to taking this nation in a hard left turn if there is a
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.960]  doubt and anyone's mind about what this administration is attempting they
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:24.280]  literally have not been paying attention and they certainly haven't been
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:30.280]  listening to you or me because the facts are the facts are overwhelming a role for
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:36.360]  the IMF and the international currency market is an absurd at a time when the
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:43.320]  dollar should be receiving support as a reserve current we are acquiescing what
[1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:46.480]  I say we have with regard to this administration of the US government
[1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:55.560]  are acquiescing to the idea of it that is being broadly discussed pushed in the
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:01.320]  United Nations that there be a UN international global currency well sir
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:05.640]  be devastating to the United States absolutely a global international
[1:24:05.640 --> 1:24:11.120]  currency well the G20 admits headed up by Geithner and that they want a
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:18.080]  concerted global currency devaluation coordinated their word they said this
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:21.440]  last year they said it this year so this isn't really a currency war they've
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.920]  made an agreement to sink all the currencies and I'm sure you saw the
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:29.080]  Wall Street Journal last week and Bernanke and others say we're looking at
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.400]  inflation to quote fix the debt that's why my republic sir exactly what you
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:38.160]  warned of many years ago can you speak to how amazing it is that they send that
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:44.360]  signal and say we want a global VAT tax on every nation to fund the very private
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.720]  banks that have engineered our collapse I mean that is global banking system
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:54.720]  taking over our society me I mean please speak to that I have to laugh at
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:25:01.480]  the VAT tax this value-added tax this consumption tax for the suddenly the
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:08.720]  darling of the of the globalist who really see in it the capacity to bring
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:16.200]  in even more private sector capital to and and turn it over to government the
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:21.160]  public sector we are in a struggle right now in this country and I think in many
[1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:25.040]  parts of the world the principle in the United States a struggle between the
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:31.440]  public and the private sector that will determine whether or not we the people
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:37.560]  are working for our government or our government is working for us and the
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:44.880]  idea that that is somehow logical sensible or makes any kind of economic
[1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:50.680]  sense for this great free enterprise capitalist economy of ours to be further
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:57.480]  burned with a VAT tax which arises to 20% of some cases that Europe in addition
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:04.240]  to the tax burden that we're already under this would be this would bring
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:08.280]  the back of the free enterprise system in this country if I judge and it's not
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:14.840]  an accident that these these folks of these advocates for the VAT happen to
[1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:21.480]  be led by this administration well Lou I mean watching George Soros media
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:27.240]  matters outfits and others demonize you on a weekly basis myself Ron Paul and
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:32.520]  and and and say we're lunatics making up world government I've seen time Newsweek
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:37.040]  Financial Times of London Wall Street Journal all say world government is here
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:41.480]  it's gonna be run by the very banks that engineered the the Washington Post says
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:47.520]  $600 trillion unpayable derivatives a black hole and and we're just looking
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:52.080]  at what they're doing what they're saying and they think so little of the
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:58.120]  public that they go out and say we're crazy liars Lou I mean sometimes do you
[1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:03.680]  pinch yourself like it's a dream or the twilight zone well yeah you know like I
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:08.440]  think most most American I have a pretty clear idea what this country was
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:14.560]  founded on the values the ideals that are critically important to the success
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:18.080]  of this nation over the course of more than 200 years I don't believe those
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:22.520]  values of those ideals it should be fundamentally transformed if this
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:27.560]  president asked five days before the inauguration I have absolutely faith in
[1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:34.120]  absolute system this political system of ours this economic system of ours and I
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:41.360]  think that anyone advocating a change is in as president Obama put it a
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:46.920]  fundamental transformation of America had better be asking why and to what end
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:52.480]  and what would be the vision that would replace this great nation of ours and why
[1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:59.920]  is it that this administration is so utterly committed to apologizing for
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:06.240]  America's success for American exceptionalism at a time when we need
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:13.600]  positive leadership to drive both our economy and our financial system if one
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:18.960]  looks at what this administration is taking off decrying the economy for a
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:24.400]  brief period while it's exceeded and achieving an 800 billion dollar stimulus
[1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:32.840]  law it is now running down the economy and talking down markets rather than
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:40.280]  bolstering and small investor enthusiasm all business energy it makes no
[1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:44.120]  sense this is the most negative leadership one could have imagined from
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:49.600]  a candidate to talk about the audacity of hope and hope and change well again
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:53.000]  folks Lou Dobbs joins us we're about to go to break sir and have about 10
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:56.520]  minutes with you on the other side you're very gracious Lou Dobbs.com is the
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:28:59.720]  website we'll talk about your radio show and more when we come back but
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:04.480]  specifically they blamed capitalism in the free market for what's happening but
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:07.880]  as Ron Paul and you and others have pointed out the obvious it's the mega
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:13.440]  banks who are not free market who sell fraudulent derivatives the mega banks
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:18.600]  that want the world government they get our tax money basically conduit it to
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:26.520]  them via the national debt so it's it's mega banks with the government waging
[1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:30.120]  war against all the rest of the free market and then they blame the free
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:34.840]  market for all of the problems when this is not a free market that has done
[1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:38.600]  this Lou Dobbs is our guest we're gonna come back after this quick break and I've

[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.440]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:19.600]  Lou Dobbs is our guest we've got him for 10 more minutes very honored to have him
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:24.240]  he's got a kick off his own radio show coming up here in 27 minutes so he's
[1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:28.240]  really kind to join us I want to run through a laundry list of final
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:32.280]  questions Lou looking at the point I was making about the Federal Reserve and
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:37.000]  this consortium of banksters teamed up with government worldwide what we're
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.160]  seeing happening here is happening all over the planet
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:46.600]  yeah and what we are watching as you and I were discussing is not only a coordinated
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:52.640]  effort to not one would think that would be to support the strength of the dollar
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:58.200]  and currency markets and the forex market around the world but instead two
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:03.560]  is it seems that every opportunity to kick the force off from under the dollar
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:07.080]  you do not hear this administration talking about a commitment to the
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:13.080]  strength of the dollar and what is strange is to see this obvious desperate
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:20.560]  desire on a part of the Treasury Secretary and the G20 members to defer
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:27.400]  to the victim of the communist Chinese coming on it's extraordinary and then
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:32.440]  to carry on a national conversation instead of about the role of the Federal
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:38.320]  Reserve well it will be at the level of commitment to stable prices in this
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:43.720]  domestic economy in particular but it didn't talk about what China should be
[1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:51.160]  doing with the law rather than talking about US policy as if the answer here is
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:58.760]  to dictate communist Chinese policy in the global economy that's an absurdity
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:05.080]  sir sir I'm sorry erupt is that not treason I mean we know the policy for
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:09.280]  several years has been to allow quiet dollar devaluation the G20 said that
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:13.200]  but now they're saying it's a good thing I mean is that not fundamental
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:19.200]  sabotage against our nation to have a policy of devaluing the dollar the
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:24.440]  policy of devaluing whether one wants to construct that is treason Alex I think
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.560]  it depends upon whether or not one believes it will be at the first it will be
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:34.080]  successful or simply a discussion of a preferred policy you know I personally
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:39.360]  will not call it treason yet but we will watch very carefully to see where
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:46.160]  these policy recommendations that go whether they continue and secondly the
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:52.480]  idea that these policy recommendations would focus with the national media again
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:57.960]  acquiescence but the national media is not asking why should the Obama
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:02.720]  administration be focusing on the policies of a sovereign state that is
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:09.080]  the communist Chinese rather than the policies over which we have control the
[1:36:09.080 --> 1:36:15.440]  US government policy yes sir for which we are responsible and by the way by
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:20.320]  pursuing correct policies and I would include amongst those policies correct
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:27.240]  those correct policies would be a strong dollar and expanding our export
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:33.360]  market and and trading successfully mutually and reciprocally internationally
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:39.400]  without calling it globalism it seems to me Alex that there's a difference
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:46.200]  between being international traders and being globalist is globalist don't care
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:52.560]  how much of a trade debt we run up or how many consecutive years of deficit we
[1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:58.360]  run and those of us who believe in fair international trade believe it should be
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:04.040]  the precisely the same policy pursued by our fair trade not free trade
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:09.440]  reciprocal absolutely mutual reciprocal and balanced trade well sir as you know
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:15.440]  I'd put an end cap on this China just raised more tariffs against us I mean
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:19.200]  all of these international agreements are all one-sided and you're absolutely
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:22.760]  right about that you've been proven right in spades now a bunch of quick
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:26.760]  questions while we have you sir again Lou Dobbs joining a syndicated radio
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:32.960]  host former top CNN host and let's get into that issue when are we going to
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:38.560]  be seeing Lou Dobbs back on television with your number one show everybody is
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:42.840]  just basically demanding it when are we going to see Lou Dobbs back on
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.680]  television I think we'll know probably here in the next month or so open that
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:54.720]  well when that will be is it going to be Fox I can't come in about where it'll
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:38:01.280]  be or or the nature of the show but you know we should know a lot more than
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:07.440]  well I know how Fox works even they'll maybe business channel the beta tested
[1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:11.080]  for six months and then they've got to decide who to who to throw overboard at
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:15.640]  the main Fox channel well I think that they have so many strong people that
[1:38:15.640 --> 1:38:22.800]  there's you know a lot of room for talent to persevere I mean I really believe
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:29.880]  that the box business channel I have some superb talent I can't imagine why
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:35.640]  anyone would want to be moving any of them out oh come on Lou I bet I just made
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.200]  a good guess didn't I you know it's one of the places that I don't get great
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:47.040]  respect for I have no doubt about that okay what about a presidential run Lou
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:52.720]  Dobbs as vice president with Ron Paul well I was I was my wife and I were
[1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:57.240]  privileged I was the keynote speaker at the Virginia Tea Party Convention that
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:02.240]  you know Alex and Ron Paul and the duple what girl were there I've got the
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.280]  greatest respect for him I think he would make a fine president I think I
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:12.680]  would make a fine citizen I intend to pursue vigorously the most important
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:18.080]  title of all for me in this country well I'm telling you sir and you know what
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:24.640]  your gut a Ron Paul Lou Dobbs ticket is unbeatable well it's very kind of you
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:30.720]  to say so I'm flattered and thank you so much for that out well your
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:35.640]  country needs you've already done such great service mr. Dobbs but I know you
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:39.760]  just had dinner with the polls at the Tea Party Monday didn't you we didn't
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:45.160]  have dinner but we had an opportunity to talk for a while and I'm just so
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:52.840]  impressed with both wonderful wonderful America Lou another question back to
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:57.680]  banking I'm sure you've seen the mainstream news articles and CNBC where
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:01.640]  the government saying we may take over the private pensions to protect them
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:06.760]  after they destroyed them and put a tax on them boy I mean is that a recipe for
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:12.920]  revolt politically yes it is that that is a recipe for rebellion a peaceful
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:17.240]  rebellion but a firm rebellion which I think by the way you're going to do a
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:21.760]  very strong expression of that on November 2nd but the idea that this
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:29.960]  government would continue to drive an intrusion into our economy supporting
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:35.280]  pensions the half trillion dollars in unfunded pensions that local
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:41.320]  government employees alone another three trillion dollars that unfunded
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:47.360]  liabilities for state government public employee pension funds I mean this is
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:52.240]  outrageous and there's going to have to be an account and accounting and
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:57.800]  accounting in this case means people understand that the the taxpayer the
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:04.320]  private sector taxpayer simply can no longer afford to support public sector
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:10.000]  employment that provides salaries well beyond those of the private sector for
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:14.760]  like work and provides retirement and health care benefits far in excess of
[1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:23.480]  anything that the private sector taxpayer has for himself or herself on that
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:30.200]  same subject the major economist that I've had on and literally more than 30
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:34.120]  or 40 in the last few months and it's all over mainstream news say we never
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:38.880]  left the recession and by every gauge we are really entering into a depression
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:45.440]  what's your what label do you put on the point we're at right now I believe
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:50.560]  we're at the we were in a very vulnerable state and what is a fragile
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:57.720]  recovery we have economic growth it is not growth that is widespread if you use
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:03.200]  if I say I think a very vulnerable period but it is a recovery I like it's
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:10.720]  just not one in which you know the wealth is being created at a rate that comes
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:15.600]  close to creating something called that we could call general prosperity but
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:21.320]  we've got 35 billion people unemployed underemployed are not working part
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:29.120]  time that is a 17% unemployment rate at my opinion by in real-time okay
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:34.440]  better than that all right mr. Dobbs one final question how do you see it ending
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:41.080]  with the u.s. Mexico situation Obama has in that's in ABC news ordered ice to
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:44.880]  basically stop most deportations we've got 800 plus cities that are sanctuary
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:49.440]  cities Mexico is officially a totally collapsed failed state the State
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:55.360]  Department even admits that I mean how is it going to end it's going to end I
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:01.280]  vote it won't end until the Mexican people themselves 110 million citizens of
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.440]  Mexico decided they are not going to tolerate corruption and the United
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.360]  States understands you the US government in this administration begins to
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:16.160]  understand that they have to treat Mexico as a sovereign responsible state and
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:22.520]  hold them accountable for the corruption of the government of Mexico and for the
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:28.400]  corruption of the of the border states that are making that they're making this
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.240]  a security nightmare not only for the people of Mexico but very soon the
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:38.840]  America and America if we don't mean that border final point on that we'll
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:41.800]  let you get to your own radio show Lou we're very honored to have you again in
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:44.840]  your hard work and all the persecution you've gone through to get the truth out
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:48.920]  to people but we know it's going in the opposite direction the the the blue blood
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:53.160]  Republicans want to continue it the Democrats are trying to get to be
[1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:58.760]  basically their SPP merger and instead they're going in the opposite direction
[1:43:58.760 --> 1:44:05.440]  so I mean I just see it only getting worse and worse that I will agree with
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:12.480]  you Alex on the last we do confirm that the American people are awakening to all
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:17.280]  of the threats and challenges to this nation and on November 2nd and one
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.800]  party ruled in Washington DC I believe strongly that we will see that happen do
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:28.880]  I think that is sufficient and adequate to roll back what is a potentially a
[1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:34.440]  disastrous direction for this country no but I do think that it is the basis for
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:40.280]  some considerable confidence that we can still achieve our destiny is the nation
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:44.640]  but first we have to prevail on November 2nd and we can feel the momentum
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:49.280]  shifting against the globalists in the and the elitist can't we I certainly can
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:54.640]  I certainly in my audience continues to express that confidence and that
[1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:59.640]  optimism and I think right now we the best we can do is stay over the next
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:05.000]  two and a half weeks you know let's hope and let's pray all right Lou Dobbs look
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.800]  forward to speaking to you again and seeing you back on television God bless
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:12.200]  you and say how do your wife and your great family thank you so much Alex and
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:16.440]  thank you all right there goes Lou Dobbs ladies and gentlemen on this live

[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:28.440]  lineup of true patriots coming up Lord Christopher Monkton at three with
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:34.680]  bombshell information Max Kaiser Gerald Salente Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Dr.
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:41.200]  Childress Catherine Austin Fitz Sherry Tenpenny in studio Richard Reeves
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:46.680]  great patriot David Ike is coming up I mean this is amazing what the crew has
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:50.840]  done I just want to say my producers all of them everybody multitask everybody
[1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:53.800]  does webmastering everybody does producing everybody does board hopping
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:58.800]  and running the TV radio show and we all take the trash out together and you
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:01.800]  know I mean just it's all a team effort here and I couldn't do it this is the
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:06.880]  best group of producers the most focused and they you notice that they can
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:11.880]  Google something and search it in like 30 seconds I mean it's just an amazing
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:14.800]  team and we couldn't do all this without them and we couldn't do it without you
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:20.480]  now we've raised about another $20,000 in the last two hours and let me just
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:24.440]  tell you ladies and gentlemen that's I appreciate those that are giving but we
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:27.480]  won't hit our goal of $500,000 in the next 24 hours if that's what's
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:31.160]  happening and I understand we're in a depression you know Lou under is trying
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:33.720]  to save this country so he's saying well we've had a little bit of a recovery
[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:37.880]  as he understands confidence he's trying to but I mean I look as Ron Paul said
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:42.800]  at the Tea Party 95% chance total implosion because the policies adding
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:46.600]  taxes is going to do that and I just want to encourage everyone to support us
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:50.520]  and to call right now especially those of you that have capital we need to
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:53.520]  continue to grow this platform we're able to get news out into the national

[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:37.440]  that Ron Paul raised six million for his run in one day and broke all records
[1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:42.080]  for presidential campaigns but that's a congressional one-day record and people
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:45.400]  like well Ron Paul didn't win yeah but he put all the inflation issues out the
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:49.800]  new world order issues out people and now he's like a profit and he's bigger
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:56.280]  than ever worldwide and now the biggest movement on the school campuses the
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:01.640]  college campuses got my wire messed up here now the biggest movement on the

[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:11.680]  as them it's the Federal Reserve's private they're running the show they're
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:15.480]  screwing the country up and we've gone from Ron Paul with no co-sponsors 15
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:19.120]  years ago in Congress for his audit the Fed bill to it fat passing the house by
[1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:23.280]  two-thirds and the Senate sabotaging it doesn't matter once they've been
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:27.040]  identified as the real government that they're illegitimate now we know who
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:30.760]  the bad guys are and now the war drums are beating harder and harder it takes
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:35.280]  time to destroy the globalist it takes time to discredit them it takes time to

[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:05.640]  this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:09.320]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a
[1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:12.760]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or

[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:43.280]  now I remember reading the health care bill the different versions of it and
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:46.480]  having Ron Paul on about it and others he's a medical doctor he could really
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.680]  speak to it and it had death panels and now you're hearing about that and Bill
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:53.840]  Gates is promoting it and it said it makes everybody get insurance and it
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:58.480]  doesn't cover the uninsured it just takes money out of your check or if you're
[1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:02.120]  poor you know you're out of luck and it said people with pre-existing conditions
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:08.320]  they could raise rates on and 25% is the number and here's New York Times you
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:12.640]  have to let insurers raise fees for sick children and they lied to you about that
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:20.480]  the insurance companies wrote this here is in WCN and it says Blue Shield
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:26.680]  customers notified of skyrocketing rates and in some cases is more than 25%
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.640]  increases so I mean I mean this is a total ripoff by the banksters same one
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:34.600]  stealing the mortgages and lying and taking houses that they don't even own
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:37.840]  or don't even have the deed to the same ones taking the death benefits of six
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.400]  million dead and dying troops going back to World War two to today Bloomberg I
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:45.000]  mean it's just lawless total stealing thieving and they're now announcing oh
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.200]  we're gonna have troops on the streets in America that's coming up next hour oh
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:52.880]  yeah the for the financial collapse we are gonna have troops and I heard troops
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:56.720]  calling in local radio this morning when they were covering my story on 590
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:59.800]  going yeah we're training to take your guns what's wrong with that got to do it
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:04.520]  keep safe I mean folks I want to bring Ted Anderson up to talk about this gold
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:08.840]  has hit an all-time new high Ted tell folks the number yeah the number is
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:18.480]  1380 110 silver up to 2460 almost $25 an hour 2460 and ounce and then you've got
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:21.840]  the situation with gold we're about to go to break and come back but what do you
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:25.480]  have left prices had to go up but it's still lower than when anybody else has
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:28.360]  got this is gold you gold silver you bought weeks ago and again this is how
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:32.440]  this works as you sell out it'll go up what are the new prices Ted well 299 on
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:37.960]  the Frank 375 on the British sovereign walking Liberty halves are 1177 the
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:42.960]  Lakota coin now jumped over $31 and 29 cents 10 dollar liberties are still
[1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:47.440]  down at 877 and 20 dollar liberties are at 1708 I mean there's a lot of things
[1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:52.280]  that are going on Alex a lot of stuff in this market it's hot you know it we're
[1:57:52.280 --> 1:57:56.640]  watching things just fall apart internationally and it's just you know
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:01.280]  the dollars falling gold is rising the resistance level for gold gold now is
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:05.680]  $1400 an ounce that's huge man that means we're gonna be breaking that
[1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:11.120]  $1400 level very soon and yeah we'll probably see some profit taking in the
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:15.040]  next week or so but then it'll it'll go right back up to a new high I bet we see
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:19.520]  1400 by next week Ted you know it's a very good chance that'll happen all right
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:26.160]  let me give people the number 800 686 237 800 686 237 I told you get those silver
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:30.360]  half dollars they've gone up again but that's still the best price you're gonna
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.880]  find anywhere and it'll probably go up again next week because that's just how
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:39.560]  it is don't wait ladies and gentlemen 800 686 223 7 more on the markets when we

[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:22.840]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:26.840]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:30.960]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:34.920]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:39.080]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:29.920]  backup case there any technical issues because we sold out the Sunday event
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:33.840]  with 800 tickets at the Kokomo Grove deal and then there's 800 more tickets and
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:36.840]  half of those have been sold with almost no promotion so you want to get your
[2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:44.160]  tickets ksco.com ksco.com a second event at the Kokomo Grove event there in
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:48.960]  beautiful Santa Cruz right on the beach the tickets are $10.80 that
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:53.720]  just pays for the cost of the event and security which they demand we have so
[2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:59.480]  that is all coming up look forward to you joining us and I know everybody's I
[2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:03.120]  mean a lot of emails and calls and I see comments on the websites well I can't
[2:12:03.120 --> 2:12:06.800]  stay up all night for all these amazing award-winning or original interviews
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:12.000]  that are live and you know the video interviews well don't worry the issue it
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.080]  takes you know 20 minutes or whatever to upload the high quality video we're
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:20.880]  gonna have 27 hours of this stuff so the next few days it'll all be archived at
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:25.800]  prisonplanet.tv and the highest quality then it'll also then segue over to the
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:29.280]  Alex Jones channel on YouTube so we couldn't do any of this without the
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:32.480]  prisonplanet.tv members we couldn't do it without people supporting the show we
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:35.280]  couldn't do it without all the folks spreading the word about the broadcast
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:39.200]  buying the t-shirts the books and materials I mean to build a first-rate
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:43.200]  studio for 500,000 is impossible we're doing with prosumer gear and things but
[2:12:43.200 --> 2:12:47.680]  it takes money to do this okay just this free video stream we estimate will
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:52.200]  conservatively probably cost $10,000 because over 100,000 people will
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:57.360]  probably watch it for a long time I did a test a few days ago for an hour when
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:01.960]  nobody even knew about it we just put a link up and it costs about $150 and we
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:06.200]  buy big bulk bandwidth if anybody knows how to get a cheaper police tell us that's
[2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:09.400]  why Google's government backed they're able to have all this bandwidth to dominate
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:12.920]  the market because nobody else can pay for the bandwidth ladies and gentlemen
[2:13:12.920 --> 2:13:16.600]  nobody I mean we couldn't have reached 200 million people in the last two years
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:19.440]  on YouTube and Google alone if they didn't have that platform you think I
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:23.480]  could pay to stream full-length films and clips to 200 million people
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:28.520]  conservatively I mean that's got to be do the math at the bandwidth cost we've
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:32.520]  got just some kind of dead reckoning I mean that's got to be millions of
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:37.460]  dollars to to to to have 200 million plus people watching you know two three
[2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:44.360]  hour films that's conservative I mean it's just we don't have it and as Google
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:46.840]  and YouTube start talking about censoring and kicking people off is
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:50.760]  starting to happen you know they'll come a day where we'll have to pay for it all
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:52.840]  and I guess that's how they're gonna handicap us that's how they're gonna
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:56.120]  sever our legs that's how they're gonna sever our arms how they're gonna gag us
[2:13:56.120 --> 2:14:00.160]  so we've got to push and fight to get all this out now they are announcing all
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:03.720]  over the news now the military is learning how to run your city and that's
[2:14:03.720 --> 2:14:07.160]  coming up later with Alan Watts and key video clips on that where it's admitted
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:12.120]  it's for America but again we've raised another ten thousand dollars in the last
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:16.040]  30 minutes we need to really raise about thirty forty thousand dollars an hour
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:21.600]  because I don't think we'll raise as much overnight I've done some
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:26.320]  calculations during the key time of the radio show where we're on all the M&F
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:30.280]  affiliates and then the internet the streams it'll dissipate over the
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:33.640]  nighttime hours we need to be raising really right now about fifty thousand an
[2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:37.600]  hour and so everybody's great we appreciate you the phones are jammed

[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:54.920]  declassified that the Congressional Budget Office admits is illegal but the
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:59.040]  government takes your money and forces propaganda on you we don't do that we're

[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.880]  value I think the few remaining stations are left and there's a very few
[2:17:44.880 --> 2:17:49.280]  there's a lot of stations for patriot radio the few remaining ones are the
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:54.000]  only lifeline that people have to any alternate news that fill the pills in
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:58.880]  all the blank spots which the media leaves out and without it really you're
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:02.640]  left with nothing but mainstream propaganda and the mainstream will never
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:07.040]  tell you that they're really shepherding you into this whole new global
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.920]  society which is an authoritarian society and the show is the few patriot
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:17.000]  stations are left are trying to put out the information to show you what kind of
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:20.520]  society is to be it's already decided they have put out their books on it
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:24.640]  they've got lots of documentation of the United Nations of the society they're
[2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:29.040]  bringing in it's an authoritarian society totally controlled society and
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:34.640]  there's no democracies or republics in it it's simply authoritarian from top

[2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:42.080]  the implementation as I've taken the rights away from all the people across
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:47.760]  the entire planet and this is a global agenda and right now as I say the only
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:52.400]  lifeline they have are the occasional top-shell hosts who puts out alternate
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:56.280]  information and try to at least educate the ones who need that and they'll
[2:18:56.280 --> 2:19:01.960]  still do really crave to have the the little bits explained to them that the

[2:24:04.520 --> 2:24:08.120]  Canada and have had for the past couple of years but the shadow of a doubt is
[2:24:08.120 --> 2:24:14.600]  the economy but as I constantly remind Canadians there isn't really a Canadian
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:20.720]  economy anymore more it is a global economy and yes the Canadian economy so
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:25.880]  to speak is doing better than many other countries so Stephen Harper general
[2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:30.000]  trajectory of the Canadian economy whether we're on the down or downhill as
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.160]  we were last year whether we're on the rebound as we are this year is
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.440]  fundamentally determined by the state of the global economy and that's what
[2:24:37.440 --> 2:24:40.560]  these meetings are all about and that's why they are so critical that's why it's
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:45.200]  so critical that we participate and play a major role because Canadian jobs and
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:51.120]  Canadian futures are intimately linked to what goes on here and quite frankly
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:57.640]  everything that we do in our country to improve our country's position is
[2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:01.640]  ultimately to improve that position within the context of a global economy
[2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:06.720]  and we cannot be effective at major economic matters any month any longer
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:10.520]  unless we work with our other economic partners around the world and work with
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:14.120]  them closely and intimately that is essential I know some people don't
[2:25:14.120 --> 2:25:18.880]  like it it's a loss of national sovereignty but it is a simple reality
[2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:24.400]  it is a simple reality that we are in a global economy the global economy is
[2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:28.520]  determining that where we're headed and we'll determine our future and we have
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:33.520]  to play our part in these in these forums to make sure that our interests are
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:38.960]  protected and advanced all right so they hold you hostage they say the global
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:43.000]  economy has to make the decision that's the mega central banks that bought up
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:49.160]  the planet through fraud with at least 1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion and now
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.720]  oh we've got to let this foreign group make the decisions and determine it
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:58.800]  globalisms are only hope see it gets you like a boa constrictor squeezes you and
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:02.120]  then hisses in your face while it's killing you that it's saving you and
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:07.560]  this is how they're selling pure evil and world government Alan what yes and
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:12.120]  again it's nothing to really shock some of us who studied it for years because
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:16.280]  we've watched all the different global meetings I've had you could understand
[2:26:16.280 --> 2:26:20.160]  that all members of the council and foreign relations that was set up as a
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:24.680]  power law government they put members in government to most of your bureaucrats
[2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:29.080]  at the high levels are all CFR members and in every other country across the
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:34.040]  world all members of the council and foreign relations and sometimes they'll
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:38.080]  change the name for the same organization but their their plan for the
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:43.640]  last oh also a hundred years has been to bring in a global society as a mixture
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:50.440]  of Marxism and a mixture of the Kenosian or King's basically philosophy on
[2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:54.320]  money that's the system we're living in now and now we're going for the kill
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:58.960]  which was the second part of the the recipe of Bretton Woods was where the
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:03.440]  IMF would come up and be the global banker for the whole planet and be in
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:08.400]  charge not only of dishing out money across the world but also of managing
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:12.320]  every country's debt instead of the country doing it themselves they will do
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:16.720]  it for them this is a financial takeover and everything we talked about has
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:20.200]  come true with total precision because we were only reading their own documents
[2:27:20.200 --> 2:27:24.680]  that's right they have made it public in all the publications just the public
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:28.640]  had never hear about them because the media is perfectly silent about them
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:32.500]  and the media is silent because the leaders are all members of the
[2:27:32.500 --> 2:27:36.840]  comes from foreign relations and we've had Rockefeller before who finances
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.360]  an awful lots of the CFRs movements in America and it polishes their books too
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:46.840]  and he pays for it all he said one of his meetings we thank you he's talking
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:50.720]  to the editors of newspapers and the magnets and he said we thank you for
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:54.280]  keeping it secret we could never have gone this far without your your help
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:58.840]  keeping it all secret from the public what point have we reached I mean
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:02.000]  they're publicly saying they're devaluing global currencies to quote fix the
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:06.400]  debt that's like if your legs chopped off chopping off the other leg yes
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:10.600]  because we're going to bring in a standardized monetary system for the
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:14.160]  whole planet that's definitely on the books and obviously they always do the
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:17.360]  same thing when they change into new monetary system they devalued the
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.080]  present currencies as they amalgamated all together and that's what they're
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:25.960]  doing with the u.s. and and Canada to follow Canada always follows the u.s.
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:31.720]  because we are so intertwined financially with business there's major
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:36.400]  resistance to it in fact it was Burzinski talked about a total global
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:41.160]  awakening the first time in history and admitted that they are in trouble what's
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:45.960]  your take on that I don't see it really is trouble remember to these guys have
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:50.840]  full-time think tanks working on every possible problem that could arise with
[2:28:50.840 --> 2:28:55.440]  their big a far-reaching plan and they work it out well in advance and they
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:59.880]  have as you know across the world set up a police state and a militarized state
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:04.640]  in order to take care of any problems as we go through this as a just in case
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:09.480]  scenario will be trained since 2001 to simply obey anybody in a black flag
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:15.080]  uniform and and this is part of of that too is training us to accept total
[2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:20.800]  authority poverty coming your way that redistribution of wealth austerity
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:24.360]  announced that yet they've announced that openly that's whatever happens in
[2:29:24.360 --> 2:29:28.560]  and see somewhere in Africa you your wealth your people will have to be in
[2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:33.560]  the mouth and so we're this is the redistribution of wealth is Karl Marx
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:38.080]  talks about they call it the third way this is the third way the joining of the
[2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:42.000]  capitalist system with what was called the Soviet system which the rank
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:46.120]  corporation documents admit they've also been involved in Alan watch stay

[2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:41.760]  understand Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Rand Corporation all the old-timers were
[2:34:41.760 --> 2:34:45.680]  right it's true world government run by the big banks you pay your taxes to them
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:50.480]  VAT taxes taking the pension funds troops on the streets for the financial
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:53.280]  collapse they engineered we're gonna be playing some video of that coming up
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:58.880]  early in the next hour this is all happening now this is real it's happened
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.480]  to every other country most countries are under tyranny and then the countries
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:07.120]  fall apart and just are in squalor they use the economic warfare to control you
[2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:11.760]  just like Mexico does but we can beat this okay they're not invincible we've
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:15.480]  known their plans we've warned people for decades and they are having a lot of
[2:35:15.480 --> 2:35:20.680]  problems and they're losing in their operations in the Middle East the
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:26.320]  globalist are not invincible and regardless as we go into this thing
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:33.880]  humanity cannot give up the answer to 1984 is 1776 resistance is victory but
[2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:38.920]  the globalist are out in the open now it is incredibly brazen but one big thing
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:42.840]  that I know is hurting them Alan is and I want you to get back into the third
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.160]  way one big thing is hurting them is the mortgages it's coming out that they're
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:50.800]  stealing houses that they don't even own that it's all fraud that the that the
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:55.480]  deed system has been destroyed there there are people are winning in court
[2:35:55.480 --> 2:36:00.280]  against them I found that these people aren't gods they're not kings they think
[2:36:00.280 --> 2:36:04.600]  they are just like climate gate devastated them they are not invincible
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:08.040]  Alan I I know we can win and I know I can't give up on my family and my
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:12.960]  children we've got to take action but continue getting into the mortgages the
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:17.920]  banking where you see all this going the third way well part of the the the
[2:36:17.920 --> 2:36:23.120]  process right for now is going into chaos you see they form in the public's
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:27.040]  mind the form of chaos the public naturally turned to government for
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.720]  solutions and that's the key to all this this process have been many times
[2:36:31.720 --> 2:36:36.440]  before in history and out of the chaos of course to say look the world's in a
[2:36:36.440 --> 2:36:40.200]  mess we have this plan here to get us out of it but here's what you have to
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:44.760]  give up which is exactly what they're doing right now so it's a plan take down
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:49.600]  it's some step by step if they have to rush a part of it to create more chaos
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:53.480]  they certainly will do it and I do think there's another part of it planned that
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:57.480]  way too to make us really scared and to make the dollar really plunge even
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:02.160]  further and then they come out with their magic solution of the IMF and so on
[2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:06.720]  and how intertwined we are we can't go it alone anymore until the public get
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:11.640]  trained in getting the message and that's the psychology you have no idea how
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:16.040]  many behavior behavioral psychologists they have working in the big massive
[2:37:16.040 --> 2:37:20.080]  think tanks they have hundreds of these think tanks you know working on every
[2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:25.120]  possible outcome to make sure their plan will succeed you know so we've got to be
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:30.160]  aware of this at all times but even with the mortgages being sold three or four
[2:37:30.160 --> 2:37:34.640]  or five times have lost track of who owns the houses that was announced four
[2:37:34.640 --> 2:37:38.920]  years ago that was already happening so it isn't really new it's just it's time
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:43.320]  now to push that and say we can't go on the same old way remember in this new
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:50.360]  world order system and Arnold Toynbee who was the they had teachers Oxford for
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:54.400]  road scholarships and he taught the leaders of many countries many countries
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:59.800]  across Europe and America and Canada he did say that the world they were bringing
[2:37:59.800 --> 2:38:03.840]  in would have eventually no private property and that's the world we're
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:06.480]  getting trained to go into most youngsters who have come out of school today
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.920]  would never think about to buying property they think rentings the way to
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:15.000]  go I've talked to many in Canada they all agree so they're all getting this in
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  school of course they all feel their parts of the the new generation of
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  greening and saving the world and the planet and sacrifice and sharing and
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:28.560]  they have no idea what it really means it's an authoritarian Marxist type system
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:33.920]  that is run by the wealthiest people on the planet at the top so it's now time
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:38.040]  for the US to get brought down I've been saying this for years and Toynbee said
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:41.400]  it too by the way he went through the whole process of America he said the
[2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:46.000]  US was designed to take over from Britain when Britain I couldn't afford the
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:50.480]  Empire anymore but they would use the Empire model for the United Nations the
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:55.600]  US would fund it primarily the supply of the armies and they would win most of
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:38:59.960]  the wars and then it seemed to lose and then they come back again at our last
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:05.040]  big push and then they would collapse he said and then China would take over as
[2:39:05.040 --> 2:39:09.400]  the world army this is all designed on the cards and I've never seen them go
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:14.240]  wrong with their big plan and the CFR has said that 20 years ago they are just
[2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:19.240]  laughing at us how they've charted all of this out but we could have a new
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:23.920]  renaissance of liberty against these people if the public understands their
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:30.080]  crisis creation yes and also too you've got to understand that some that there's
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.520]  been so much subtle but ongoing constant training for me between three years or
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:39.440]  more that government is the supreme being on the planet instead of being the
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:43.640]  supreme servant of the people and the public has to realize they got to take
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:48.200]  that back and and really the politicians as you know are nothing like the
[2:39:48.200 --> 2:39:52.200]  images that are protected through the magazines and television they're
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:56.480]  basically actors but they still are responsible to the voters that they do
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:01.400]  want to get in and stay in but they've got to be held to the fire and and
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:05.440]  literally I mean short literally short honestly this has been discussed at the
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:10.520]  top as well short of a revolution with a philosophy to back it up as to where
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:16.360]  they're going with it the public don't have much of a chance unless unless
[2:40:16.360 --> 2:40:21.720]  there were massive demonstrations are going on every week in major cities
[2:40:21.720 --> 2:40:25.520]  capital cities across the world demanding to have their sovereign rights
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:29.720]  back again and to put the politicians back and well that's starting to happen
[2:40:29.720 --> 2:40:34.760]  that's starting to happen in Europe yeah yeah let's hope in Europe and some
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:38.600]  countries because they have caught on quicker they have memories some of the
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:43.440]  countries are being taken over by totalitarian powers there are communists
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:48.840]  ex-communist living in Canada who who tell me here it's more communistic here
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:52.680]  now than it was in the Soviet Union they see all the signs coming they know what's
[2:40:52.680 --> 2:40:58.280]  going on and unfortunately it's been the American people who've been lulled to
[2:40:58.280 --> 2:41:02.840]  sleep with all the trivia on their news and so on as all this is running
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:09.480]  through but some individuality is a key factor here because you see that again
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:13.880]  the United Nations admitted a long time ago on the research of this thing too
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:19.600]  that some individuality is their main enemy so they're trying to create the
[2:41:19.600 --> 2:41:23.320]  mass man the mass mind we were all politically correct we all agree about
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:28.120]  everything we're all group think and the individuality must be crushed they said
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:32.320]  well look at your again that individuality and that means that every
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:36.000]  individual has the right to speak regardless of what they want to talk
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:40.240]  about or say or even question and without that you're lost because the next
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:44.560]  step is to forbid you to even mention this new global system and they're
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:47.720]  trying to do that already by the way they're putting through into the military
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:53.960]  the Rand Corporation the NSA are now checking all military personnel to see
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:59.560]  if they're pro-government or what now called anti-government so this is on
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:03.560]  going now you're seeing the Soviet times system come into play yeah that's the
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.440]  attempt at intimidation but we need to boldly stand up and say it's not bad to
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:12.840]  be pro-second amendment private property and pro-family you were a bunch of
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:16.760]  sickos and they put out you know these TV ads showing the school teacher
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:20.760]  murdering children because they don't accept the new world government that
[2:42:20.760 --> 2:42:24.720]  blew up in their face the people are now learning that the Federal Reserve is
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:28.600]  private and is the enemy and Ron Paul has said that that's why we have a very
[2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:31.920]  good chance of winning because they tried to say there is no private Federal
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:35.600]  Reserve there is no world government being formed there is no plan to put
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.120]  military on the streets for our financial collapse but I turn on the
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:44.560]  local radio this morning and hear them reading my article on air Paul Watson's
[2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:48.400]  article government trains troops to run American cities and they took over 30
[2:42:48.400 --> 2:42:52.480]  calls while I was listening and seven out of ten or more said they've imploded
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:55.800]  the economy by design they're gonna try to take the pension funds this is a
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:59.320]  martial law takeover but then I heard people calling and saying yeah well I'm
[2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:02.440]  in the military yeah we're training for this but but we didn't you know the
[2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:06.640]  governments wants to protect you during the collapse but you know they've gone
[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:10.720]  from not being able to even talk about it to now it being out in the open and
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:13.640]  the host were even saying you know people that have actually made fun of me
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:18.720]  quite a bit that this is real that this is wrong that this is dangerous that
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:22.800]  they're doing gun confiscation drills but I did hear a father and he goes my
[2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:25.960]  sons of the Marines he is training for gun you know door-to-door gun
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:31.920]  confiscation what's wrong with that so so now they've gone from denying all
[2:43:31.920 --> 2:43:37.320]  this to it just now being announced now coming out in the open and I don't see
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:41.920]  them getting away with it even if they stage terror attacks Alan oh they do
[2:43:41.920 --> 2:43:45.640]  expect trouble there's no doubt about so they do expect trouble that they've
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:49.160]  even got some through all the again that they ran scenarios where they feed all
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:53.080]  the data through their massive computers just that it did during the Cold War and
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:56.200]  they have they have pretty good estimates of where the trouble will break
[2:43:56.200 --> 2:44:01.680]  out right down to how many numbers will be involved and so on the ways to
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:06.880]  retaliate calling soft retaliation and hard retaliation to call it the soft
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:12.680]  ones will be of course getting the active NGO groups to come out and pretend to
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:17.320]  to stand up for the people's rights to stop violence and so on and but if that
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:22.120]  fails then they'll bring out the hard military the hard power well said Alan
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:26.120]  we've got a part two article that I asked Watson to do that goes as a
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:31.280]  compliment to government-trained troops run American cities the new report is
[2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:36.400]  US troops to deal with rioting Americans globalists collapsing society to bring
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:42.200]  in martial law and Watson goes over all the army reports all the proof all the
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:47.320]  training all the things that are going on how the public is being trained to
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:52.240]  turn their guns in it is all up there at prisonplanet.com US troops to deal
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:56.840]  with rioting Americans it generally takes three hours for a search term we
[2:44:56.840 --> 2:45:06.200]  put out to become number one I plugged it at 1150 central so by by 250 or so we
[2:45:06.200 --> 2:45:09.560]  should know if we got the number one search term we normally do it is up to
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:15.800]  you search the term info wars.com put it in Google over and over again that will
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:19.640]  cause a big news frenzy wondering what it is it will lead them because then our
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:25.880]  stories you have that term in it to to info wars.com to prisonplanet.com also
[2:45:25.880 --> 2:45:31.280]  another search term is info wars without the calm info wars money bomb money
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.320]  bombs one word so two words info wars money bomb that search number two and in
[2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:38.920]  case they ban both those searches which they've done before also search Alex
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:44.160]  Jones that will lead people to the big money bomb are doing today and again I
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.200]  look at my children it's over for them we're going into this tyranny of what
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:52.040]  if we don't reverse this this is life and death that's why I'll work 18 hours a
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:55.960]  day I dream about this stuff every night I eat drink and sleep at so does Allen
[2:45:55.960 --> 2:46:04.360]  want so many others because this is so hardcore what we are facing and it looks
[2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:07.920]  like we have an updated it we're about to we've raised $150,000 that means
[2:46:07.920 --> 2:46:14.920]  $50,000 today in the last three hours we need to see so select we raise $50,000
[2:46:14.920 --> 2:46:18.840]  every three hours but I know overnight it won't be as good will we get our goal
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:26.360]  of 500,000 we can do the math on that but we need everybody to call 888-253-3139
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.200]  and donate especially all you middle-class people if you put out the

[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:40.960]  into the mass drugging of society and how they're even coming out and going

[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:48.720]  breast cancer yeah yeah you know we're you know fluoride's doing that yeah
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:52.280]  aspartame's killing you but so what I mean it's incredible how they're doing
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:58.960]  this again it was talked about by many to talk globalists back in the 50s
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:04.240]  and 60s that they would have to do this for world peace they called it and we
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:08.560]  find with Charles Galton Darwin the physicist and grandson of Charles Darwin
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:14.960]  he wrote a book called the next million years and he also was a scientist who
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:19.000]  worked on the Manhattan project with all the other top scientists he was at all
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:24.480]  the global meetings of course and he was allotted for his book on ways to bring
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:29.240]  down massively coal and reduce the populations but he said would have to
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:34.000]  use various drugs on the public and including hormones he says hormones to
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:38.800]  alter the physical makeup of the meals especially and make them more docile
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:43.560]  well that's why you've had all this kind of stuff put into your food and to your
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:49.160]  your plastic bottles even babies formula and the babies bottles as well and men
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:54.440]  now literally are almost infertile that there's so much data come out on BPA for
[2:48:54.440 --> 2:48:59.160]  instance has been banned in Canada just just yesterday or the day before although
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:03.920]  they aren't going to take it off the other products for two years so that I
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:07.400]  can see they I can actually see the physical effects on the young guys today
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:12.400]  there's no shoulders they're very narrow shoulders they're more effeminate now too
[2:49:12.400 --> 2:49:18.080]  and it's a deadly stuff but the big boys did say they would use hormones on the
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:23.120]  public they also said too that excesses of certain hormones that would affect
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:26.680]  women in a different manner they make them more masculine more aggressive and
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:31.640]  that has happened too and it's helped also to further destroy the family and
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:36.280]  admit it's all designed I mean you see short couples and the children look like
[2:49:36.280 --> 2:49:42.840]  them but the mom's 5 5 the dad's 5 10 their daughter 6 2 and their and their
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:47.960]  you know their aqua line they look like amazons but they're like a tree that
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:52.400]  grows too fast they've got the breasts by the time they're 30 of an 80 year old
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:56.160]  woman from the bisphenol a and they're going to die so I mean they're
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:49:59.120]  murdering our women and and and you know the average yuppie just makes it's
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:03.640]  funny yes they are and of course with all inoculations and the cancers and the
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:08.840]  virus the viruses and inoculations that was part of it too if you go through
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:14.240]  the first major inoculation process that they've been on with the Salk vaccine
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:19.520]  and I never said that he was a great savior for polio and I think Florence
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:22.840]  with the polio was hyped out of proportion just like the flu was this
[2:50:22.840 --> 2:50:26.120]  wine flew the non-existence that was to put the sv-40 in that they admit killed
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:30.040]  hundreds of millions globally that's right and it's not new what they were
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:34.000]  putting in that there was many other it varies than there are two from the live
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:37.320]  viruses hold on talk about that when we come back because we have the clip from

[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:52.160]  much good news out there though and and and I understand the globalists have
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:59.720]  tried to cover all the angles but I mean they are destroying this system and you
[2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:02.920]  know as you said we don't have a choice we've got to fight back against this.
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:08.000]  There is no choice you have no choice because I don't think people understand
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:15.440]  what a Sovietized bureaucracy ruling over you means and this is what you have
[2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:19.400]  this is the third way that's what they meant by Alvin Toffer wrote the book
[2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:23.160]  too it's called The Third Wave it's emerging but as it planned it came out
[2:56:23.160 --> 2:56:27.040]  under the Rees Commission but Norman Dodds up on YouTube somewhere he
[2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:31.920]  explains that the foundation said their job was to change the culture radically
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:35.600]  altered so much in the Western countries including America that could blend
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:40.000]  it seamlessly with that of the Soviet system. And who is their main apprentice
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:46.120]  Professor Newt Genrich the pro-carbon tax globalist? That's right and he's also
[2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:51.080]  ahead of the annual meeting for the world scientists to do with the shipping
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:56.320]  individuals worldwide the first one they held was in 2000 at Loyola
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:00.240]  University where they talked about successfully trying you know implanting
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:03.920]  chips in the brain they did say there's a system ready to go all they had to do
[2:57:03.920 --> 2:57:07.920]  now was train the public through fiction through movies and so on and
[2:57:07.920 --> 2:57:13.160]  Emily Young had to accept it and want it. Now I want you to continue with that in
[2:57:13.160 --> 2:57:17.840]  the next hour and we're gonna open the phones up for Alvin Watt about the
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:27.000]  money bomb why you're supporting the money bomb 1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.560]  but I want you to understand we have the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:34.760]  they're on the websites it's public they are poisoning the food and water they
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:38.560]  are adding stuff to the vaccines this is real I mean get out of your trance
[2:57:38.560 --> 2:57:44.320]  and I'm even telling myself this physically realize how incredible it is
[2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:46.840]  they're doing this you got interrupted by the break we're about to go to break
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:50.880]  again but get back into the stuff they're putting in vaccines. Yeah well
[2:57:50.880 --> 2:57:54.880]  again to members Dr. Salk before he became the champion and the hero of the
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:59.480]  common folk with this polio vaccine was also the head of the British and
[2:57:59.480 --> 2:58:04.240]  American Eugenics Society who advocated to buy many papers which he wrote which
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:09.400]  are up there on that massive reduction and sterilization of the general public
[2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:13.840]  and suddenly becomes the hero is saving you with vaccines and then from 50s
[2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:18.840]  onwards the sperm count in the mail goes plummeting down year by year by year
[2:58:18.840 --> 2:58:23.320]  this is all tied together these guys don't sit at world meetings discussing
[2:58:23.320 --> 2:58:27.920]  something for Santa Claus to grant them a Christmas they go ahead and they
[2:58:27.920 --> 2:58:32.120]  actually implement it because they do believe that they have the right to
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:36.840]  govern the public do as they wish with the public at the near worst to save the

[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:20.080]  being part of it thanks to all of you that are supporting us we couldn't do
[3:01:20.080 --> 3:01:25.320]  any of this without you okay Alan you were getting into the Dr. Sock to head
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:29.640]  you Genesis well he killed a lot of people they released the virus it's in
[3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:33.600]  CBS news that all over the world they go and inject people with the new polio and
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:37.660]  then it's live polio and then they say oh we got a vaccine everybody now there's
[3:01:37.660 --> 3:01:42.120]  been a polio outbreak we caused I mean they just brazenly are murdering us
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:47.440]  right out in the open that in Africa earlier this year they gave them at the
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:51.920]  spray and mist I think it was and the sugar-coated ones and the United
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:55.280]  Nations World Health Organization of all people because they generally hush it
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:59.800]  all up they're the ones who advocated this admitted now that this vaccine they
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:04.760]  gave the Africans had had mutated into a super polio
[3:02:04.760 --> 3:02:09.920]  they cannot stop so this is an agenda they don't make these kind of mistakes
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:13.920]  that that's all burn the lab laboratories with the same thing happen
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:19.960]  remember too with the with millions of women being sterilized chemically by
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:25.440]  being given and three injections by the World Health Organization to protect
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:30.920]  miss supposedly in India and Africa and admitted later on they had done it and
[3:02:30.920 --> 3:02:35.200]  they justified that the people had to be sterilized and who else is going to do
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:40.280]  it they won't do it themselves and yet they actually admitted that's a 30
[3:02:40.280 --> 3:02:44.400]  different separate laboratories across Europe somehow we're all contaminated
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:49.560]  with particular chemical which went straight for the ovaries caused massive
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:53.520]  inflation and then literally killed them off eyebrows them off till they were
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:59.240]  useless so chemical basically sterilization is a favorite to pipe
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:02.680]  yeah they added a hormone to the tetanus shot that bound with it and caused
[3:03:02.680 --> 3:03:08.320]  the target to the ovaries yeah again ladies and gentlemen we're gonna go to
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:11.040]  break and come back with calls but I want to start getting into this now all
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:15.240]  of the killing the soft killing that's been going on it they admit is just
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:21.280]  beta testing but that's why insiders like Dr. Erpianca says with this weird
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:25.960]  crazy cult look he gets all these awards all over the world for it soon we're
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:31.640]  all gonna die the airborne Ebola is coming it's going to be beautiful I'm
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:35.320]  sad for my wife and children and I that will die but I'm ready for the earth
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:39.280]  then I criticize him and his graduate students we then search their names
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:43.000]  send us their their their their graduate papers saying all humans should be
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:46.760]  killed and then you pull up their names that they are in white lab coats at
[3:03:46.760 --> 3:03:51.400]  government facilities you know I mean I mean they are just there and they're
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:55.720]  like a death cult and they show videos on TV and at movie theaters of children
[3:03:55.720 --> 3:03:59.080]  being murdered by the government for the earth and it's good and they're just a
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:02.640]  death cult of murdering pure evil and they're so brainwashed that they're low
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.960]  level priests like Pianca and others and Peter Singer are like yes the death is
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:13.680]  coming it's beautiful total death total death I mean it's just a satanic cult
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:18.640]  straight out of hell yes and they do definitely recruits the fringe elements
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:23.280]  in society the ones who have a big chick on their shoulders and who love this
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:26.800]  type of thing they join these groups are very radical they're promoted they're
[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:32.360]  funded by the big foundations again to demand to go from government pretending
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:35.640]  that they're demanding on behalf the public of course the certain laws get
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:40.000]  enacted and that's why your energy taxes are going to go sky high as part of it
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:44.360]  so there will be food rationing coming along in this new world order there's no
[3:04:44.360 --> 3:04:46.960]  doubt they have lots of they've announced that's part of it they say you

[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:01.840]  just been a test and they are clearly getting everybody with all these TV
[3:09:01.840 --> 3:09:06.800]  shows and movies and nonfiction shows about mega viruses are going to develop
[3:09:06.800 --> 3:09:09.960]  naturally in the wild and kill almost everybody and the governments of the
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:13.160]  world are accelerating their big bunkers for themselves and their
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:17.000]  emergency seed vaults and they're putting out all this GMO stuff I want
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.840]  you to understand ladies and gentlemen that this is life and death that's why

[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:40.360]  economy because they've done it in third world countries over and over again
[3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:44.160]  they said in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents that got leaked they were
[3:09:44.160 --> 3:09:50.120]  going to do it here you understand it's going to happen unless you go absolutely
[3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:54.440]  wild getting the word out and start caring and start getting angry if I
[3:09:54.440 --> 3:09:58.040]  walked up to you and your wife eating at a cafe at 7 p.m. one night in Austin

[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:26.600]  myself focus realize the cost realize what we're facing I mean this is real
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:31.640]  do you understand that and we're on an express elevator to Hades right now and
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.160]  the churches are all government paid off the big ones and saying submit it's the
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:38.080]  end of the world go you know go along with all this you're going to be
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:42.720]  raptured out the Bible clearly says that after Christ returns that the dead in
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:45.520]  Christ are raised that the beast will wage war against the saints and
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:49.120]  overcome them but that they wake everybody up there's a huge revival now
[3:10:49.120 --> 3:10:52.520]  even if you're not a Christian the point is this this this idea of it's the end
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:57.160]  of the world a 2012 notice they've engineered 2012 off some quackery with
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:00.200]  the Mayan calendar when the Mayan calendar I've gone down there and talk
[3:11:00.200 --> 3:11:04.720]  to top archaeologists people who are Mayan who are archaeologists and they
[3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:08.840]  say no it just means the end of the age 2012 a new hearth will be lit
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:14.080]  basically Sun God worship and it's not even true but but notice the Pentagon
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:17.480]  says 2012 total collapse the British Ministry of Defense says it it's all
[3:11:17.480 --> 3:11:22.960]  public documents Paul Watson has it in his article that is up on prison planet
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:26.680]  calm we're getting it moved over to info wars comm as well US troops to deal
[3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:30.640]  with rioting Americans it shows the military admitting it it shows that oh
[3:11:30.640 --> 3:11:36.400]  there's a crisis a collapse coming into 2012 so that's another for people that
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:39.680]  aren't Christian they said what do we do a lot of Christians you know 150 years
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:44.800]  ago the big banks openly with Scofield and others took over the churches and
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:48.880]  said don't worry about fighting evil like our founders in 1776 led by the
[3:11:48.880 --> 3:11:52.920]  black brigade the pastors it's the end of the world and you're not supposed to
[3:11:52.920 --> 3:11:58.400]  fight evil God will handle it all and captain Kirk will beam you up not in the
[3:11:58.400 --> 3:12:05.560]  Bible not in the Bible okay after the foul after the devils thrown into the pit
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:11.240]  from the Christian perspective here okay the dead in Christ are raised and then
[3:12:11.240 --> 3:12:14.680]  Christ comes back for a thousand year reign and then the serpent is loosed
[3:12:14.680 --> 3:12:21.440]  again for a short time okay it's all clear as day it's all a lie 2012 is all
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:25.920]  a lie they said what do we do half the world in Christian or more what we do
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:30.640]  well we give them a new age baloney 2012 and promote it so everybody feels like
[3:12:30.640 --> 3:12:34.440]  there's no hope it's and I see all these dumb yuppies on YouTube going so what I
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:37.640]  hope we do have war I hope the whole world's nuked humanity's not worth it
[3:12:37.640 --> 3:12:42.720]  they're making it cute to not care cute to be nihilistic Alan what can you speak
[3:12:42.720 --> 3:12:47.120]  to that and then we're going to calls yes it is nihilistic but remember to the
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:52.880]  big players who worked in the big world think tanks and when across the the top
[3:12:52.880 --> 3:12:58.280]  Ivy League universities to talk to the future leaders of the world like Alters
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:02.640]  Huxley talked about this the society coming up get the Bertrand Russell doing
[3:13:02.640 --> 3:13:06.960]  the same thing Lord Bertrand Russell and Bertrand Russell also worked with for
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:11.960]  MI5 at one point you can't trust any of these guys however he did say Russell
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:15.600]  said we shall create a condition of apathy amongst the general public
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:20.800]  towards the end and when you look at a place like Britain that's had maybe 30
[3:13:20.800 --> 3:13:25.520]  40 years of increasing apathy until you don't know what Britain even is anymore
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:31.080]  you've had so much propaganda psychological warfare mass immigration so
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:35.880]  much immigration that Tony Blair said hopefully Tony Blair said hopefully this
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:40.440]  will be the the end of Britain as we know it and as far as this culture goes
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:45.240]  and the more immigrants we bring in he said from diverse countries the less
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:48.800]  chance they could ever go back to British culture members of the British
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:52.960]  parliament on who admit most the CPS workers and police now are foreigners
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:56.840]  because they enjoy coming in and pushing people around yes that is a fact and
[3:13:56.840 --> 3:14:00.880]  a given priority to do it and and authority to do it so they act that
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:04.400]  the part very well because they come from countries that have never known
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:08.560]  anything about voting or democracy and they're used to just working for the
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:12.840]  big boss and get and pay for it and that's what they're doing now remember
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:18.400]  too also in the US I think it was Kissinger statement to California
[3:14:18.400 --> 3:14:23.480]  there back in the 70s he said under the right circumstances that the
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:28.480]  US would be glad to see the blue helmets coming in from the UN and he was
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:32.560]  talking about what's coming up shortly in the future food riots that kind of
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:36.840]  stuff coming up because food has been taken over over mid-since World War
[3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:40.640]  two has been encroachment by governments and government authorities
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:43.600]  working with the United Nations Agricultural Department know the
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:47.520]  Agriculture Department in the US and the same as you know I've read the quotes
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:50.960]  here we've had the farm you know a rice groups on they they come and tell the
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:55.760]  farmers get big or get out work for mega agribus that's a quote get big or get
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:00.680]  out and now they've got the food safety bills or you can't even grow tomatoes or
[3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:08.360]  or avocado or or grapes anything oranges apples pears you can grow nothing and
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:13.080]  sell it yes and also now you got swap teams literally swap teams attacking
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.400]  dairies for goodness sake because they're they're giving out wholesome milk that
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:21.160]  hasn't been neutered because there hasn't been a pasteurized and everything
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:25.400]  destroyed in it and they've even just confiscating cheeses natural cheeses
[3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:30.480]  and all the rest of it swap teams with guns drawn going in to farmers at that's
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:35.160]  utter tyranny and if you can't see that right now and stop that right now by the
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:39.080]  way we have a surveillance video from the little farmers market store they
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:42.240]  happen to have a camera and it shows the cops come in and the people are
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:45.360]  peaceful just you know hippy standing there and they pulled guns and say get
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:49.200]  on the ground get on the ground you're selling oranges and then they go to
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:53.040]  Amish people's houses now and they're saying no dust is allowed to be released
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:56.560]  when you till the earth and they're taking their farms and and their swat

[3:17:58.320 --> 3:18:01.840]  keep their aggression they want to keep their fertility I see articles about
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:04.640]  David Rockefeller I saw it mainstream news out looking last week I'd already
[3:18:04.640 --> 3:18:08.760]  seen it before but how he has little farms all over the US for all his food
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:12.480]  it's flown everywhere he goes Prince Philip does this I've seen him in a
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:16.560]  documentary they understand what's going on and they have the antidotes as well
[3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:23.600]  to all the weapons they've launched on us and and so it's just incredible it's
[3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:31.120]  incredible what you realize even going back to the farming remember too that's
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:37.720]  the heads of the CEO of the United Nations Agricultural Department stated
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:44.200]  years ago that that's a farming was too important to be left to farmers they
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:48.560]  wanted to eradicate all small farmers and only the big agribusiness would be
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:53.480]  allowed to have farm at all now we're watching ourselves being corralled with
[3:18:53.480 --> 3:18:58.200]  but our water our foods being taken away from us our right to even grow our own
[3:18:58.200 --> 3:19:02.240]  food taken away from us that's that's that's you've had enough to get anybody
[3:19:02.240 --> 3:19:06.720]  up in arms because when that happens as a standard water technique food and
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:10.960]  water is your basic survival without that you've had it and we sit back
[3:19:10.960 --> 3:19:16.040]  calmly thinking the grocery stores will always be full of all the process
[3:19:16.040 --> 3:19:20.600]  rubbish to the bar but you'll forget too there was a small farmers they got
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:23.920]  them through the last depression there were so many small farms around who had
[3:19:23.920 --> 3:19:28.280]  stopped to sell to the public when they couldn't get food this time when it went
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:31.640]  when they really crunch as the next time there's gonna be no small farms left to
[3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:35.440]  go to people left in government wants that they want you with a ration card
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:41.040]  and big brother will dish out your soul of your food for the week all right stay

[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:02.320]  pro stuff you're talking about but what's your question or comment for for our
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:06.520]  guest I'm trying to find out a more about Newt Gingrich in the in the brain
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:10.080]  chipping you know it's a loyal university is there any links out there today is
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:14.840]  there any you know any videos on YouTube they all make oh yeah the first
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:19.880]  year at he held the meeting he opened the meeting with his initial address he's
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:22.320]  written books about it Gingrich has written you can just search newt
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:26.440]  Gingrich a micro chipping and you'll get the minutes of it and the quotes from
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:29.840]  his book sorry I just want to give folks a source yeah and there was also the
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:34.680]  first meeting at Loyola University came out with 600 pages for the
[3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:38.920]  university and I managed to get it downloaded before they took it off but
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:43.760]  there's still a partial a link with partial transcripts are still up there
[3:26:43.760 --> 3:26:47.440]  and I have at my archives at cuttingsforthemetrics.com if you go in
[3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:52.680]  there and look for it you'll find it there but it says five maybe four
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:57.280]  hundred pages left in it but the original one was 600 pages they had the top
[3:26:57.280 --> 3:27:02.880]  scientists and bio special fields and so on into their meeting the one from
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:09.320]  Tokyo Japan said that they developed a brain ship which would interface with
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:12.480]  the protein of the brain it would be indistinguishable so would not be
[3:27:12.480 --> 3:27:18.240]  rejected and it was all ready to go he said think of this world coming up as
[3:27:18.240 --> 3:27:23.560]  the hive society the hive and he said there be no more individuality will be
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:27.360]  impossible for the individual who's chipped to even think of themselves as a
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:31.440]  distinct individual because everyone will be connected with centralized
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.120]  regional computers and it said you'll hear whispers going through your head
[3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:40.720]  of the communications from the central computers to the individuals around you
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:44.840]  and to you and going back again and when I hit when I when I heard that I thought
[3:27:44.840 --> 3:27:48.880]  that he's talking about the board from Star Trek this is exactly what they're
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:53.000]  talking about only no Star Trek is predictive programming explain what
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:28:00.640]  that is to people it is absolutely and the thing is too this hive mentality
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:04.720]  they want is for the general population but not for themselves at the top
[3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:08.680]  because Charles Galtman Darwin a big player in the 50s through through his
[3:28:08.680 --> 3:28:12.600]  lifetime at the top world meetings with the United Nations all the big players
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:17.320]  and foundations he said we we heard who are the world leaders we who are the
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:21.920]  elite mustn't chip ourselves it says our alter ourselves chemically or through
[3:28:21.920 --> 3:28:25.800]  hormones it says that's for the public to make it to be the more peaceable and
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:31.920]  and accommodating he said we are must retain our wild qualities our ability
[3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:35.600]  for self-preservation the public won't need that because the state will be
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:39.600]  making all their decisions for them yep it's all on record Tony good to hear

[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:56.680]  who throws down ten thousand dollars and get like all the books and videos and
[3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:00.600]  everything you know that that's good and great but I I might recommend putting it
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:03.640]  out there to say hey if you're gonna put down ten thousand dollars for this
[3:29:03.640 --> 3:29:07.320]  what do you want to get out of it and maybe have some more cut collaborative

[3:36:07.880 --> 3:36:12.040]  California the day before I was and it's just a funny coincidence yeah that's a
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:16.240]  great back-to-back Alan my question for you is I live in British Columbia here
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:20.880]  and our Premier Gordon Campbell and as you know he was at the Bilderberg meeting
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:23.600]  earlier this year what do you think they have planned for him and what do you
[3:36:23.600 --> 3:36:25.880]  think his agenda is while he's still here in office
[3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:32.200]  old Prime Minister ship go ahead yeah well he's definitely a party these guys that
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:37.480]  you think you're elect are picked by we have our own Canadian Council on Foreign
[3:36:37.480 --> 3:36:43.640]  Relations here and every every Prime Minister or Minister of the government
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:47.560]  or the provinces has picked way in advance years before you even hear
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:50.480]  their names they're groomed for the positions they even told when they'll be
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:54.640]  put into power and this is the con of democracy but there's no doubt about it
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:59.920]  so the British Columbia I've got books going back to the 1930s by the Council
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:04.360]  on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs where
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:07.920]  they had their meetings in Australia and they said they were talking about the
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:13.680]  populations of Canada and the maximum population that could sustain etc at that
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:17.680]  time they said about 30 odd million but they would have to add more from for
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:22.280]  immigration from China to the West Coast to Canada and it happens because that
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:27.240]  would become the British Columbia would become basically the porting city for
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:31.200]  all the goods and the trade that would come from China and lots of Chinese would
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:35.240]  have to move in and be the managerial class to take that on that
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:39.880]  responsibility with their language and so on so I've lived long enough to see
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:44.360]  that happen and these guys were talking about in the 30s when China was still a
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:48.200]  third-world country they didn't have factories had nothing we built the
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:52.240]  factories through the gap treaties from the World Trade Organization we funded
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:37:56.320]  them up into the strength Canada trained most their engineers from the 70s
[3:37:56.320 --> 3:38:00.640]  onwards when they didn't even have factories to go back to working so these
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:04.840]  guys work century the simple centuries worked out in advance well it's a
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:09.400]  subset of lords under the British feudal system where they even get families
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:14.920]  that continually in power like the bushes and others as a subset so it's
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:20.280]  it's really hereditary power as hereditary power and they also get a lot
[3:38:20.280 --> 3:38:24.400]  so I gotta admit so there's a lot of sexual deviancy amongst the power elite
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:27.920]  and they all they've all come out with a little scandals here and there and of
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:32.040]  course they close ranks together at the top and cover each other up but some
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:37.440]  these guys are sworn to their cause they do believe they'll get a kick up
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:40.960]  stairs into the better quality food all that kind of stuff that they already get
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:44.880]  that when they're getting to that the whole family gets it passes for the
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:48.240]  better quality foods that are untampered with non-gmo all that stuff
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:52.120]  and that's well look at germany with the flu shot last year it turned out the
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:57.000]  the ruling class and the politicians all got a special quote clean one yeah
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:39:00.120]  well and not only that the government refused to take it they said if this is
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:05.160]  untested if he gets sick who's going to run the country so they're not so
[3:39:05.160 --> 3:39:09.160]  stupid after all they know what they're doing this that the flu of course
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:13.280]  injection is this it's just more bioengineering on us Peter Peter that
[3:39:13.280 --> 3:39:17.560]  is an amazing question anything else I know I just look forward next weekend
[3:39:17.560 --> 3:39:21.120]  listen to you all right thank you look forward to shaking your hand let's talk
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:28.280]  to Chris in Texas I want to move quick now Chris go ahead hello yes Chris hi
[3:39:28.280 --> 3:39:32.800]  Alex I've been listening to you show for quite some time and and this is the
[3:39:32.800 --> 3:39:39.040]  first time for me to call in and I just wanted to tell well you all were
[3:39:39.040 --> 3:39:45.680]  talking about property and how that is so important in there in the fight
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:50.960]  against this global system you know slaves are not supposed to have property
[3:39:50.960 --> 3:39:55.480]  and they're not supposed to have guns and its feudalism to pay a yearly tax on
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:39:58.080]  your land we don't really own our property now they got rid of that with
[3:39:58.080 --> 3:40:02.600]  property taxes and there's now a federal property tax in the healthcare bill
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:08.480]  five percent on all property all real estate yes and and and the republicans
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:12.680]  you know a lot of people are going to vote republican but the republicans now
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:18.880]  in Texas are calling for statewide property tax and you know they want to
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:23.160]  take it out of the local control right now that the county judges in each
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:29.480]  county determines the property rate and I didn't know that and when I found that
[3:40:29.480 --> 3:40:33.640]  out I ran I'm running yeah it's got to be centralized in the state so gonna be
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:36.960]  passed on to the federal and then the international government Chris great
[3:40:36.960 --> 3:40:41.880]  points Alan want yes of course you're quite right when you know that's been
[3:40:41.880 --> 3:40:45.160]  nail in the head actually when you said or when you said that without some
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:48.960]  property you're a slave without rights to food you're a slave when you're
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:53.720]  dependent on everything you need food shelter clothing water for survival if
[3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:57.240]  you don't have rights to that you are a slave so that's the bottom line they're
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:02.280]  bringing you into a new form of slavery and it is the authoritarian system which
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:06.960]  the club of Rome demanded they get brought in it's very elementary if
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:10.440]  slaves are independent they're gonna run off and be a self-sufficient but if
[3:41:10.440 --> 3:41:14.280]  they've got to have you they'll actually compete to be padded on the head by the
[3:41:14.280 --> 3:41:18.880]  slave master yes and if you own property if you own property technically
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:23.160]  without taxes and you should have paid no taxes on them you can survive a
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:28.800]  depression you can survive anything you can leave and they need that tax so if
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:32.400]  you don't have their money they can take your property that's right and so we
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:35.920]  were being trained and trained and trained at private properties bad as a
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:40.400]  dodgy risk to take on etc just rent rent rent and eventually you'll go in
[3:41:40.400 --> 3:41:44.040]  to see the world that they're bringing in is what they call a socialist system
[3:41:44.040 --> 3:41:49.760]  and everyone must be dependent upon the government to make them behave and go
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:53.520]  along with all the rules contained within the socialist system remember it's an
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:57.920]  authoritarian system people with private property tend to get rather indignant
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:00.600]  and stand up for their rights especially when it comes to keeping their
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:04.120]  property and they have fought them down through the ages one of the biggest
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:07.960]  problems the ancient Rome had the same thing again the centers were passing
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:13.520]  laws taxing that the peasants have eventually helped overthrow a Rome
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:17.360]  along with invaders they actually joined side with invaders to get rid of all
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:20.960]  these senators that had dropped their land from them stolen land and their
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:25.360]  houses all right thank you so much Chris let's talk I gotta move quick now
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:27.640]  cuz I got two other issues I gotta hit with Alan we appreciate him joining us
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:33.880]  Julio and Illinois good to hear from you welcome okay he's not there we'll let
[3:42:33.880 --> 3:42:38.800]  him go let's talk to Steve in California Steve you're on the air yeah
[3:42:38.800 --> 3:42:43.840]  thank you Alan Steve here in California listen I go back in the
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:47.840]  Patriot Network network a while quite a while back and I'm wondering if you saw
[3:42:47.840 --> 3:42:54.680]  in LA Times that they were using foreign troops also came out in the BBC they had
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:43:00.280]  a mock-up town doing car searches and searching for guns and they interviewed
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:04.600]  it came out on the BBC what are you practicing for to the Chinese general
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:09.680]  he said the invasion of America yeah no years ago that was in the 90s and it'll
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:14.280]  pop my head they had the cooperative nugget 1 2 and 3 and they and they had
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:18.160]  the general on video effect Google general says that troops are part of the
[3:43:18.160 --> 3:43:21.880]  New World Order and it'll come up cooperative nugget general says troops
[3:43:21.880 --> 3:43:24.400]  are part of the world order and he goes it's in fact it's one of my police state
[3:43:24.400 --> 3:43:27.800]  films he goes you are part of our wonderful New World Order battle force
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:32.280]  it's all these foreigners and they train with role-players that are Americans
[3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:37.320]  to take them down Alan want yes and we bring in all kinds of troops and the
[3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:43.360]  Canadian bases for the last 20 years and training them the ex-soviet troops
[3:43:43.360 --> 3:43:47.720]  train in different bases in Canada as mainly officers who train and what are
[3:43:47.720 --> 3:43:52.320]  taught is civil laws of the country and the area and so that when they bring in
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:56.240]  the main troops they already know how to follow the localized of the laws
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:02.000]  etc. and first exactly first they're getting us trained to have regular troops
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:06.560]  and then as part of NLE09 it's foreign troops and now it's Israeli spying in
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:09.600]  Pennsylvania and everywhere else they're just the cops are like here's the
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:13.240]  Israelis here's the Chinese here's the Czech Republic here's the brettes and
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:16.480]  the cops literally in fact they send our SWAT teams over to Iraq to learn how to
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:20.080]  do it that was in the Fort Hood newspaper the Fort Hood Sentinel brave
[3:44:20.080 --> 3:44:24.960]  rifles train with APD and literally the cops just salute to Chinese you name
[3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:28.120]  it I'm ready to crush the American people who I mean that's basically what
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:34.520]  this is it is and also remember too you see that the when he signed the treaty
[3:44:34.520 --> 3:44:40.200]  at San Francisco 1946 for the United Nations every president and prime
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:44.640]  minister has signed away then the sovereign rights of the country to to
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:49.800]  decide its own fate and destiny back back then and any country which tries to
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:54.000]  pull out of this coming global order they've been working towards and we're
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:58.000]  working through we're all part of it really right now will be called a rogue
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:01.560]  state and then all the other United Nations countries will bring the troops
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:05.720]  and to get them back under control that's what this is all about and they've
[3:45:05.720 --> 3:45:09.760]  got all the predictive programming movies and TV where the UN lands to
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:13.240]  restore order because states are breaking away during an economic collapse
[3:45:13.240 --> 3:45:17.680]  yeah and you know that's part of it too because they know they can bring it on
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:23.200]  so badly with the lack of cash banks failure devaluation of the dollar the
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:27.640]  lack of food whatever bring it all on at the same time and there will be chaos
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:31.760]  obviously even amongst it is the society where where those who have the least
[3:45:31.760 --> 3:45:36.880]  sored out the least whatever will start rising to steal from other people that
[3:45:36.880 --> 3:45:40.360]  will be the excuse to bring in to bring in these troops and now they're on the
[3:45:40.360 --> 3:45:43.480]  news going we really have trained the troops to take over your local towns
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:47.360]  but it can also be for Afghanistan and the army times you know but you'll see
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:51.200]  the line in one newspaper like oh it's for overseas and you actually read the
[3:45:51.200 --> 3:45:54.720]  army times and what they're on no it's for America to we're here learning how
[3:45:54.720 --> 3:46:00.120]  to take the city over and going back eight years ago here is a I think it's
[3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:05.160]  seven years ago a clip from 60 minutes where they have signs that say give
[3:46:05.160 --> 3:46:08.840]  peace a chance follow the Constitution I've been to these drills where they're
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.240]  training to take on Americans this is what's really happening this is what's
[3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:19.640]  going on let's play a brief clip of the pain ray being used on and by the way I
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:25.720]  didn't see that pain ray article in Paul Joseph Watson's story let's make sure
[3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:34.760]  he posts that that CBS story about that and while they're finding that clip I
[3:46:34.760 --> 3:46:38.920]  just want to put on screen and let people know something interesting happened
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:42.440]  I've never had people search the term Alex Jones before I've never searched my
[3:46:42.440 --> 3:46:46.160]  name in Google Trends I've been told it's been in the top ten before just on
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:52.200]  its own but when we started plugging the name Alex Jones at 1150 and you can go
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:56.760]  back several days and you see that there's already giant traffic before we
[3:46:56.760 --> 3:47:01.700]  plugged it searching the name Alex Jones giant traffic searching the name Alex
[3:47:01.700 --> 3:47:07.360]  Jones on the graph do we have that 60 minutes now or are we keep almost there
[3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:11.500]  we had to queue it back up okay but Alan remember the head of the Air Force
[3:47:11.500 --> 3:47:17.000]  came out and said we need to use pain ray on Americans first mm-hmm yes they will
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:22.160]  use that on Americans first they've had this stuff actually since the 1950s
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:26.960]  even small portable units that they can put in their pocket and use on you but
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:31.960]  the big ones of course have shown in the military demo vehicles are shown up on
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:36.840]  Google at testing this stuff out on civilians and believe me it can work
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:41.560]  but the other big things your members to if you remember Tiananmen Square and the
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:45.480]  reporters said that the they brought again troops from the north of China that
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:50.240]  were Mongolian who really are almost apart from the Chinese so yet they
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:52.960]  always bring in foreigners who have nothing in common with the ones that
[3:47:52.960 --> 3:47:58.720]  they were they use southern Chinese to go into Tibet so there's no a racial
[3:47:58.720 --> 3:48:02.880]  connection there in the borderlands we do have the workers their porters also
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:06.920]  said that these these troops were hyped up really hyped up on some kind of drugs
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:11.480]  now the troops today in the United Nations Army all troops are into but
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:16.520]  seven to nine drugs each prescribed drugs by the military and these guys are
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:20.840]  going to bring in literally are like zombies like trained zombies and then
[3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:23.960]  they're addicted and get met a mental problems then they get to take their
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:28.320]  right to guns after they're out hence the blackwater filings in federal court
[3:48:28.320 --> 3:48:32.800]  where the piles of cocaine steroids running around naked shooting up family
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:37.480]  for enjoyment they are creating the army of hell that's right look totally just
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:42.640]  totally wicked burzarking the equivalent of of orcs or something from Lord of
[3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:47.320]  the Rings the Urakai or something half man half orc let's go ahead and play
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:52.000]  that clip from 60 minutes here it is which is being tested at Moody Air Force
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:54.760]  Base in South Georgia
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:49:00.040]  targets here are people military volunteers creating a scenario soldiers
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:06.640]  might encounter in iraq angry protesters advancing on American troops
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:12.120]  who have to choose between backing down or opening fire off in the distance a
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:18.240]  half mile away the operator of the ray gun has the crowd in his sights
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:29.280]  unlike the soldiers on the ground he has no qualms about firing away because
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:36.120]  his weapon won't injure anyone he squeezes off a blast the first shot hits
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:47.400]  like an invisible punch protesters regroup any fires again and again finally
[3:49:47.400 --> 3:49:52.480]  they've had enough the ray gun drives them away with no harm done officially
[3:49:52.480 --> 3:49:56.760]  called the active denial okay it does penetrate now they have these out at
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:01.320]  tea party sound cannons it's the same announcements and they have provocateurs
[3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:05.240]  cause problems they have a pretext to attack you this is their control grid now
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:10.040]  I want to play a new clip and we have again this report but notice they say
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:13.800]  it's for Afghanistan no it's not they put again and Watson has all the army's
[3:50:13.800 --> 3:50:17.960]  own admissions this is for the United States it has the dual use of Afghanistan
[3:50:17.960 --> 3:50:21.360]  but I heard troops calling on the radio this morning on 590 am saying yes it's
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:26.880]  good this is all good you know yeah the economy is collapsing we're going to
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:32.080]  take over so they're so they're now even telling the troops all of this they're
[3:50:32.080 --> 3:50:36.080]  now even admitting all of this to the troops themselves while we're queuing
[3:50:36.080 --> 3:50:41.400]  that up Alan your comments on it yes and remember to these pain rays that I
[3:50:41.400 --> 3:50:45.840]  turn on microwave technology have different settings on them and they
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:50.480]  have a two major settings one is the minor settings at a certain point once
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:55.440]  the key in the top settings and have used this in Iraq it's up on Google they
[3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:59.200]  can they literally fry the people they've done it not people in a bus in
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:03.960]  Iraq as well documented by video you see these shrunken bodies literally shrinks
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:07.960]  the body and the complete takes all the moisture out and you're left with these
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:12.560]  four and a half feet long ex-human beings this is the kind of stuff they're
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:18.720]  going to use back home in America yeah and the next video clip is linked up in
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:22.400]  the article by Paul Watson government trains troops to run American cities and
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:24.840]  we had that at the start I'm not sure we're gonna be able to have it before
[3:51:24.840 --> 3:51:28.800]  this hour ends but it's it's all up in the article government trains troops to
[3:51:28.800 --> 3:51:33.320]  run American cities and Paul Watson has a second article on that US troops to
[3:51:33.320 --> 3:51:37.720]  deal with riding Americans but the good news is that we play this Christopher
[3:51:37.720 --> 3:51:42.200]  Monkton bombshell interview coming up I'll be able to come back it's it's
[3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:45.320]  ready now here is the clip I'm gonna get Alan watch take on it here it is
[3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:50.920]  starting the day's activities off with a five mile run this is a government one
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:57.440]  on one day the city of Watertown in the third BCT and we felt this was a good
[3:51:57.440 --> 3:52:02.360]  way to kick the day off we'll be spending the morning talking about local
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:08.080]  governance and spending the afternoon doing some tours of city facilities to
[3:52:08.080 --> 3:52:14.440]  include water wastewater hydroelectric this morning's run was really a part of
[3:52:14.440 --> 3:52:18.360]  our program piece the rock program we've partnered with several communities
[3:52:18.360 --> 3:52:22.880]  Watertown being one of them our 287 infantry battalion partners with
[3:52:22.880 --> 3:52:28.480]  Watertown but it's also part of a program we're calling government 101 where
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:32.040]  we actually learn from the city officials here in Watertown on how to
[3:52:32.040 --> 3:52:36.120]  provide services the third brigade combat team will use the information that
[3:52:36.120 --> 3:52:40.800]  they obtained today from the city and apply that over in Afghanistan to help
[3:52:40.800 --> 3:52:46.840]  build more of a community structure really it's learning from experts they
[3:52:46.840 --> 3:52:51.720]  are the experts in civic government providing services to the population
[3:52:51.720 --> 3:52:56.280]  and we are seeking to learn from them take some of their best practices and
[3:52:56.280 --> 3:53:00.720]  we'll apply those in Afghanistan where we can in the area that will be stationed
[3:53:00.720 --> 3:53:06.960]  these ladies and gentlemen are headed into a situation where in essence they
[3:53:06.960 --> 3:53:10.440]  will be okay then in our article we have all the mainstream links of them
[3:53:10.440 --> 3:53:14.600]  running checkpoints DUI checkpoints searching people running checkpoints
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:18.880]  all over the country but this is the the first wave of all the troops are here
[3:53:18.880 --> 3:53:22.600]  oh they're jogging with the locals forming a relationship and the troops are
[3:53:22.600 --> 3:53:26.240]  first told a mission that it's for Afghanistan next they're then told no
[3:53:26.240 --> 3:53:30.720]  this is for domestic operations this is a group of newbies who are now being
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:35.400]  inducted into this so oh well we helped out to learn how the city runs now we're
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:40.440]  here to take your city over Alan what yeah this is going on absolutely too and
[3:53:40.440 --> 3:53:44.520]  in Britain they're using other techniques to include in commuterianism
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:48.400]  where where they're now supposedly giving power back to the local communities
[3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:52.360]  but they've already set up the Soviet ties structure through common purpose
[3:53:52.360 --> 3:53:57.000]  organizations which is attached to the Council of Foreign Relations or
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:54:01.080]  Russia International Affairs is a branch of the nationality and so they've already
[3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:05.360]  set up the leaders to run your local Soviet Soviet movement ruled by Councils
[3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:09.600]  and this is the ideal system that the Rockefellers suggested that they bring
[3:54:09.600 --> 3:54:13.800]  in many many years ago that's what you're seeing happening too so it's the
[3:54:13.800 --> 3:54:18.160]  new commuterian type of system where experts run everything that that was a
[3:54:18.160 --> 3:54:22.840]  whole idea of what Soviet was supposed to be about expert rule and civilians do
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:27.200]  as they're told now the only expert and as far as I'm concerned about and
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:31.200]  civilian life of the civilians themselves you know what you need you
[3:54:31.200 --> 3:54:34.880]  don't need to express to tell you that you can even have it you have the right
[3:54:34.880 --> 3:54:37.400]  to have water and food and all the rest of it
[3:54:37.400 --> 3:54:41.480]  Alan what we're almost out of time we're gonna have this monk to never before
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:45.400]  seen interview then I'll be back with David Ike after the interview folks

[3:55:06.240 --> 3:55:10.440]  soon Alan so you're an expert on this but we know it's declassified the
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:14.040]  governments of the world have planned project blue beam fake alien landings
[3:55:14.040 --> 3:55:17.480]  to unify the planet they are really hyping it now they had another fake
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:23.160]  hoax again yesterday in the news saying aliens were gonna land yesterday the
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:27.480]  pentagon's promoting all this garbage what's your view on that it's a stable
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:30.800]  story they always said they would try something like this they had a test run
[3:55:30.800 --> 3:55:36.320]  initially back in the days of I think it was Orston Wells who did the war of the
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:41.680]  world on radio and and they used to the Princeton University psychology department
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:46.880]  with the Pentagon funding as well and Rockefeller funding to full Americans
[3:55:46.880 --> 3:55:50.840]  thinking this was a real invasion to see how the public would react so this is an
[3:55:50.840 --> 3:55:55.840]  old idea they would scare the public enough about invasions would all come
[3:55:55.840 --> 3:56:01.320]  together under a common purpose to fight off an alien invasion that kind of stuff
[3:56:01.320 --> 3:56:06.160]  and of course it's a great distraction as well we know too that the UFO cover
