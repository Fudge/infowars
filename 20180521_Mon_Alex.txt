[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  You have the power, Humanity has the power, we have the power, do you want to fight,
[00:10.000 --> 00:22.000]  do you want to believe, you got one!
[00:22.000 --> 00:35.000]  Well, if you want next year's news today, you have found the place in FullWars.com.
[00:35.000 --> 00:43.000]  If you go back to January 20th, 2017, myself and Roger Stone were live at the inauguration,
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  on the street and in a studio, saying over and over again,
[00:48.000 --> 00:58.000]  Trump must launch a DOJ criminal investigation of illegal spying by the Obama campaign
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  and by the Hillary campaign against President Trump.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  We said it over and over again, that illegal spying by the Hillary campaign
[01:08.000 --> 01:20.000]  through Obama's DOJ NSA CIA. And they even had that very day, people like Chuck Schumer going,
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  the intelligence community has seven ways from Sunday to get you.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  And we're going to punish you and we're coming for you.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  And remember Brennan famously said two days before the inauguration,
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  to President Trump, you better watch your mouth.
[01:39.000 --> 01:50.000]  I mean, these are some of the most arrogant people that the world has ever seen.
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  They are absolutely, totally and completely arrogant and insane and out of their minds.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  And I'm going to recap all of it and roll through all of it,
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  but the reason the media hates us and the reason the globalist have us targeted,
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  number one after Trump, is they tune in and they hear what they know is really going on
[02:13.000 --> 02:19.000]  and they say, how on earth do these people know all this?
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  Well, we know how you guys operate.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  We know your history. We know your MO.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  We know you're very robotic about how you repeat the same things over and over again.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  And you guys are very badly disciplined.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  You go on print media, you go on TV media, you go on radio,
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  and you blabber about what you're going to do to everybody.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  And then later you think we have no memory and you say you never did it.
[02:48.000 --> 02:54.000]  So we knew you were illegally spying on Trump because that's what you do.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  You're much crooks and you were continually having pieces of information that weren't leaked.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  They were being gleaned from wiretaps.
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  They were being gleaned by electronic surveillance and Trump knew that during the campaign.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  Trump knew that when he was president-elect,
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  Trump had a consortium of paramilitary organizations and groups
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  counter-surveying all of you when you were spying on him.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  And man, did he set you up.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  He set you up so badly you committed all those crimes and you perjured yourselves to Congress
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  and you lied to everybody in the media.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  And that's why I want to cue this up first.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  I've already played it twice.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.000]  That's what Giuliani said on Fox News last week.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  He said, we're ready to tear you apart.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  You want to end this peacefully?
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  Let's stop now for the betterment of the country.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  But if you want us to tear you apart, we're going to tear you apart.
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  That's not a threat.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  That's called an ultimatum.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Here it is.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  I should do it today.
[04:02.000 --> 04:07.000]  I mean, as soon as possible, I think that they have the facts from which they can write their report.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  If you're going to write a fair report, fine, write it.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  If you're going to write an unfair report, write it and we will combat it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  We're ready to rip it apart and we're ready to rip them apart if that's what they want.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  We would rather peacefully settle this and get it over with.
[04:23.000 --> 04:24.000]  Pretty Giuliani.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  Thank you.
[04:25.000 --> 04:26.000]  Always great to see you.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Thanks for coming.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  It's really, really bad, folks.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  When we come back, I'm going to get into all of it.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  There's so much other news.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  The election in Venezuela of the dictator, if you believe that's real election, I got a bridge.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  I'll sell you.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  There are holy legal spy network coming down.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  It was happening over in Hawaii.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  I meant to get into this Friday.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Fox News covered it last night.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  NAACP leader said racially profiled, but then the body cams released.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  The police officers totally polite.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Well, the NAACP leader went further.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  He may have a bunch of lies.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  We're going to cover all that coming up as well.

[05:55.000 --> 06:08.000]  Try the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack today!
[06:25.000 --> 06:52.000]  Well, it's official. The DOJ has confirmed that the Inspector General is probing in a criminal investigation
[06:52.000 --> 07:01.000]  the Obama Administration, the Hillary campaign, the head of the National Office of Security,
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  the head of the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  All of them are being criminally probed for the illegal spying on the Trump campaign
[07:14.000 --> 07:22.000]  when the president was just a candidate, when he was a nominee, when he was the president-elect,
[07:22.000 --> 07:30.000]  and they kept doing it even after he was president with their stay-behind networks inside the 17 agencies.
[07:30.000 --> 07:44.000]  And they also had human intelligence on the ground, not just the professor we exposed five days before anybody else,
[07:44.000 --> 08:03.000]  but others going in and bringing up Russians and Russian influence at all these different public events when President Trump was a candidate, the nominee, president-elect, and then president.
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  And over and over again, it comes out in all these meetings, they were rebuffed on being approached by the so-called Russian state
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.000]  or by people that claimed that they wanted to talk to them about the Russians.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  They followed everything by the book.
[08:20.000 --> 08:30.000]  So then they took the president-elect's national security advisor, who is customary on January 20th, right after the president sworn in,
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  he's handed the football, the codes, they go in and have emergency meetings, they're updated on the latest information.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  That's what Trump did that day, and then General Flynn began calling all the different world leaders to line up meetings with the president,
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  which is what you do over the telephone.
[08:48.000 --> 08:57.000]  That's what you do, you reach out to Russia and China and Britain and Germany and Mexico and Canada and Australia and Japan.
[08:57.000 --> 09:09.000]  That's what you do default, and the media turned all that into a circus and tried to get Flynn to give a false statement at the FBI about something,
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  even though there's nothing illegal there, but just trip him up and make him make a mistake.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  And so they ended up getting him, folks, with threats of not having his paperwork filled out on turkey lobbying.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  That's really why Flynn just put guilty.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  He said, fine, I'm not going to defend any of this, I haven't done anything wrong.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  I'm going to be present for something, just make it up and do it.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  And that's what happened.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  In the four years since he was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he did lobbying.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  He went out and was a consultant.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  That's what retired generals do.
[09:42.000 --> 09:53.000]  And they went, oh, you might not have filled out an exact lobbying form, right, on this new regulation that came out in 2016.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  Okay, no one's ever been charged with it. You don't even get fines for it.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  That's the type of stuff they've got on Flynn.
[10:02.000 --> 10:15.000]  So if you go to CNN, it's just all these crazy articles about how dare President Trump meanly called for a criminal investigation of Obama.
[10:15.000 --> 10:27.000]  And then now the Justice Department announced today that indeed it's a criminal investigation and the mainstream corporate media has now gone into convulsions of fear.
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  Because here's the deal.
[10:33.000 --> 10:44.000]  Clapper, the very arrogant criminal that told Congress twice under oath that the NSA spies on no one in the U.S. ever.
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  Turns out Obama was already spying on Trump five years ago when Clapper made that statement, Trump was under full surveillance.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  This has all come out in the FISA court.
[10:54.000 --> 11:02.000]  And the FISA court's put out an emergency report last year to the president that's public that we covered.
[11:02.000 --> 11:26.000]  Mr. Nunez called it the FISA memo and then he put out his report based on that. And the FISA memo lays out three instances where they illegally lied to get fake warrants to cover previous criminal investigations that were going on without warrants illegally.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  It's called parallel construction.
[11:29.000 --> 11:39.000]  Why do you think Mueller's subpoenaing now eight different Trump associates just last week and grabbing them out the street and interrogating them and then demanding all their emails and correspondence.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  They already have it from the Senate committee that investigated Stone.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  They already have it from the House committee, but they're having to parallel construct it because they already illegally have it.
[11:50.000 --> 11:59.000]  That's all been confirmed. So they have to now act like they got it from somebody else to try to use that in court against Stone, even though there's nothing illegal there.
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  They just want to try to find something that doesn't 100% match up.
[12:05.000 --> 12:20.000]  So that is the point that we have gotten to in this country where there is a criminal investigation that has been opened up.
[12:20.000 --> 12:38.000]  Rightfully so by the office of the inspector general, not under the control of the president of the country Rosenstein and his deputy, the most dangerous man in America, the rogue attorney general who is completely compromised and involved in a dereliction of duty.
[12:38.000 --> 12:50.000]  But the inspector general is doing his job and following the president's directive and has now launched a criminal investigation of Obama and of the Hillary campaign.
[12:50.000 --> 13:02.000]  And we already have them. We already have Obama to the New York Times on January 8th, 9th and 10th of 2017 saying, don't worry, we're going to bring Trump down.
[13:02.000 --> 13:12.000]  We've got the data. We've been monitoring him and his campaign. We know they did wrong. We know they're in bed with the Russians and others, and we're going to bring Trump down.
[13:12.000 --> 13:25.000]  That was put in the New York Times to go look the president still sitting says Trump's a criminal. He's a Russian so that people in the CIA, the FBI, the NSA would go, OK, we'll keep spying on him.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  We'll stay where we are. We'll refuse his orders. And they came to him. This was even in the news and said, do not follow the president's orders if he gets in.
[13:33.000 --> 13:44.000]  He'll be gone in a few months, then a few months passed. He wasn't gone. Then Brennan and Clapper go on CNN and say he will be gone by November, guaranteed.
[13:44.000 --> 13:58.000]  And then Wolf Blitzer goes, you mean impeachment? And they said, no, extraditionally. And Blitzer goes, wow, because this is the former head of the CIA and former head of national intelligence.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  And so they know this is speaking for the shadow government that Obama and John McCain were heading up. And so he took it like, wow, this is amazing.
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.000]  Just hold on, hold on to your places. We're going to beat them. Hold on, hold on. Everything's PR suing Trump, suing me, shaying Trump's a liar, saying the economy's falling apart,
[14:15.000 --> 14:29.000]  saying all of this, saying that mainstream media's winning is meant to make their people hold on in an impossible situation while they try to dig something up to remove Trump, but then they came up empty handed.
[14:29.000 --> 14:38.000]  So they are now in 1 trillion percent panic mode. And when Trump keeps saying this is bigger than Watergate, it's true.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  That's why Clapper, famous perjurer, is saying that Trump's tweets are disturbing assault on Justice Department's independence.
[14:47.000 --> 14:58.000]  The Justice Department is under the executive and the president. The Justice Department has become rogue to the globalist.
[14:58.000 --> 15:08.000]  The Justice Department is running around with only a few people, Clinton and Obama, stay behinds, that are acting outside of their authority,
[15:08.000 --> 15:16.000]  and have the mainstream media saying it'll be this giant faux pas, this giant era of justice, this mafia criminal activity.
[15:16.000 --> 15:24.000]  If Trump does anything to these people who are completely rogue, rating his lawyer, leaking everything to the media, telling all these lies,
[15:24.000 --> 15:32.000]  going on TV saying the president better watch his mouth, but you can see the megalomania is draining out of their faces.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  They're now white as ghost. They're now white as a sheep.
[15:37.000 --> 15:46.000]  As all of their criminal activity and the fact that Trump knew even during the campaign, when he wasn't doing illegal spying,
[15:46.000 --> 15:57.000]  he was doing counter surveillance, legal surveillance of his communications and his systems, and they knew they were being followed, tracked, watched and attempted infiltrating.
[15:57.000 --> 16:17.000]  Even shut up Obama.
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being able to afford needed prescriptions,

[20:20.000 --> 20:31.000]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[20:41.000 --> 20:48.000]  A lot has gone on in the last year and a half since President Trump got into office.
[20:48.000 --> 21:08.000]  But when Trump talks about this being a scandal bigger than Watergate, a second rate failed burglary spying on the psychiatrist of the Democrat nominee that Nixon was never even proven to have been running brought him down.
[21:08.000 --> 21:21.000]  On the case of this whole Russiagate situation, Obama was illegally spying on Trump and Hillary was illegally spying on Trump throughout the campaign.
[21:21.000 --> 21:33.000]  Trump was under NSA surveillance since 2010. The FBI is now admitting all of this. So that's the big takeaway.
[21:33.000 --> 21:43.000]  Quantifying this. The FBI is now confirming there was illegal spying, monitoring, whatever you want to call it.
[21:43.000 --> 21:53.000]  The old terms wiretapping, but also physical infiltration, physical spying to track what the Trump campaign was doing.
[21:53.000 --> 22:10.000]  And to know what their next move would be politically, and they use the Russia investigation as the smoke screen for the major criminal political meddling that dwarfs anything we've ever seen in a fascist country or a third world banana republic.
[22:10.000 --> 22:24.000]  And that's the big takeaway here that Obama and Hillary and all the clapper and Brennan were so arrogant they thought they'd spy on him illegally and beat him. Then when they failed, they panicked.
[22:24.000 --> 22:41.000]  So they went public with their fake Russia investigation and hoped to find something that the public would buy. They came up empty handed and the whole time Trump knew what was going on and was giving them rope when they testified before Congress.
[22:41.000 --> 23:04.000]  Mueller, Comey, clapper, Brennan, Hayden, they are in deep, deep trouble. And so now the FBI, the Justice Department are like, okay, there was an operation going back into the early days of the campaign operation crossfire hurricane.
[23:04.000 --> 23:23.000]  And they're saying national security, you cannot release it to the House and Senate intelligence committees, who have the highest security clearances. They're saying Rosenstein and all the rest of these people are saying, do not give this to Congress.
[23:23.000 --> 23:37.000]  And so Trump says, checkmate, the president is the final arbiter of what is classified and what isn't. Under the Constitution, the president could go meet with the Russians, the Chinese, anybody, and get them launchcoach.
[23:37.000 --> 23:48.000]  Now it'd be up to Congress to impeach him over that. But the point is, they've got the power to at least execute that. That's how Obama sold us out the foreign powers. That's how he opened the borders.
[23:48.000 --> 24:02.000]  So we first reported on Operation Crossfire Hurricane. We first reported on Professor Halprin, Stefan Halprin. We first reported on all of it. We first reported on eight Trump associates grabbed last week.
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  You won't hear about it for days, because the media is so dutiful, they've got to wait till they hear from John Podesta and Hillary and Mueller who are still in charge of the media.
[24:11.000 --> 24:20.000]  And when they decide what to do, you will then hear the new talking point. There's no filter here, folks. There's no filter here.
[24:20.000 --> 24:33.000]  By the way, Roger Stone talked to a high level economist in the White House. I'm sure a lot of you can guess, a high level economist that Roger was very supportive of for the new job of the economic head.
[24:33.000 --> 24:55.000]  Economics are. And guess, ladies and gentlemen, what an individual told Roger last week, when the new quarterly numbers come out, right now it's estimated to be at four to 4.1.
[24:55.000 --> 25:05.000]  What are the Democrats going to do when that comes out? They are going to crap their collective big boy pants.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  You can feel the tide turn, folks. It's turned.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  Trump's winning. America's winning. We're winning. Here's the problem.
[25:14.000 --> 25:25.000]  For those of us on the front lines, like myself, they are coming for us, but it's a necessary sacrifice. Pond Sacrifice is what it's all about.
[25:25.000 --> 25:34.000]  It's called a gambit. It's called stratagem. It's called victory. And I believe info wars will make it through this be even stronger, but know this.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  It's the path I've chosen.
[25:37.000 --> 25:46.000]  And so I'm a winner one way or the other. I want that clear. They're not taking my victory away from me if they kill me or shut me up or put me in prison or bankruptus or whatever.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  And then go, oh, look, we beat him. No, I'm taking you down. I have chosen this kamikaze attack.
[25:53.000 --> 26:03.000]  So let's get that straight globalist. These people are such sociopaths. So they're so self-centered. They think I'm like them. I'll never be like you.
[26:03.000 --> 26:14.000]  I'm about destiny. I'm about changing the world. I'm about my life really meaning something for good. That's the value. That's what I want.
[26:14.000 --> 26:22.000]  So why are we under attack? I've got to get more crew in here just to be archivist. We probably said, I'm not going to exaggerate.
[26:22.000 --> 26:33.000]  Well, speaking of 500 times that it was illegal spying, laid it all out, who did it, how they ran it, and that it was totally illegal. And it's all come out now exactly as we said.
[26:33.000 --> 26:42.000]  Roger Stone, myself, everybody else. Roger has personally told the president over and over and over and over and over again.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  I've told him several times, Mr. President, they illegally spied on you during the campaign. They've been caught lying and perjuring themselves.
[26:48.000 --> 26:58.000]  Brennan has perjured himself. Clapper has done it before Congress. So has Comey. All of them have committed massive crimes. You've got to go after them. You've got to go after them.
[26:58.000 --> 27:09.000]  This is the key. Why do you think you then saw probably 10,000 news articles saying, we've got to keep Alex Jones away from the president?
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  In fact, can we pull that up? It's even an article. We've got CNN and MSNBC video clips coming up. We're going to find them.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  Just type it into YouTube yourself. CNN claims Trump's source on the wiretapping is Alex Jones. It's Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow, both.
[27:25.000 --> 27:39.000]  All immoralized saying that the source that the president got was us because they're listening to him at the time and they had moles and knew he was hearing it from me and Roger Stone.
[27:39.000 --> 27:51.000]  But it wasn't. I wasn't the source. Reality was the source. Eric Prince was the source. Simcom was the source.
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.000]  Why do you think Trump would hear stuff I'd say and just go with it? Because he's already been told that by the Pentagon.
[27:57.000 --> 28:06.000]  Go after them. Go after them. Go after them. Go after them. Go after them. They're illegally spying on you. The whole campaign, they're trying to sabotage everything.
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  And then every time Trump would talk to me or Roger Stone, that's all we start telling him. Just don't worry about this, sir.
[28:12.000 --> 28:19.000]  Great. Thank you. They're coming after you. They're coming after you. They're spying on you.
[28:19.000 --> 28:30.000]  So they're in trouble, folks. This is way beyond Watergate. There is now a criminal investigation by the DOJ.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  The area not controlled by Rosenstein and the Attorney General, the Inspector General that's truly independent in the Justice Department.
[28:37.000 --> 28:47.000]  And all the Inspector General's doing is finding massive crimes and lies and fraud. And the whole stinking rat's nest is now being exposed and it is going to get spectacular.
[28:47.000 --> 28:56.000]  But here's the problem. The globalists are going to false flag. They're going to pull big stuff. You know it. This is the time to be totally vigilant.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  Maximum vigilance right now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  You have been lied to.
[29:31.000 --> 29:41.000]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer. Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[29:47.000 --> 29:50.000]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[29:50.000 --> 29:58.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them the library, to give them the courage to get them right now at killingunclesambook.com.
[29:58.000 --> 30:07.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have it in Fuller's life. It'd take hours.
[30:07.000 --> 30:15.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[30:15.000 --> 30:23.000]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it.
[30:27.000 --> 30:36.000]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[30:36.000 --> 30:44.000]  That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[30:44.000 --> 30:52.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[30:52.000 --> 31:17.000]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[31:17.000 --> 31:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[31:26.000 --> 31:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[31:37.000 --> 31:47.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[31:47.000 --> 31:54.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[31:54.000 --> 32:00.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[33:20.000 --> 33:37.000]  Resistance to Tyrants is Obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[33:37.000 --> 33:51.000]  So, if you just joined us, praise God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you, listeners, for praying. Thank you for being politically active. Thank you for spreading the word.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  A year and a half later, after President Trump got into office, everything is turning around.
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  Directly from a White House meeting with Kudlow, they're looking at the beginning of the next quarter.
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.000]  When the numbers come in currently, when they release the new quarterly numbers, when is that like a month or so?
[34:14.000 --> 34:25.000]  4%. And it's surging so fast, they think it might be 4.2%, but they're concerned about inflation now,
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.000]  which you see starting to wear a ugly head, because the economy was so stalled, now it's heating up.
[34:31.000 --> 34:39.000]  What are the Democrats going to do there? Remember, Obama, what are you going to do? Trump wave a magic wand?
[34:39.000 --> 34:47.000]  No, I'm just going to take the bowling ball off our leg.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  I'm just going to tell companies that we're not going to let them have tax exemption if they're overseas, and then we're going to penalize them and they're going to start coming back.
[34:56.000 --> 35:07.000]  And Trump's reasonable, he just says, listen, bring 20% back or I'm going to break your legs.
[35:07.000 --> 35:17.000]  That's all he's been doing is saying, give us something. He's not anti-American. He's pragmatic. He's like, why are the globalists so against America?
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.000]  Because they're allied with the Communist Chinese and the authoritarian, and they hate this country. I'm going to get into that coming up.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  But with Giuliani says, you go ahead and file your fake report. We're going to tear you apart.
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.000]  You want to fix this peacefully? Stop now. But if you don't, he starts laughing and says, we're going to tear you apart, and that isn't an empty threat.
[35:37.000 --> 35:44.000]  They are loaded for bear.
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.000]  Now, let me show you a document Kim shot for TV viewers, radio listeners, all read over this.
[35:49.000 --> 35:57.000]  Some articles going back to April and March of last year, 2017.
[35:57.000 --> 36:06.000]  And can you imagine the amount of pressure and heat we took and why they hate us so much?
[36:06.000 --> 36:16.000]  That we didn't just tell you how they were being illegally spied on. Where do you think our sources came from?
[36:16.000 --> 36:31.000]  I mean, this is known by the establishment, so I'll go ahead and tell you. It came from the U.S. Army, the Marine Corps, Defense Intelligence, who had access to all the stuff that was going on,
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  because the military has even more access to everything than the mainline agencies do.
[36:39.000 --> 36:47.000]  They're watching Obama and the globalists in live time with communist Chinese money trying to stop the recovery of the nation.
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.000]  And by the recovery, it's like the globalists fumbled and we got the ball back.
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  We haven't won the game yet, but we've recovered the ball.
[36:58.000 --> 37:13.000]  And now we've gone through the first quarter. We're halfway to the second quarter and we're 43 to 7.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  But if they kill our quarterback, we're going to be in trouble.
[37:18.000 --> 37:24.000]  So let's not start getting too excited here before the big halftime coming up, 2018.
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  That's the real halftime.
[37:27.000 --> 37:34.000]  Trump gets back in in 2020. It'll be like legacy teams that win three Super Bowls in a row, in my view.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  But if we don't get to that next level, we are screwed, blew and tattooed.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  So let's go back to these documents.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Donald Trump as family.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  We didn't just tell you it was going on.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  We had feds leak this to us directly, exclusively.
[37:58.000 --> 38:06.000]  Zero coverage in mainstream media, actual DEA, NSA interfaces.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  Guess who's being surveilled? Alex Jones, Donald Trump.
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  We're all listed here. Private addresses, private phone numbers, homes that are in trust, everything.
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  All right here. Zero, zero, zero, zero coverage.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  You think the folks that leaked this to us just did this because they wanted to have a little bit of fun.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  They risked their lives doing it, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:32.000 --> 38:40.000]  So, yeah, that's what Info Wars does. That's why they're coming after us, because we will stick it to them every time.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  We will do it because I fear Soros being in full control.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  I don't do this because I'm not afraid at a certain level.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  I'm afraid of them winning. They're so bad that I have no fear of what happens to me.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  Is that clear?
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  And I keep going back to this to understand why we're under attack, because we are the tip of the spear.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  Why they demonize us? Why they lie about us? Why they come after us?
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Because we're telling the truth.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  Another document, The Hill.
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  Roger Stone claims secret warrant about the discovery of his contact with Hacker Report.
[39:13.000 --> 39:19.000]  That's The Hill, March 15th.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  And, of course, it came out there were three illegal warrants.
[39:23.000 --> 39:26.000]  Just as Stone had said.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  Stone wasn't just theorizing on this. He knew.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Another one, Politico.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  Roger Stone convinced Obama administration got FISA warrant to monitor him.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  April of the same time.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  Here's another one. Reuters exclusive.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  U.S. agents to cover up program use investigate Americans.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  Reuters.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  Inquiry by CIA affirms it's spied on Senate panel.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  Bombshell.
[40:00.000 --> 40:09.000]  Obama's NSA legally spied on Sheriff Arpaio's prosecution.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  And now they admit they spied on his chairman. They spied on his lawyer.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  Mueller did. A lot about it to Congress.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  That's next level, isn't it?
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  So, truly, we're next year's news today, but that's a side issue.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Now there's a criminal investigation.
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  Now they're closing in by the Inspector General of the illegal spying, which is cut and dry and all the perjury and all of it.
[40:34.000 --> 40:42.000]  And we've reached the maximum moment of danger because who knows what the globalists are going to do now to try to stop all this.
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.000]  Everybody should be praying hourly that we make it through this critical time because the enemy is cornered.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  They've committed incredible crimes.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  And now they don't know what to do.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  Their arrogance, their bravada, their hutzpah is draining away.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  And now they are white as sheets.
[40:58.000 --> 41:05.000]  Now, here they are 2017 claiming the president heard from Info Wars.
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  He was being illegally spied on, which is true, but the president already knew it.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  Here it is.
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.000]  Clip not ready.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  We were going to play that.
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Oh God.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  It's unbelievable.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  These computers, I tell you, they just get crazier and crazier.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  It's like certain clips I want.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  I cannot have.
[41:33.000 --> 41:44.000]  There's like 50 clips of MSNBC, CNN, NPR, young Turks making fun of me saying that there's no wiretapping, no spying.
[41:44.000 --> 41:45.000]  I'm wrong.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  I made it up and I cannot find them if I had a billion dollars.
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  There are articles on infowars.com about it when we wrote about it at the time.
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  But we cannot report on ourselves.
[41:58.000 --> 42:07.000]  It's like a black hole vacuum system where no matter how hard I try, I cannot have it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  But you know what?
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  You remember.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  You remember we told you exactly.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  You remember we broke it all down.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  You remember.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  And you know, for my own neurotic need and also for history, I haven't made a film in six, seven years.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.000]  I keep saying I'm going to make one.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  Is that kind of great idea?
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  Make a film about all the illegal spying because it's 50 times bigger than Watergate.
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  And this is really bringing down the deep state and it's so historical and exposing all their criminal activity.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  And it's really a beautiful moment for everybody.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  So we'll see if I can go back back there like I wanted to and get the clip.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  There's a bunch of clips and we're going to see or I should just suspend the show till I have them.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  We'll go to rebroadcast until I have those clips.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  I'm not mad.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  I'm actually very excited.
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's just that at a certain point you've got to have what you've got to have when you've got to have it.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  Like the 500 clips of Roger Stone saying the same thing.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  I'm so excited.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  The new product at m4warslife.com.
[43:03.000 --> 43:11.000]  In a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.000]  But boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw of medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  But it wasn't prescription.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  But they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  to even make the hormones in your glands.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It is amazing.
[43:52.000 --> 44:21.000]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[44:21.000 --> 44:28.000]  The incredible new purifying formula is dentist recommended for daily use whenever you feel like you need to stay clean.

[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[46:07.000 --> 46:15.000]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  CNN and many others are calling for infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[46:24.000 --> 46:31.000]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against infowars.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[46:39.000 --> 46:47.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[46:47.000 --> 46:56.000]  And so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[46:56.000 --> 47:18.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:26.000 --> 47:39.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  So if you want to know why they hate us, if you want to know why they're always trying to shut infowars down,
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  it's because even Fox, other than a few of their hosts are cowards and they will not go on air with all this stuff.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  You've heard Sean Hannity for a year saying they illegally spotted the president because it's been confirmed for a year.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And they call him a conspiracy theorist and George Soros attack semen.
[48:01.000 --> 48:09.000]  They have boycotts when taking him off the air because they've committed serious crimes and they're getting caught doing it.
[48:09.000 --> 48:21.000]  So what? Here's a report from early 2017 with Anderson Cooper was an infowars.com article that accompanies.
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.000]  We can put that on screen so later I'll give you the actual date where they're saying that the president got all this from info wars.
[48:28.000 --> 48:38.000]  No, he didn't get it from info wars. He got it from the Pentagon's snot nose and he got it from the documents that we published as well.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  So here's that report.
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  This reminds me of the scene in Annie Hall where two people are talking about Marshall McLuhan's work and Woody Allen gets annoyed and says,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  you know what, I just happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here.
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.000]  So we're very glad we happen to have the reporter who wrote the story that is being quoted now by Sean Spicer.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  I want to give you a reaction to what we just heard.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  What do you make of the White House citing your article as part of the evidence?
[49:00.000 --> 49:08.000]  I mean, it's getting bizarre at this point because we've said it very clearly and I said on your show that that's not what the story said.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  Anybody can read the story and see that's not what it said.
[49:11.000 --> 49:20.000]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on this kind of fringe right wing media.
[49:20.000 --> 49:28.000]  And then after his tweet storm, info wars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story, misreading our story.
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing info wars.
[49:34.000 --> 49:41.000]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right wing fringe theory, both of which there's no evidence to support.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  And just to be clear, there is...
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  But stop right there.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  I'm wrong.
[49:45.000 --> 49:53.000]  Notice how they try to look so smug, so confident where you look at the camera and you go, they claim the moon is made of rock.
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.000]  But really, it's made of cheese. It's ridiculous how extreme and right wing wing are claiming the moon is made of rock.
[49:59.000 --> 50:10.000]  When everyone knows it's made of the finest green Swiss cheese and the little Martians fly by and get scoops of it and go back to Mars and feed it to their little baby Martians.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  And then Alex Jones claims that the sky is blue and that water is wet.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  We all know that's not true here at CNN.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  It's just bizarre.
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  And then they do this over and over and over and over again in this huge confidence game, hoping you don't have any memory.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Let's finish up with the club. Here it is.
[50:26.000 --> 50:35.000]  Absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump, correct?
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  Nothing. I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story that we would be rushing.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  I would not be sitting here with you. I'd be at home writing it or out reporting it.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  We said that there were intercepted communications in subsequent reporting.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  We've said that these communications were Russians talking to each other about contact.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  Oh, we said there were intercepted communications.
[50:55.000 --> 51:02.000]  No, you had six months before Trump even got the nomination.
[51:02.000 --> 51:10.000]  You had your operation going full steam and we even know the name of it.
[51:10.000 --> 51:19.000]  And we even know the spies that you tried to put into the Trump campaign to plan Russian collusion.
[51:19.000 --> 51:33.000]  Operation Crossfire Hurricane and Stefan Halperin and the list is just going to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  So there's a criminal investigation of this.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  They've been caught doing it.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  The FBI admits it was going on.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  I should just open the whole broadcast up with this.
[51:42.000 --> 51:50.000]  The FBI now admits that they were illegally spying on the Trump campaign under orders from President Barack Hussein Obama.
[51:50.000 --> 52:02.000]  And that they lied to Congress and that they lied under oath and that they lied to the court to get the fake warrants to parallel construct illegal investigations that were already going on.
[52:02.000 --> 52:10.000]  So ding dong, the witch is dead, the witch oh witch, the witch, witch, witch, ding dong, the wicked witch is dead, but that doesn't mean that's going to happen yet.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  Because the media is going to try to confuse this and manipulate this where people that aren't paying attention won't know what's going on.
[52:17.000 --> 52:26.000]  Or people that don't care that they've been told thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  That there was no spying.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  It's totally insane.
[52:29.000 --> 52:47.000]  When they were all involved, the New York Times bragged in early January that they were spying on Trump, that they were working with the people spying on him, that Obama was spying on him, and that they had the dirt, they had the proof.
[52:47.000 --> 52:57.000]  So they could then confidently tell federal bureaucrats, don't worry, we know he's a Russian agent, don't do what he says, he'll be out before he's even inaugurated.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Then he'll be out in a few months.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  Then he'll be out by the end of 2017.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  We're going to kill this guy.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  Remember they sure haven't.
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  Deputy Director of the FBI and CIA, he'd been both.
[53:09.000 --> 53:15.000]  Mudd go on CNN and say, we're just going to kill this president.
[53:15.000 --> 53:27.000]  The guy was done at Foddy Bog and we're getting ready to kill him and the same week he got Brennan and Clapper on TV going, we're going to take him out.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  What do you mean impeachment?
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  No, he'll just be gone in two months.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  You watch.
[53:33.000 --> 53:47.000]  Because they're all going to prison if they don't get Trump out. So they keep running this con game, he's mentally ill, he's going to die, he's going to be out, all the TV shows hitting, all the programs hitting, they all say horrible things.
[53:47.000 --> 53:55.000]  Trying to tank the economy, trying to get somebody to make a move, trying to find something, but every day that passes, they're losing their people in government.
[53:55.000 --> 54:03.000]  Every day that passes, mainstream media is losing its ratings and falling apart and killing itself and the NFL tried to kill Trump and the relaunch of America, so it's falling apart.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  And Hollywood's down 30, 40%.
[54:05.000 --> 54:13.000]  They're falling apart because they try to take down Trump and almost every Netflix show is anti-American, anti-Trump and that's not working.
[54:13.000 --> 54:23.000]  They've weaponized the schools and they've got Mueller going after him, rating his lawyer and do all this criminal stuff, illegally spying and telling Congress they didn't do it.
[54:23.000 --> 54:36.000]  And you've got Mueller's former deputy director saying the government's going to kill this guy all as a confidence act to their criminal stay behind networks to make them all think everything is going to be okay.
[54:36.000 --> 54:44.000]  So they stay at the job and keep prosecuting their operations. This is how criminal psychology works. It's all a big con game. It's all a manipulation.
[54:44.000 --> 54:53.000]  It's not straight shooting. It's not real work. It's not actually knowing what you're doing. It's not actually delivering. It's all flim flam.
[54:53.000 --> 55:00.000]  You've been around LA and all the fake people that have now moved to Austin. They work about one day a week. They're all talk. They're all imaginary.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  They all run around trying to create conspiracies against people. That's the way DC is.
[55:05.000 --> 55:15.000]  And Trump's coming in a construction foreman. He's coming in somebody that's all about OCD getting it done. OCD being a winner. OCD.
[55:15.000 --> 55:23.000]  He's obsessive compulsive about winning and about not having a bunch of destabilization and a bunch of garbage.
[55:23.000 --> 55:31.000]  Trump knows you take over with success. You take over with delivering and people wanting to be Americana.
[55:31.000 --> 55:42.000]  And Americana is coming back. And all you idiots that bet against America. And all you idiots that sat there and bet against Info Wars and bet against Trump and bet against it all.
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  You people are selling tyranny. Something other folks don't want. You understand that?
[55:50.000 --> 55:59.000]  And so your system's in trouble and you'll never win. And I'm not just up here like a con man like CNN saying, oh, we're going to win. Oh, we're unstoppable.
[55:59.000 --> 56:07.000]  I'm up here with a track record proving it. And you know that. And that's why you're so incredibly scared.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  Now, it doesn't mean Soros and Hillary aren't suing us. It doesn't mean they're not trying to shut us down. It doesn't mean they're not running dirty tricks and trying to destroy my family.
[56:13.000 --> 56:21.000]  We need your prayers, number one, and we need you to spread the articles and the videos and the information of the forewinds and to take action.
[56:21.000 --> 56:37.000]  But they are caught in criminal activity. Their whole network is beginning to come down. And right now is the moment of maximum danger.
[56:37.000 --> 56:51.000]  So that's what it comes down to. And of course, financial support. But I mean, what's the point of plugging at the end of every hour? Anyway, I don't even listen to the end of the hour. They tune out the first the hour and no one cares anymore.
[56:51.000 --> 56:57.000]  I mean, at least people that are in the know don't care. They don't realize that we're this close to winning. We're this close to losing.
[56:57.000 --> 57:13.000]  I mean, this is a total war against control freak scum, ladies and gentlemen. And if the American people just put out a little bit more energy standing up to the bureaucrats, standing up to the intimidation, standing up to the garbage, we would turn the tide incredibly well.
[57:13.000 --> 57:28.000]  But they've created a mesmerized TV head world of people who just can't get themselves out of the box, but they're still a minority of awake, focused, dedicated people that are able to turn it around.
[57:28.000 --> 57:43.000]  So you just saw the video from early March 2017, CNN attacking me saying I said there was an illegal spy operation against Trump and against his campaign. And now all in triplicate confirmed by the FBI. Boom! In your face, down your throat, right again.
[57:43.000 --> 57:59.000]  That's why you hate us. We're not going away. We're going to kick your ass, New World Order.
[58:14.000 --> 58:24.000]  Deep Earth iodine crystals. This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones, which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.

[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  Here's the truth about gun control. Many times these mass shootings are actually case and point examples as to why gun control doesn't work.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  And the recent Santa Fe shooting is a prime example. The Santa Fe shooter only 17 years old took his father's firearm to commit this mass shooting.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  And yes, stealing your father's gun is illegally obtaining a firearm. Federal firearm laws already prohibit firearm cells to anyone under 18.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  I guess the argument to ban guns kind of falls through when these shooters use guns that were obtained illegally.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  Does Mexico not have mass shootings because they've banned guns? Actually, they have cartels that go and massacre whole villages.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  Another common argument amongst gun control advocates is that we should ban all assault rifles and bump stocks in order to prevent mass casualties.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  What is an assault rifle? Is that just the made up word? Do rifles assault people? Or is it the people behind the guns that are assaulting people with guns?
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  Last time you, guns don't just pick themselves up and start firing on people.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  I guess you can put assault in front of anything to make it sound big and scary.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Assault cars, assault trucks, assault sticks, assault flags, assault rice cookers.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  A 17 year old mass shooter wielding a sawed off shotgun, killing 10 and wounding 10 is kind of proof that you don't need an assault rifle or an AR-15 or bump stocks to commit mass carnage.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  We've seen more carnage in China in a mass knife attack.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  So essentially, you can use anything to kill a lot of people.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Prison inmates can find ways to kill people with sporks.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  That's why there are so many items banned from prisons.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Do we want to live in a giant prison? No.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Banning AR-15s will not stop mass shootings with mass casualties.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Here's one we hear amongst the left and the right. Fatherlessness is to blame.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  That's why these mass shootings are happening and this is how we can prevent them. More fathers in the home.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  As much as I like the idea of more fathers being in the home, this simply isn't a valid solution.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  The Santa Fe shooter's father apparently was in the home because it was his father's gun that he stole and used to then go commit the mass shooting.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Here are some real solutions that might actually make a difference.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  First, for the mainstream media to stop making every one of these shooters famous, I mean the Parkland shooter has been receiving tons of fan mail and love letters.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  From teenagers ever since he did this shooting and got all of this worldwide attention.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  But God forbid the mainstream media not exploit another tragedy in order to push their anti-gun agenda.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  More guns.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Did you get triggered? Did I just trigger you again and again and again? Are you getting triggered or confused?
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  But yes, I did say more guns.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  The people of Switzerland are heavily armed and surprise, mass shootings are very rare.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  There have been several instances where armed security or armed civilians have actually stopped mass shootings or greatly minimized the carnage.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And yet these stories are rarely reported on by the mainstream media.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  November 2017, an off-duty Kansas police officer stopped a potential mass shooting in a Costco when an armed man entered and said,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  I'm going to kill people. He was able to neutralize the shooter and prevent a mass shooting.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  September 2017, a shooter entered a Nashville church and shot seven people.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  A man in the church was able to run out to his car, obtain his firearm and come back and neutralize the shooter, saving untold lives.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  May 2015, a man pulled into a South Carolina fire department and began shooting on people and children when a firefighter with a concealed carry permit returned fire and neutralized the subject.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Experts have told us that predators like to prey on the weak and those less likely to defend themselves.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  There are many stories and instances where armed civilians or armed security have stopped and prevented mass shootings. The solution is already there.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  The mainstream media just doesn't want you to know it.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  When you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer. And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139. And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called Infowars.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  And in the decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  Infowars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation and technology,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Infowars has been at the forefront of the Information Revolution.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Infowars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  except no substitutes, demand truth, demand Infowars.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  One thing that happens when you make as many wild, unproven claims as Trump does is that the people around you have to go to increasingly ridiculous lengths to try to defend those claims.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  And this weekend we saw another example of that when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked if she had any proof for Trump's outlandish claim
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  that Obama wiretapped him during the campaign and offered this bizarre answer.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  How does he know that his phone was actually tapped?
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  Let me answer that globally. He's the President of the United States.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  You know what? Yeah, I'll agree with that.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Trump has intelligence that I definitely do not.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  I agree. Listen, people, one more time.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  Trump's accusation is ridiculous and pathetic.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  He is suggesting a U.S. president enlisted a foreign intelligence service to spy on a political adversary.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  That is an explosive charge.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  This is a serious allegation. This might be the most serious allegation any president has made against a previous president.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  But this is a very serious allegation for a sitting president to make about his predecessor.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  Trump tweeted, terrible, just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Nothing found. This is McCarthyism.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  And the other one, how low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process?
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  This is Nixon Watergate, bad or sick guy.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  He said Obama is either a bad or sick guy.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Maybe he means some of his compliments. Like, yeah, man, he's bad. He's a bad guy.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  The NSA's deputy director told the BBC it was Aaron's nonsense, revealing a complete lack of understanding in how the relationship works.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  And for their part, GCHQ called the accusations utterly ridiculous.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  And yet, rather than distancing himself from Spicer, Trump decided to back him up.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Are you asking, did I wire tap Donald Trump?
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Of course, I did it.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  This is Nixon Watergate.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Hello? Hey, Barack, sorry we have to investigate you on this wiretapping thing.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  But you know I didn't do that. I know. But we still have to investigate it.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  Otherwise, it'll look like I'm just mentally unstable.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  The craziest thing about Trump calling for an investigation without any evidence. Zero evidence.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  Trump has not produced a shred of evidence.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  There's no evidence for Trump's claims.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  There what? Evidence did not come.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  So where did Trump get his info? From the CIA? From the FBI?
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Where are you getting this information?
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  From a very reputable source.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  What? The FBI? The CIA?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  No wars. It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones. You know he's legit.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  Ah, Alex Baldwin. You've been very useful to me, said Kim Jong-il.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  And of course, if you just joined us last hour, I went into an information blitz
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  showing hundreds of articles where they were admittedly spying illegally on Trump
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  and now the FBI admits it and now there's a criminal investigation by the Inspector General in the Justice Department.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  And we have Brennan. We have Clapper. We have Comey.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  We have Mueller all caught perjuring themselves before Congress.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Here's our article, Jerome Corsi March of last year. It's over a year ago.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  The actual NSA documents. A top secret.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  But no one else has and the government didn't come after me and the media didn't say it was a lie.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  They just ignored it. See right there? How did we know?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Where did we get the information? Where did the President get it? Alex Jones.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Well, in the case of this, he did get it actually from the DEA. That's where the President got it.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  The folks involved here and the people that had gotten all this information,
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  they tried to get it to the President, but we were able to.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Oh, and then Joe Arpaio got his pardon. Wasn't that nice too?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  He got that information from us as well.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  And again, here we are in the news going back to March of last year.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  CNN saying, I'm a liar. I'm insane.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  There's no illegal spying going on against the President. But then here's even Reuters.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  They came to get their disinfo together.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  US directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  But they do it without warrants. And then when they think they've dug something up,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  then they go get the warrant and then reverse engineer it from there.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  It's called parallel construction. Remember they spied on Congress?
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  July 31, 2014, inquiry by CIA affirms it spied on the panel that oversees the CIA.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  That is the Fox guarding the old henhouse, isn't it?
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And then we've got more documentation of all of that, my friends.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  So why are they mad at us? Because we aren't playing ball with the globalist.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  So what's going to happen now?
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Well, DOJ confirms they started a criminal investigation of Obama and of the Clinton campaign
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and the reports they ordered illegal spying on candidate nominee,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  President-elect and then President Trump. And Trump on the weekend said that
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  he was demanding that they open a criminal investigation and they've now done it.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  And CNN calls it dangerous. No, you are dangerous. You've been caught lying.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  You are very fake news, quote the President.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  And you've been caught now with a bunch of your operatives, a rogue government element
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  trying to overturn the election of the American people.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And you can see with each waning day, you're losing power.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  With each waning day, you're collapsing.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  With each waning day, it's guaranteed already that you will be defeated.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  Now, if you want to go on some kamikaze mission against us,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  try to hold us off or take some of us out that led the attack on you,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  you might get away with that, but you'll be more destroyed in the end because of that.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  You are defeated. You are crushed. It's over for you.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  It's all coming out and we're going to make sure everybody remembers
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  all the things they said and all the things they did when they got up there
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  on all the late night comedy shows and lied and on CNN and lied and all the rest.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  Now, it's critical that everybody go check out this article.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  NSA documents prove surveillance of Trump and his family.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  And we have the other articles up on the site that go through it all,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  the criminal investigation that has been opened, the FBI admitting that they were spying,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  that they had infiltrated. That was in the New York Times on Friday.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Do you think they like that? Boy, they sure hope you don't have a memory.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Let me stop right there.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  If you like the information we're putting out, like crushing the globalists,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  like returning the country to its greatness and like moving us forward
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  and like seeing 4% growth rate is the word that you heard here first
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  that we're going to be getting in the new quarter lease when those numbers come in,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  please support the Info War.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  New shipment of Survival Shield X2 is in.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  It is 25% off.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And you can also get it with BioTruth Selenium when you get it together
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  it's 50% off despite the fact that we're running low on the Survival Shield X2,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  the good halogen and the Selenium and the high quality concentrated iodine,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  deep earth source synergistically work together.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  So that's 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  when you get the X2 with the Selenium together, they're 50% off.

[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt,
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com, that's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  there's no better product to help your body fight back.

[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  supports your digestive tract and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.

[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  poudarco bark and grape seed extract,

[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  Alright, we had Dr. Nick Baggett scheduled for about a week to come on.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  The first guy to really expose.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  What's now mainstream news?
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  Using cell phone waves to control the brain.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  He went off the patents. He went off the research.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  He went off the science of that.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  And now it's suddenly being announced as mainstream news.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  And the fact that 5G is super destructive when it comes to the DNA basically rattles it apart and causing massive cancer increases.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  So he's going to be popping in for just two segments coming up.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  I'm going to get him back for a full hour in the near future.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  And he's going to be hosting some podcasts and shows with us as we expand our operations.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  Now, joining us is Roger Stone with a quick pop in on not just eight of his associates being dragged off the street last week at FBI Dragnet.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  But also, we are going to be looking at the huge news that there is now a criminal investigation by the Inspector General taking place against Hillary.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  And the campaign and Obama ordering it and we know they ordered it.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  The FISA court put out a report that what happened was illegal last year.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  It's got no coverage.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  We have the documents we got from Sheriff's Arpaio's office.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  NSA documents surveilling Trump and myself.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  That was confirmed.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  We had them bragging when he was president-elected.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  Don't worry.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  We've been spying on him.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  We've got proof of Russiagate so that people in government would stay confident and basically be mutinous against Trump when he got in in the belief that he was illegitimate.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  But all that was a lie.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  They were spying, but there was no dirt.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  And now we know the name of the mole.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  We broke it five days before The New York Times.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  We knew his name months before, but didn't want to get sued.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  And that was Stefan Halprin.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  And that's now confirmed by The New York Times on Friday.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  But he's just one of the moles, but not a mole to actually find Russiagate, but to create discussions about it.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  So at least there'd be some discussion of Russians and influence when later the FBI would ask members of the Trump campaign about it.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  That way there'd at least be some discussion of collusion.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  But again, they failed.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  They came up dry.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  So I wanted to get Roger Stone to pop in quickly on how big this is.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  The president over the weekend said, I'm demanding a criminal investigation in his tweet.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  Today it has been opened and the globalist, the leftist, they are in fear.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Roger.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Alex, it's, it's great to be with you.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  And that was, I think, a very good summary.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  I'm here at the Baptist hospital in Kendall, Florida, where my life is undergone emergency surgery.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  I believe in the power of prayer, so I ask for all the employers to please pray for her.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  She'll be fine, but it is a major surgery came up as kind of a surprise.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Well, absolutely.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  I knew about that.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  I didn't want to say that on air, but since you brought it up, because that's your privacy.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Now folks really should pray for her.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  In fact, I should have asked if you want people to lift your wife up in prayer.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  She's a great lady and she's a great patriot and stood by you so strong.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  And so again, tell everybody a little bit about your wife.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  And well, as you know, she's a Cuban American.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  Her father was, you know, was a diplomat under Batista who fled his home country was fiercely anti-communist, anti-Castro, a great man in his own right.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  He lost everything in the revolution.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  And she has been my rock.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  He has been steadfast.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  This is this came as kind of a surprise to us.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  She'd be very upset if I got into the details of her physical condition on Info Wars, but other than to say she's going to be fine.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  The doctors are very pleased with how her surgery has gone.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  She'll be out here shortly.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Let's get to the story of the day.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  I was very forthright yesterday when I said that having come up completely empty-handed when it comes to Russian collusion,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  having come up empty-handed when it comes to any trafficking of allegedly packed emails with WikiLeaks,
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  having come up empty-handed with the bogus claim that I knew about the publication of John Podesta's emails,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  the government now quite conceivably will conjure up some other bogus offense against me because I appear on Info Wars,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  because I'm like you the tip of the spear and because we've been taking these people on and we won't be silenced.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  We won't shut off.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Well, Roger, you were the first person to say Trump must go after him for illegal spying on the campaign.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  How did you know that?
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  It's all been confirmed since you've been absolutely on target.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  Well, that New York Times story of January 20th, we were called page one.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  I was with you that day when the bomb hit, saying that Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page had been under FISA surveillance,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  rocked my world because, as you know, Alex, a U.S. citizen can only be surveilled under a FISA warrant if you're involved in espionage against the United States
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  or a foreign power, which I most definitely have never been.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  So this is an illicit spying operation.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  We at Info Wars were really kind of concurrent with the Daily Caller, the first to report about the role of Stephen Halper,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  a longtime Bush hand and deep state operative who was planting evidence of Russian collusion, faux Russian collusion in the Trump campaign.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  Now, he wasn't looking for Russian collusion.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  He was planting fake evidence of it so they could later come back and say, ah, you see Carter Page was in touch with the Russians.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  It's an illicit operation.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  Meanwhile, a high-level aid to the president told me on Friday that economic growth is projected to be 4% in the next quarter.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  That's incredible.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  They said that couldn't be done.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  It was structurally impossible, they said.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  The president will never be stronger than he is at this instant.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  It is time for him to order the release of all these alleged documents.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  You notice, Alex, in the wake of the Stephen Halper thing, how the intelligence services say, oh, we can't confirm this because it will expose our methods and it will risk lives.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  Well, no lives are being risked and their methods need to be exposed because they're unconstitutional and they're illegal.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  It's incredible, though, everything you said, everything I said, all of it confirmed absolutely on target and they are just apoplectic.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  All the late night shows that made fun of Trump about the wiretapping claims, you've been saying since day one, since the day he was sworn in, that this would be bigger than Watergate and that if we pushed it, it would bring down the entire deep state.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  Because once this is brought down, they won't be able to pull this stuff off no matter who it is in the future.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  This is such an exciting thing.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  We're praying for your great wife, a great lady.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  We'll talk to you again, Rodgers.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  Things unfold.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  Alex, I'm going to try to get out of the hospital in time to do the war room today at five o'clock Eastern and I'll be able to issue an update at that time.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  All right, thank you very much.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  There goes Rodgers down.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  President, we know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against info wars.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  And so the censors can bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough. That's why info wars life has created a powerful new addition to the super blue line.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  Super blue silver immune gargle available in one ounce, three and a half ounce and 16 ounce bottles.

[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:33.000]  Big normal toothpaste fans of super blue is awesome and thank you so much Alex for the info wars life products.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Absolutely.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  We can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves. We can take our country back.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  Alright, I've just spent an hour and a half of airtime getting into the fact that a permanent deep state of Democrats and NSA, CIA and FBI officials
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  who've been in power for decades and committed incredible crimes selling the country out to communist China, Russia, the EU, you name it,
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  did spy on Trump, found nothing, spied on Trump illegally, then lied to the public, lied to Congress about it.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  Now they've been caught. Now Trump's going after them for it. Now there's a criminal investigation.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  We've all been totally vindicated. Nunez has been vindicated and there's almost no coverage of this, even on Fox News.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  It's mainly the Texas shooting, which is a tragic event. Our own Owen shroyer was down there with our crew.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  The vast majority of people are pro gun. They understand that it's an evil problem. It's a mental illness problem.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  They're saying that the lieutenant governor is wrong to say that we should have armed guards at school or that we should have less entrances
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  to stop these type of events because mad dog killers know that they can go to a school and generally not face any resistance.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  And then a large group of unarmed people are there and the media hypes these school shootings like it's the thing to do.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And Dana lash really got it right this weekend when she said that the media hyping this is the biggest contributor.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  They're almost always into devil worship. They're almost always on serotonin re uptake inhibitors. They're almost always in to shoot them up video games.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  Now, I want to be clear. I'm not saying ban should not video games, but they were created for the military so that people wouldn't hesitate
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  when it came to shooting somebody up close because in Vietnam about half the people up close wouldn't shoot somebody.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  Or they had them in their crosshairs far away. They hesitate. So they started developing what became video games.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  So you have all this MO but then you add the final catalyst, the media giving an all of that attention and that's what's contributing to it.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  We had gang shootings and some shootings at schools previous to what happened at Columbine.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  But once Columbine happened and the media turned it into the number one circus and cover school shootings every day even when they're not happening for six months or so,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  then mentally ill people get in their head, then they start the training at the schools, then they start the active shooter, then they start the drills.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  They'd had two drills at this school in the month before they had multiple drills in Parkland and the police stood down there.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  And so it is creating this atmosphere and I make this point but no one else makes it.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  I'm very thankful that Dana Lash is now making that point because when they had, again, death education, which was really suicide education,
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  started in 1989 in pilot schools across the country, they saw a doubling and then a tripling within a couple years of people committing suicide.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  A doubling in boys, a tripling in girls. There was even a 2020 ABC News piece about it and they scaled it back.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  It was weird liberal socialist brainwashing to create anxiety, to create mental patients.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  The developers know what they're doing that the teachers don't know in the health class.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  They'd put them in coffins, roll them up in carpets, lock them in lockers to form a torture and tell them, think about death.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Here's how people commit suicide with a shoelace tied around the hat rack or the clothes rack on the back of the stall, the clothes hook.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  And little girls, 12, 13 would go kill themselves right after class.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  They'd get depressed about a boyfriend or about mom or dad or about not being on the cheerleader squad.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  And instead of just going home and crying, they were emotional. They were taught quick and easy way to kill themselves.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Even though they weren't serious about it, five seconds they passed out, bye-bye, bloated, purple head, dead.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  Another globalist victory because you take devastating psychological warfare techniques like that and you deploy that into schools.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  It's well known. In fact, there was a well-known sympathy suicide syndrome.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  There's different names for it, but they noticed hundreds of years ago that they would do William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, sometimes the large crowds, particularly outdoors.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And if they really pulled it off, some women would go commit suicide that night.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  Because they were so in love with the story of Romeo and Juliet, they wanted to join them.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  There it is, USA Today.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Last year, youth suicide rates are rising, school and the Internet may be to blame.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  Screen time, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, death education.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  It was well known that the drug program increased, the whole dare program increased drug use.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  It doubled drug use just a few years after it was in the news.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  And they go, we don't know why we're doing the dare program and drug use has exploded.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  Some think it's introducing drugs to young people.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  Now, I'm all for sex education to know about diseases and the reproductive tract, but that's not what it really is.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  It was a way to teach young people about unnatural sex acts, to introduce them to other forms of sex, to introduce homosexuality, promiscuity.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  That's now declassified, and it caused that.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  Sex education caused promiscuity to explode as well.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Drug education makes drug use explode.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  Suicide education makes suicide explode.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Sex education makes sex explode.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  If it's not real sex education, you show somebody diseases, syphilis, gonorrhea.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  You show them some, the old stuff they showed them did not increase it.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  Stuff in the fifties and sixties did not.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  But after that, the seventies, eighties, boom, it just is how to have sex.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  Children as young as six years of age under some liberal area school districts are taught things I didn't know about till I read about them in the newspaper when I was like 25 years old as a talk show host.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  I was like, what's that they're teaching them?
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  And I had to go look it up.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  I didn't know what eating feces was. I didn't even know people did that.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  They teach six year olds how much fun it is.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  And stuff I can't even say on air.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  I remember reading these articles, I'm like, this isn't real.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  And then they'd have teachers on the news defending it.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  So you have shooting drills, you hype shooters are coming, that goes on.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  People get the idea in their head.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  And once the idea is in crazy people's head, Katie bar the door, then they want the infamy, then they want to be known, then they want to be famous, they want to be somebody.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And it's off the races in this sick narcissistic culture.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  So if somebody's wearing a devil worshiping outfit, I don't mean an iron maiden shirt or something.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  I mean, if they're wearing a Nazi style outfit with communist symbols and skulls and death, and they're into guns and their loners, that's who you got to watch.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  They play shoot them up video games.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Wow, you really got to watch them.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  Here's Dana Lash talking about it.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  And I was reading about this study, these numerous studies.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  And in fact, they went back and they noticed that all of these school shooters had one, well had several commonalities.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  But one in particular stood out.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  Every single one of them was motivated and every single one of them had at some point, either in writings that were discovered at their home and social media or something.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  They had in some way referenced Columbine, which was a motivating factor.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  The media has got to stop creating more of these monsters by over saturation.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  I'm not saying don't responsibly report on things as they happen.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  Look, I understand it, but constantly showing the image of the murderer constantly saying their name is completely unnecessary.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  I understand if you want to report it once they've been identified, but after that, according to what these studies have shown, we need to be very cognizant of what this creates.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Total veritas. Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's what's happening. That's the truth.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  And the media knows full well what it's doing.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  They've been hyping up Parkland hoping for this.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  But with the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  Something the globalists are targeting. Visit infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention. I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  I planned each chartered course, each capital step along the byway, and more, much more than this, I did it my way.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  Look at dredgereport.com. Infowars.com, newswars.com. We are hammering that Trump has launched a criminal investigation into Hillary and Obama spying on his campaign and then lying about it to Congress.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  This is thousands of times bigger than Watergate. This is seismic. This is the entire illegal spy grid, the Big Brother system, all of it in a civil war.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  And the media caught doubling down the lies. This will destroy whatever credibility they had left. This will bring them all down and Trump is winning.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  And you've got to go to dredgereport.com to find it. Our infowars.com, but dredge has it all nicely laid out in the left-hand corner.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  Trump rips Brennan. Spy spooked. XCI chief warns McConnell and Ryan. Penn says, deep state desperate. That's absolutely true. Ted Olson, constitutional crisis brewing. Rudy will be over by September 1st.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  Tobin, dims, civil war, over impeachment. Watchdog default FBI for Clinton probe. There is a criminal investigation. They've been caught. It's been blown wide open.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  The FBI now admits that they had a major operation and they've named it against Trump during the campaign. It's huge.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Because until now they've been denying it and lying about it and lying to Congress. It's massive.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Meanwhile, the Pope says it's okay to be gay. God made you like this.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  There's an article up on infowars.com that Daniels put out getting into the fact that the man he's telling this to was abused as a child.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  So the Pope's using that as a backdrop. Is it okay to be a pedophile because you're deputy Pope, you're right-hand man, just got indicted and is in a secret trial in Australia for reportedly abusing over 100 young boys.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  Some young is five years old. So the Pope wants to hide behind a rainbow flag.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  I had the kid Daniels article. It's on infowars.com and newswars.com. We can just punch that up. I'll just go in for myself.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  And around here, I just, I got so many papers. Sometimes it just drives me crazy. There's so many.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  There's another big one that's super important that I haven't gotten to that just seismically shows how weak the globalist are.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  And that's that Obama is pleading with Jay-Z to keep other hip hop stars from ever meeting with Trump, trying to isolate Trump, but it's not working.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  So he wants Jay-Z to go organize everybody because just Jay-Z alone not going to the White House does nothing but getting hundreds of people not to.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Obama hopes will stop the trend where when Kanye valiantly stood up for the truth, Trump saw his ratings with black males double in polls.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  That scares Obama. He wants to own those folks and they're starting to wake up and that scares them. That story is up on infowars.com.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  It's absolutely critical. But look at the creepy photo of the Pope.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  Pope tells molestation victim it's okay to be gay. And that's what this is really all about.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  And notice you had this so called expert come out a few weeks ago and say, oh, if you're changing your baby's diaper as permission or it's sexual assault.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  The left and Nambla and others want it to be a system where they say children can give consent.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  So you're thinking, wow, you're making it bad to change a baby's diaper like you're a pervert. That shows how sick your mind is.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  The real agenda behind this. I'm not sure this lady even knows this is to make it where children can give consent to have sex.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  And so that's why they need consent to have their diaper changed. Now there's the headline.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  Parents should ask their baby's permission before changing dirty nappy sexuality expert says so the idea is being a parents dirty and bad.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  But there's not going to be any worry in the leftist publications about the devil Pope and his main adjunct his attache is aid to camp.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  His right hand man being the main procure for the whole blackmail network of little boys in the Vatican and just look at that pervert right there.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  You know, it's going to come out on him. He's talking about resigning anytime.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  So he's doing some leftist shots over the bow. It's worth pointing out the Pope Francis was talking to a victim of Catholic sexual abuse when he reportedly told him it's okay to be gay.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Why it matters. The context of the Pope's alleged statement is being overshadowed by the statement itself.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  The context, however, is important because it sheds light on the decades long molestation accusations against Catholic priests, many of which turned out to be true.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  It also sheds light on why the Poneth is motivated to drift away from additional Catholic teachings.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  The Pope's statement isn't just about homosexuality versus the church.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  Pope Francis is an inherent liberation theology prominent Latin American socialists for decades with the end goal destroying the church from within.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  And when they tell people that they've been molested, don't worry, you haven't sinned turning it on to them like they did something wrong.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  Don't worry, I forgive you that you got molested.
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  What she's really saying is it's okay. You got molested.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  See that alchemy? Very, very sick.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  And then it goes into all the context of it.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  That's what they're pushing. That's what the Pope's doing.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  And this man's best buddy is in a trial, a secret trial, because he's so powerful, about 100 plus boys kidnapped in traffic to men in the Catholic church, which has turned into the pedophile command base to its own government, its own system operating however it sees fit.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  So that's the reality that we're dealing with here.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  Now, we're going to start the next hour, had a really interesting guest on have been falling for years, but I want to get him back on Vox Day to come on and cover some really, really big issues here on air and how big a deal it is that we see this whole situation unfolding with the beginning of the fall of the deep state.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  I mean, this is really powerful. This is really dangerous. This is a critical juncture point.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Who knows how they're going to try to strike back right now. But this is quite a time, quite a time to be alive.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  So we are at that point of no return. The globalists are going to be defeated, but we're not sure how serious this is going to get before it's over.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  We are in the thick of battle right now.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  We'll cover all of that coming up in the third hour today also to take a lot of phone calls coming up throughout the week.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  We have Ron Paul joining us. A lot of other very informative guests will stay with us throughout the week.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And don't forget the war room with them with Shroyer three o'clock every day and Roger Stones popping in on that.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  You've also got David Knight in the morning with the real news doing a great job.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  There's a lot of other stuff I want to get to here coming up.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  Before I do that, please remember the broadcast. Please remember the globalist are fighting as hard as they can.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Try to shut down free speech to try to destroy info wars as an example of everybody.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  And when you purchase the products and when you support us, we're going to be able to expand and go 24 hours a day.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  I want to go about 20 hours a day at first and we're going to be able to really reach out and find a lot of new affiliates and a lot of new people.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  We're going to wake up. And so this is the second American Revolution. It's going global right now.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  And it's the financial support that makes it all possible. And here's the deal.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  We have a huge special that I didn't even know about that somebody came up with. It's massive.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  X2 is our best selling product, deep earth, good halogen iodine.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  It's 25% off even though we're selling out of it.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  But you can get it with our bio true selenium pure mustard seed super strong selenium.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  You talk about energy stamina, libido. In fact, I need some a bottle right now at home and I swing grab me a bottle of bio true selenium.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  Thank you. It is 50% off when you get it together.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  So that is a massive discount on both bio true selenium bio true selenium has a 4.9 review.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  The X2 has a 4.9 review as well by power reviews. You've never been a better time to try selenium and true iodine.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  It's all there. It's a tonic iodine pure iodine. Nobody else has got it.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  M4warstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  And you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  Because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and M4warstore.com.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  Go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against M4warstore.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  It is so critical that you go to M4warstore.com and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  And so the censors can bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society that is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  I am a little bit over overflowed when it comes to globalists.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  I mean, I don't want to look at the pedophile pope anymore. What about you? Look at that creeperzoid.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  I don't even want to sit there and look at Nancy Pelosi, all these crazy people.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And of course we're starting to defeat them. We should defeat them.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  We should not allow ourselves to be ruled by this abject scum who's trying to virtue signal about, oh, gay people aren't bad.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  And, oh, the earth is no longer the center of the universe.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  Like we need this guy to tell us any of this stuff. Look at him.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  Oh, you are a victim of my people raping you. It is okay, my son.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  Just can we zoom in on that? Let's go to M4warstore.com. I mean, look at that creeperzoid.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  Would you let Pope Francis keep your five-year-old son for the weekend?
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  Not unless you wanted him to get diddled.
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  You know for a fact that that is a piranha. That is a demon-possessed creature.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  Pope Francis is as close to Satan as you're going to get on this earth in the flesh off of what he does, how he behaves.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  He used pedophilia to take over the Catholic Church and get rid of the family system and the good things it had.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  And it's taken a hundred years for the pedophiles to take control of the Catholic Church.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  And now they've done it. And now he's going to hide behind a rainbow flag.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  Everybody's going, oh, you're not against gay people as they segue into that.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  That's the Nambla creed. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the real head of Nambla is Pope Francis.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And notice I'm baiting the media. I dare the horror globalist media that the Pope rides around the back of.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  The great horror Babylon. I dare you to even run my story.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Pick it up. You think it'll hurt me if people read Alex Jones says the Pope looks like a big old degenerate pedophile out of central casting.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  And his attache, his right-hand man, his aide to camp, his best friend is in jail right now being tried for trafficking over a hundred little boys over decades.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  Why the Cardinal Pell case has to be so secretive New York Times.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  Imagine your six-year-old, seven-year-old boy in the door opens and here comes Cardinal Pell.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  That big old potbelly hanging out. He's porcupigging it.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  And you're going to beg for mama and mama ain't going to come. And then in comes the door.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  In comes Pope Francis, the Jesuit New World Order kingpin to destroy the Catholic Church.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  And he's got his Georgetown suing me.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  And you morons couldn't even do a half decent filing yet to withdraw it.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:55.000]  Vengeance is coming. Fire is coming, Pope. The real revolution against you is coming and you will burn in hell.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  Take advantage of the powerful nutrients you receive. There's no better way to power your body.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  Fluorolife is a powerful probiotic supplement with 20 of the most potent clinically studied probiotic strains.

[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  In the forest, we need worship, where they go. In the mirror, we spread a song. It's in the kitchen, all all wrong.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  They decide every shot gonna save the song. Until I have to new constitution, think about what a new revolution is like.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  Think of the change around, think of my guitar and play, just like yesterday, and I get all my needs away.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  We don't get through the game.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  Matt Bracken always does a great job. Former Navy SEAL counterterrorism expert getting into the whole school shooting.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  Some of the interesting areas that look at that, the tragedy, our prayers go out for everybody. He's gonna be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  Box Day joins us right now to cover the waterfront. He's the best-selling author of FJW's Always Lying. FJW has always doubled down and he wants to get into the whole Stefan Halpern situation and how bombshell that is and how that's shaking the world that indeed there was an illegal FBI mole from the CIA.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  Inside the Trump campaign, not to find Russian collusion, but to try to basically get it going, but it didn't happen.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  And how the media lied and how there's a criminal investigation now going on by the Inspector General, the only part of the Justice Department, not controlled by the rogue operative Jeff Sessions, the most dangerous man in America.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  We can speculate all day if he's senile, why he's compromised, why he's not doing his job, how they let Rosenstein sign documents giving himself control of everything, how this rogue group is operating.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  But a lot of people early on, when Trump was first elected, were hedging their bets. They really thought there was all this Russian collusion evidence.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  They were told by Obama, and I believe Sessions was, but we know the New York Times was. We've got evidence Trump is a Russian agent, we've got evidence of him being urinated on and all this other stuff, and they believed it.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  So they hedged their bet. They took the appointments, they hedged their bets, but were told, you'll be okay.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  And now that the Democrats are being exposed, they're at their most dangerous point because they are in full panic mode as everything we broke down, everything we laid out has come true.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  So Vox Day joins us. And, you know, we just had Vox on. I'm only attacking Ben Shapiro because he tells people not to come on my show.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  He's trying to take over the remnants of Glenn Beck's imploded operation in Dallas. He's constantly here in Texas, siphoning money from Texas billionaires to fund himself.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  He's not a self-made man. And he was a never-Trumper. And he's a globalist. And now he's in the news defending the illegal spying on Trump.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  So he's a small footnote, but I mean, with friends like Ben Shapiro, you don't need globalists, you don't need Democrats.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:56.000]  That's all I'm saying is he's been set up, they think, as this anointed one, you know, to tell all the Christians and conservatives how we're supposed to wipe our noses.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  And he's very leftist how he tries to police everybody and say who can go on what shows and what language to use. And there it is.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  Ben Shapiro depends FBI, deep state, inside Trump campaign, which, which of course he said was never happening and I was wrong and I was crazy.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  It's all confirmed. So Vox Day joins us. Vox, good to have you back on the broadcast weather show. You're also launching your new, your whole new system here pretty soon, a new comic book.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  And so we're going to be breaking all that down as well as soon as we get Vox on the line. But before I go any further, why not?
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  Before we get into all that here today, tell you that we have the biggest special ever on bio true selenium.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  That's bio true selenium, ladies and gentlemen from infowarslife.com. And if you don't know about selenium, you have to have it electrochemically in all processes in the body.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  And your body's electrochemical. And there's a lot of synthetic stuff out there that doesn't do anything in your body. Reportedly, we have it from mustard seed, the mighty mustard seed.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  And we have it. They're concentrated, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  It's a very, very strong formula. And it's available at infowarstore.com at 50% off.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  When you get it with X2, it's also 50% off. So X2 is 25% off by itself. But when you get it with bio true selenium in the combo, it is 50% off.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  The special is going to have to end this week because we're running low on the X2. The specials that will end tomorrow because we have new specials on Wednesday will be the super blue fluoride free toothpaste for adults and children,
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  the immune gargle, the mouthwash, all six products individually or by themselves are all at 50% off free shipping when you get them all together.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  You can also sign up for auto ship on things you want to reorder and an additional 10% off. There's also Patriot points you get 5% on every purchase, good towards other future purchases.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  infowarslife.com, infowarstore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of other specials that are ending. The real red pill 50% off is ending tomorrow.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  50% off on alpha power is ending tomorrow. 40% off on bodies. No, it's 50% off. Excuse me. 50% off on bodies, ultimate tumor formula. That is ending tomorrow.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  It's all ending tomorrow because we have a new product we're launching on Wednesday.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  But listen, your purchases are vital. I've said we're expanding here. And I got all these calls from corporate establishment assassin media, really intelligence agency operatives and folks posing as media saying, Oh, did you get investors?
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  Oh, did you get money? Oh, how are you doing that?
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  I've told people we've been saving and building and preparing to hire more people and go 20 hours a day by the end of this year and to hire the talk show host and the engineers and the reporters and all the people.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  So this is our plan. This is our fuel. This is our launch operation. This is our target. That's how we're doing it to answer the media.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  And I haven't even gone to the private investors. I haven't gone to the private equity people. I haven't gone to the private placement people.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  I haven't gone to the going public situations. And I know that scared Soros when he learned that we were being offered a bunch of money by folks and all the rest of it.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  That's why they filed all their fake lawsuits, which are getting thrown out of court and are being defeated.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  The point is, is that we're not trying to get a jet airplane or a bigger house.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  I'm trying to hire people and launch a 24 hour radio slash TV network that's hardcore that then makes it safe for the other talk show hosting people by getting our research to then go to the next level, which the media matters and CNN and all the rest of them have already figured that out.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  They've already figured out that we kind of break through the electronic Berlin wall. We put out the research we have the expert guest on. Then that makes it safe for it to get picked up by Hannity Limbaugh and all the rest of which is great.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  Because they're not plagiarizing me. They're actually seeing the research doing their own research finding out it's true. So we're normalizing the Liberty movement.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  We're normalizing not wanting to be ruled by secret offshore corporations that want us to be poor.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  We're normalizing that the Vatican's run by pedophiles, which is now confirmed. We're normalizing that CNN's fake news. We're normalizing it's okay to not be politically correct.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  And everything they do is to bully us into total submission to go along with that agenda. That's why they're telling you, oh, don't say 1776. It's a hate word or oh, apologize when you change your baby's diaper. You're a pervert.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  No, you've got a weird twisted mind trying to make us like you, in my opinion. That's what this is all about. So it's all coming to a head at an incredibly historic moment.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  The tide is turning. Trump is winning. Nationalism is winning. Humanity is coming up from the water trying to get air. We're fighting for our lives, but at least we're fighting.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  And that's why we need your prayers, your support, and to spread the articles, the videos, the links, you name it.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  It's because that's how we get past their electronic Berlin Wall. When you buy the products, we do it as well.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  We got Vox De Nio. I'm fired up. Yeah. When we come back, we're going to have them on the show. We're going to wake up other people and we're going to win.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  And we're going to crush the apathy. We're going to crush the globalists. We're going to smash them. Victory's ours. Stay with us and spread the live legs or roll over.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  Were you born before the year 1956? If so, did you know you could be collecting between $575 and $2,200 in tax-free income right now?

[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:22.000]  Attacking the power structure. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we see a lot of hype in media.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:49.000]  But you know, I'll tell you when the grades are dire. I'll tell you when we're losing, so we'll get up and fight back.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:56.000]  We are winning globally. Nationalism, populism, Christianity's coming back from the dead.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  People understand globalism as death. Collectivism, communism is death.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  A lot of bad stuff's happening too. GMO, the smartphones, you know, suicide going up.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  But that's people that haven't been warned who are susceptible. There's a larger and larger minority cadre of every race, color, and creed who is awake.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  And this situation with the Obama administration and the Hillary campaign caught spying on Trump during the campaign and after.
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  We was president-elect and they're arrogant saying, watch your mouth two days before the inauguration, Brennan.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  And the eclipse of Schumer going on TV and going, the intelligence communities have seven ways from Sunday to, you know, to destroy you.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  And I read The New York Times. Don't worry, we know he's a Russian agent. We spied on him.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  And I'm like, look, they admit in all these articles, they spied on him.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  Then they went, we never said that. Jones is crazy. And Trump got it from Jones and this is all insane.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  I mean, I've got every major news channel saying that. By the way, Trump didn't get it from me. I got it from Trump.
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  I got it from the same people in CENTCOM that told me where to look. They didn't give me anything classified.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  They said, these arrogant SOBs have been shooting their mouths off. Look here, here, and here.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000]  I've got more stuff sent to me today. Because, and then it's all right there.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  And so now it's all coming out. They are in full panic mode. A criminal investigation has begun.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  And Vox Day, a best-selling author, researcher, he's over in Europe.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  And he, I already wanted him on another subject. He said, no, I'm going to talk about this because this is showing that America is worse in many cases than Banana Republics.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  We're naive about it. And this whole deep state is in a lot of trouble. VoxDay.blogspot.com.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  We'll get into his books. He's got a new line of books coming out today. Alt Hero number one gets published.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  We'll talk about that towards the end of the hour. But I wanted to get him on right now.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  He was really on the bottom of the hour. I misread my sheet here. I apologize to the producers.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  Like I said, I'm kind of wound up today. Good ways and bad. I can just, it's just insane.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  The energy level, what's happening. I get excited by stuff like this Vox, but also at a gut level.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  I feel like the enemy's about to strike back. So I'm just totally agitated. Do you get what I'm saying?
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:33.000]  Absolutely. There's no question that every time the deep state takes a blow, they attempt to come up with some sort of way to intimidate and discourage people from looking too hard at what they're doing.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  But the reality is that the awareness of the deep state has never been greater.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  People didn't even understand what the deep state was. It was something that was usually talked about in a Turkish context.
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  And it was only when people began to understand what was going on in Turkey with Erdogan and the deep state there that they suddenly began to realize that the same process was at work in the United States as well.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  Exactly. They've spent decades since the 1947 National Security Act building the shadow government deep state.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  Then they spent decades having it go rogue and go completely illegitimate.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  And now in just a few years, it's crumbling, it's disintegrating, and its very foundations are imploding.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  Well, the thing that really struck me was the way in which these revelations about Stefan Halper's activities for the last 40 years have completely demolished the United States pretensions to moral superiority in the political context.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  A lot of people don't understand that this has very serious ramifications around the world because countries like Korea and countries like Indonesia have been looking at the different models.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  They look at the Chinese model. They look at the United States model.
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  And the main thing that the United States has had going for it besides its economic wealth has been its perception of moral superiority.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  The United States is the true voice of the people. It's a true democracy and that sort of thing.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  But with these revelations that the deep state has been interfering with United States presidential elections all the way back to Ronald Reagan versus Carter at the very least.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  This completely changes the moral ramifications of the United States political system as it's viewed by the rest of the world.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  And did you get my little point though? This is a real civil war and Trump's made the decision to destroy the old deep state and really try to get rid of it and be more direct and pragmatic.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  And so when I explained that it's the Pentagon, it's the DEA, I mean these are real sources that gave us these documents at great risk to themselves.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  These are real people that told us what to look at, what was going on, what was happening, and it turns out it's all true.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  What do you think CNN and all these people think now that they've said we're liars and all this and now it's coming out?
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  Well, I think they're terrified because for years they've relied on their ability to cover things up, both the people in the media as well as the people in the various bureaucracies and so forth.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  And so when you look at people like Ben Shapiro or you look at some of the people at CNN and even at Fox and you see people who have been elevated,
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  you have to wonder how many of them are getting payments like Stefan Halper was getting.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  They just revealed that the guy got paid something like $390,000 in 2016 and 2017.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  How many other people in the media are on similar payrolls?
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  Now we have to start asking those questions, especially when you see some of these individuals coming out and defending the deep state and saying,
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  oh, the FBI was just trying to protect Trump and coming up with these absurd cover stories and these absurd spins and these absurd explanations,
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  trying to hide the fact that we have this shadow system.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  It's more than just a shadow government because it extends into-
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  It's a parallel track and now they've got the point of trying to deconstruct the old track, the republic, and put us only on the new track,
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  but it's at that point that their new system implodes because we were here exposing it beforehand.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  And I think that's really where they were arrogant and didn't get what was happening.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  Well, I also think that they don't really understand how fragile their system is.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  One of the big problems of these various ideologies like communism, like feminism,
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  these different ideas that are not based in reality is that eventually they run into contact with reality and they tend to fall apart very rapidly.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  We saw that when we saw how quickly the Soviet Union fell apart.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  And so what a lot of people don't understand is that despite this all-encompassing system, despite the way that it extends tendrils into everything,
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  it's not very necessarily very stable.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  No, you're right. It's a parasite that thinks it's the actual system, but it's only a parasite and once that illusion's gone,
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  the man behind the curtain, the whole thing caves in and they don't know what to do.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  So they have megalomania. They're delusional and that con game works for so long, but then suddenly when it stops working,
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  it implodes very quickly. We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.

[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  It was very gold water. You can trace back the first person since the 50s and 60s
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  to really expose the conspiracy on a wide scale in Congress.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  Cleon Scousen was really who he was getting his information from
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  and he was a senior FBI agent who was allowed into the archives.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  But as soon as they figured out that big banks were funding the communists
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  as an outside threat to the West so that we could become a police state as well,
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  that was all shut down.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  But he said extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  This is a war for me, folks, and I'm not up here tooting my horn.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  But for whatever reason, they're mad at us.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  Well, it's because we're not afraid and we're loud and we're telling the truth.
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  And now I learned from Roger Stone, I talked to two of the people as well here on air.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000]  We're going to get them back on.
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  I've talked to two people that were grabbed up in the dragnet
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  and they've previously been on the shows, what I meant to say,
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  before they were caught up in the dragnet, Caputo and others, all about me.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  And I'm like, really, you're interrogated for eight hours
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  and they ask you 20, 30 questions about me and about Russians and all this.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  That's all just an attempt at intimidation.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  Roll over to us or we're going to come after you,
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  as if I don't know they're a bunch of thugs,
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  as if I don't know that the units out working for Mueller are bad people.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000]  It doesn't mean the whole FBI is bad.
[02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  But this is all really coming to a head.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  And we're talking to Vox Day author, researcher, all around smart guy to get his take on
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  the point in history we are now, how big this is,
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  and what you think they're going to do.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  What you think they're going to do to try to get out of this,
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  because that's my real concern.
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  Well, I think they are not going to do anything too direct,
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  simply because it's too much risk for them.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  When you've got a group of people who are very accustomed to winning,
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  they're not going to be prone to take a lot of risks.
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  And so I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to use the tools
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  and the methods that they've been using for the last 30 years.
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  A little bit of an intimidation here, a lot of false stories there.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  There's some idea that there's a connection between all of these FBI connected school shootings.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  But the main thing that we know is that Trump is relying very heavily on military intelligence
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  and on the US Marine Corps in particular.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  If you just look at the background of the people that he's got surrounding him,
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  you can see that he's being very, very careful about who he permits around him.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  And I think that that's important.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  And as somebody who's from a long time marine family myself,
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  these are people who are genuine patriots who take their oath to defend the Constitution
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  against enemies foreign and domestic very seriously.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  And I don't think it's an accident that we're seeing so much
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  Marine Corps related military intelligence surrounding the president right now.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  Well, adding to that, I was never somebody that just said,
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  oh, our military is perfect.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  It's great because I saw it being used as propaganda for the globalist.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  I was four people in the military.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  But just being on the air 23 years now,
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  the intel I've gotten from the military has always been accurate.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  They are the people fighting back.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  They're the people on the inside that are helping the American people get Trump in.
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  And I look at the military in other countries.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  They're the ones pulling out of globalism as well because they're trained to fight a foreign enemy.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  And globalism is this multinational foreign enemy.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  And so, yeah, they may have the intelligence chief heads,
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  and they may have some of the top brass on the globalist side.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  But more and more, more and more, especially as Trump begins to win,
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  people are going from being neutral to being pro-Trump.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  And I think that's why the globalists realized they're about to lose.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  And you saw Giuliani, or you probably did.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  We played a few times here.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  Say on Fox over the weekend, he said, we can basically destroy you.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  We want peace.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  We want to stop this now and just move forward.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  We're trying to give you parlay.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  We're trying to give you quarter.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  But if you don't give us quarter, we're going to physically rip you to pieces.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  He says, we're going to rip your report apart, and we're going to rip you apart.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  And then he smiled.
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  And you can tell it's not a bluff because we know what they've done.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  The arrogance of the psychopaths throughout history that get into power,
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  who think they have unlimited power, I'll never forget Brennan.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  Two days before the inauguration, headline, Brennan, head of the CIA tells President Trump,
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  watch your mouth, and then when he got fired, three days after Trump got in, he was shocked.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  He thought he was God.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  What is their psychology, Fox?
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  Well, it's the problem that a lot of businessmen have after they've been successful for a long time.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  When you've been successful doing a certain thing a certain way,
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  it's almost impossible to change your tactics.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  It's almost impossible to change your strategy.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  And so a lot of what they have relied upon is deception.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  And they mistake the influence that they have from that deception for genuine power.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  And so it was, I want to get back to a point that you made about the way in which around the world,
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  the militaries are fighting back against globalism.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  And we're seeing that, for example, even in countries like Italy, even in countries like Switzerland.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  It was kind of interesting because the Swiss government tends to be fairly globalist.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  A lot of the big banks are located there, of course.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  But it was fascinating when one of their top generals came out and said,
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  we're instituting these military preparedness plans
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  because we believe there's going to be massive ethnic conflict throughout Europe.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  And the generals and the militaries are preparing for the very stuff
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  that the politicians are running around promising people is never going to happen.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:23.000]  And so this clash between globalism and nationalism
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  is not just the Trump administration against the deep state here,
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  but it's the nationalist parties against the EU
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  and against their collaborationist governments at the national levels.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  And that's why I get chills up my spine when you talk about that
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  because I even forgot that headline last year and those are several others.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  It was even worse than you said, you're being conservative.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  The headlines were Swiss generals, it was a couple others as well,
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  made similar statements, they said, are preparing for a civil war in Europe
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  because the EU opening borders and that they believe that starting in Eastern Europe
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  it'll flow and the countries are all going to go against it
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  and then unify and that they believe Germany and France may cause a war.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  Now that was last year.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  Now the EU run by Germany is threatening EU military to enter countries.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  They told Italy as you know last year,
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  if you keep stopping Zodiac boats that Soros brings in from North Africa every day,
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  we may use ships to physically stop you.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  They're calling for a navy to block nation states' navies,
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.000]  which tells us folks we're already in full civil war against the globalists.
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  That's what I'm telling the listeners and the generals get it.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  The globalists want to implode the pension funds, make everybody poor,
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  create a giant underclass and then have a breakaway civilization
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  that seals all the technology.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  These generals aren't perfect angels, they're just not anti-human,
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  exterminist, crazy people.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Well, the fascinating thing about the Italian people's response to that threat by the EU
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  was to elect a Eurosceptic government which just took power yesterday.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  Movimento Cinque Stelle is of the left and the Liga,
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  which is led by the excellent Matteo Salvini, is of the right.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  But both parties are very heavily anti-EU, very heavily anti-globalist.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  And so the left and the right here in Italy have come together
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  and they're joining forces to kick out the EU.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  And there's a very good chance that you might see Italy leave the EU within a year or two.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  Because now they know the EU isn't about being able to drive through checkpoints quicker.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  It's not about being all friendly, it's about total enslavement to the globalists.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  It's all public.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  And the Communist Chinese coming into control Davos two years ago
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  and pointing their fingers at people, that woke Europe up.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  For an affordable price with InfoWars, life selects storable foods.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship,
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  As a society that is critical to this fight.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:21.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  And they offered a box day to share with us.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:31.000]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims.
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  There was no evidence for Trump's claims.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  So where did Trump get his info from the CIA, from the FBI?
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  Where are you getting this information?
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  From a very reputable source.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  What, the FBI, the CIA?
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  You know he's legit.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  He did a major news program in the country last April, May.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  They came out and said, Alex Baldwin came out and said, Alex Jones says they were spying on me.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  They've been spying on my campaign.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  I didn't just make that up.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  They bragged about it.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  And then I confirmed from sources how they were doing it.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  I knew a year before it was in the intercept that Trump had basically not even hired.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  Eric Prince just did it.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  I don't want to get into the details of it because I don't know the details.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  I don't want to know the details.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  But he went and hired former head of black water to say what you want about that.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  He went and hired other groups.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:33.000]  And let's just say I know a lot more.
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  And let's just say that everything I was told was dead on accurate.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  I'm always like, why am I being told all this?
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  You're on the team, buddy. You're trusted.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  And I've never been let down by any of these people.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  I used to get stuff from Patriots like 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  Everyone wouldn't go with it because I thought, oh, it must all be corrupt.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  No, there's good people there.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  They don't want to live under this.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  And a lot of them are pragmatists.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  Globalism wants to make you poor and wants to destroy whatever culture you've got to control you.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000]  Latin America could be super rich.
[02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  They've had countries richer than the U.S. before.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  Venezuela, the old saying, as rich as an Argentine, for Argentina,
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  they have systems to make you poor as a political control arm.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  It's feudalism.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  And that's all come back.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  But since I mentioned it a bunch, here's CNN saying, I made up.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  And it's not about us tooting our horn.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  It's why they're attacking us because they know we're a big enough media outlet.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  We can punch through and get other people we have on as guests to punch through.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  And then it gets to the decision makers.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  Basically, we're covering what people in the government already know that are patriots.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  So why do they support the show?
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  Because they already know more than we do in many cases.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  But it decompartmentalizes them, and then it allows them to know they're not alone.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  So we give aid and comfort to the patriots psychologically.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  That, hey, you got a radio show.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  You got a TV show.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  Hey, we're fighting.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  And that's why they're out to get info wars to set the precedent.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  We'll talk to Vox Day about how he thinks they'll strike back.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  Keep going back to this because we're having victory right now.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  Trump's winning.
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  Nationalism's winning.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  But they're about to strike back.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  They're already striking back.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  So get ready.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  But right now, let's go ahead and play this clip again from Anderson Cooper on March.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  Was it March 2nd?
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  We wrote about it March 3rd.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  This is a year and three months ago.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  Literally playing dumb months after they admitted they were spying on Trump.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  They tried to spin it that, oh, Alex Jones made it up as if I'm this discredited person.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  But now notice how that's boomerang back.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  Here it is.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  And so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  that he was wiretapped, which developed on the kind of fringe right wing media.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  And then after his tweet storm, info wars then started saying, well, look,
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story, misreading our story.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  And now a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing info wars.
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  So they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right wing fringe theory,
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000]  both of which there's no evidence to support.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  And just to be clear, there is, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump, correct?
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  Nothing.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  I mean, if we knew that, that is a fantastic story.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  That we would be rushing.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  I would not be sitting here with you.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  I'd be at home writing in or out reporting it.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  Let's stop there.
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.000]  It just goes on.
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  All of it confirmed.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  We broke the Halpern thing, all of it.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000]  But I was even told later by one of my sources, he said, you know, it's not just Cooper that's CIA.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000]  That's leftist arm of the CIA.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  And he said, you know, the guy they had on with him.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  Why don't you call CNN and ask him who's he worked for?
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  Because here's what is so scary.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  And what VoxA was getting to their system so fragile that once there's a chink in the
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  armor, it's all over.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  Well, we just blew their whole breastplate off.
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  Think that's an accurate statement, Vox?
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  Without question.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:10.000]  And it's interesting because what they're accusing you of, as is very often the case, exactly
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  what they're doing.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  You know, whenever they focus criticism on someone they're trying to discredit, one of
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  the things they often do is to accuse you of what they're already doing.
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  You know, they find it impossible to imagine that anybody is operating any other way.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  And so when they're making an accusation like that of you, you can be very, very certain
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  that if you look hard enough, you'll find them doing precisely that.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  That's really smart because I've been told by retired high-level spy chiefs and others
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  that these aren't that smart of people, Alex.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000]  They're all about how they look and how they act.
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  They're given a playbook.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:53.000]  If you don't know what to do, just invert, invert, invert, what you just said.
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  That's what Satanists do.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  They just invert every day.
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  And to get to your point or your question about how they're going to strike back, the two
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  areas that they're going to focus on are deplatforming because that's obviously the first thing that
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  they always go to.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  The other thing that they're pushing hard at is they're trying to demonetize everything
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  and everyone.
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  So it's going to be harder and harder for right-wing companies and right-wing individuals to create
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  bank accounts, to get credit cards.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  We're already seeing a gunsmithing.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  Oh, yeah, they're going right to the gulag method of most conservative sides can't even
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  have their credit card processing revoked.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  Amazon won't take their books now, won't take Christian advertisers.
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  You're absolutely right.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  And that's the big thing.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:58.000]  Trump must move against the racketeering of the deplatform because it is so criminal.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:03.000]  Yeah, I think that the most useful thing that Trump could do once he manages to break the
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:14.000]  deep state is to break the corporate wall and what the corporate wall is is the big social
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:21.000]  media plus the big online retailers and they've created a system.
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  They've basically created a shadow economy that is the online economy, but they've rigged
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  it in a way so that only people who are favored are able to benefit to the fall from it.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  Voss, I know you have your own show and write books, but you're so smart because if you look
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  at what Trump's doing, he's got to break the deep state.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  He first had to turn the economy on to show people that it could be done, that we've been
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  screwed by design.
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  Then he has to break the deep state, which he's almost done.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  And then his next thing, he is going to break up Amazon because he understands that it's
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  a whole thing even worse than China that's depressing the economy.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  Well, I think that if you look at the combination of Facebook and Google, which now presently
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  account for something like 85% of all online advertising, simply breaking up that duopoly
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  would offer a lot of opportunity to a lot of new players.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  Amazon, they're in a difficult position because on a global scale, they're not equipped to
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:36.080]  compete with the big Chinese Alibaba, I think it's called.
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:37.080]  And so, you know-
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:42.880]  No, I agree with you, but when it comes to funding, Trump knows that shadow funding, even
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:49.280]  worse than Soros, Bezos is so crazy that he is actually almost rivaling in funding against
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:50.800]  Trump and America Soros.
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:53.120]  I mean, what a stupid position, exactly.
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:56.800]  If Amazon worked with everybody, we could use it against the Chinese, but he's just
[02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:57.800]  crazy.
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:07.560]  Well, that's the difficult position that Bezos has put Amazon in because on the one hand,
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:16.160]  you've got something that you should be for everyone, you know, it's a wonderful platform.
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:22.880]  And they've managed it in a way, essentially, it's never made any money, and the investors
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:27.040]  don't care about it making any money because it just keeps becoming more valuable by gaining
[02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:29.760]  more and more market share.
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:36.760]  But as with all giants, the more that they start to abuse their position, the more that
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:39.920]  they create the opportunity for them to be disrupted.
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:45.880]  And so, I expect, and I've already seen some signs, that there's going to be a number of
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:53.680]  seriously well-funded, seriously well-conceived attempts to disrupt Amazon.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.840]  So they're going to be coming up against Alibaba and the Chinese on one side, they're going
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:00.880]  to be coming up against these competitors on the other.
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:05.880]  And then you've got the potential risk of the antitrust from the Trump administration
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:06.880]  as well.
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:10.400]  I've noticed the only truth Amazon tells the Washington Post is exposing the Communist
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.520]  Chinese because he gets Alibaba as government backed.
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:16.440]  And like, why is he against Trump, he's a moron.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:19.000]  Let's just get out of the way, man.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.240]  You can have to be the richest guy in the world, just don't try to screw over America
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:23.760]  and take our guns, jerk.
[02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:29.200]  But again, they trained them all, very young, these leftists like Baby Ducks, who imprint
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.440]  on hating America and hating Christians.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:34.200]  We're going to come back, I want you to be able to plug your new comment books coming
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  out, your other books.
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:39.560]  We're back in just two minutes, final segment with Vox Day, who I tell you is awesome, hope
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.920]  we'll come on a lot more, and then we've got Matt Bracken coming up, fourth hour straight
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:43.920]  ahead.
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:58:11.720]  Thank you.
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:16.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:21.720]  fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:22.720]  symptoms.
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:26.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:31.320]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:37.120]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:39.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:45.920]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:52.260]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:58:52.260 --> 02:58:58.640]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:05.880]  or videos or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:05.880 --> 02:59:10.920]  I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products at
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:11.920]  infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:15.640]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with
[02:59:15.640 --> 02:59:21.080]  colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children
[02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:22.080]  and adults.
[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:25.840]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:33.680]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or triple-A2533139, and your purchase of the products stands
[02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:37.200]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:41.480]  satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and
[02:59:41.480 --> 02:59:48.920]  they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:48.920 --> 03:00:15.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:19.360]  All right, final segment of Vox Day.
[03:00:19.360 --> 03:00:25.760]  We are living in epic times right now, and speaking of not being funded by the big globalist,
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:30.420]  when Vox sells his books, that's how he funds his operation and what he does with the show.
[03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:33.560]  When we sell products at infowarsstore.com, that's how we're doing all of this, so thank
[03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:34.560]  you all.
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:36.320]  When you thank me, it's really obscene.
[03:00:36.320 --> 03:00:40.720]  Thank you for funding us, got a bunch of products, like DNA force, bodies, ultimate
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:47.720]  formula, all the fluoride-free toothpaste, all of it, 50% off, that all has to end tomorrow.
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:51.880]  The sale will go through Wednesday morning, that's it, infowarsstore.com, but Vox, speaking
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.560]  of yourself and the work you're doing, tell us, you know, you've written, SJW is always
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:59.720]  lying, SJW is always double down.
[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:04.240]  Those books are available at a lot of different places, like voxday.blogspot.com, but also
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:09.320]  you are now just releasing today, because you're also a big comic book publisher, Alt
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:12.920]  Hero, number one, tell us about that.
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:18.800]  Well, for about the last three years, people have been encouraging me to get into comics,
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:23.200]  because they said the SJWs have completely destroyed the comics industry, they've completely
[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:26.720]  taken over Marvel, they've completely taken over DC.
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:35.120]  And so, we did a Kickstarter on Free Starter, and we actually ended up raising more money
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:41.920]  than anyone had ever raised for a new comic before, and everybody was astonished.
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:48.440]  And so, I was very, very happy today to be able to announce the release of the first
[03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:57.040]  digital edition of Alt Hero, and it's a big step in the culture wars, because it's the
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:05.080]  first time that the right is actually taking back ground that the left had previously claimed.
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:11.000]  And so, the response has been fantastic, it's already the number one new release in comics
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  on Amazon.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  Wow.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:14.080]  We should have led with that.
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:20.360]  The number one new independent comic guy in the world, voxday is on with us.
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:21.360]  But you know what?
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:25.120]  I used to have a crush on Baroness, even though she was a bad girl, but I do like the, I like
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:28.320]  the Marilyn Monroe shaped redhead, who's she?
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:36.120]  Oh, that's Dina Meek, and she's the newest recruit to the Global Justice Initiative.
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.480]  And if you like Dina Meek, you're really going to like Rebel, who gets introduced in
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:41.480]  Alt Hero number two.
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:46.040]  Well, I got to tell you, it's awesome, because notice she doesn't look like a heroin head.
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:49.240]  She hasn't been drinking soy, she looks like a woman.
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:58.280]  Yeah, it's actually a lot of fun to go in and violate pretty much all of the SJW imperative
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:02:59.280]  lives.
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:06.520]  You know, they're chopping the hair off women, they're making all the women fat.
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:07.640]  It's really ridiculous.
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:13.640]  And so, you know, the artists have been really excited about being able to draw proper comics
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:14.640]  again.
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:17.920]  And, you know, for me, it's fun to be able to tell a story.
[03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:18.920]  Yeah, think about that.
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:21.680]  You don't see the archetypal goddess imagery anymore.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:25.480]  Like when you see a god, you know, you see it.
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.640]  Because they either want fat and look like a man or like an emaciated little boy, not
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:30.640]  the goddess.
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:31.640]  You know, look.
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:33.840]  Oh, exactly.
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:34.840]  And that's intentional.
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:40.240]  You know, if you look at what they're doing, they keep introducing more and more gay characters,
[03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:45.040]  more and more transgender characters, and this is very, very intentional.
[03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:50.040]  And so, what we are doing is we're coming back and we're hitting them hard.
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:56.320]  And we are, we're coming, the storylines revolve around globalism versus nationalism.
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:59.360]  But it's not, it's not preachy.
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:04.440]  You know, I'm a novelist, so I understand the importance of, you know, the story has
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.440]  to come first.
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:06.440]  Settling.
[03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440]  You can't preach the people.
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440]  Settling.
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:10.440]  Well, exactly.
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:15.720]  And the thing is, is that because of what's going on in real life, like for example, here
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:20.120]  it talks about how across the city of Berlin arrests are taking place.
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:28.880]  Well, the ironic thing is, I wrote that before the German police actually executed very similar
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:29.880]  raids.
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:31.760]  They just didn't use superheroes to do it.
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:35.440]  I know you got to go, let's do five more minutes and Matt Braggen's taking over.
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.440]  This is so revolutionary.
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:40.480]  We should have opened up with the fact you're launching this comic because this is revolutionary.
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:45.000]  We don't just let the left and sorrows the globalist take over every, like Marvel and
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.880]  DC have comics against me that are on store shelves.
[03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:51.880]  I've been in a store and seen a comic book attacking me.
[03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:54.680]  We've got to get on this turf and Vox Day is doing it.
[03:04:54.680 --> 03:05:01.800]  You're a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWarsLife.

[03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:29.480]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:32.840]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown has a nickname for Trump.
[03:06:32.840 --> 03:06:34.840]  It's the wrecking ball.
[03:06:34.840 --> 03:06:38.080]  You know, I've been called the bulldog and all that, but I can tell you I'm jealous of
[03:06:38.080 --> 03:06:39.080]  that nickname for Trump.
[03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:44.040]  I want to be known as the wrecking ball because I'm not so.
[03:06:44.040 --> 03:06:48.560]  I'm like a big old 2,000, 3,000-pound wrecking ball slamming into the face of the globalist,
[03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:55.440]  but then there's all the intellectual gravitas and intelligence of the artist and the subtlety
[03:06:55.440 --> 03:06:56.440]  and all of it.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:07:01.520]  But once you realize how the globalists are hitting you with subtle propaganda, but then
[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:07.840]  also over the top on top of it, then you see something like a Vox Day comic coming out,
[03:07:07.840 --> 03:07:14.040]  already the number one new comic on Amazon, and it just shows how people immediately see
[03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:17.680]  what they've been having taken away from them.
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:24.400]  And it's just absolutely amazing, like the whole feminist thing takes away femininity
[03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:27.560]  and claims we want women on a pedestal, they take them down off the pedestal.
[03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:31.360]  But you see that first comic, the woman is on the pedestal right there.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:32.360]  She's the power.
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:36.080]  And see, that's the opposite of what the left claims they're doing for you, but they're
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:41.880]  taking that magic power because they want to imprison that and they do it on every front.
[03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:45.480]  They teach males to be all sneaky and manipulative and cowardly and, you know, they say, there's
[03:07:45.480 --> 03:07:50.200]  a myth of masculinity, there's a myth of femininity, no it's not.
[03:07:50.200 --> 03:07:54.840]  And the way they want to try to define everything, I've got articles right here where they were
[03:07:54.840 --> 03:08:00.560]  going to have a big event, a high school principal apologizes for party like it's 1776 on prom
[03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:05.520]  tickets, Jamie White in FullWars.com, New Jersey High School, they were having an event
[03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:09.400]  at the Constitution Center.
[03:08:09.400 --> 03:08:14.040]  America was about the idea of empowering everybody, didn't mean it started right away.
[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:17.920]  The West is what was the forefront, but then they're saying, you're not part of the West,
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:19.440]  you're not part of the future.
[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:24.880]  People are offended by 1776, well then blow the Liberty Bell up, burn down Constitution,
[03:08:24.880 --> 03:08:31.320]  Paul, get rid of July 4th then, how they're stealing your birthright.
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:35.320]  Most white people's ancestors came here after the Civil War.
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:40.440]  Your birthright's 1776, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, but they steal it from you
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:46.120]  like they're representing you and if you look everywhere they're stealing the power, everywhere
[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:50.760]  they're stealing the archetypes, everywhere they're stealing what makes us great and they
[03:08:50.760 --> 03:08:57.080]  have academics and people on the BBC saying, when you change your diaper, you have to ask
[03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:01.960]  permission or you're a pervert, no a pervert says something like that to introduce that
[03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:06.280]  into our mind, like Dana Lash getting it and saying, look at the studies, you promote
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:10.680]  school shootings, you promote the shooters, it didn't happen before 1999, we already had
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:16.640]  the guns then, it's the evil, the psychological poisoning coming in, but once you're aware
[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:21.480]  of the poisoning then it loses all power, even if you're talking to someone who's been
[03:09:21.480 --> 03:09:26.400]  under the spell of the poisoning, once you show them the spell and how they were psychologically
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:32.760]  hit, they can break out of it sometimes in minutes, but again they need the human touch,
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:36.200]  they need us that are awake to go out and break them out of the spell.
[03:09:36.200 --> 03:09:40.120]  Fox Day, I'm very excited about what you're doing, glad to hear your new comic book, it's
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:43.520]  already number one on Amazon, tell folks how they can get it, I want to buy a ton of them,
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:50.000]  if I get a great deal I'll put them for discounted inside all my packages because I realize that
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:55.320]  this is information warfare and comics are paramount right now because they're archetypal
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:01.280]  and it's something the enemy completely controls, so now it's time to take back that and build
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:03.360]  a beachhead, so tell me about it.
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:09.680]  Well, first of all, I want to point out that if you've got a Kindle Unlimited that the
[03:10:09.680 --> 03:10:18.360]  comic is free to you, so the digital comic, we have print versions coming out very soon,
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:24.520]  these are two of the early ones that we did, we're going to have Alt Hero out in print
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:32.360]  within two weeks and it's going to be in German, Italian, and French, and possibly Swedish
[03:10:32.360 --> 03:10:44.360]  as well, and so we are committed to bringing out these quality stories in a way that is
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:51.160]  vastly superior to what DC and Marvel are doing, it is our long-term goal to become the number
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:58.480]  three company in comics and eventually start producing movies and all that sort of thing,
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:06.440]  and we think it's doable because there is such a hunger in the market, the comic market
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:13.000]  has shrunk by about 25% in the last three years just because the SJWs are telling these
[03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:19.560]  stories and pushing these messages that nobody wants to read, and so this is a genuine alternative
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:28.280]  that the storyline is fundamentally based on nationalism and globalism because that's
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:35.160]  the most relevant story in the world today, and like I said, if you've got Kindle Unlimited
[03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:41.080]  you can check it out for free, it's only $2.99 and I think if you look at the reviews, people
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:42.080]  are really enjoying it.
[03:11:42.080 --> 03:11:47.240]  Let's be clear, driving something like this to the top, just like you've done with your
[03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:54.040]  Kickstarter and all the other stuff you've done sets the precedent, nothing succeeds
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:59.840]  like success, and the work's great, it's amazing, and it's already number one on Amazon, so
[03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:04.280]  and again I'm not criticizing anybody that's on Amazon, we're on Amazon, we sell our products
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:09.000]  there as well, but we have to do that where people can sell counterfeits, so we have to
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.600]  be on there to control the market, we don't promote the fact we're on Amazon, but when
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:17.800]  it comes to print, it dominates it, so the fact that you've got it discounted for folks
[03:12:17.800 --> 03:12:22.640]  and free for people that already have the Kindle, that is very, very exciting, so good
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:27.320]  job having the number one new hot release with Alt Hero, that's got to make you really,
[03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:31.200]  really happy, Vox Day.
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:41.440]  I'm more relieved, this was the first time that we ever did a comic, and so it was definitely
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:45.240]  a new experience, but we have a great team.
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:52.080]  We've got the best writer in comics who's doing a separate series for us called Avalon,
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:59.800]  his name's Chuck Dixon, he's the man, and it's only gonna get better from here, we're
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:06.120]  just learning what we're doing, and I think within a year or so a lot more people are
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:07.120]  gonna be familiar with it.
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:11.800]  And you're right, the market is there for nationalism, for liberty, for freedom, but
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:17.560]  all these corporate guys wanna play it safe, less the newspaper attack you, you want to
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:24.840]  be attacked by the fake news, I mean, I don't get how they have turned so many men into
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:30.400]  these jellyfish cowards, and even if they were cold blooded, the liberty movement is
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:35.040]  the place to grow and expand, they don't get that, they're so stupid.
[03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:43.760]  Well, you have to expect it, we just released Alt Hero today, but already Rolling Stone
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:51.560]  and NPR are doing a hit piece on us, they interviewed Chuck Dixon about a week ago,
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:54.720]  they wanted to interview me a second time, I just said, hey, look, you've got enough
[03:13:54.720 --> 03:14:04.280]  information, so the whole discredit disqualification campaign is going to begin, but we're not
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:05.280]  afraid of that.
[03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:09.920]  Exactly, the headline's gonna be, take white supremacist media off the web, even though
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:11.840]  that's not what it is, I mean, that'll be it.
[03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:17.640]  We can't compete against this, we own the universe, don't let him have that.
[03:14:17.640 --> 03:14:22.960]  Oh, I have no doubt that it's going to get a lot of negative media attention once the
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:28.440]  media embargo cracks.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:30.600]  Where do you go from here?
[03:14:30.600 --> 03:14:40.720]  Well, we gotta scale up, I mean, the big thing is, we now have the process in place, we've
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:46.960]  got the books coming out, we've got the comics coming out, now the thing is to go from selling
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:55.200]  2,000 of a book to trying to sell 10,000 of a book, once you hit that level, then you
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:56.200]  can do-
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:14:59.320]  That's just because it's easier, big fish eat little fish.
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:08.720]  Right, but we will not be selling out to Marvel or, you know, our publishing company Castelia
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:15.680]  House has had, I think, four offers so far, and we're just not interested in doing that
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:19.480]  because we like what we're doing, we enjoy what we're doing, and we believe in what we're
[03:15:19.480 --> 03:15:25.920]  doing, and as you can see, we're not afraid to fly the Confederate flag despite the fact
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:33.400]  that the left has come out so hard against it, and basically, we look for anything the

[03:17:34.240 --> 03:17:39.320]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a
[03:17:39.320 --> 03:17:40.320]  shadow government.

[03:20:19.680 --> 03:20:25.720]  I'm sure we'll get into the shooting in Texas and the huge news of the ongoing moves over
[03:20:25.720 --> 03:20:30.800]  the criminal investigations now afoot against the illegal spy network that we first exposed
[03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:31.800]  a year and a half ago.
[03:20:31.800 --> 03:20:33.240]  Matt Bracken, thanks for joining us.
[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:34.240]  Take over.
[03:20:34.240 --> 03:20:35.240]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:20:35.240 --> 03:20:36.240]  What a day.
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:42.960]  Three o'clock is the hour that supposedly Christopher Ray and Rod Rosenstein have been
[03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:47.400]  commanded to come to the White House to get a spanking, I think.
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:51.520]  So I think we're going to be seeing some major evening news tonight.
[03:20:51.520 --> 03:20:56.000]  I don't know if Rod Rosenstein is going to be fired, if that's going to be the news.
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:01.760]  I'd like to see President Trump going over to the Department of Justice and the FBI
[03:21:01.760 --> 03:21:09.480]  with the U.S. Marshals and go in with orders to remove what the House Intelligence Committee
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:10.480]  wants.
[03:21:10.480 --> 03:21:13.880]  Otherwise, anybody standing in the way is going to be let out in handcuffs.
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:14.880]  That's right.
[03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:15.880]  Let's be clear.
[03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:17.960]  Let's thank God you're here.
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:22.040]  The President can declassify anything he wants, and for months they won't give noon as any
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:23.040]  of this stuff.
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:27.080]  So, I mean, I agree with the fact that they're being summoned as we speak.
[03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:28.080]  This is historic.
[03:21:28.080 --> 03:21:30.040]  They're about to be given an ultimatum like Giuliani.
[03:21:30.040 --> 03:21:34.080]  He's going to say, listen, I'm going to let you skate like Napoleon to Albu, but you
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:36.960]  guys are going to run the white flag up or I'm going to drop the hammer on you.
[03:21:36.960 --> 03:21:39.160]  Yeah, I think he is going to drop the hammer.
[03:21:39.160 --> 03:21:45.320]  And I think that this is what Sundance at a conservative treehouse, he's been a contrarian
[03:21:45.320 --> 03:21:46.320]  on this.
[03:21:46.320 --> 03:21:52.840]  He's been saying that Sessions and Trump have been hanging back, letting the coup plotters
[03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:59.480]  basically hang themselves and dig themselves in deeper.
[03:21:59.480 --> 03:22:03.080]  And that's why Sessions wouldn't touch anything and recuse himself?
[03:22:03.080 --> 03:22:08.700]  I think, no, I think that, yeah, exactly, that Sessions won't even make a statement
[03:22:08.700 --> 03:22:14.520]  because anything that he said would be perceived as politicizing the outcome.
[03:22:14.520 --> 03:22:21.040]  So when the IG report comes, it might turn out that Huber from Utah is a white hat, even
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:23.480]  though he was a Democrat appointee.
[03:22:23.480 --> 03:22:27.600]  He might be a white hat and over at conservative treehouse.
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:32.760]  That's been the operating thesis is that when the IG drops, the indictments are going to
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:35.880]  drop that they've been working together.
[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:38.520]  And it's going to be a real tidal wave.
[03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:45.720]  And unlike in 1974 with Watergate, when the Republicans basically told Nixon to hang it
[03:22:45.720 --> 03:22:54.160]  up, the Democrats are basically deciding to stay in this Kamikaze plane on fire right
[03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:59.000]  into the ground, which is great because I think they could be wiped out in the midterm.
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:02.680]  I was about to say, I think the tide has turned, all the numbers, all the facts show it.
[03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:06.280]  They've been caught lying saying there was no spying, now the FBI admits it happened.
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:07.560]  They can't recover from this.
[03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:11.000]  This is, this is, but let's not be too confident.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.400]  I think we're in prime false flag zone now.
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:17.560]  I think definitely, you know, where's, where's Joseph Mifsud?
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:23.640]  I think he's probably at the bottom of the Waikomiko River around where Colby had a canoe
[03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:24.640]  accident.
[03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:27.520]  You know, he hasn't been seen in months.
[03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:31.120]  And you know, we know from, we know John Brennan, he's a Stalinist.
[03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:37.840]  He voted communist in 76 and joined the CIA in 1980, which is amazing and then rose through
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:43.120]  the ranks and a Marxist named Barack Obama appointed him to be the head of the, you know,
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:46.960]  the entire central intelligence agency, a communist to me.
[03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:48.640]  I mean, I never saw a conversion.
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:53.000]  I never saw him, you know, write a paper saying how he regretted being a communist.
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.200]  Well, all of his actions have been to sell us out to China.
[03:23:55.200 --> 03:23:57.080]  So there you go.
[03:23:57.080 --> 03:23:58.080]  And Islam.
[03:23:58.080 --> 03:24:03.120]  You know, I'm talking to folks that confirmed they thought it was a fake conversion to get
[03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:04.120]  the Saudis on board.
[03:24:04.120 --> 03:24:05.840]  No, he converted Islam.
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:06.840]  Sure.
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:13.520]  And you know, this, this, um, event last Friday with Nunez, his, he had a huge, uh, really
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:19.400]  blockbuster interview with Maria Bartiromo, you know, when it counts, that woman has been
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:20.400]  stellar.
[03:24:20.400 --> 03:24:26.440]  I mean, she has got some nerve and guts, you know, even though she's on Fox business news,
[03:24:26.440 --> 03:24:30.780]  when it counts, she's in the, in the white hat corner, you can tell.
[03:24:30.780 --> 03:24:36.520]  And Nunez said that he didn't go over to the Department of Justice on Friday because he
[03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:39.880]  suspected he was being set up and it's brilliant.
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:45.600]  Um, I caught a little bit of rush earlier and other people are talking about it.
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:52.040]  If he had gone over to the DOJ to get, you know, uh, dragged around the, the poll again
[03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:58.080]  over looking at the scope memo, these articles that dropped in the Washington Post and the
[03:24:58.080 --> 03:25:01.880]  New York times were all timed.
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:06.360]  They would have followed the Nunez visit to the Department of Justice, then Nunez would
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:12.440]  have been cast as the leaker who outed the, you know, our wonderful brave informant, Stefan
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:16.920]  Halper and he, and Devin Nunez needs to be fired for good.
[03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:21.720]  So either Devin Nunez has ESP, which is certainly possible.
[03:25:21.720 --> 03:25:27.200]  I mean, he's, he's, after being run around the bushes so many times, he's probably very
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:31.200]  skeptical, obviously, but I'll bet there's some white hats inside of DOJ.
[03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:32.200]  Oh, of course.
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:36.480]  It's like William Mitty, when they were trying to set him up, had somebody drop an envelope
[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:38.000]  off at his house with all the evidence.
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:42.480]  I mean, that's why the globalists are in so much trouble is that I'd say there's a good,
[03:25:42.480 --> 03:25:46.680]  what 50% probably on the fence, just sitting back on their paycheck.
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:51.040]  And then the other, it's 25 evil, 25 good or, I mean, all I know is we know everything
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:52.040]  they're up to.
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:53.040]  Yeah.
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:55.400]  And it's, it's clear we do.
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:57.160]  And we've known for quite a while.
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:01.880]  It's just, you know, it's also pretty amazing to me what a bunch of pansies they are, even
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:06.040]  on Fox News, they still won't say the word Stefan Halper.
[03:26:06.040 --> 03:26:11.640]  I saw Roger Stone over the, I think was over the weekend, but he was on, no, it was a Friday
[03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:13.560]  night, I think Thursday or Friday night.
[03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:17.440]  He was on with Laura Ingram and he dropped the name.
[03:26:17.440 --> 03:26:23.320]  And I think she repeated it and it was, it was great because Roger also dropped that.
[03:26:23.320 --> 03:26:24.320]  Yeah.
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:30.680]  As I said, on info wars the other day, which was a completely gratuitous plug that I was
[03:26:30.680 --> 03:26:33.840]  like cheering when he said that that was great.
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:39.200]  You know, right on, right on Fox News, you know, saying the unsayable Stefan Halper and
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:41.800]  info wars all in the same paragraph.
[03:26:41.800 --> 03:26:42.800]  Exactly.
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:43.800]  Yeah.
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:45.400]  But this is, this is quite a day.
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:49.000]  This is a real day for history and I've actually prepared something that it's probably going
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:52.360]  to take me a full segment to give this little, I'm out of here.
[03:26:52.360 --> 03:26:55.800]  I'm just sitting, watching you and listening to my friend take over.
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:56.800]  You bet.
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:26:59.960]  Thanks a lot.
[03:26:59.960 --> 03:27:01.520]  Well we can, we can do phone calls.
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.280]  I don't know how much time I have left in this segment because I'm going to need.
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:08.520]  You have one minute, 30 seconds, so you can come back and do a nice 10 minutes segment.
[03:27:08.520 --> 03:27:10.680]  I have another 10 minutes for calls.
[03:27:10.680 --> 03:27:11.680]  That's perfect.
[03:27:11.680 --> 03:27:16.560]  You know, what a, what a time to be alive because we've been watching this for the last,
[03:27:16.560 --> 03:27:19.640]  for the last year, year and a half playing out.
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:24.320]  We've known what was happening, but we've been watching these deep state operatives clinging
[03:27:24.320 --> 03:27:31.200]  to their plan, even though Hillary lost the whole, the entire Crossfire Hurricane was
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:36.160]  predicated on, on Hillary wins and we cover the whole thing up.
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:43.600]  Brennan is, stays at CIA, Lynch stays at DOJ, you know, we'll win, we'll win the Congress
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:45.800]  and nothing will ever come of this.
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:50.960]  What a shock it must have been for them when Trump actually won and what's going to come
[03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:55.760]  out now is going to be shocking and I'm, and I'm so gratified to see all of these Democrats
[03:27:55.760 --> 03:28:00.800]  with very few exceptions, you know, just chaining themselves to the flaming wreckage of this
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:05.400]  plot because they are going to all crash into the mountain together and there's going to
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:06.840]  be no saving them.
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:13.080]  In fact, if I was a Republican, I'd be asking any Democrat now, do you denounce now these
[03:28:13.080 --> 03:28:15.080]  deep state plots against the president?
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:16.080]  That is genius.
[03:28:16.080 --> 03:28:17.080]  I'm going to steal that.
[03:28:17.080 --> 03:28:18.080]  Exactly.
[03:28:18.080 --> 03:28:22.040]  It's time for Democrats to either say they're on this train or off it and they're all going
[03:28:22.040 --> 03:28:23.920]  to sign on and go over the edge.
[03:28:23.920 --> 03:28:24.920]  Yeah.
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:31.400]  And down in flames and it's much worse than spying because they were using agents, provocateurs
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:33.000]  to set people up.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:38.080]  They were creating the illusion of collusion and then they were leaking it to the media
[03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:40.260]  that there was collusion.
[03:28:40.260 --> 03:28:44.560]  So this is not only going to take the Democrats down, it's going to take the Democrat liberal
[03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:45.560]  media down.
[03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:46.560]  Matt Bracken's on fire.
[03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:48.480]  There's going to be nothing.
[03:28:48.480 --> 03:28:50.120]  Matt, everybody tune in right now.
[03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:51.120]  Everybody spread the word.
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:53.320]  Matt's going to come out and lay it all out.

[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:33.760]  Well we're back and I'm running it by myself right now so have mercy on me I'm just an
[03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:35.520]  amateur at this.
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:45.520]  The call in numbers are if you don't already have this on speed dial 877-789-2539 that's
[03:33:45.520 --> 03:33:53.160]  789 Alex and we'll go to calls maybe in the next segment but I have a few announcements
[03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:59.320]  and then I've got a little talk I've already prepared I just sort of have an outline of
[03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:01.240]  it.
[03:34:01.240 --> 03:34:05.960]  When I come on the show every other Monday I usually put some of my books on to Kindle
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:08.840]  Free Run so that they're a free download.
[03:34:08.840 --> 03:34:16.520]  Today this book, Castigo Key, is a free to download it's the first of the novels that
[03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:23.800]  feature a new character the new one is Red Cliffs which is my very edgy counter jihad
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:29.240]  novel very unpolitically correct something that you know you'll never see advertised
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:36.560]  in mainstream media or even reviewed on what I call you know conservatism Inc. those guys
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:41.760]  you know they're so far behind the curve they consider me too far out in front I'm always
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:46.680]  too far out in front that's a problem when you're a novelist by the time that reality
[03:34:46.680 --> 03:34:51.600]  catches up I've already written another book that's still far out in front and you know
[03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:58.280]  they'll look bad to review a book that's predicting today 15 years ago so my novels just stand
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:03.840]  on their own reviews I'm never going to be you know mainstream household name that's
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:06.120]  for sure.
[03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:13.720]  Anyway today as we watch this unfolding of the unraveling of the deep state coup I'd
[03:35:13.720 --> 03:35:20.880]  like to sort of do a big picture analysis of where we are and what's really happening
[03:35:20.880 --> 03:35:26.800]  and to do this I've got to go back in time quite a bit and in fact I'm going to go I'm
[03:35:26.800 --> 03:35:35.240]  going to go all the way back to the 1700s and then bring it all the way forward to today
[03:35:35.240 --> 03:35:40.760]  you know the biggest mistake I think that Americans made I was a cold warrior my military
[03:35:40.760 --> 03:35:47.760]  time was during during you know Reagan that era and when the Cold War was over we thought
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:54.720]  that we won America was on top of the pile communism was defeated and we could coast
[03:35:54.720 --> 03:36:01.240]  you know maybe look for new enemies take it easy enjoy the peace the peace dividend and
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:10.080]  that was a huge huge mistake because in reality we didn't win the Cold War per se we defeated
[03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:19.080]  the Soviet Union economically but we did not defeat the idea of Marxism socialism communism
[03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:26.120]  the idea just went internal it went underground it made a metamorphosis into some more modern
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:35.640]  forms but it didn't disappear our mistake was to equate communism and the USSR thinking
[03:36:35.640 --> 03:36:44.160]  that if the USSR if the Soviet Union has collapsed therefore communism has collapsed but in fact
[03:36:44.160 --> 03:36:50.520]  that that is not what happened and their victory was a hollow victory it was a shameric victory
[03:36:50.520 --> 03:36:57.560]  the USSR was really just a vehicle you know Lenin launched communism in the Soviet Union
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:05.040]  in 1917 because it was available you know it was a shell on the on the back of World
[03:37:05.040 --> 03:37:14.320]  War one that was weak and and his ideas could spread easily he thought that when this revolution
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:23.280]  had succeeded in Russia he would be able to use his his Chekhov NKVD what we now called
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:31.240]  KGB and now FSB to foment revolutions country after country that was his concept going into
[03:37:31.240 --> 03:37:38.200]  the 20s but it didn't work there was an Italian named Antonio Gramsci who was probably much
[03:37:38.200 --> 03:37:46.080]  more far-seeing than Lenin and what he what he believed was that western western people
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:51.600]  loved their countries too much they loved their religion they loved their their societies
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:57.720]  and before the revolutions the revolutions could succeed in in the rest of the world
[03:37:57.720 --> 03:38:04.120]  those countries had to be sabotaged from within the people had to be had to be cut off from
[03:38:04.120 --> 03:38:08.560]  their roots from their history from their love for their countries from their love for
[03:38:08.560 --> 03:38:14.960]  their religions and he called it the long march through the institutions and that has
[03:38:14.960 --> 03:38:22.200]  succeeded wildly so I am sometimes I learn lessons from nature you know I love I love
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:29.960]  watching these these nature shows and one thing that came recently to me I never even
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:34.960]  heard of this but there's something out there called the the parasitic or the parasitoid
[03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:40.800]  wasp and there are thousands and thousands of species of these and what these guys do
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:46.520]  is they don't fight for a living they just inject their eggs right into a fat dumb and
[03:38:46.520 --> 03:38:53.520]  happy caterpillar so I created a meme and the the USA is that fat dumb and happy caterpillar
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:59.440]  and even though the wasp is dead guess what guess we're little communists are being produced
[03:38:59.440 --> 03:39:05.320]  now like those little wasps coming out of the of the dying caterpillar they're being
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:11.200]  created and born right here right in our own country all you've got to do is is look at
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:17.560]  our universities to see how we're pumping out little communists now communism had a brand
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:23.000]  name problem based on the fact that more than a hundred million people were murdered by communists
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:30.680]  in the 20th century so they had a PR problem and all they did was was rebrand so you can
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:38.440]  you can say forget whether we call it communism socialism cultural Marxism neo Marxism it's
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:46.680]  all the exact same thing and that's what we're facing now is is this burgeoning effect of
[03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:52.360]  of these little hatchlings coming out they've been breeding inside while on the outside
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:59.200]  we look like a nice healthy caterpillar rolling along munching the leaves inside we're producing
[03:39:59.200 --> 03:40:07.320]  the next generation a little communist wasps and you can see it happening so anyway there
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:13.280]  are there are a lot of the tactics that we see these neo Marxists using you can obviously
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:19.920]  they've taken over academia this was straight out of the Gramscian Frankfurt School playbook
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:27.360]  that they they have completely I think I saw where something like 98% of college commencement
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:35.600]  speeches are by ultra liberals slash you know cultural Marxists so they've absolutely won
[03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:43.200]  and dominated academia another way that another thing that they do is they always are for
[03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:49.120]  open borders now they they dress this up as social justice obviously if you think of it
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:54.080]  logically the math just doesn't work you know two or three billion people would love to
[03:40:54.080 --> 03:41:00.440]  move to America and that would be insane and would be our instant destruction if it happened
[03:41:00.440 --> 03:41:08.200]  so why do these cultural Marxists these neo Marxists want open borders because when when
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:14.600]  third world people not necessarily very intelligent poor with lots of problems when they move into
[03:41:14.600 --> 03:41:21.440]  our country they they not only will vote for whoever promises them the most but they also
[03:41:21.440 --> 03:41:26.600]  require lots of government workers to tend them and met and manage and take care of them
[03:41:26.600 --> 03:41:31.640]  so you can see what happens in California that's the plan for the rest of the country
[03:41:31.640 --> 03:41:37.400]  this is why the cultural Marxists hate the wall you know you can strip away all of the
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:42.920]  all of their terminology whether they're you know liberals whether they're Democrats social
[03:41:42.920 --> 03:41:50.080]  justice warriors they're called their Marxists it's what they've always been so what can
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:57.680]  we what can we do about this first of all educate ourselves and I've got four book recommendations
[03:41:57.680 --> 03:42:03.760]  I wish that I could get everybody to read and the first of them not many people have
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:09.360]  heard of but maybe it's the most important and it's and it's called hope of the wicked
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:16.920]  by Ted Flynn and it was written it was written before 9 11 so it pretty much is the history
[03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:25.520]  of Marxism up to 9 11 and it goes right back to the earliest times when the enlightenment
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:31.360]  happened and then man became divorced from God and some men began to think you know why
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:36.840]  don't we take over the role of God the first guy that that came up with this idea in a
[03:42:36.840 --> 03:42:44.960]  really cogent way was a man named Adam Weishaupt and he lived in the 1700s he was came along
[03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:51.920]  around 10 years before car before Robus here and his lifespan also overlapped that of Carl

[03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:29.920]  don't want you to hear he is alex jones i'm not at i'm not alex but i'm sitting in for
[03:47:29.920 --> 03:47:35.800]  him today this hour and i'm sorry i ran right into another break it seems to be my specialty
[03:47:35.800 --> 03:47:42.080]  sorry about that but i was talking about the beginning of marxism this is really a secular
[03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:47.200]  religion this is why we can't speak in terms of defeating it like in the cold war since
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:52.320]  we beat the survey union we've defeated communism we can move on to the next thing no this is
[03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:59.240]  completely wrong going all the way back to adam weithaupt and the and the illuminati
[03:47:59.240 --> 03:48:06.640]  these guys the illuminist influenced the french jackabins leading to the french revolution
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:13.320]  they also influenced carl marx a lot of marx's writings are taking taken straight from weithaupt
[03:48:13.320 --> 03:48:20.360]  straight from it it's almost the carl marx crib from him so in a sense adam weithaupt
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:28.360]  plus carl marx are sort of the mohammed of the of the secular religion known as marxism
[03:48:28.360 --> 03:48:35.080]  they're the they're the originators and this is a is an absolute religion to a vast majority
[03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:41.840]  of people and not maybe a vast majority of people but certainly the most influential
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:48.120]  religious force of the last 200 years has been the secular religion of marxism you
[03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:53.640]  can see this even the pope today is a marxist there are pictures where he's being given
[03:48:53.640 --> 03:49:06.280]  a hammer and sickle across hammer and sickle and he's grinning you know he is a marxist
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:12.600]  for sure so we can see that even within an institution like the catholic church marx
[03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:18.720]  is ascendant which seems amazing but it's true so that the next book on my list probably
[03:49:18.720 --> 03:49:23.440]  most people here are familiar with it creature from jekyll island is the foundation of the
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:28.920]  federal reserve system this is sort of the deep state of bankers this is the cabal that's
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:34.120]  really pulling the strings in congress you know the laws that are passed are passed on
[03:49:34.120 --> 03:49:42.760]  the base the on the the behalf of these bankers everybody's familiar i hope with with ed griffin's
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:49.560]  creature from jekyll island the next book american betrayal fabulous book by diana west
[03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:59.040]  this is uh came out in 2013 it goes back to fdr and his and his uh uh desire to converge
[03:49:59.040 --> 03:50:04.720]  the united states and communism he didn't come out and say that but all of the advisors
[03:50:04.720 --> 03:50:11.920]  around him he surrounded himself with communist agents such as such as uh uh harry hopkins
[03:50:11.920 --> 03:50:19.240]  harry dexter white uh uh alger hiss all of the leading people around fdr were basically
[03:50:19.240 --> 03:50:26.320]  working on behalf of the soviet union and communism fdr dies we win world war two everybody
[03:50:26.320 --> 03:50:33.120]  considers him a great hero but in many respects he was he was a trader he was working to converge
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:40.560]  our free market system and a communist so soviet style system and even though we had hearings
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:46.400]  in the fifties and everybody's familiar with uh with joe mccarthy in a sense the communists
[03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:52.080]  were never defeated they just burrowed burrowed deeper and deeper inside you can see that
[03:50:52.080 --> 03:50:59.120]  this is true because in in 1976 john brennan votes for the communist candidate for president
[03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:04.040]  gus hall this is when people were being dragged off to gulag still this was the height of
[03:51:04.040 --> 03:51:10.760]  the cold war in 1980 john brennan joins the cia he admits on polygraph that he voted for
[03:51:10.760 --> 03:51:15.680]  a communist does he get thrown out do they do you know do they tar and feather him do
[03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:23.040]  they beat him and chuck him onto the street no absolutely not he's he eventually rises
[03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:28.240]  to become the head of the cia this is back to my parasitic wasp you know the injecting
[03:51:28.240 --> 03:51:35.680]  the these little incubi of of marxism within our within our body and that's where we are
[03:51:35.680 --> 03:51:41.360]  today the last book on the list is not that well known it's um see something say nothing
[03:51:41.360 --> 03:51:48.320]  by phil haney and this is pretty current this is you know post 9 11 this this um islam and
[03:51:48.320 --> 03:51:53.880]  jihad expert is doing fantastic work within the department of homeland security he and
[03:51:53.880 --> 03:52:00.040]  everybody like him are purged when obama comes in and even before obama it began under bush
[03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:06.120]  they're purged and replaced with imams from the mo mslam brotherhood you know front groups
[03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:13.120]  like care so this this subversion from within is continuing right to today so it's no wonder
[03:52:13.120 --> 03:52:18.640]  that these deep state coup plotters have felt that they could that they could just uh seize
[03:52:18.640 --> 03:52:24.200]  the reins of power and you know it's it's not a wonder to me that we are that we've
[03:52:24.200 --> 03:52:29.240]  that we are where we are today because the real power within this country is in the hands
[03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:36.520]  of these subversives and i i don't know what uh more than can we we can do other than ensure
[03:52:36.520 --> 03:52:41.080]  that trump doesn't get kicked out of office vote for republicans hold your nose and vote
[03:52:41.080 --> 03:52:46.880]  for republicans so that he can't be impeached that's about all we can do otherwise um i
[03:52:46.880 --> 03:52:53.280]  don't see any any hope for us but uh you know today is a big day maybe trump is going to
[03:52:53.280 --> 03:52:58.760]  fire rod rozenstein we'll have to see what happens but we need to support him now i'm
[03:52:58.760 --> 03:53:05.200]  not sure if we have time for a caller but um i'm finished my little chat and uh i'd like
[03:53:05.200 --> 03:53:18.440]  to see um i'd like to see uh number three uh jay from san francisco are you on can i talk
[03:53:18.440 --> 03:53:29.040]  to jay it's jay holding hello jay go ahead yeah i was calling to uh ask you about uh
[03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:34.560]  the sES and how trump could root those elements out of the government which i think goes to
[03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:40.720]  your point about the subversive debt or the subversives that are in our government how
[03:53:40.720 --> 03:53:46.040]  can how could he do that how how is that possible i think that we need the we need to bring
[03:53:46.040 --> 03:53:51.520]  this battle right out into the open and lance the boil and then as these little bugs come
[03:53:51.520 --> 03:53:56.160]  out we need to crush them one at a time um and we need to call them traders we don't
[03:53:56.160 --> 03:54:00.440]  we we shouldn't be polite you know when the so when the soviet union collapsed there were
[03:54:00.440 --> 03:54:07.040]  no nuremberg trials it was just a a nice quiet uh you know the the bushes were just let's
[03:54:07.040 --> 03:54:12.080]  get along with gorbachev let's not talk about the bad old days we need to crush them we
[03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:17.200]  need to drag them out and have trials this is this to me is complete treason now there's
[03:54:17.200 --> 03:54:22.960]  no communist conspiracy per se so people say bracken what are you talking about conspiracy
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:28.840]  the soviet union was defeated but this is an enemy subversive ideology this is what
[03:54:28.840 --> 03:54:35.400]  why james comey called his book a higher loyalty what he means is higher than the united states
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:41.760]  higher than their constitution because his loyalty is to this global socialist new world
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:49.080]  order and nationalists like trump are retrograde throwbacks that need to be defeated by all
[03:54:49.080 --> 03:54:55.920]  means you know including uh a lying running operations against the president you know so
[03:54:55.920 --> 03:55:03.720]  i say let's have this battle let's be ruthless let's call them traders let's insist on trials
[03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:09.520]  and and crush them as to the greatest extent possible we can't just let them fly under
[03:55:09.520 --> 03:55:15.680]  the radar for another generation like the uh traders of the 1930s they were never punished
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:21.000]  except for the rozenbergs and a few others like that they need to be punished at least
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:30.760]  humiliated disgraced and thrown out of of polite of you know of um normal society anyway let's
[03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:40.600]  see um vincent and nevada you've got a question about the pope i call him pope marx go ahead
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:46.520]  well and that goes to the heart of my question i was actually hoping to talk to alex earlier
[03:55:46.520 --> 03:55:51.080]  because i think there's an important guest that maybe you or alex should have on um but
[03:55:51.080 --> 03:55:55.840]  but the reality is he's not a pope uh he's an anti pope along with many of the popes
[03:55:55.840 --> 03:56:01.560]  before him and your analogy regarding the caterpillar is critical because these people
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:06.440]  have infiltrated the catholic church they are not catholic at all this is part of something
[03:56:06.440 --> 03:56:12.760]  that was warned about by our lady fadima in october of 1917 immediately before uh linen
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:18.920]  came aboard and the idea that i have for a guest which i don't know if you or alex would
[03:56:18.920 --> 03:56:25.160]  be willing to have are two benedictine monks and what's interesting about these benedictine
[03:56:25.160 --> 03:56:30.400]  monks is they operate a website called most holy family monastery dot com but the order
[03:56:30.400 --> 03:56:35.680]  of st benedict according to catholic prophecy states that his order will exist until the
[03:56:35.680 --> 03:56:40.880]  end of the world and it'll play a very critical role in the final battle what's interesting
[03:56:40.880 --> 03:56:45.800]  about these monks is that yeah we're we're running out of time if you if you um can find
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:52.800]  me on twitter uh matt bracken 48 on twitter and uh i'll look in notifications or uh if
[03:56:52.800 --> 03:56:57.640]  you dig around for my public email you might find it but listen it's interesting the last
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:02.720]  pope didn't die he wasn't didn't have dementia he was thrown out in a in a vatican palace
[03:57:02.720 --> 03:57:11.320]  coup by leftist socialist cardinals so yeah this this was this marxist this marxist up-swelling
[03:57:11.320 --> 03:57:17.680]  is in all of our institutions even the catholic church thank thanks they're all vincent i
[03:57:17.680 --> 03:57:23.160]  think we're going to a break now and that's the top of the hour so i'm not sure uh what
[03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:47.080]  the next plan is
[03:57:47.080 --> 03:57:51.920]  years ago info wars life created the powerful michael's the x formula to help you combat
