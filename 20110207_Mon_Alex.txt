[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:32.760]  thank you so much for joining us today wherever you may be listening around the
[00:32.760 --> 00:40.320]  world and however you may be listening whether it's AM and FM's XM shortwave the
[00:40.320 --> 00:44.440]  internet at info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv and of course all the
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.640]  viewers at prisonplanet.tv we're obviously gonna be live here for the next three
[00:49.640 --> 00:56.880]  hours and we're gonna have open phones as well I have quite a few vital stacks
[00:56.880 --> 01:04.760]  of news and information obviously here that we're going to be going over today
[01:04.760 --> 01:09.400]  dealing with so many huge issues but there are some interesting articles out
[01:09.400 --> 01:15.200]  of Europe and also out of the times of India Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss
[01:15.200 --> 01:20.040]  visit and it's interesting we've been trying to get Ray McGovern on the last
[01:20.040 --> 01:25.680]  week former CIA top analyst advisor to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker
[01:25.680 --> 01:30.840]  Bush to talk about the Egypt situation and we got ahold of him today to get him
[01:30.840 --> 01:34.600]  on and he said well I don't really want to get into that too much people know
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.240]  what's happening there but I'll talk about it he said I want to talk about the
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.480]  Bush arrest news that just came out and it's funny because that's one of the
[01:42.480 --> 01:47.080]  reasons this morning that we redoubled our efforts to get him on so perfect
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.160]  timing to have Ray McGovern on with us in the third hour today or coming up two
[01:53.160 --> 02:01.000]  hours from now bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit and it's funny because
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.640]  that's exactly what we were talking about last night at dinner after the radio
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.960]  show ended a couple times a year I like to treat especially the Sunday crew that
[02:09.960 --> 02:15.200]  works six days a week to dinner and I asked where they wanted to go eat and
[02:15.200 --> 02:20.120]  they said how about a downtown steakhouse and it was a downtown steakhouse
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.240]  eight years ago that I got to see the Bush twins drunk but that wasn't as
[02:25.240 --> 02:31.200]  interesting as what happened last night who we saw last night at a steakhouse we
[02:31.200 --> 02:33.760]  were gonna go to one steakhouse but it's out of business now in this great
[02:33.760 --> 02:37.920]  economy so many of the businesses are shut down so we went to another
[02:37.920 --> 02:44.000]  steakhouse and they set us right down next to Carl Rove he was just this far
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.440]  away from me and I'll tell you how it ended coming up in the next segment but
[02:52.440 --> 02:55.920]  that was undoubtedly very very interesting it's pretty dark in the
[02:55.920 --> 03:02.880]  steakhouse we did have one iPhone that shots some hard video my iPhone video
[03:02.880 --> 03:08.440]  the lens is basically broken it's fogged permanently because I got it partially
[03:08.440 --> 03:12.080]  wet a few months ago I've just got to get a new one I should never go anywhere
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.840]  without a camera but I'll tell you what ended up happening with the whole Carl
[03:17.840 --> 03:23.040]  Rove situation obviously we'll continue to discuss the fact that on Friday
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.080]  evening not only the George Soros media matters but the White House itself
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.240]  responded to our prisonplanet.com article from Thursday about Obama policies
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.460]  dealing with energy triggering the rolling blackouts nationwide and the
[03:38.460 --> 03:43.800]  White House did respond to that so we know we're on the White House enemies
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.760]  list that's been reported on by mainstream news but this is a new level in
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.960]  them countering us so certainly we need your prayers all of you out there also
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.600]  Obama has been in the last 30 minutes been giving a press conference or really
[03:59.600 --> 04:04.440]  a speech press conference Obama calls for bipartisan effort to fight for US
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.560]  jobs all he tries to shut down our power plants and put the carbon taxes on us
[04:08.560 --> 04:13.120]  see we think of it as a president fighting for us the globalists that run
[04:13.120 --> 04:17.080]  our country like using our military to dominate the planet that's as far as
[04:17.080 --> 04:21.920]  their love of America goes the rest is nothing but hatred and the stated goal
[04:21.920 --> 04:28.200]  on record is the deindustrialization of this country so I thought I would go
[04:28.200 --> 04:32.480]  over some of that I mentioned this yesterday but I will play it today I
[04:32.480 --> 04:38.240]  interview on CNN Bill Gates vaccine autism link an absolute lie and he gave
[04:38.240 --> 04:44.200]  no proof also we're gonna be getting in to the latest situation and
[04:44.200 --> 04:51.760]  developments that are unfolding in the Middle East and North Africa in Egypt
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.440]  and we're gonna get it into the Huffington Post being bought by AOL
[04:55.440 --> 05:02.200]  we'll be right back stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[05:02.200 --> 05:06.080]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[05:06.080 --> 05:09.760]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.760]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.160]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.600]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.600 --> 05:27.360]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.160]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.160 --> 05:34.760]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.120 --> 05:42.280]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.280 --> 05:45.960]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:45.960 --> 05:51.480]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[05:51.480 --> 05:56.280]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[05:56.280 --> 06:04.360]  1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[06:04.360 --> 06:09.120]  alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off
[06:09.120 --> 06:13.160]  this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:13.160 --> 06:18.280]  turning members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[06:18.280 --> 06:23.080]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.440]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:27.440 --> 06:32.720]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:32.720 --> 06:37.000]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.520]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[06:40.520 --> 06:45.760]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.760]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at
[06:51.760 --> 06:57.280]  infowars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[06:57.280 --> 07:04.360]  planet TV hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver
[07:04.360 --> 07:08.600]  Lungs Generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and
[07:08.600 --> 07:12.920]  deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[07:12.920 --> 07:16.760]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for
[07:16.760 --> 07:21.120]  airborne pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[07:21.120 --> 07:25.280]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[07:25.280 --> 07:30.600]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[07:30.600 --> 07:34.800]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[07:34.800 --> 07:39.440]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator
[07:39.440 --> 07:43.600]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making
[07:43.600 --> 07:49.920]  production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[07:49.920 --> 07:57.600]  about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:57.600 --> 08:08.760]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.680 --> 08:21.480]  it is Monday the seventh day of February 2011 Ray McGovern former top CA
[08:21.480 --> 08:26.120]  analyst to Barturber Walker Bush and Ronald Reagan who of course famously
[08:26.120 --> 08:34.280]  confronted at a press conference Donald Rumsfeld about his lies about WMD's he's
[08:34.280 --> 08:41.560]  going to be joining us to deal with bush fears arrest scrap swiss visit former US
[08:41.560 --> 08:45.080]  president George W. Bush has reportedly canceled a visit to Switzerland
[08:45.080 --> 08:49.160]  amid concerns that it could be arrested for allegedly authorizing the torture of
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.080]  prisoners there's no allegedly we have the White House memos ordering it and
[08:54.080 --> 08:57.960]  saying that bush had ordered it from then Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez and
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.880]  John you White House counsel and of course Cheney doesn't travel to many
[09:03.880 --> 09:07.680]  European countries like Spain because there have been indictments there as
[09:07.680 --> 09:14.800]  well and bush has openly in the last six months written a book about it and
[09:14.800 --> 09:20.720]  given two different speeches where he bragged about ordering torture and our
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.120]  media has tried to sell us the torture is cool and sexy and a great thing when
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.040]  we do it but not when others do it I mean this is truly the American people
[09:30.040 --> 09:34.280]  being sold on evil and so if the government can order things that are
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.640]  illegal then the sky is the limit why not ship in drugs well they do that why
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.800]  not run giant child kidnapping rings worldwide well they do that why not
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.680]  steal veterans death benefits which they now admit they're doing why not go
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.440]  ahead and steal your pension funds why not go ahead and add things like
[09:52.440 --> 09:56.920]  uranium to the tap water which Texas newspapers have been reporting on the
[09:56.920 --> 10:01.440]  last two months why not why not have the troops use depleted uranium that they
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.600]  know is going to basically soft kill the troops why not if it isn't illegal when
[10:06.600 --> 10:12.400]  the president does it remember what Nixon said he said well it's not illegal
[10:12.400 --> 10:16.640]  when the president breaks the law and that's what they argued under bush for
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.680]  those eight years and now the media has hailed Obama for continuing to do the
[10:21.680 --> 10:25.120]  same thing and say he's above the law and do things that are illegal and
[10:25.120 --> 10:29.840]  unconstitutional and Cheney has recently praised Obama saying and now he sees
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.560]  that what we did was right continuing the torture the secret arrest all of it
[10:35.560 --> 10:41.000]  the drone attacks targeting quote unknown terrorist is well that guy's got a
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.840]  gun in Pakistan or Afghanistan go ahead and blow up that whole group of people
[10:44.840 --> 10:49.480]  there this is incredible so we'll talk about that coming up with Ramah
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.920]  govern in the third hour today we'll also pick his brain dealing with the
[10:53.920 --> 11:04.240]  whole situation in the Middle East and North Africa obviously I'll cover Egypt
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.960]  before we have him on we'll get into the latest economic developments and
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.640]  police state developments forget Super Bowl pat downs big sis wants
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.320]  interrogations and behavior test and their training private security guards
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.920]  the police you name it how to be basically secret police new report from
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.800]  Paul Joseph Watson some good news on the police state front two of five FCC
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.640]  commissioners FCC doesn't have legal authority to regulate the internet the
[11:31.640 --> 11:35.600]  problem is the FCC is still declaring that they are taking over the internet
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.520]  and have the power to control it so we're going to be breaking that down
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.160]  obviously if you didn't join us yesterday you don't know about it but
[11:44.160 --> 11:51.080]  obviously if you did join us you know about it Fox News drudge report Rush
[11:51.080 --> 11:56.320]  Limbaugh media matters and a whole bunch of other publications on the control
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.040]  left and right I wouldn't say drudges on the control left or right but
[12:00.040 --> 12:06.040]  certainly Fox News is but media matters and others on Friday came out and
[12:06.040 --> 12:12.000]  attacked us for our Thursday report dealing with Obama's blocking of new
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.880]  power plants triggers nationwide blackouts the White House responded
[12:15.880 --> 12:19.920]  Friday afternoon with a press release by Dan Pfeiffer White House
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.560]  communications director and I went through that yesterday but I'll be
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.520]  recapping the latest developments on that front we have our counter story to
[12:27.520 --> 12:33.080]  it White House attacks prison planet comm report on blackouts also the
[12:33.080 --> 12:37.800]  heritage foundation concurred with our analysis and did point out that drudges
[12:37.800 --> 12:43.680]  top storyline for the morning featured the connection to Obama's policies and
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.640]  blackouts again linking through what we were covering there we're going to be
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.160]  going over all of that in the so-called global warming Al Gore course last week
[12:53.160 --> 12:57.600]  and then again today is saying in press releases that this is global warming
[12:57.600 --> 13:01.520]  causing these extremely cold temperatures across the United States
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.760]  Mexico 35 zoo animals are frozen death in northern Mexico because they're just
[13:06.760 --> 13:13.680]  not prepared for it also northern Mexico cold snap paralyzes war as so those
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.640]  are just some of the reports that we have on that front also later in the
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.240]  next hour I get so many emails I get so many calls I've had people in the
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.200]  office last week asking me about it dealing with pole shift and yes the
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.600]  poles of the planet have moved and are always moving a little bit but now
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.720]  they're moving a lot more than they've been recorded in the last 80 years or
[13:41.720 --> 13:48.280]  so since the 1920s when the establishment the scientific establishment
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.240]  around 1910 1920s see the studies begin following the polls they really only
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.040]  got about 50 years or so of accurate readings but in the last 50 years these
[13:58.040 --> 14:01.840]  are the biggest movements ever recorded so I've done a lot of research on it but
[14:01.840 --> 14:07.120]  I dove back into it last night and this morning and we have an article up at
[14:07.120 --> 14:12.440]  prisonplanet.com link through to the Salem-news.com magnetic polar
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.240]  shifts causing massive global super storms and there is some evidence to
[14:17.240 --> 14:23.080]  that that it's confirmed it shifted quite a bit compared to previous readings
[14:23.080 --> 14:27.680]  but it's not like a complete flip we're suddenly the pole is in you know South
[14:27.680 --> 14:38.360]  Africa and Brazil you know where we're suddenly you know the whole planet
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.520]  moves around or the magnetic field moves around because the moving of the
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.480]  magnetic field can also change the planets overall orientation of the sun
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.000]  and yes that would be a cataclysm and scientists do believe that sometimes the
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.480]  earth has massive pole shifts but no doubt it's moving right now and every
[14:55.480 --> 15:02.400]  year in the last 12 years or so I wouldn't hear about this my first four
[15:02.400 --> 15:07.160]  five years on there but the last 10-12 years I constantly hear next week
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.440]  pole shift next month and people set dates and never give any proof and it
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.440]  creates all this hysteria and people say why aren't you covering it why aren't
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.280]  you going over and why aren't you discussing it well I'll spend 10
[15:19.280 --> 15:23.800]  minutes or so next hour getting into pole shift and you're welcome to call in
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.800]  and talk about pole shift or even more importantly big changes that are always
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.000]  going on in the Sun and its magnetic field bathing the earth in solar
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.920]  radiation the main driver obviously of the climate of the planet even though
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.440]  the UN says the Sun has no effect on the climate or weather if you believe that I
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.440]  got a bridge I'm happy to sell you on the moon magnetic polar shifts causing
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.200]  massive global super storms and here's Fox News magnetic north pole shifts
[15:53.200 --> 15:58.720]  forces runway closures at Florida Airport continuing we'll go over the
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.400]  overall cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis and what people are saying
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.840]  here's another one scientists gives human extinction warning here's another
[16:07.840 --> 16:14.720]  one why is BGS reestablishing a magnetic observatory on South Georgia that's out
[16:14.720 --> 16:20.920]  of the British Geological Survey also a report here from NASA magnetic portals
[16:20.920 --> 16:26.520]  connect Earth to the Sun satellites by changes to Earth's magnetic field
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.800]  scientific American this is just some of what we're going to be covering and I
[16:30.800 --> 16:35.600]  think the bottom line here is we don't know what's happening change is the only
[16:35.600 --> 16:41.800]  constant in this universe and hence on terra firma our little blue-green jewel
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.220]  orbiting the Sun two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm of the Milky Way
[16:46.220 --> 16:51.160]  galaxy and I wonder if we could pay Al Gore or the UN of the Rothschilds a tax
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.980]  and they'll wave a magic wand and stop any pole shifts from happening or
[16:56.980 --> 17:02.480]  asteroids from meeting us or the Sun shooting out a massive coronal ejection
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.520]  directly at the earth and blowing out all of our communications and we know
[17:07.520 --> 17:12.600]  these events happen we know that cataclysmic asteroid impacts happen
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.880]  routinely they estimate now not every million years or so but perhaps every
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.640]  10,000 years and that's why many other previous human civilizations going back
[17:22.640 --> 17:27.480]  over 6,000 years just disappear I don't know do we have the technology to put
[17:27.480 --> 17:30.960]  weapons systems in space stop it probably but the establishment will then
[17:30.960 --> 17:34.840]  just use those and wheel those guns around those missiles around on the
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.200]  earth and the globalists have been caught admitting they want to use an
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.680]  anti asteroid weapon system as a cover for further weaponizing space so these
[17:44.680 --> 17:48.360]  are all issues we deal with but that's just part of life driving on the highway
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.360]  is dangerous swimming in a swimming pool or a lake is dangerous walking around
[17:52.360 --> 17:56.360]  you know in the woods is dangerous you could you know get attacked by a bear
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.560]  or a wolf or a rattlesnake anytime the government sells you that you should not
[18:01.560 --> 18:05.000]  be ever be in any danger and that they're gonna protect you a under law
[18:05.000 --> 18:07.800]  they don't have to protect you be historically they don't want to protect
[18:07.800 --> 18:11.120]  you they want to feed off of you and it's like that woman I covered two weeks
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.080]  ago here in Austin getting a $48,000 settlement with us with the Travis
[18:15.080 --> 18:20.880]  County she's out with a bike riding group on rural one lane each way two lane
[18:20.880 --> 18:26.280]  road she's on the shoulder the broken shoulder and flips off the bike and
[18:26.280 --> 18:32.520]  broke her jaw and they settled with her you know the message is you fall off
[18:32.520 --> 18:38.280]  your bicycle you see the government or oh my gosh the sea levels are gonna rise
[18:38.280 --> 18:42.080]  from carbon dioxide which by the way they're not rising let's pay Al Gore
[18:42.080 --> 18:51.160]  some money it's a joke so that I'm gonna get into that coming up as well but
[18:51.160 --> 18:55.160]  the first thing I want to get to when we come back from break because I
[18:55.160 --> 19:04.080]  mentioned it earlier at the kickoff of the transmission is that George W. Bush
[19:04.080 --> 19:08.120]  it is confirmed was to be the keynote speaker former president George W. Bush
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.960]  at an event in Switzerland and is canceled due to fears that he may be
[19:12.960 --> 19:19.080]  arrested or that there's gonna be scenes there and that a local magistrate may
[19:19.080 --> 19:22.840]  try to have him arrested and then he'll have to use diplomatic power to block it
[19:22.840 --> 19:29.640]  and that will further focus people on his admitted crimes and it's funny because
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.120]  we were discussing people being arrested for torture and admittedly ordering
[19:34.120 --> 19:38.320]  torture that's illegal and other war crimes last night the reason it popped
[19:38.320 --> 19:44.560]  up in our debate was we went out to eat after the radio show and Carl Rove is in
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.600]  town and they set us down two feet from Carl Rove was right over my shoulder I
[19:49.600 --> 19:55.880]  could reach out and touching and he was gibbering and giggling like a goblin I
[19:55.880 --> 20:02.400]  mean it was literally like I was sitting next to Satan skip the long lines and

[24:17.840 --> 24:26.600]  hear from you on any issue you'd like to discuss 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 so
[24:26.600 --> 24:32.240]  two or three times a year I like to take the Sunday crew out to eat and we
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.720]  just on off chance I said hey we're not watching the Super Bowl and my wife's
[24:37.720 --> 24:40.560]  out doing stuff with the kids I said let's go eat I said where you guys want
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.680]  to eat because my sister's a vegetarian she didn't want to you know go eat
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.560]  steak so she didn't go but the rest of us went and we went try to go to one
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.040]  place but it's closed because the economy's so great and so we said well
[24:53.040 --> 24:57.200]  let's let's try this steakhouse or should we try that steakhouse and we said
[24:57.200 --> 25:06.240]  now we haven't been there let's go there so we go in and because we hadn't been
[25:06.240 --> 25:13.600]  there in a while and the place is about a third full and on one end of the
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.080]  dining area there's a table by itself with some folks at it and they walk us
[25:19.080 --> 25:24.080]  over and sit us down and then I look because I hear jibbering behind me I
[25:24.080 --> 25:30.120]  it was four of us at a table and I was seated with my back to Carl row but I
[25:30.120 --> 25:33.480]  didn't recognize you want to sat down he was right behind me sitting right here
[25:33.480 --> 25:38.160]  and I literally hear like demonic jibbering like if I tried to do an
[25:38.160 --> 25:46.240]  evil laugh and if I was thinking I could have at least recorded it with my iPhone
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.280]  even though my camera is somewhat broken on it like I said I got it wet so it's
[25:51.280 --> 25:57.240]  all fogged up but it shoots audio and I was asking the other guys and one of
[25:57.240 --> 26:00.400]  them had a smart phone we were trying to shoot some video but it was so dark in
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.400]  there but I should have recorded the jibbering in fact we we haven't downloaded
[26:04.400 --> 26:07.920]  it yet we may have some of it on audio which we heard on bigger speakers but
[26:07.920 --> 26:12.200]  it was the jibbering and and all of them demonically laughing there were five
[26:12.200 --> 26:17.520]  people at his table and he obviously one of them was his wife it was a gray haired
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.680]  woman he kept you know rubbing on her back and talking to her but but just the
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.440]  jibbering went on and on it took him about ten minutes to even come over and
[26:25.440 --> 26:32.720]  get our drink orders they were so busy serving them and the jibbering just went
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.560]  on and on and on and Aaron Dykes was there he was up here working on a story
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.120]  so he went with us and Aaron if you remember I don't know eight nine months
[26:40.120 --> 26:45.440]  ago and the case is still pending Aaron got arrested for asking Carl Rova
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.120]  question at a at a UT speech during the question and answer Aaron got up and
[26:51.120 --> 26:54.760]  asking questions about torture and war crimes and how can they say that they're
[26:54.760 --> 26:58.480]  above the law and that Bush was above the law and there's video of that of
[26:58.480 --> 27:01.840]  course online at the Alex Jones channel on YouTube hundreds of thousands of
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.600]  views and they they took him they arrested him he didn't resist and they now
[27:08.600 --> 27:12.840]  are saying they could still press charges but they haven't yet and but but
[27:12.840 --> 27:16.240]  Aaron's lawyer has told him that it's still pending so they've kind of got
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.920]  that sort of Damocles and Aaron's like I want to confront him and I said okay
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.080]  let's let's get our food because it looks like they haven't got theirs yet and
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.000]  let's go ahead and eat since we're here and then we can confront them we start
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.280]  having to discussions about what are we gonna say to him and I go Aaron you
[27:33.280 --> 27:36.320]  don't want to get arrested again they'll claim you're stalking him you've
[27:36.320 --> 27:39.920]  already been arrested for asking a question and I said so you know maybe
[27:39.920 --> 27:44.280]  I have to be the one that talks to him and then I talked to the one fellow that
[27:44.280 --> 27:48.600]  was there with us that had a phone that had a camera on it and I said okay get
[27:48.600 --> 27:53.680]  ready we're gonna do it and then the gibbering continued I mean it was
[27:53.680 --> 28:00.720]  demonic and and so we were there about 25 minutes and it just continued it
[28:00.720 --> 28:04.480]  continued on and on and we're like I can't handle this anymore we've got to
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.160]  confront him now because I was wondering how a group of people could sound more
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.840]  like goblins I mean if you image Lord of the Rings and a group of goblins
[28:12.840 --> 28:17.440]  around the fire eating you know hobbits or something it's what it sounded like
[28:17.440 --> 28:23.660]  just and then they whisper each other's ears because I guess it was
[28:23.660 --> 28:26.840]  all secret what they were talking about and then the gibbering would continue
[28:26.840 --> 28:29.640]  and it was pretty high-powered looking people he was with I would guess they
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.040]  were in oil I know what Texas oil looks like they were all mmm couple guys big
[28:34.040 --> 28:40.200]  old giant old country boys are and then I went up into the bathroom and I came
[28:40.200 --> 28:43.760]  back and saw they were looking at me and I was just like oh man and then the
[28:43.760 --> 28:50.080]  gibbering and the giggling continued on and on and on unabated and I just said
[28:50.080 --> 28:54.320]  you know what let's do something classy let's wait till they come back over here
[28:54.320 --> 28:57.160]  to the table and let's just get up and say we're not gonna eat here with this
[28:57.160 --> 29:02.920]  war criminal and so once the staff came over you and we said we're leaving
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.040]  knowing that the manager wouldn't come over then we got up and said yeah we're
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.680]  leaving cuz he's here we're not gonna eat with him and I said not too loud but
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.400]  you know enough for them to hear it I just said look I'm not going to and they
[29:15.400 --> 29:19.480]  had drinks in their hands and the food I said we're not gonna basically eat in
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.960]  the same restaurant and sit right next to Hitler and we left and we basically
[29:25.960 --> 29:32.400]  shunned Carl Rove and made a little of a scene but I probably should have said
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.640]  more to him or done something it's just that it was almost like I didn't even
[29:36.640 --> 29:40.320]  want to address him you know I've addressed Janet Reno and George W. Bush
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.320]  and others and he's so evil he might have claimed that we tried to assault him
[29:44.320 --> 29:47.400]  or something as well he's well known for that so we just got out of there and
[29:47.400 --> 29:55.440]  ate somewhere else we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[32:55.640 --> 33:10.160]  1-877-327-0365 devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's
[33:10.160 --> 33:16.960]  propaganda machine tirelessly waging war on corruption from deep in the heart of
[33:16.960 --> 33:23.720]  FEMA region six in Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:23.720 --> 33:30.440]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[33:38.640 --> 33:45.320]  alright finishing up with the Carl Rowe situation how it connects to Bush
[33:45.320 --> 33:52.840]  fears arrest scrap Swiss visit and that ties into Cheney calls Mubarak a good
[33:52.840 --> 34:00.240]  friend a u.s. ally CNN reports in a speech he gave Saturday just to show how
[34:00.240 --> 34:03.840]  lawless these people are and if they can get away with this they can get away
[34:03.840 --> 34:10.000]  with anything supporting murdering terrorist dictators like housing Mubarak
[34:10.000 --> 34:19.280]  but continuing I tried to get Phil in here to tell the story of it but he
[34:19.280 --> 34:22.960]  didn't want to go on air Aaron was up here working late last night via his
[34:22.960 --> 34:27.400]  choice so he's obviously still asleep tomorrow or maybe when Ray McGovern's
[34:27.400 --> 34:31.160]  in here during the third hour we'll get Aaron to pop in and tell his Carl Rowe
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.880]  gibbering story because I should fill did I give an accurate representation he
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.360]  said yeah you did a good job I said well people aren't gonna believe that this
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.080]  continual gibbering and demonic giggling was going on come in and back me up but
[34:45.080 --> 34:49.840]  he said no it's true just I don't want to go on air but because I can't believe
[34:49.840 --> 34:53.840]  it I can't believe that we were there for about 25 minutes and it was almost
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.840]  unabated non-stop if you saw somebody at a bus stop let's say you were taking the
[34:59.840 --> 35:03.000]  bus you walked up to a bus stop you're waiting 20 minutes and they're giggling
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.120]  and gibbering to one of their friends like this you'd walk on down the road
[35:06.120 --> 35:11.800]  to another bus stop I mean he basically drove us out of there we were gonna
[35:11.800 --> 35:15.040]  wait and eat and then confronting with the demonic presence I'm not getting
[35:15.040 --> 35:18.040]  Aaron's like I gotta confront him now I can't sit here and listen to this anymore
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.200]  and we were just not talking just sitting there listening to Carl Rowe going
[35:22.200 --> 35:30.120]  I mean I can't even do it as evil as he was it was like the other ones were
[35:30.120 --> 35:34.280]  doing it I'm like what is this are these people ringwraiths or something or
[35:34.280 --> 35:43.240]  these people some type of demonic entities I mean it was amazing and I have
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.040]  to say I've never been around Carl Rowe in person I've confronted a lot of
[35:47.040 --> 35:52.920]  globalist at point blank range and I talked about Janet Reno had an evil
[35:52.920 --> 35:58.320]  a plum about her but he definitely put off really bad vibes and I didn't like
[35:58.320 --> 36:01.880]  being in the same building with him and it was basically that we were all
[36:01.880 --> 36:07.200]  getting fired up and we're really gonna confront him and that my gut was that
[36:07.200 --> 36:10.120]  wasn't a smart move especially with Aaron already with charges against him
[36:10.120 --> 36:15.160]  for asking Lord Rowe of a question in public last year so we got out of there
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.280]  and I now I will regret for the rest of my life that I didn't scream war
[36:21.280 --> 36:26.000]  criminal at him or go over and shake his hand kind of like I did with Gargan and
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.800]  then slickly asking him a question but I think it was also because we didn't have
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.240]  any good cameras we were shooting some video of him trying to look at it and
[36:34.240 --> 36:43.600]  it was just all I mean of those steak houses you hardly see in them but I can
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.160]  make excuses I think I should have confronted him I know Phil and Aaron
[36:48.160 --> 36:51.960]  everybody thought that what we did was classy to get up and say you know I'm
[36:51.960 --> 36:55.720]  not gonna eat here with basically somebody who's like Adolf Hitler this is
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.040]  like eating dinner next to Hitler we're leaving that guy well I did say that
[37:00.040 --> 37:10.400]  guy's a war criminal but so I guess we did I did do a little bit but you know
[37:10.400 --> 37:18.160]  once I get going folks it would have been potentially explosive situation and
[37:18.160 --> 37:26.680]  I'm basically reflecting on it right now here on air now I should have gone over
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.800]  and then left but then I'd have been thrown out that would have been some
[37:30.800 --> 37:34.960]  kind of victory for him I don't know I can ask listeners what you think I
[37:34.960 --> 37:37.440]  should have done but you know what I'm not perfect I don't have all the answers
[37:37.440 --> 37:43.160]  but now perhaps I should just next time he's in Austin for a book signing I know
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.960]  he lives here part of the time he lives in Alabama DC in Austin reportedly has a
[37:47.960 --> 37:55.360]  place in Tarrytown but I'm gonna make it a mission now to at least go to a book
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.000]  signing that way it's more of a quote public event the guy hadn't eaten dinner
[37:59.000 --> 38:06.120]  I also have an issue about people's privacy one time we were at the wave of
[38:06.120 --> 38:14.800]  Leon Mexican food restaurant off of what is it on Fifth Street and I was with the
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.320]  crew that was about four years ago one of the last times I was still doing the
[38:19.320 --> 38:26.520]  local access show and we went in and sat down ordered our food and there was a
[38:26.520 --> 38:31.280]  big table again right next to us but with family and in kids and a bunch of
[38:31.280 --> 38:38.880]  politicos I knew I recognized some of them and all the sudden Mike Hanson was
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.480]  there and he's sitting here looking at the door to the larger dining room we
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.400]  were in the back dining room he said there's Rick Perry the governor and I
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.880]  looked up and ten feet away there's Rick Perry looking right at me at the door
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.440]  and he goes and you gave me a look of concern and then turned and walked out
[38:56.440 --> 39:02.680]  and I said okay guys we're gonna see what happens then a few minutes later a
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.880]  couple of plain clothes guys in suits obviously probably state police
[39:06.880 --> 39:11.120]  security probably Texas Ranger detail you know guys with bulges come in and go
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.720]  sit out at another table you know he went out and got I guess security out of
[39:14.720 --> 39:20.160]  the parking lot that was waiting had them come in and then he came in and went
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.160]  and sat down started eating and then he got back up and he walked over and put
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.200]  his hands on the back of the chair of Raymond one of Mike's friends that was
[39:30.200 --> 39:36.040]  there is it Raymond that was there the point is Mike Hanson a few people put
[39:36.040 --> 39:39.800]  his hands on the back of the seat and looked me right in the eyes and he said
[39:39.800 --> 39:44.920]  I want you to have a great Thanksgiving his Thanksgiving was coming up in a few
[39:44.920 --> 39:49.880]  days I want you to have a great Thanksgiving and I was just well you
[39:49.880 --> 39:53.840]  know Rick Perry's popped in on the show before many years ago as well but I don't
[39:53.840 --> 39:57.600]  know why I'm now digressing off into these stories but I didn't confront him
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.200]  there either I think it has something to do with their families being there I
[40:01.200 --> 40:05.440]  almost did it with Roe right now live on there I'm trying to go back to my mind
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.680]  and why I didn't really fully confronting and I think if they would
[40:10.680 --> 40:13.400]  have had children with them I definitely wouldn't have done it because it's a
[40:13.400 --> 40:17.240]  private place they think they're having dinner even if he is a war criminal but I
[40:17.240 --> 40:23.760]  almost did it but they were with their wives and I just I think the cherry on
[40:23.760 --> 40:27.720]  top the straw that broke the camel's back was that Aaron I said Aaron what's
[40:27.720 --> 40:32.480]  going on with that Carl Roe thing has that been decided is that over and he
[40:32.480 --> 40:39.320]  said no they arrested me and basically put charges on him arresting for
[40:39.320 --> 40:45.600]  disorderly conduct and resisting but then never went through with it Aaron
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.240]  doesn't know the exact legalese so I'm not sure but I said I said that was
[40:49.240 --> 40:52.960]  almost a year ago and then he said I know they say it's another year until
[40:52.960 --> 40:56.240]  they could possibly charge me like I hate even talking about it now it'll
[40:56.240 --> 41:02.000]  remind him to charge him the UT police through the city of Austin but that was
[41:02.000 --> 41:08.400]  the main reason is that I didn't want to get Aaron in more trouble because I know
[41:08.400 --> 41:18.520]  Aaron he was going to start screaming at him but I resent the fact resents not
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.520]  even the word I lament I regret that I didn't do more but at least I did
[41:23.520 --> 41:31.360]  something hmm all right now I've wasted a lot of time on this and I apologize for
[41:31.360 --> 41:37.040]  that as well okay let's get into the Egypt news and of course this does tie
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.800]  into the whole call row of criminal situation if they can sell us the Jack
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.880]  Bowers torturing people and it's cool and then the Pentagon admits that they're
[41:44.880 --> 41:48.080]  torturing people's children in front of them to get answers it doesn't get any
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.560]  more dungeon keeper Jeffrey Dahmer than that the Army's own to goomba report
[41:53.560 --> 42:01.920]  general to goomba put the report out on that you can just type in general to
[42:01.920 --> 42:08.000]  goomba report on Abu Ghraib torture one of it's got to be in the hundreds most
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.880]  of them are sacred but it's well over a hundred that have identified torture
[42:10.880 --> 42:17.360]  sites all over the world it's admitted that camp x-ray has a CIA run base
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.880]  within it in Guantanamo Bay that's a laboratory for mind control and torture
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.880]  and I can't even say on air because children may be listening what the
[42:29.880 --> 42:34.480]  government admits they do there to these people but they're basically
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.080]  manufacturing folks that will plead guilty to create the illusion of terrorism
[42:38.080 --> 42:43.040]  they're also recruiting people that they then put out as patsy operatives to go
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.680]  out and recruit other people to stage terror attacks we know that's been
[42:45.680 --> 42:52.360]  happening it's a very very serious very very serious situation but continuing
[42:52.360 --> 43:01.560]  here Cheney calls Mubarak a good friend US ally and the government admits that
[43:01.560 --> 43:06.920]  the biggest concentration of black sites ghost sites torture dungeons they've
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.000]  got them all over Eastern Western Europe they've got them in the US they've got
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.920]  them in North Africa is Egypt and that Mubarak tortures people for even
[43:17.920 --> 43:22.320]  criticizing the government including killing them and so of course Dick
[43:22.320 --> 43:25.360]  Cheney has come out former vice president Dick Cheney said Egyptian
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.200]  president Hossie Mubarak is a good friend in the US ally but declined to
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.880]  predict whether the embattled leader what he protestors calls to step down I
[43:33.880 --> 43:37.360]  think now he's gonna go it's it's pretty clear the question is how long he's
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.340]  trying to say September but it could be a matter of weeks Cheney made the
[43:42.340 --> 43:45.960]  comments Saturday night at a ceremony honoring former president Ronald Reagan
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.800]  and Santa Barbara, California protestors have pledged to stay on the streets of
[43:50.800 --> 43:55.320]  Egyptian cities until who's Mubarak relinquishes power Mubarak who has led
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.600]  the North African nation for three decades has said that he will stay in
[43:58.600 --> 44:02.520]  power until September and will not run for reelection Cheney said the Egyptian
[44:02.520 --> 44:08.040]  leader should be treated with respect he has been a good man a good friend and
[44:08.040 --> 44:10.840]  ally the United States you mean the globalist Cheney said we need to
[44:10.840 --> 44:17.120]  remember that so there's that report right there continuing in a major
[44:17.120 --> 44:21.800]  escalation that we did predict a few weeks ago business insider reports
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.920]  senior US Marines says multiple platoons are headed to Egypt there is a
[44:26.920 --> 44:30.360]  system within the US Marines that alerts the immediate families of high-ranking
[44:30.360 --> 44:34.040]  Marines that their Marine will soon be deployed to an emergency situation where
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.000]  they will not be able to talk to their spouses or families the alert just went
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.920]  out says one source the senior Marine told our source at the Pentagon will
[44:41.920 --> 44:46.800]  deploy multiple platoons to Egypt of the next few days and that the official
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.800]  reason will be to assist in the evacuation of US citizens one source was
[44:52.800 --> 44:56.480]  told that the chances that they were going over there were 70 yesterday to a
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.880]  hundred percent today we're keeping these people anonymous because both would
[45:02.880 --> 45:05.600]  get in trouble for sharing this information with the press on Friday
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.640]  the Pentagon announced it would move US warships and other military assets to
[45:09.640 --> 45:15.400]  make sure it is prepared in case of a US evacuation reported the LA Times see
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.160]  when I read a business insider who I found to be a good good news source I
[45:19.160 --> 45:22.920]  people ask how I judge news a I think this is a pretty good source in the
[45:22.920 --> 45:27.840]  past be when the LA Times is admitting warships are going there who is deployed
[45:27.840 --> 45:31.880]  to get people out of embassies it's the Marines so yes this is accurate and a
[45:31.880 --> 45:39.400]  major escalation on that front American warships heading to Egypt reports the
[45:39.400 --> 45:50.480]  LA Times and other major media outlets continuing Egypt is locked in a standoff
[45:50.480 --> 45:56.160]  it says anti-government protester it's a photo leech chance against President
[45:56.160 --> 46:00.640]  Hassan Mubarak in front of soldiers guarding Egyptian Museum in the main
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.480]  square in Cairo Egypt thousands of demonstrators continue to occupy the
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.120]  square demanding Mubarak's immediate resignation political standoff is
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.040]  intensifying here's one out of the French news agency AFP saboteurs attack
[46:14.040 --> 46:19.640]  Egypt gas pipeline to Jordan Israel's also worry about restrictions in gas and
[46:19.640 --> 46:27.280]  oil and also the besieged town of Suez where they've had two weeks of rioting
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.880]  unknown saboteurs attacked an Egyptian pipeline supplying gas to Jordan
[46:31.880 --> 46:36.320]  forcing authorities to switch off gas supply from a twin pipeline to Israel an
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.280]  official told AFP the attackers use explosives against the pipeline in the
[46:40.280 --> 46:49.560]  town of Laughin in northern Sinai Sinai near the Gaza Strip the official
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.480]  said it was initially thought the pipeline to Israel was attacked the
[46:53.480 --> 46:56.880]  pipeline to Jordan has been attacked and the supply to Israel has been cut off
[46:56.880 --> 47:00.720]  the official said the army has taken precautionary measures to stop the fire
[47:00.720 --> 47:03.960]  from spreading the official added a rescue service we're putting the fire
[47:03.960 --> 47:07.320]  out is not immediately clear who was responsible or whether the attack was
[47:07.320 --> 47:11.360]  linked to the deadly protest against President Hassan Mubarak's rule which
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.480]  entered the 12th day on Saturdays we're now to day 14 we still don't have details
[47:15.480 --> 47:21.000]  of what happened and they still don't so that is just some of what's
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.360]  happening continuing here Egypt government hints it seeks to write out
[47:27.360 --> 47:36.640]  protest wave leaders of Egypt's unprecedented wave of anti-government
[47:36.640 --> 47:40.800]  protest have held talks with the prime minister over ways to ease President
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.520]  Hassan Mubarak out of office but the government appeared this weekend to be
[47:44.520 --> 47:47.640]  digging its heels in calculating that it can write out the street
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.920]  demonstrations but the rallies are intensifying so that remains to be seen
[47:52.920 --> 47:59.480]  okay next hour I will get into pole shift how big of a threat is it is it
[47:59.480 --> 48:05.040]  real yes the question is is it about to happen it is moving at a record pace
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.880]  right now the north and south poles that is confirmed but are we gonna have a
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.920]  massive pole shift if we do have one it's going to be cataclysmic you can
[48:15.920 --> 48:24.760]  better believe that you're gonna see some fireworks if that happens it appears
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.520]  from human history that there have been a lot of cataclysms in the past but
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.440]  obviously there was there isn't good record keeping especially after the
[48:32.440 --> 48:38.880]  library at Alexandria was burned but we're gonna be covering that coming up
[48:38.880 --> 48:44.200]  in the next hour I'm going to get into some of the other big economic
[48:44.200 --> 48:48.400]  developments that are taking place but right now let's take calls I'd love to
[48:48.400 --> 48:53.800]  hear from you Donovan in Florida you're on the air welcome Alex how you doing
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.240]  buddy good there's a couple things I'd like to point out I'm glad you're
[48:58.240 --> 49:01.720]  talking about pole shift today because I'm driving through Florida here where
[49:01.720 --> 49:07.320]  they recently had to recalibrate the compass headings at Tampa International
[49:07.320 --> 49:13.800]  and there might be more to follow so the poles definitely shifting you know more
[49:13.800 --> 49:19.400]  in some areas than others but I think the important thing is maybe it goes to
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.800]  show something solar related and that may tie into you know these weather
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.600]  anomalies we're having as well and what you know I'm sure if you just pay some
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.960]  carbon taxes and we shut down some power plants will all be safe but being
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.080]  serious here here's Fox News this is back from January 6th so this is a month
[49:40.080 --> 49:46.000]  ago and it says magnetic north pole shifts forces runway closures at Florida
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.280]  Airport the planet's northern magnetic pole is drifting slowly but steadily
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.000]  towards Russia and it's throwing off planes in Florida we'll cover that more
[49:53.000 --> 49:59.640]  but you're absolutely right yeah it is it does shift slowly over time but it
[49:59.640 --> 50:03.760]  has accelerated quite a bit the past I don't know how many years but it has
[50:03.760 --> 50:13.360]  started so all right well you know it's funny I remember 16 years ago 12 years
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.480]  ago you know hearing it but not really paying a lot of attention to the last
[50:18.480 --> 50:23.200]  10 or so that on 2012 there'd be a big pole shift and it is kind of creepy that
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.280]  we're seeing record movements in the poles right as we approach it I mean it
[50:28.280 --> 50:33.880]  is it is creepy and we know the globalist have been good at at at hiding
[50:33.880 --> 50:38.840]  ancient revelations in data you know that's one of their big systems of
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.640]  control is they've they've hidden a lot of real history do they know something
[50:42.640 --> 50:45.840]  we don't know I mean I hate to start giving validity to this but it's got
[50:45.840 --> 50:50.440]  to be looked at anything else Donovan well yeah look at the other planets our
[50:50.440 --> 50:55.880]  solar system they are also showing weird weather weather anomalies as we are so
[50:55.880 --> 51:01.400]  they won't stay there I want you to elaborate on that absolutely forget

[53:56.080 --> 54:13.000]  that's goberkey.com today all the major scientific institutions that measure
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.480]  it are confirming that since they've been getting accurate readings for more
[54:16.480 --> 54:21.720]  than half a century there is the greatest movement in the polls they've
[54:21.720 --> 54:27.280]  ever seen they normally just move around a very small amount now they're
[54:27.280 --> 54:32.040]  massively drifting in the last couple years and that drift is accelerating and
[54:32.040 --> 54:37.040]  causing all sorts of problems especially with the geosynchronous
[54:37.040 --> 54:43.160]  satellites that are engaged in GPS but the problem is they've only been
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.520]  measuring it accurately for half a century or so some measurements going
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.280]  back you know more than 80 years so we don't know this is part of a normal
[54:52.280 --> 54:56.520]  cycle but NASA and others are saying it's the Sun that's the main driver of
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.400]  that obviously they must not have gotten the memo from the UN that the Sun has
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.080]  no effect on the earth let's talk to Donovan again Donovan you had another
[55:04.080 --> 55:09.240]  point you were gonna make oh yeah I just wanted to point out that if the rest of
[55:09.240 --> 55:12.840]  the planets in the solar system are experiencing you know other weather
[55:12.840 --> 55:17.400]  anomalies similar you know well not similar to us I guess you could say but
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.600]  they are experiencing weather anomalies that it would be implicating something
[55:21.600 --> 55:27.520]  no they are similar the especially the moons of the gas giants for the last 20
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.760]  years or so their ice caps were melting Mars ice caps were receding now they've
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.760]  been getting bigger again because the solar system's cooling off a bit and
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.400]  because the Sun is like a light bulb you know it gets brighter sometimes and
[55:40.400 --> 55:45.400]  dimmer to you know simplify it and that's why when I had David Rothschild on
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.480]  pushing carbon taxes a he denied they want carbon taxes even though it's
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.760]  admitted and B he's I said well why are the other ice caps melting if the
[55:53.760 --> 55:57.440]  warming's only on other planets because you know that's now four years ago since
[55:57.440 --> 56:02.600]  then we know that the cooling has come back in and the warming's reversed and
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.320]  he said oh that's because Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth
[56:06.320 --> 56:14.920]  and I'm like no the order of the planets are Mercury Venus Earth Mars and then
[56:14.920 --> 56:19.160]  out from there with the gas giants all the way out of course to the tiny now
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.480]  non-planet because they've delisted it of Pluto out in the Kuiper Belt but
[56:23.480 --> 56:29.480]  finish what's your other point well I guess it goes back to their idea of
[56:29.480 --> 56:34.000]  carbon tax and you know saving the world of global warming there's a couple things
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.440]  I'd like to point out one being that let's say for just for the sake of
[56:38.440 --> 56:45.400]  conversation that their global warming is caused by COQ mission and you know
[56:45.400 --> 56:50.000]  they're gonna save us all right well if their plan of action is merely put the
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.680]  band-aid over gunshot wound you know I mean it's it's not gonna do anything we
[56:53.680 --> 56:58.640]  have to see solve fossil fuel consumption immediately but but great
[56:58.640 --> 57:03.280]  point I appreciate your call Donovan look at the Kyoto Protocol look at the
[57:03.280 --> 57:09.880]  Kyoto Protocol look at it it says that 167 of you want to be technical third
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.120]  world countries including China and India and many other greenhouse gas
[57:14.120 --> 57:18.400]  polluters that's in quotes they don't have to make any cuts so if they
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.480]  restrict our energy here and make people pay more well what's left of our
[57:23.480 --> 57:27.400]  industry will leave even faster and it doesn't cut back on emissions because
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.880]  our cleaner systems get turned off and then their dirtier systems increase
[57:31.880 --> 57:35.520]  upkeep the studies show would actually increase the amount of carbon dioxide I
[57:35.520 --> 57:39.400]  mean it's all a giant fraud from one into another it's a bunch of fair
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.440]  mongering to sell global government and a global regime deciding who can have
[57:43.440 --> 57:48.800]  energy and who can't and how much you can use its feudalism period by the way
[57:48.800 --> 57:54.600]  we are getting rid tomorrow morning we've never extended this far into

[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.880]  first get into magnetic pole shift it's starting to happen but how serious is it
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.280]  gonna be if there's a major pole shift it will be cataclysmic we'll be
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.840]  discussing that coming up at the bottom of the hour Marcia in New York you're on
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:39.200]  the year yeah hi Alex how are you I'm good welcome you listen congrats on the
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.280]  White House nose and I'm calling about a situation here on Friday night in New
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:52.920]  York subway I changed up at a platform and we saw it five cops getting a guy
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:59.360]  with sticks and he was covering his head with both both arms and screaming
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:06.240]  record this record this and I pulled out my phone and other guys started doing
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.920]  the same and as soon as the cops or at least they you know they stop using
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.840]  mistakes so what I'm trying to say is why the people really see something like
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.920]  this yeah believe they can do it start taking you know you can buy little
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.920]  portable digital cameras that shoot decent quality for about 50 bucks now and
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.080]  I need to walk the walk and I normally do carry a camera in my car and always
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.120]  carry one you know my iPhone is but it's an old iPhone because I don't like the
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.160]  new ones but I'm gonna have to go ahead and trade up and get a new one I've had
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:40.920]  this one for two over two years since they first came out and because last
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.280]  night I couldn't even really shoot good video when we ran into Carl Rove
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:51.120]  downtown I was in the DC a special on a medicine to see about Bill Clinton you
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:57.000]  know the title is the world president yes they're really positioning him to be
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.040]  a UN secretary general they've admitted that that's always been their plan in
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.000]  Obama becoming the head of the Security Council which no presidents ever done
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.400]  violates the Constitution and we cover that in fall the Republic in fact I'll
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:17.320]  give you the actual subsection code of the US Constitution I think it's
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.600]  Article 1 section 9 but I know it's on the back of the film so I can double
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.120]  check my facts America's last stand make the choice liberty or tyranny fall the
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.900]  Republic documents an offshore corporate cartel is bankrupting the US economy by
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.440]  design leaders are now declaring that world government has arrived and the
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.400]  dollar will be replaced with a new global currency president Obama has
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.080]  violated brazenly violated article one section out of the US Constitution by
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.960]  shooting himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council thus
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.560]  becoming the first US president to chair the world body and so that's just part
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.920]  of what the film covers but I'm glad yes I I did see the promo article from MSNBC
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:03.680]  Bill Clinton president of the world what do you think of that crazy of course
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.320]  they're trying to make us ready for what's coming that you know he's gonna
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.280]  be our number one guy and then after we've had a US president president of
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.920]  the world then we can have a communist Chinese president as president of the
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.040]  world and of course global rules that we're all being conditioned briefly how
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.360]  did it end with the police beating the man do you know why they were beating
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.400]  him you really heard the guy because they ran his face into the metal part of
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.540]  the platform and they got the talk of it you know but at least they stopped
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:40.200]  hitting him and that was it you know the train stopped for like seven minutes
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.240]  and then we just kept on going but at least you know in the beginning people
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.800]  were laughing and I'm like are you crazy this is not funny and it takes one
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.640]  person to say something to do something another we're like others absolutely

[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:52.040]  Egypt also he wants to respond to this key report out of the Times of India it's
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:59.320]  also in big European publications bush fears arrest scraps swiss visit he
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.640]  admittedly did order torture that is illegal it doesn't matter if he says
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:08.600]  he's above the law or Carl Rove tells him so this is illegal and now he was to
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.640]  do a big keynote address there in Geneva but has canceled it February 12th
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.560]  because he's worried about being arrested so we're gonna be talking about
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.080]  that first time a US president can't travel like Pinochet of Argentina or
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.040]  something very very serious also coming up at the bottom of the hour people keep
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.160]  wanting to hear my take on pole shift and I've done a lot of research on it
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.120]  that it is moving at a record rate since they've been recording it in the last
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.520]  half century and if it does shift massively by thousands of miles you're
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.720]  looking at serious calamity there's no doubt serious cataclysm I'm not saying
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.480]  that's coming are gonna happen but we know big asteroids and comets hit the
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.800]  planet we know there are pole shifts and it's just crazy that people predicted
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.240]  that there'd be a pole shift in 2012 and now it is moving around at red a record
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.360]  pays pretty creepy I mean do the globalists know something that the
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.560]  ancients knew that they're not telling us there are all these martial law
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.040]  preparations you've got all the world economic collapse coming along at the
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.560]  same time I don't know what's going on I mean they admittedly have magnetic
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.800]  weapons earthquake-causing weapons secretary of the army William Cohen
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:18.320]  1997 admitted so in a press release but it's classified tectonic weapons is what
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.920]  he calls them are the globalists doing this we know they're manipulating a lot
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.560]  of the weather it's just crazy I'll talk about it coming up at the bottom of the
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.560]  hour also most talk show host I think would still be talking about this but I
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.680]  covered it some yesterday I'll briefly get into it today it's a pretty big deal
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.720]  because it shows how vulnerable they are and how if real media actually covers
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.920]  the globalist activities the light of of sunshine the light of exposure will
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.880]  destroy their designs but on Friday Fox covered it Obama blocking a new power
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.560]  plans triggers nationwide blackouts and they posted the present planet dot com
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.040]  article very strange they're doing that more and more continuing but I guess our
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.400]  articles well documented so why they did the White House responded to it that
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:14.800]  evening the media matters came after us as well so we're going to be discussing
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:19.600]  that coming up later as well but right now let's go to a bunch of your calls
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.840]  here let's talk to John in Michigan John you're on the air good morning Alex and
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.360]  thank you for everything you've doing to have you ever heard of Charles Walters
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.960]  from Austin Texas their former he was with the Austin USA publication on
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:41.440]  organic gardening it rings a little bit of a bell but but no but I have a book
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.760]  here that he wrote before he passed away and it's in regards to a physician up
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.640]  here in northern Michigan a chiropractor who took the elements chart and this is
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.280]  rough for dr. Wallach to reinforce dr. Wallach's information that you're
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.320]  putting out and he went in the forward of the book and it's the title of the
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.400]  book is minerals for the genetic code and I can give you an information how to
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.760]  get a hold of it minerals for the genetic code he talks about the county in
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.880]  Texas back in the early 50s death County Texas in a town called
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:18.040]  herford and that's where they did found high levels of flooring in the water and
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:23.840]  this is where they began their their theory to put water or fluoride in the
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.920]  water in this book dr. Orry takes the element chart and links it to the
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.520]  minerals and how they are essential and the positive negative valence is so it's
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.640]  something I think really that is something people and you yourself might
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:43.640]  be interested in and getting you can I give out the website for it it's a
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:51.520]  mineral dot info the letter e mineral dot info and it's a very very the very
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.240]  first time that this has been done with the element chart Alex well we know that
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.440]  the body needs all the minerals and all the trace elements and the vitamins to
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.520]  be healthy but the system wants to make money off treating people who are
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.000]  mineral deficient that then causes diseases they want to treat the disease
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.360]  itself and try to block it instead of going to the root of it I appreciate your
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.080]  call I'll check into that let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Kentucky Chris
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.720]  you're on the air
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.720]  hello Alex hey buddy yeah I wanted to know something oh I got a question here
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.560]  about the health department I've got something about called a risk surveillance
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.520]  system do you know about that it's federally funded it says here in a
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.400]  letter yeah no they have federal federal standardization which is totally
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.400]  unconstitutional of zoning laws that's also in the climate treaty that the
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.040]  house passed a year and a half ago but the Senate hasn't passed but the EPA is
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.720]  still implementing and it's federal zoning where they force their way in your
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.200]  house where they talk about potential risk and we're basically they're gonna
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.960]  try to take many of the homes and buildings in this country and and
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.360]  artificially condemn them go ahead yeah that's what I think is like almost like
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.360]  a telltale squad because this because this is getting you know it's telling
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:11.720]  plumbers firemen telephone repair people cable people to basically spy on you
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.000]  realtors when they're in your home yeah and that's a this dude this new guy
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.160]  that's been going on for 10 years and what happened 10 years ago we had 911
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.040]  we have what about Christine Whitman I told everybody out there the air was
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.160]  safe how many people are dying from all this these people are a bunch of
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.640]  criminals out here this is you know you know there's probably some good people
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.400]  are working on this but if they if I get a hold of me you know I'm gonna go into
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.920]  it with it and just hit talk with him you want to talk with me you know I'm
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.920]  not gonna answer any questions I wouldn't respect my amendment you know my
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:42.040]  property well they're trying to basically give code enforcers and their
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.800]  minions unconstitutional powers to force their way into your home and more and
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.120]  more in apartments you know they're saying oh we're gonna do a drug sweep of
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.560]  the apartments everyone must leave at this time of day and then the police all
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.320]  come into your apartment they claim well you don't own the apartment and so you
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.960]  don't get the 4th amendment but federal and state courts have held that yes you
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.800]  do still have a 4th amendment even though you're renting so it's just
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:10.280]  absolutely incredible what they're doing I'm aware of those general developments
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:16.320]  but why don't you email us what you've got to show tips at info wars.com
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.680]  John is the acting director of the local Metro Health Department I called the
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.280]  Metro to the Tattletale Department I'm just this is getting really bad out here
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.920]  so folks get active and we could take this country back absolutely now what
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.640]  they're doing is they're fully converting the society over to a
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.000]  Tattletale society and saying it's good and we've all got a responsibility and
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.080]  the government's hovering over us with blimps and telescreens and drones and
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.440]  announcements and amber alerts that were for little kids and now we're for you
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.520]  know is your neighbor you know owning firearms and they're trying to convert us
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:55.720]  over this total system of surveillance I mean take the Super Bowl she says it's
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.240]  your responsibility to tattle on everybody it's your responsibility as
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.320]  if people don't know if they see something that's really suspicious to
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.160]  say something the message is look for things be spies don't trust each other
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.320]  terrorists are everywhere and now as they announced years ago they're now
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.800]  rolling it out that TSA or TSA trained locals will pat you down put their hands
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.120]  in your pants search your bags when you go to even a school play we're now seeing
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.120]  cases of this with a few hundred people at local junior high football games
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.520]  they'll call out the state garden places like Alabama and search little girls
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.200]  with hello kitty bags actually have a photo of that and so our children are
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.320]  being trained the public's being trained to live in this total surveillance
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.480]  society with no fourth amendment peter in washington you're on the air
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:52.880]  hello Alex I would like can you hear me yes yeah I want to talk about it
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:59.880]  not the real crisis but the fake crisis of global warming and not about its
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:05.800]  evidence but about the concept itself now you pointed out many times that they
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:11.320]  want to interdict against co2 which is very natural plants use it so but this
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.840]  contradicts the greenest greenness because greenness is based upon plants
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.800]  which couldn't exist without co2 and we know the earth has the lowest ever
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.280]  recorded from the soil samples and ice samples of carbon dioxide we're in a
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.600]  carbon-starved environment thank god humans started putting it out
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.480]  unfortunately we don't put out anything near volcanoes and because the earth is
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.400]  having less and less volcanic activity then you know what it had millions of
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.920]  years ago so obviously we have a lower carbon level because the earth is
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.280]  cooling right what I want to concentrate is the is it contradicts
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:54.680]  their very supposed goal of greenness now Lindsay Williams as you know pointed
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:18:01.080]  out that these elitists have to tell you and I found that true not only with
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:06.080]  elitists but with others that they have to tell you who they are and they have
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.640]  to give a warning I think the very concept itself because it is so fraudulent
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:18.200]  it contains that kind of a warning that means there are two kinds of people that
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.480]  fall for it one group are those that just say well scientists are always right
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:27.520]  you know they're the new priesthood and all that but there are other people that
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.840]  like it they're bad and they're on the other side I that's all really I have
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:38.040]  to say well yeah no I've talked to a lot of mid-level media people and
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.120]  environmentalist and they go okay global warming's a fraud it's not caused by man
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:47.400]  but isn't fossil fuels dirty shouldn't we use this as an excuse to push an
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.480]  environmentalist revolution nothing that's done from a point of deception is
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.320]  going to bear good fruit and what they're trying to do through their
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.440]  environmental revolution is not actually clean up the environment they're
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:02.320]  allowing the cross species genetic engineering the toxic waste dumping the
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.120]  dangerous weapon test it's all just a brazen power grab and they admit that's
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:11.440]  what it is and you've got all these low-level people who get off on feeling
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.480]  like they've signed on to the power structure you know even though they know
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.480]  it's a fraud they think that by agreeing with it now it doesn't threaten them and
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.920]  they're part of the winning team when when they're not getting the spoils from
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:29.600]  this even if they're a reprobate social climbing sociopaths the sociopaths fool
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:33.280]  themselves that it's somehow helping them when it isn't but more and more I
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.280]  realize that what we're facing is one-dimensional thinking so many people
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.560]  have one-dimensional thinking and I'll explain what that is briefly when we
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.080]  come back continue with your calls and then get into the poll shift news but
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.640]  but I'll give you some examples of one-dimensional thinking when we come
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:56.880]  back on the other side of this quick break stay with us
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:04.640]  never buy home canning jar lids again no kidding when you buy

[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.000]  it means all the world under their control the United Nations would take
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.680]  over America the trilateral Commission would control the world invisible
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.760]  empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:35.080]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe first of all
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.560]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global

[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:20.640]  one-dimensional thinking I want to do some whole shows on this or special
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.000]  videos on this subject because it's so complex but at the same time so simple
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.080]  and it's a fundamental issue of symbols and there's been a lot of
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:38.560]  sociologists political scientists before them philosophers psychologists that
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.720]  have written about this and Madison Avenue and the propaganda masters they
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.280]  call it perception is reality perception isn't really reality if you're on a
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.840]  bunch of lsd having a full bore hallucination and believe you're jumping
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:01.240]  off into a creek but you really jump off a 50-story building perception is not
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:06.320]  reality or if you think you're a bird and you're gonna fly off a 20-story
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.200]  balcony well you're really gonna crash and die on the bottom perception is not
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.440]  reality take a dollar bill in fact will somebody give me my wallet over there I
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.760]  think it's got some money in and I can't reach over and get it I dot thank
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:30.360]  you a dollar bill is a symbol of energy but it's not redeemable a five dollar
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:38.160]  bill is not redeemable in gold or silver so it is simply an empty symbol of a
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.480]  commodity which again what is commodity it's it's it's some form of energy or
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.680]  something of value but people one dimension only I mean old-timers who
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.680]  were common sense and understood history they knew how dangerous a fiat
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.920]  currency was but as we became more and more symbol oriented it gets to the
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.640]  point where the symbols have no connection to reality anymore and create
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.600]  almost like a matrix like system of deception but here's an example of one
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:16.120]  dimensional thinking I saw a comment in our article on prisonplanet.com last
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.400]  night the article responding to the White House response to our previous
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.760]  article on Thursday White House Attached PrisonPlanet.com report on
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:31.880]  blackouts and the commenter said I don't get it I I'm sick of Alex Jones he
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:37.840]  has an advertiser that promotes a solar backup unit and Alex says get off the
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:45.280]  grid but then Alex is saying don't let them shut down our cold-powered plants
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.360]  that's a one-dimensional thought anyone thinking in a two-dimensional three
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:55.760]  dimensional or some can think in a four-dimensional layer would realize
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.960]  instantly in a fractal design hundreds of different angles and points that show
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:09.560]  how unconscious and one-dimensional that statement was in the ad we say
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:14.160]  there's moves to shut down power plants to increase prices we should move to get
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.360]  off the grid but we need multiple systems of energy we need cheap industry
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.160]  for our factories and businesses and schools to be competitive and China and
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:27.760]  Mexico and others they get cheaper energy than we do because the globalist
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:31.040]  have decided to invest in those countries not here and they're trying to shut
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:35.800]  off their competition but see that's not even a complex thought but it's two to
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:43.920]  three dimensions deep so that person sees I've noticed the weak-minded they see
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:48.000]  contradictions where there aren't contradictions and of course the one
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.200]  dimensional thinking goes further a lot of people will just say lies about their
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.120]  boss or their employee or anybody and believe them real liars believe their
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.160]  lies and they believe that if they create the symbol in their mind and that if
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.640]  they just say something is that they've made the decision and now that's the way
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.120]  reality is they've bought into perception is reality they've bought into the
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:20.160]  packaging and it's just extremely frustrating to see something like that
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.240]  when obviously we're saying it'd be great if we could all have solar power we
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.840]  could all be off the grid and independent the point is our society and system is
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.840]  set up and in the interim we don't want to let the globalists come in with
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.520]  promises of alhalla when their real goal is to only allow their coal powered
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.360]  plants to operate so there's artificial scarcity so they might make much larger
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.280]  profits in the endgame and they're already making those bigger profits by
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.000]  creating artificial scarcity and power if there are plenty of power plants and
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.680]  anybody can set one up as long as they're clean then that cuts into the
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.240]  globalist incredible profits the globalists make huge profits and
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.520]  consolidate power through controlled markets that they're able to get through
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.440]  government power and so it's that wedding of the mega corporations with
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.880]  government that is the great tyranny that is the great tyrannous and there's
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.680]  so many other examples of one-dimensional thinking you know the TSA
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.560]  Homeland Security puts out a report we want to stop child trafficking at the
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.840]  Super Bowl and a one-dimensional thinker just takes it and says must be true
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.600]  government said it meanwhile if you have two three-dimensional thinking and
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.960]  historical understanding and have the data you know the government's one of
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:38.680]  the biggest traffickers in women and children and this is all just a PR stunt
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.000]  but to protect themselves they've got to have the movement against their own
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.200]  system so they can control any of the investigations see that's three-dimensional
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:55.400]  thinking all the right back we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:30:02.760]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.200]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.120]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:19.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.680]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.640]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.320]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:28.400]  one-dimensional thinking here in just a moment first though we live in a toxic
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.200]  environment there's no doubt about that and our body uses nutrients and
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.600]  minerals to repair itself and to fight back against things like cancer and
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.760]  there is a great sponsor we have my wife uses it I use it Rob Jacobson uses it

[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:51.840]  special okay trying to get into higher levels of thought one dimensional
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  thought is really not a natural state for humankind we've been artificially
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.880]  put into this because of television the internet and society more and more it's
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.720]  always played a role in deceptive governments and systems but just to
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.240]  break down one-dimensional thought one-dimensional thought at a subconscious
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.320]  level would be if you were watching us live via video right now and you think
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.640]  that you're here in the room with us or when you go to a movie theater and watch
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.000]  a film and suspend disbelief and actually just start accepting it all is
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.160]  true and you're subconscious in your conscious basically become one for a
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.120]  period and you accept it all is real when you're watching that horror movie and
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.680]  you think the zombies are real and you're getting scared that's one-dimensional
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:43.200]  thinking and one-dimensional thinking of course is associated with lower brain
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:48.720]  function and basic instincts but another example of it is obviously so-called
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.400]  money when I call this money I'm engaging in one-dimensional speech I know
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.000]  this isn't really what we think of as real money that's backed up by a real
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.640]  commodity and that's redeemable in wheat or gold or salt or whatever's been
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.800]  valuable throughout history or land things that are associated with energy
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:14.200]  this now becomes a certification or a symbol of exchange but now they've
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:20.000]  removed any connection to any real tangible wealth from the money and so
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.680]  they've brought us into this one-dimensional system where a lot of
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:29.240]  people will kill their own grandmother for a stick of bubblegum but another
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:36.080]  example of one-dimensional thought is people still believing politicians and
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.400]  just accepting whatever they say as if it's the received truth kind of in a
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:46.400]  suspended disbelief mode of just receiving not actually thinking and and to
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.400]  simplify it complex thought complex business complex relationships the most
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.480]  unsuccessful failures that we meet in life are people that are like wild
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.560]  animals they see things one-dimensionally they'll buy into any kind
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.120]  they'll go along with any false idea as long as it's packaged correctly and
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  they never think about what's really contained in the symbol and what it's
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:18.400]  connected to if anything and they never think about the causal relationships of
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.960]  doing one thing well what is that gonna cause and then what is that gonna
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.640]  trigger and what are the possible outcomes of what of the ramifications of
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.800]  that development as it divides out into a fractal design similar to the
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:37.520]  butterfly effect or throwing the pebble into the pond that causes the massive
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:45.280]  overall ripples tiny pebble if you have a very still pond and you throw it in
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.080]  you'd be amazed at how it causes ripples to go all the way across the pond and
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:55.920]  then bounce back and it could go on for several minutes massive overall energy
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:01.320]  output compared to the tiny amount of energy that the pebble first exerted
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:08.840]  now when you enter other energy drivers like the wind or kids splashing around in
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.920]  the pond now the pebble isn't as noticeable and that's why the global is
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.120]  politically want you watching TV responding to their stimuli following
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.840]  their matrix false reality as they walk you deeper into unconsciousness and one
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.160]  dimensional thinking because when you act on your own when you act in a
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.120]  multi-dimensional thought process and then put it into action and actually
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.480]  manifest it through actions you begin to cause ripples in the universe ripples
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:42.680]  on our planet economically spiritually physically you begin to actually have an
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.960]  effect and leave a mark on the world they don't want you on the field they
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.840]  want you as spectators so their pebbles or the boulders they're throwing into
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:57.480]  the pond have the biggest effect but the winds of change millions and millions
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.600]  of people doing little things every day to further increase their understanding
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:07.760]  and of knowledge and to further put that spread of knowledge out to others and to
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.120]  promote moral ideas which are universal in mankind the first thing the global
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.280]  is do is tell you there are no morals you can't have a view there is no right
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.880]  and wrong so that you don't have a position then they come back with all of
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.480]  their morals about shut down free speech because it's hurtful and shut off
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:29.800]  energy because it's hurtful they always moralize but then they're telling you
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:35.240]  you should moralize because when you do pick the position that's best for
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.040]  humanity that's best for you that makes you sleep good at night that you know is
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.520]  wholesome when you make those right decisions in life it's winds of change
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:50.340]  they can't stop and no amount of propaganda and lies can reverse the
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.680]  smallest amount of truth and when you begin to put off the truth when you
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.840]  begin to put it out into the universe it has an effect this is scientific and
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:02.160]  I'm now getting into philosophy and this is the type of stuff I think about 24
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.360]  hours a day I have dreams about this constantly my
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.320]  understandings of it but they're very afraid of you and the power that you
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  have and that's why the globalists admit in countless white papers that we've
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.040]  covered here that they wanted to make us promiscuous that they wanted to make us
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:24.680]  animalistic because that stuff's addictive but it's lower brain and then it
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:30.520]  makes us more easy to control they're threatened by a true human they're
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.720]  threatened by true dynamic understanding because most people if they ever
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.000]  actually see the truth of the universe and the world if they ever tap into that
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.080]  great truth they then will immediately see all the corruption the evil the
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.520]  cancer in society and you will not even have to have courage you will hurl
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:51.960]  yourself towards the tyranny in an attempt to block it because at a
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:42:00.360]  fundamental level you understand it's threatening to all that's good so they
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:06.280]  want you in the flesh they want you in a lower state of awareness they want you
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:12.200]  to be stunted because you're threatening to them they understand the secrets of
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.720]  humanity the secrets of our potential and they have greedily decided to done
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.400]  everybody down put a police state grit in have controlled by all weapons
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.960]  releases each one worse than the last as they set up a tighter and tighter grid
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.840]  and basically wipe the majority of us out in the next 30 to 40 years perhaps
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:34.680]  even sooner but it's now being phased in it's all documented all admitted what
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:41.040]  they're doing and it's something that is gonna hurt 99.9% of us and in the end
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:48.120]  hurt the globalist themselves there could be two globalist in a high-tech
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.000]  crystal palace a hundred years from now two globalist left they've got total
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.240]  life extension they've merged with the cybernetic interfaces they can you know
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:09.440]  do things that are to the ancients would be godlike but they still at their core
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:16.480]  were wicked people that made the satanic decision to engage in nihilistic
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.920]  exploits of power grabbing and they're still self-destructive at their core
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.080]  and their projection on the outside world of wanting to enslave and
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.520]  degrade and dumb down that's going to come back on them and those two final
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.480]  entities those transhumanist will rip each other to pieces and will destroy
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.360]  whatever creations they've made in an attempt to get the ultimate throne of
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:49.200]  power this is a system that will extinct all life this is a dark force that
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:56.320]  will give no quarter and must be resisted 110% I'm getting some pretty
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:07.000]  heavy stuff now but start little mental exercises of thinking about chain
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.080]  reactions in the economy in business in relationship in lives in everything you're
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:23.640]  doing and learn to study how they interact and at first you won't have a
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:28.200]  lot of skill at this but as you focus your mind on it more and more you will
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:33.440]  develop what is known as discernment and obviously some of us are gifted with
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:39.560]  more of it than others but all of you have it and I suggest you use it because
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.920]  your life will be so so fulfilled I am so alive I am so awake that it's
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:53.240]  painful my knowledge curve is growing so fast and it's so frustrating that I
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.680]  can't even articulate it and the gifts that God has given us are so wondrous
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:04.640]  the eye has not seen the earth not heard what God's got planned for the species
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:12.960]  think about how fast things have changed think about how we just got the
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.680]  internet really in the last 20 years I mean it was around in the 60s but
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.440]  officially in the last 20 think about how just a hundred years ago we got
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:24.640]  automobiles think about how people just take electricity for granted think
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:32.120]  about how people take it for granted that the sum of knowledge is got to be
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.600]  billions of times what it was just a hundred years ago you can search
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.640]  instantly all the libraries of the world you can search information on a
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.280]  trillion different subjects you can get different views and different ideas from
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.920]  thousands of different perspectives on each issue just via the internet the
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.800]  sum of humanity communicating with each other and advancing knowledge it's got
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.880]  a lot of bad things as well it's a spectrum of humanity but just like
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.480]  children you go to Africa or you go to Latin America you go to the poorest
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:08.960]  areas and you see starving children their eyes are a light burning with the
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.720]  human spirit it looks like old black and white photos I've seen of my ancestors
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:18.160]  150 years ago a hundred years ago even 60 years ago you look at every one of
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.560]  them their eyes look wild with electricity my eyes are dim compared to
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.800]  theirs but you go and you see starving villagers little children with their
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.880]  ribs sticking out of them and their eyes are on fire and they're cheerful and
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.560]  they're happy and if you give them a tin can to play with they will cry and they
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.800]  will thank you and when you talk to those children they have great intuitive
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:48.400]  knowledge spiritual knowledge because they're so close to death children who
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.880]  don't have enough food appreciate it children who don't have enough knowledge
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:56.080]  appreciate knowledge so much they're questing for it so they're already wide
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.200]  open like a flower to the sun and already have an inherently all the knowledge
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:05.640]  of their soul and their ancestors in them but then you look at my children
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.920]  beautiful electric eyes eating healthy food wonderous compared to many other
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.840]  children I know who are eating all the toxic garbage and watching television
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:25.600]  but still decadent always wanting certain types of food a poor starving
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.200]  African or Asian child would gobble up spinach or Brussels sprouts and beg for
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:35.960]  more but my children even if I try to not make them decadent and weak they're
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:41.200]  like I am they're not as hearty because they've had it so good see we have all
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:45.040]  the knowledge of the world but because we have so much knowledge we don't even
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:48.160]  care the general public ah who cares about the three branches of government
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.760]  who cares about quantum mechanics who cares about fish infusion who cares
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.040]  about heavy cyclotrons who cares about weather modification who cares about
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:04.840]  cross species chimeras who cares because we've it's all there so what I'm gonna go
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:10.600]  to the bar and get drunk yeah that's what they say or I'm gonna go to the
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:17.760]  topless bar or I'm gonna go watch a football game and so the world kills us
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:24.560]  with the largesse the system kills us with just this fount of food and and
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.320]  entertainment and distractions but notice everything the globalist push
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:37.160]  everything that they really drive on you is death to the species and they're
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.920]  smart and they've talked about it go back 80 years ago or so they said we've
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:44.680]  got to take over the education this country I have the US National Banking
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:49.600]  Association from actually 1898 read it on air where they said we got to take
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.760]  over the media we got to dump people down have you read a newspaper from 235
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:58.080]  years ago when this country was getting founded I mean they weren't showing off
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:02.760]  with their use of language they were really into it to use wide spectrum
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.800]  delicate words woven together to truly express their deeper thoughts and
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:13.760]  understandings the average commoner was using words and complex ideas then top
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:26.240]  professors today I can barely read a newspaper from 1780 it's hard to read a
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:33.480]  newspaper from 130 years ago the language is being destroyed the use of
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:38.240]  words their meanings is being changed where people can't even basically
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:44.800]  communicate with each other anymore and the globalist practice disinformation
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:51.520]  and practice dumbing down the culture and those that understand this they are
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:56.520]  advanced up to this advanced as you destroy your own species that you're
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:06.800]  bound to for eternity this is what the heart of the matter is really all about
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.840]  we are being inserted into an electronic matrix we are not communicating
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.720]  with each other children at restaurants I look at all have handheld video games
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.400]  they're not talking to their parents they're at the school all day we are
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.640]  being programmed and once you aren't connected to the real world and street
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:27.080]  smarts and common sense now as you're raised up with a tablet in your hand
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:33.960]  giving you what the government wants you to see now they can give you symbols
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.440]  that aren't even connected to any reality the globalists know what they're
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:44.320]  doing and so right now they're trying to sell us on total tyranny as if it's a
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.560]  good thing because they believe the majority of people are disconnected from
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.000]  reality enough now that they can't communicate and can't be reached or
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.440]  helped we're reaching a critical point and humanity starting to wake up and
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:01.480]  struggle because humanity knows how much danger it's in collective hi this is
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.440]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:08.920]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.240]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.400]  seeds and I'll perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.320]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.440]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:29.320]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food

[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.580]  you feel I'm Don from the Mexican January of 2000 I had a heart attack then
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.980]  my real health began going downhill and I had high blood pressure high blood
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:16.280]  sugar poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well I was a mess pretty much
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.680]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract I started
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:24.000]  taking heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.880]  better my blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.120]  really did improve experience these benefits and more when your body gets
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:35.640]  what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract order at HB

[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.340]  folks I did not expect this at all about a seventh eighth and ninth day I saw
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:54.160]  dramatic improvements from taking heart and body extract details at HBextract.com
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:01.120]  or call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:11.200]  you know I can't do justice to the pole shift in just this one segment ahead of
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.640]  Ray McGovern joining us so what I'll do is he leaves us at the bottom of the
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.680]  next hour I will spend the last 30 minutes of the third hour exclusively on
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:23.840]  the pole shift information it's just too important and I'm not gonna just spend
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.160]  five minutes on it and again it's exhausting to try to cover such a lofty
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:34.840]  subject and then try to secrete the accurate paradigm information to you
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.480]  because if I don't give the information out in a full spectrum breakdown it
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.920]  could actually be used by the globalist for further deception that's another
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:49.480]  problem with really becoming conscious and and truly breaking things down but
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.840]  I don't think there's a more important subject than with the one-dimensional
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.360]  thinking and once they get you in one-dimensional thinking then they can
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:03.760]  remove all trappings of reality and put people into a false reality and many
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:07.680]  ancient cultures could artificially do this even with low-tech means
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.040]  generationally that the priest class would train the public to even give
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:16.880]  their children up to be sacrificed why it's an act of total submission to go
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.960]  against the very human instinct every culture did it it's a tropism you know
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:27.800]  how a plant grows the seeds designed well tyranny grows a certain way it
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:34.840]  builds a certain system the Japanese 500 years ago 800 years ago a thousand years
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:40.120]  ago had the exact same feudal caste system with knights and castles fealty
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:45.160]  to a lord to an emperor to a showgun exactly as they had it in the Aztec
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:50.560]  kingdom exactly as they had it in in in European kingdoms these are cultures
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:54.640]  that hadn't communicated with each other but they build the same systems
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:03.000]  tyrants just like a certain species of spider the scientists that study
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.520]  arachnids you know they can tell you even if the spider has been eaten by a
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.120]  bird what spider spawned that web because they know the fingerprint they
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.920]  know the signature and with the globalist we've seen the web they've
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.840]  spawned but this isn't this this is something new this isn't the same web
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.480]  they've taken all the old webs of tyranny and laid them over each other
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.320]  and then put a new high-tech web over that web and I'm looking at this thing
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:33.400]  and I'm going whoa this is a kill grid and the globalist and all their
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:38.160]  publications go you better believe it is we're going to kill you they openly
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.040]  talk about world government one-shot policy for sterilization drugs in the
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:50.160]  food and water I've got a report here out of federal news radio presidential
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:56.240]  emergency alerts to be tested and they're upgrading it with presidential
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:00.320]  announcements see that just took me into a whole fractal understanding of
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:10.920]  previous data research I remember in 96 talking to Kevin Stone the engineer at
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.840]  the local FM I was on remember talking to other engineers when I was doing the
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:23.840]  show out of or the other AMs here in town and they had all been given the the
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:30.120]  feds always tell you what they're going to do a decade or so before they do it
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.240]  they put it in place and they announce it and how many times I told you through
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:38.520]  the federal EAS you won't just get occasional tests anymore they told
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:45.600]  engineers and media companies 14 years ago and then again 10 years ago and I
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.720]  was able to read the document shot video of it it's in my film police state
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:54.720]  2000 1999 release they told him when we're done the government's gonna take
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:58.840]  hours of broadcast time every day that's gonna be the new fairness doctrine or one
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.560]  part of it is that the government's just gonna break in whenever they want and
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:07.280]  they're wired in under law since 96 with their own receivers in all the
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:11.320]  broadcast units at the tower the board op doesn't hit a button when they get an
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.600]  order it automatically goes on and the government makes announcements they've
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.480]  also passed federal regulations were all clock radios have automatic
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:24.200]  transponder takeover arms where it turns on by itself and makes announcements
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:29.480]  television sets have it in it all the cable systems and federal news radio is
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.640]  reporting and they have a link to the White House announcement that the
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.720]  president is preparing to start making announcements getting you ready of course
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:40.720]  for when they give the true martial law announcement

[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:44.880]  restaurant and we were talking about when are they gonna arrest this guy for
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:48.360]  war crimes how can bush brag that he ordered torture he said it again in two
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:52.880]  two speeches last year but then send people in the military to prison who
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:56.800]  were caught torturing and we know that they've talked in Spain about and

[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:22.080]  introduce you you're a former military man from the Vietnam era and then of
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.960]  course you were the top presidential briefer to Ronald Reagan George Herbert
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:29.280]  Walker Bush and you've been a big critic of the lies about WMD's and famously
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.480]  confronted Rumsfeld he tried to lie and say that he hadn't said that and you
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.720]  certainly secured him there and you've done so much more but I thank you for
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:43.560]  coming on with us let's briefly get into the situation in Egypt well Alex
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.960]  there's an elephant in that living room and the name of the elephant is Israel
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:56.880]  and surprise surprise no one in this country is talking about it this is an
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:02.560]  incredible blow not only to the United States but to Israel they had depended
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:09.280]  on having a very safe frontier with Egypt since the accord there were Egypt
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.760]  recognized Israel and that's a long time ago and they had taken it for granted
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:19.360]  and all of a sudden whoa their strategic calculations are upset by this popular
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:27.040]  revolt in Egypt so the real question is what will the Israelis do now you know
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:30.320]  people say well they can't do anything they'll sit back and watch what happens
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.440]  right but the way they operate number one they'll operate through their well
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:41.360]  how shall I say their their supporters here in the United States and this is
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.320]  one main reason why Hillary Clinton and our president have been waffling for the
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:50.800]  last week or ten days not knowing whether to say you know bark needs to get
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:55.280]  out or oh maybe you can deal with this vice president who's a well-known
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.160]  torturer you know it's really been painful watching the twos and froes and
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:07.280]  the unspoken the factor that can never be spoken on mainline TV is what this
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:11.880]  means to the Israelis and how Israeli supporters in this country are putting
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.560]  the screws on Barack on Barack Obama again to make sure that he doesn't do
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:22.560]  anything they will make that part of the world still riskier for Israel and now
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:29.440]  the LA Times reports a bunch of US ships are steaming into the area and on top of
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.920]  that we're getting reports that Marines are being deployed into Egypt they
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:41.400]  claim for evacuations do you buy that I know I don't buy that I think the Marines
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:47.960]  want to be want to be prepared to follow orders as they always do I don't think
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:53.240]  that the US personages are in any danger there may be a you know back up at the
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:58.120]  airport but none of the protesters have have said they're going to do any harm
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:03.320]  to US officials or tourists who remain there so this is a pretty ominous thing
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:08.000]  I hadn't gotten confirmation about these marine moves but that's what Marines do
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.880]  and if we move our decides to make a last stand he'll be supported not only by
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.960]  Marines from our country but by all manner of support from Israel which knows
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:24.280]  how to do this by the way and our only stones throw away well we've had the
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:29.800]  British go into Suez in the past and it is the business insider reporting on the
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:34.420]  marine situation but if they if they admit they're sending ships would
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:38.400]  Marines go along with that and that's who comes off the ships yeah
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:42.760]  dependent what kinds of ships of course they can always justify the ships by a
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:49.600]  sensible danger to the Suez canal we'll have to see how that plays out because I
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.640]  don't think the administration here knows what it's doing stay there let's
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:05:01.840]  finish up with Egypt they then get into bush arrest fears Alex told you the
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:05.720]  government announced recently that the recession is over it ended on June of
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:10.800]  2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:14.120]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for the rest
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.760]  of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news

[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:14.400]  Jones and the GCN radio network that's right the United States has been
[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:18.840]  captured by big offshore corporations they're totally ruthless all over the
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:24.640]  world these multinationals have funded dictatorships corrupt bureaucracies to
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:30.160]  basically feed on top of their populations and the people are rebelling
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:35.000]  in Egypt the establishment obviously recognized that and has said that they
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.840]  are funding the opposition I guess so they are still in control if housing
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:46.320]  mubarak is forced out sooner than September and Ray McGovern of course
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:52.280]  top CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior he was also in the
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:58.520]  military during the Vietnam War and we always appreciate him joining us he's
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.920]  made a lot of really accurate predictions I remember about a year and a
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.600]  half before it happened he said well I would look for Cheney in the neocons to
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.360]  try to stage a gulf of Tonkin situation to get in the war with Iran then about a
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:17.720]  year later that happened and then a year after that we learned that it had been a
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.440]  staged event so just amazing and so we need to listen up when he tells us what
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.200]  he thinks is really going on in Egypt and where he thinks the situation is
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:30.040]  going what's happening with these pipelines going these gas pipelines into
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:35.400]  Jordan and Israel being blown up what the overall geopolitical ramifications are
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:39.560]  and not just briefing presidents he's now briefing us tell us again what's
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:47.120]  going on in Egypt well Alex it's very very complicated the main factor really
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:54.360]  is that the broad public support the revolutionaries or the uprising people
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:10:01.640]  are numerous but they seem to lack a coherent leadership the only bright
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.680]  light there is El Baraday the former chief UN inspector the head of the
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:13.600]  International Atomic Energy Agency who has wide respect abroad as well as in
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.320]  Egypt a reluctant the draftee so to speak but he has said that he would be
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.160]  willing to lead now and form an interim government so that's the good news the
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:29.440]  bad news of course is that for Israel and the United States El Baraday is
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:35.880]  poison why and because oddly this statesman insists on telling the truth
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:41.080]  he was the one that has said all along that there is no real evidence that Iran
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:45.560]  is working on a nuclear weapon and he should know his inspectors are crawling
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:52.240]  all over that country and he was the one you may recall back in March or April of
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:58.320]  2003 who testified or is watching it live I'll never forget it testified
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.240]  before the UN Security Council and said you know those reports those reports
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:11.160]  that the Iraq was seeking a Euro cake uranium from New Year we have looked
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:18.200]  into it and in two days we found that they are not authentic they were
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:24.440]  forgeries forgeries by I think the Chinese folks so the guy is poison the US
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.240]  tried to get him removed from his post in the IAEA without success so where
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:35.320]  that leave us well that leaves us with a with a very fearful Israel stoking up
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.960]  fears in the United States about these those Muslims you know these these
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:45.200]  Muslim terrorists that could take over Cairo which is a red herring they're
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.840]  never going to do that in Egypt Egypt is a country of 80 million people you know
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.280]  if the rest is small fry Egypt is so big the Israel I think will have to
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:00.040]  determine what it's going to do and what it's going to do frightens me because
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:05.000]  it is all kinds of possibilities including well let me put it this way
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.600]  Alex say if I were about a day I would insist on a whole platoon of soldiers
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:18.520]  and bodyguards around me rather than just the 10 that exist now now Ray what's
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:25.520]  the stratagem of disinformation then having the AP the London Telegraph come
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:31.360]  out and say that the US is behind alberity and basically triggered this is
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:37.440]  not an attempt knowing that if the West and Israel claim that alberity
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:44.120]  somehow works for them that that will discredit him at home in a country tired
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:48.800]  of foreign domination through the propped up dictator housing mubarak who
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:54.600]  Cheney is calling a great guy who and a good man who we should respect yeah
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:59.520]  Alex if I were you know giving references for a job I don't think that
[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:03.960]  include big Cheney and my reference list yeah that speaks volumes doesn't it
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:09.960]  Cheney thinks he's a great guy but your your initial point was having to do with
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:15.880]  the I forget now well no I mean the media is the media yeah I'm claiming that
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:20.640]  alberity is is backed by the US yeah well you know there's all kinds of
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.120]  disinformation campaigns out there to discredit somebody like about a day and
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:30.480]  you can be sure that we have our quote assets and quote in some of the more
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:35.800]  conservative newspapers and magazines in Britain and elsewhere and so you can
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.640]  expect them to sell all kinds of confusion the Egyptian people know what
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:46.320]  alabada is and what he isn't and that's what counts here the only problem is
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:51.800]  getting organized to the point where they they can actually face into the new
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:58.680]  vice president named by Mubarak who by the way is the CIA and Israeli
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:05.520]  checkpoint their liaison guy not only that but he was the fellow in Egypt that
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:14.560]  handle the the transfer of people that we wanted to get tortured renditions is
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:20.280]  what we call it the kind of nice super cat yeah renditions and there was one
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:27.280]  particularly flagrant rendition and this is worth recalling to mind the
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:32.280]  fellow's name was Ali B because he came from Libya okay and he had some sort of
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:36.640]  job with the training camps of all kind of it seems that he was sort of like
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:40.200]  the travel agent you know he would rain but repair tickets for people want to
[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:45.760]  come in and train he wasn't anywhere near close to Osama bin Laden or the
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:50.560]  Lahiri or the others but they caught him okay and then before the war the
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:55.760]  premium was on getting somebody to quote confess and quote that's how the
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:01.160]  Muslim was saying was training al-Qaeda operatives and unconventional weapons
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:04.880]  okay yeah in the fake airplanes it turned out none of that was true yeah
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:11.960]  right so he got the Ali B and he won't quote confess and quote and so they
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:18.760]  take them to to they send them off to al-Sulaman the current Egyptian vice
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:23.640]  president and they say you know you guys are better at this than we are and what
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:27.080]  we need to do is make sure we find out that
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:32.600]  Salam Hussein was training al-Qaeda operatives and that Ali B knew that
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:37.000]  because he was running the travel agency and guess what Alex you'll never guess
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.560]  what but the Egyptians can succeeded in doing that the cable went back to to
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:49.240]  Washington the next day the president the vice president and later Colin Powell
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:56.560]  before the UN spun this tale as proof that Soto Voce Salam Hussein has some
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.800]  sort of tie with 9-11 because he was training al-Qaeda operatives and that is
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:07.800]  only one of the thousands of admitted crimes and lies and deception shifting
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.760]  gears because you don't have a lot of time left with you Ray let's go back to
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.400]  who was involved at this time Bush Cheney Carl Rove the architect Alberta
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:21.320]  Gonzalez putting out memos they could torture people including crushing
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:27.000]  children's genitals and now Bush came out last year and in two different
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.240]  speeches and his book said I'd order tortured again so this is admittedly
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.020]  illegal there have been calls for at least Carl Rove or Alberta Gonzalez or
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:39.520]  John you to be brought up on war crimes but now we have the Times of India
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:44.120]  other publications reporting Bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visiting was set to
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:48.920]  give a keynote address and had agreed to do it is now canceled the February 12th
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:53.280]  speech before we get into this recapping the international admitted
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.960]  crimes that were committed here the lies of WMD's the Downing Street memo the
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:02.440]  White House memo I was at a restaurant last night and Carl Rove sat down right
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:06.720]  next to us here in Austin and I just couldn't eat what we got upset I'm not
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:10.560]  eating in the same room with somebody like Hitler and we left it was a private
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:13.760]  place I didn't want to start screaming at him in there but do you think I
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:17.280]  handled that right what would you have said to him well what I would have done
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:22.840]  Alex is a call code pink great quick they have handcuffs and they have courage
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:27.960]  the courage that continues to amaze me they have tried to arrest him at his
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:32.200]  book signings and what needs to happen is somebody needs to put the cuffs on him
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.680]  because he can be extradited and subjected to justice our government
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:41.760]  doesn't have the guts to do it but the Spaniards the French the Germans they
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:46.800]  all may under the principle of universal jurisdiction which briefly means that
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:50.760]  if the government who is harboring these criminals is unwilling to proceed
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:56.000]  against them in a legal fashion then under the convention against torture any
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.680]  government can initiate judicial proceedings now that's why George Bush
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.680]  this is really amazing we have word late Friday night that George Bush had
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:12.520]  canceled out of this appearance in Geneva scheduled for February 12th and we
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.600]  learned from the Center for Constitutional Rights that they and
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:23.080]  the European counterparts had assembled 2,500 pages worth of indictment on
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:28.480]  on George Bush and we're ready to serve it to the prosecutor in Geneva now this
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:33.960]  is serious stuff you are so long you're separately here on air all we've got is
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.120]  a blurb in the Times of India you're confirming that indeed this did go on
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:43.120]  and you have the bona fides yeah yeah we've been in touch with the Center for
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:48.240]  Constitutional Rights it almost worked someone someone leaked the fact that
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.280]  this thing had been given to the prosecutors in Geneva and what Bush did
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:57.520]  was cancel right away now the White House or the Bush spokespeople are saying
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:01.160]  well now he he had heard that there would be demonstrations and he didn't want to
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:06.440]  you know meeting when a burden that Swiss police well boulder dash but he was
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:10.280]  afraid that was getting detained and actually brought to the Hague to the
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.760]  trial now unless there's less people think that this is far-fetched this
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:23.040]  happened before on October 26 2007 again the Center for Constitutional Rights
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.960]  are really gutsy organization filed a petition with the prop it would be
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.440]  prosecutor in Paris Donald Roosevelt happened to be in Paris at the time
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:37.520]  these things need to be taken seriously witness the fact that Don Rumsfeld went
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.520]  out the back door of the embassy drove off the early airport or the gold
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:45.440]  airport and was on the first plane back to the United States cancel all the
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:51.640]  appearances so you know the sad thing is that Obama doesn't have the guts to do
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:54.800]  the right thing well right stay there let's continue to look at this on the
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:59.200]  other side incredible information plus it forces this issue of war crimes out

[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:17.880]  reports dealing with pull shift people keep wanting me to talk about it Paul
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.560]  Watson's written a big article pull shift threatens to cause weather chaos
[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:25.400]  that's what NASA and people are saying Fox News reporting are having to
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:30.480]  recalibrate airport GPS it's pretty strange so I'm gonna give you my take
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:35.800]  on it coming up after Ray leaves us Ray I think it's so important here for those
[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:40.040]  that don't know the history or those that might have forgotten it to recap
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:44.760]  briefly all the different war crimes I mean the knowingly lying about WMD is
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:49.240]  the ordering of torture the secret arrest the the rendition the White House
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:53.560]  memos where the president is above the law I mean Nixon tried that saying when
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:56.640]  it's the president breaking the law it's not illegal that was proven to be a
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.320]  fraud if they are able to operate and set the precedent of doing this and we
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.760]  know Obama's continuing the rendition then there is no bill of rights there is
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.720]  no Constitution but worse than that we are tyrants because we're allowing it to
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.160]  happen and absolutely you know by pointing out that that's probably why
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.200]  Bush has bought all that land and in Uruguay or whatever that that they are
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:20.560]  criminals that begins to put the idea in people's minds that they must be brought
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:27.120]  to justice but briefly recapping the crimes of these people well you know how
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.360]  much time we have about five minutes you but yeah and then we'll come back yeah
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:37.480]  I just of course because you could go for 45 minutes just listing them as Dennis
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:46.240]  Kusukinich to his great credit did do 35 35 articles of impeachment he read them
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.120]  it took six or seven hours on the floor of the house but he did that they were
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.880]  on the record that you can get them from war is a crime org you know the ones
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:00.320]  you mentioned are the more obvious ones also starting a war of aggression which
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:05.120]  was outlawed was banned after World War two and in numerous international
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:10.160]  documents but you know one of the things that toward the end I think it's
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:18.840]  article 33 and 34 that talks about his at best his complete incompetence in
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.680]  handling the intelligence information that was available before 9-11 and that
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.360]  was that was criminal that was malfeasance not just misbeisance and
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:34.880]  then the lying about what he was told now not many people know that George
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.920]  Tennant the head of the CIA lied under oaths during the 9-11 law then commission
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:46.200]  proceedings when one of the congressmen on the commission asked him George what
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:51.840]  did you say to the president during the month of August 2001 so we had no contact
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:56.880]  with the president I never saw him and well how about telephone no no no no he
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.280]  was on you know he's been in Crawford and I was on him well turns out that
[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:09.200]  tenets saw the president on the 17th of August and on the 24th of August and on
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.160]  the 31st of August so he lied under oath his statesman or his spokesman a
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:18.560]  little while later so yeah yeah he aired but that's what was on TV why did he
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:24.600]  err because Tennant however incompetent he was did tell him about that threat
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:31.160]  that Islamic terrorists were learning to fly airplanes he followed up on the
[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:35.720]  president's daily brief item and so there's a lot in those indictments that
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:40.040]  they just show that the president and those who served him first and foremost
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:45.320]  the sycophant George Tennant lied under oath and and you know there are lots of
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.000]  things that were in the articles of impeachment against president Nixon three
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.080]  articles which are also very operative under Bush the difference is that John
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:01.600]  Conyers had some guts back in the 1970s John Conyers is now an old part of the
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:08.760]  establishment and didn't want to risk democratic gains in the by-election of
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:14.520]  2006 and of course going back though to the Condoleezza rice memo where they
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:17.720]  said we didn't hear a plan to fly planes in the buildings and then it turned
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:22.160]  out been laudan determined to attack and that the FBI meant memos even said
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.720]  fly planes in the World Trade Center so they lied about that they knew and they
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.400]  stood down yeah they didn't do anything now the charitable explanation is that
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:36.640]  they were just completely incompetent there's lots of reason to believe that
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:42.240]  there's a more sinister explanation but none of them to my you know my
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:47.240]  investigative mind are conclusive just yet the other thing that needs to be
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.360]  mentioned of course is that there is a memorandum released by Attorney General
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:58.680]  Alberto Gonzalez which shows that George Bush on the 7th of February wow it's
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:04.600]  the anniversary isn't it 7th of February 2002 approved torture what he
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:09.600]  said was we don't have to obey the Geneva conventions we will treat prisoners
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:18.480]  quote what was the words he used human yeah quote humanly as appropriate and as
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:24.000]  consistent with military necessity period end quote that's not what Geneva
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.120]  says the president can't just preside from Geneva and that's what he did and
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:33.640]  then we got the more detailed memos where they talked about what can we do
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:37.800]  well we can bury people alive yeah we can torture children from their parents
[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.600]  yeah Ray McGovern stay there I want to talk about where this is going with an
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:47.400]  American president not able to travel to Europe this is a big deal stay with us

[02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:16.880]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:21.240]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:30:21.240 --> 02:30:25.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:29.880]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:34.000]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:26.960]  gates of hell but I won't back home or top CIA analyst Ray McGovern a true
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:31.160]  specialist in geopolitical machinations is our guest for another six minutes or
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:37.220]  so have you just joined us a bush fears arrest scraps Swiss visit and this is
[02:33:37.220 --> 02:33:41.600]  big news around the country but Ray knew about it on Friday this just broke
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:44.960]  this morning in the Times of India and other publications give us as much
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:49.800]  information as you can about exactly what transpired and the spin they're
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:55.160]  putting on this and and again why you think this is so important Ray well
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:34:01.280]  this is the first time that let's say people who are interested found out in
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:07.760]  advance of the Bush's travel plans to Europe and so the Center for
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:14.200]  Constitutional Rights which does not shy away from from controversy and its
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:22.840]  European counterparts put together a 2,500 page complaint against George W. Bush
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:27.880]  for having authorized torture now it wasn't much of an argument because he
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:32.800]  admitted that three times within the last ten months three times two times
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:38.600]  orally and once in his book now the last time he did it orally was with that
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:44.320]  MSNBC fellow who interviewed him and what George Bush said well yeah I
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.600]  want to rise torture and I do it again and the follow said well do you think
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:53.760]  it was legal and what Bush says the lawyer said it was legal and I have to
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:59.960]  follow my specialists so here we have the lawyers right now mafia lawyers will
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:04.640]  always tell you what's legal or not these lawyers and there are six of them
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:13.680]  that are being possibly prosecuted in a Spanish court and one March is the drop
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:18.640]  dead date because under the International Convention against torture if a
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:23.560]  host country harbors a torturer and does not proceed against him
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:28.080]  judicially then any country can do so any country that has signed that
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:33.040]  convention in Spain Germany Italy the rest of them have all signed it so where's
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:38.680]  it and Judy and the Swiss so what does it mean well Bush had a cancelist trip
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:41.920]  which is highly embarrassing that a former president of the United States
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:47.120]  can't travel to Europe but there it is now what about the lawyers the lawyers
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:50.600]  are not exempt you know they claim well we just gave advice Bush was the
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:55.680]  decider the lawyers under the Nazi regime in Germany were prosecuted
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:01.000]  convicted and given strong jail terms yeah that's the just following order
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.800]  situation yeah so these lawyers are equally culpable their names are
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:18.400]  Gonzales Addington J by B Jim Haynes fight and one other whose name escapes
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:25.120]  John you yeah you got it okay so those are the six now by March 1st the Spanish
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:32.320]  Court has demanded that the US Attorney General tell tell Spain are you good are
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:36.560]  we prosecuting them here or are we not the answer of course will be we're not
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:40.600]  prosecuting them here because Obama says he likes to look forward rather than to
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:46.840]  look back okay so what will that cause we hope and we dearly hope that makes
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:51.560]  them complicit and that their courts get involved well yeah and so the Spanish
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:57.200]  Court just as they did by the way with the other torturer the guy from Chile
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:02.760]  you know Shay just as they do with him they have the option to proceed against
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:08.760]  George W. Bush for his for his war crimes according to the affidavit and the
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.280]  complaint that was given to the Geneva authorities and so that's why he he
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:19.160]  quit and the ones in the things that going forward in Spain are the lawyers
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:22.720]  that are said to have given this advice well we know they gave this advice to
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:26.040]  George Bush because that's what he wanted so the lawyers are not exempt
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:31.200]  they're all kinds of international ramifications here and it's a it's a
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.160]  good thing that finally somebody is taking international law seriously
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:42.320]  because Barack Obama and Eric Holder to my great disappointment I don't really
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:47.840]  care much about international law when it comes to prosecuting former official
[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.280]  well I mean the final equation regardless of what happens just as be
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.600]  done by the heavens fall we have to do the right thing and when crimes are
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:00.200]  committed by the highest office holder and his minions we at least need to
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:04.400]  point it out so that it's on record so that they don't create some type of
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:10.080]  precedent by our inaction I mean we are forced to morally stand up and point out
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:14.360]  what's happening here so at least the history books have the truth in it but
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.960]  as we've seen with many other dictators down the road we could actually see
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:21.880]  them you know getting in trouble for the crimes they've committed we certainly
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:26.680]  can't just give in and say well yeah they're the furor the furor precept and
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:31.960]  yeah Alex you mentioned two words that are really operative one is moral nobody
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:36.200]  talks about moral anymore but that's what's at stake here the soul of our
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:41.120]  nation and the fact that precedent will be said if we let a president get away
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:45.840]  with this and so you know we're trying from our end but the Swiss and the
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:54.000]  Spanish know that we're trying and it's up to them in a sense and they are you
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.200]  know they're under great pressure from the Attorney General in our country we
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:02.560]  know from the WikiLeaks cables how hard our administration the Obama
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.080]  administration has leaned on the Spanish on the Germans and on others not to
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:13.800]  prosecute known CIA people for example kidnapped al-Masri from from he's a
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.960]  German and other Spanish and they can get away with that the sky's the limit in
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:23.640]  closing on you know the similar area and I'm not just saying this I'm not
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.120]  exaggerating I was in this restaurant for 25 minutes with Carl Rove with him
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:34.800]  sitting right beside me you know three feet away and we had to get up and leave
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:37.840]  we were talking about confronting him but we're gonna wait till the end but
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:41.200]  we physically listening to it couldn't do it I know you've been in and around
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.520]  Washington worked in the White House as I wanted to ask you if you've ever been
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:49.600]  around Carl Rove because I'm not exaggerating he was with five people and
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:56.360]  he was gibbering and cackling like a witch almost incessantly and he I mean
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:59.800]  if I saw somebody to bus stop like this I think they were crazy I mean he came
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:06.120]  off like a textbook villain I mean it was in this I mean I have witnesses I
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:10.800]  have crew members that were there just all demonic laughter have you ever heard
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:16.320]  that about Carl Rove or Turd Blossom I haven't heard about the demonic laughter
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:21.520]  but I have seen the demonic activities that he's been guilty of you know I
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:25.800]  faced the situation with Rumsfeld Rumsfeld is coming to town next week
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.840]  to sell his book and I will go and confront him if I can
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.320]  certain my colleagues will do the same it's always a judgment call and you're
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.680]  a public figure and then you you have other considerations but or I have to
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:43.560]  been where are you in those situations I would have stood up and very politely
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:49.320]  said that Carl Rove we find you guilty of this that and the other thing and I
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:53.800]  can't sit next to you so it's either you and me you or me get out of here and
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.240]  I'm staying and see what happens and it would cause a row but you know that's
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:03.400]  what you're in Houston are you I know I'm in I'm in Austin Texas to be clear
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.840]  we got up and said we're not gonna sit basically in a restaurant with Hitler
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.920]  that guy's a war criminal and and left it's and I have confronted politicians
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:16.320]  and been arrested for just asking George Bush a question so I've I mean I
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:20.320]  confronted Janet Reno and countless others it's just that well plus Aaron
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:23.880]  Dykes who was with me was arrested about a year ago in Austin for asking him a
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:28.920]  question at the University of Texas and that case is still pending I mean that's
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:34.400]  probably why we didn't just really start screaming at him but you're right this
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:37.880]  guy's a war criminal and we probably should have gone further well it's a
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:41.720]  judgment call you may get another chance but for your listeners if they see
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.360]  Carl Rove around I hope that knowing what he's done that you don't sit around
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:51.680]  like those obedient Germans in the 30s and you confront them directly and say
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:55.160]  you know well we think you ought to be arrested and if you wait here for a
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:58.600]  second we'll get those ladies from Code Pink they have the handcuffs so good on
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.200]  to put them on you something like that because he should not be able to walk
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:07.520]  around freely given what he's guilty of I agree with you Ray McGovern thank you
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.800]  for spending time with us people can go of course to consortium news give us the
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:16.640]  URL where people can read your great writing first well it's consortium
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:26.320]  news comm c o n s o r t i u m news one word dot com and you'll see not only my
[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:31.400]  writings but those of Robert Perry who in my view is the best investigative
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.560]  reporter left in this country we'll have to get Robert on Ray talked to you
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:39.240]  again soon God bless you most welcome all right there goes Ray McGovern and he
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:42.920]  had a cancer that he beat a few years ago he just had a CAT scan a few days
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:47.160]  ago is going to get the results today of his lymphatic cancer let's pray for Ray
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:54.520]  McGovern that he continued to be in complete remission of his cancer let's
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:57.720]  also pray for Charlie Sheen because when I've known Charlie Sheen he's been a
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:02.440]  dignified guy never seen him drink or do anything but you know obviously Charlie
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:05.600]  is having some problems right now and I've been wanting to tell folks to
[02:43:05.600 --> 02:43:09.120]  certainly pray for Charlie Sheen and I never even talked about Aaron Zellman
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:13.440]  dying a month ago I should you eulogize him the head of Jews preservation of
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:17.840]  farms ownership I mentioned it but I've wanted to properly eulogize him we all
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:22.880]  need to pray for each other out there in this world okay pray for Rush Limbaugh
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:31.040]  to and his oxy cotton addictions I mean that seriously I'm gonna spend the
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:37.920]  balance of the broadcast now dealing with pole shift we live on an ever-changing
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:43.240]  world we're hit by comets were hit by asteroids solar flares NASA admits of a
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:47.480]  direct solar flare ever points towards the earth it will blow out all of the
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:51.400]  satellites that are on the Sunward side of the planet that will cause serious
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:56.960]  issues as we become more and more dependent on technology pole movements
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:02.960]  or huge pole shifts solar storms will affect us and the Sun is the biggest
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:09.200]  driver of climate and climatological change on this planet and Paul Joseph
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:13.600]  Watson has put together a detailed report we think is very important for
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:17.080]  everybody out there talking right now about pole shift and why are we talking
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:22.480]  about it now what we're talking about it now because for close to 80 years they've
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:29.040]  been studying the magnetic fields of the poles and the last 50 or so there's
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  been intense metering of them at stations around the globe and you could
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:40.920]  spend days trying to read all of the NASA reports scientific American reports
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:46.920]  the list goes on and on Fox News reports confirming that the pole is moving and
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:51.200]  is beginning to shift we don't know how much it's going to shift faster than
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.520]  it's ever has shifted since it's been recorded now that isn't as scary as it
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.440]  sounds it could be but we don't know because we don't know that it doesn't
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:04.160]  fluctuate every 50 or 100 or 75 years or randomly whenever the Sun goes through
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:09.920]  different permutations of cycles but if it shifted a few thousand miles
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:18.800]  cataclysmic oceans rising Texas could find itself where the North Pole is if
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:26.000]  there was a 3,000 mile shift if there was a 5,000 mile shift you know Texas
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:30.880]  could find itself you know basically where Japan is I mean it's unlimited and
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:37.120]  right now it's moving towards Russia and it is moving and I've all of the years
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:40.280]  aren't all these scientists and people saying it was gonna shift it was moving
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:44.040]  that and there's historians that have studied it and gone into the ancient
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:47.520]  text when things like this were reported we're going to start looking at it more
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.800]  because you know I only go off stuff I can prove and I don't want to get up here
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.480]  with old cataclysm and I remember back in 99 oh Planet X will be here next year
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.200]  and then it wasn't there and then it's gonna be there the next year and people
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:04.520]  attacked me for you know saying that I thought it was at certain levels of
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:09.480]  fraud are there other planets out on the Kuiper Belt undoubtedly they found
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:12.880]  hundreds of planetoids is bigger bigger than Pluto that's why they've
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:16.360]  delisted it as the ninth planet because you'd have to count all those others as
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:20.560]  planets in a way I tend to agree with that analysis because you know there's
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:28.200]  so many but but the thing is we don't know now they admit watching the
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:31.640]  shoemaker leavey comet that broke up and hit Saturn that we probably get hit
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:36.240]  every it could be six seven eight thousand years by giant asteroids they
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:39.560]  don't know but they know it's more often than they previously thought every
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:43.280]  million or so we might be able to do something about that with space-based
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:46.320]  weapons but then the globalist admit that they want to use it as a covered
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.720]  weaponized space then turn the weapons back on the earth but our technology
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:55.280]  lets us deal with that but our technology is not going to be able to deal in the
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:00.880]  foreseeable future I mean that's godlike power with the Sun and with its
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:04.080]  magnetic waves and if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv we'll put back on
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:09.000]  screen pull shift threatens to cause weather chaos and that's a we scroll
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:19.480]  down a bit a NASA graphic of the Sun and the magnetic waves of the earth up
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:25.400]  there at the top the photo graphic you can see basically the charted measured
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:31.400]  magnetic waves of the earth because the earth obviously is so massive it creates
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:35.400]  some gravitational system then you've got the Van Allen radiation belt and other
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:40.080]  things that protect us from solar radiation then you have on average in
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:45.240]  the atmosphere from the upper areas the atmosphere to sea level on average
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:50.720]  around 10 feet of water if you condensed all the all the water vapor down
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.000]  and on average it's about 10 feet there's several inches of rock in the
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.720]  atmosphere they condense all the rock dust and potash and volcanic ash and
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:03.960]  pollen and things that are in the atmosphere and in bugs bugs get blown
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:07.720]  up into the sky and they found frozen spiders and things that they've
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:10.720]  tested and they're thousands of years old that have been up there floating
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:14.960]  around so there's several inches of rock and other particular that also is a
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:22.360]  shield that the Sun has to shoot through so we have this article dealing with the
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:26.560]  full spectrum of what we know is happening right now and so yes it could
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:31.520]  be quite alarming I mean this could happen and it is moving now faster and
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:36.600]  faster pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos will paying billions of
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.520]  dollars in carbon taxes to Hal Gore and his cronies solve the problem because
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:43.920]  obviously they're saying all this weather and cold weather is global warming
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:48.960]  and magnetic pole changes are global warming and pay them taxes and it'll
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:56.080]  fix it and Paul Watson's article is very very important and I think
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:00.280]  everybody needs to see it again pole shift threatens to cause weather chaos
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:03.840]  according to some experts the world's weather is about to get even more
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:08.880]  chaotic as a result of natural climate change that we can do absolutely
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:13.280]  nothing about because again if the poles start moving more even if the earth
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:17.120]  doesn't change its physical orientation it will change the magnetic fields into
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:22.560]  the sun and radically change weather if the earth's actual axis changes which is
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:27.560]  connected to massive pole shifting you're talking cataclysm I mean you know
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:35.040]  you're talking biblical Armageddon type stuff and even though global warming
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:37.880]  alarmists may exploit the consequences to advance their own political agenda
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:41.440]  paying a carbon tax to Al Gore will not lessen the impact of a potentially
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.240]  catastrophic mega polar shift and again it's being driven predominantly scientists
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:55.560]  believe by the sun and in evidence I bring you some of the reports that I
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:04.880]  have here dealing with the pole shift information this is out of Salem dash
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:09.960]  news dot com magnetic polar shifts causing massive global super storms they
[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:13.600]  go back into that after the break here's Fox News magnetic north pole shifts
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:20.000]  forces runaway closures at Florida Airport again magnetic north pole shift
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:25.040]  forces runway closures at Florida Airport the planets northern magnetic pole is
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:28.760]  drifting slowly but steadily towards Russia and it's throwing off planes in
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:31.680]  Florida it had basically been in one spot moved a bit but now it's moving
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.640]  faster Tampa International Airport was forced to readjust its runways
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.360]  Thursday to account for the movement of the Earth's magnetic fields information
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:47.080]  and informing the pilots who rely upon to navigate their planes thanks to the
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:53.440]  fluctuations in the force the airport has closed its primary runway until
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  January 13th and this happened back in early January right when those birds
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:03.880]  died right back is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:08.380]  or attorneys 18 years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt
[02:51:08.380 --> 02:51:13.120]  free in just 90 days it's called zero debt in 90 days and it works for all
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:17.080]  credit card debt medical bills even collection lawsuits when I first joins
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:22.160]  I was being sued so I use the program methods and after filing one piece of
[02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:26.120]  paper the collection lawsuit was dismissed with zero debt in 90 days your
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:30.240]  success is guaranteed in writing there is no other program of its kind don't be

[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:11.880]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that will be
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:16.640]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home tremendous influence on
[02:52:16.640 --> 02:52:21.000]  our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:26.240]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:31.320]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:35.760]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:39.920]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:43.640]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does

[02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:09.080]  hour to continue getting into this because I promised I would but tomorrow we'll open
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:12.880]  the phones up dealing with it we're gonna get some guests lined up his listeners
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:17.080]  just keep wanting me to talk about this and in pointing it out and there is some
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:21.080]  serious changes happening with the earth's magnetic field at all the nukes
[02:54:21.080 --> 02:54:24.080]  they detonate in the upper atmosphere to that have an effect there's all the
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:28.080]  weather modification and harp have an effect and there's some serious changes
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:33.080]  in weather modification and harp have an effect well none of that has any power
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:38.080]  compared to the sun and we know the sun has been doing a lot of strange things
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:43.080]  in the last few years before I get back into that a few other news items
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:47.080]  yesterday I tried to call the number the public number for see something say
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:53.080]  something for homeland security and it just went to a voicemail boy the
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:56.080]  terrorists are supposedly everywhere and about to get us and we've all got to
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:02.080]  be safe but they're not answering the phone so I called the FBI in Dallas and
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:06.080]  I said that today I was planning to call a bunch of agencies live on air and bring
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:10.080]  up real evidence of terrorism being staged by elements of the government I will
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:13.080]  do that tomorrow the next day I've got to look at the schedule of guests and things
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:18.080]  but I'm gonna spend much of an hour calling and and and see something say
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.080]  something you know report on the criminality in government and that's what
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:29.080]  we are the answer to 1984 1776 video contest is about it'll be complete in a
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:34.080]  few weeks so be sure to make your videos or do your entries $10,000 prize by the
[02:55:34.080 --> 02:55:38.080]  way first place 7000 second place 2000 third place 1000 the V for victory
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.080]  campaign is separate incredibly success people are going wild with that having
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:46.080]  a huge effect pointing out that we're in a police state and that we don't like it
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:51.080]  and huge solidarity being caused by that and I got so focused on other issues I
[02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:54.080]  didn't really get into the big news of the White House responding to us on
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:59.080]  Friday with our report about globalist energy policy causing blackouts
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:04.080]  whenever we have peak consumption due to cold weather but obviously we'll be
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:08.080]  talking more about that as that story continues to unfold and I shot a video
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  that's got about 100,000 views on our YouTube channel 15 minutes long
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:17.080]  breaking that whole thing down it's called Alex Jones calls out Obama for
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:22.080]  treason and so I hope that everybody will get that video and send it on to
[02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:28.080]  others so they understand what treason is this is economic warfare against our
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:34.080]  country but the fact is they've had GPS for decades and haven't had on aircraft
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:37.080]  the publishers had it the last 10 years or so they haven't had to really change
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  them because of magnetic changes and that shows how much the pole has already
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:48.080]  moved and the last two years it's been accelerating in the north towards Russia
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:52.080]  there's also movement big movement the south and that is our shield our force
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:57:01.080]  field blocking out a lot of the sun's solar wind solar radiation and it is
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:08.080]  scary it is scary but the only thing that's constant is change there of course
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:13.080]  is the cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis is the conjecture that there have been
[02:57:13.080 --> 02:57:18.080]  rapid ships in the relative positions of the modern-day geographic locations of
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:22.080]  the poles and the axis of rotation of the earth yeah that's the big one and we
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:26.080]  physically change our orientation of the sun I mean the US could end up where
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:32.080]  Chile is or Chile could end up where Australia is that is the orientation of
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:36.080]  the sun I mean you name it it could happen and there's a lot of mainline scientists
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:39.080]  that say that this is the case there's not just little changes there's big ones
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:45.080]  but even a slight magnetic change again affects how the winds of the sun are
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:50.080]  hitting the earth not just the solar radiation but the overall you know
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:56.080]  magnetic winds such a dynamic change could create calamities such as floods
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:02.080]  and tectonic events earthquakes this type of event would occur in the physical
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:06.080]  poles had been or would be suddenly shifted with respect to the underlying
[02:58:06.080 --> 02:58:12.080]  surface over a geologically short time frame because the tectonic plates it's
[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:16.080]  not just the planet moving in its orientation of the sun it's the plates
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:23.080]  themselves floating around how fix the crust seven eight nine miles and the
[02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:29.080]  rest of it is molten rock I'm gonna come back and do five more minutes on this
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:33.080]  it it's clear I probably got to do a whole show just on this multiple shows
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:37.080]  and really burrow into it because something's happening the poles
[02:58:37.080 --> 02:58:41.080]  something's happening the earth's magnetic field stay with us
[02:58:41.080 --> 02:58:59.080]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live calm today a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:07.080]  he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family
[02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:12.080]  now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right
[02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:19.080]  you see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[02:59:19.080 --> 02:59:29.080]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:36.080]  I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:42.080]  you can take to protect yourself you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com
[02:59:42.080 --> 02:59:48.080]  that's end of America the number three dot com watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com
[02:59:48.080 --> 03:00:14.080]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:25.080]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen I'll continue breaking this down on the show tomorrow and a lot of other powerful and informative guests joining us throughout the week as well
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:33.080]  my writers Aaron Dykes Paul Watson Steve Watson Kurt Nemo and others are on fire
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:39.080]  Steve Watson has a big report at prisonplanet.com we'll make sure it gets up on infowars.com
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:47.080]  AOL and the Huffington Post team up to provide a perfect blend of sanitized news content and celebrity gossip slop
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:56.080]  anything of any worth is ignored or censored there's also the George Soros angle that he's hooked up with the Huffington Post
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:01:04.080]  now the Huffington Post is to run all of AOL's news the new editor of AOL News is Ariana Huffington
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:12.080]  so it's more of a merger not just a buy up of the Huffington Post for 315 mil so that report is up on prisonplanet.com
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:25.080]  good job Steve Watson on that report cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis and it goes on to say that scientists have found that in Earth's history
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:35.080]  that there is a quote polar wander of one degree per million years but but but you know they did say it was every million or so
[03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:42.080]  an asteroid hit us now they know it's every could be every few thousand every six thousand between approximately 790
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:51.080]  and 810 million years ago on the super continent Rodina existed to geographically rapid phases of true polar
[03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:59.080]  wander may have occurred in each of these the earth rotated 55 degrees that's massive again again this is just
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:05.080]  scientists thinking that this happens but this is respected I mean this is they admit that there's evidence of this going on
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:11.080]  but they're trying to say don't worry as 800 million years ago you know don't worry it was 200 million years ago
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:19.080]  the geographic poles the earth are the points on the surface of the planet that are intersected by the axis of rotation
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:26.080]  the pole shift hypothesis describes a change in the location of these poles with respect to the underlying surface phenomenon distinct
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:36.080]  from the changes in axial orientation with respect to the plane of the elliptic that are caused by the procession and movement
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:46.080]  so and you add all of that with government increase in monitoring of this and opening new facilities around the world to study it
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:55.080]  I've got a press release here by the British Geological Survey South Atlantic anomaly and South Georgia Magnetic Observatory
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:03:01.080]  and they're talking about all these new anomalies they're picking up and how they're building new facilities to track it
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:11.080]  something I'll get into tomorrow is out of NASA.gov we actually covered this when it came out in 2008
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:20.080]  but they've discovered that there are these magnetic pathways or portals where the magnetic fields of the sun on the earth
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:28.080]  are actually joining and creating types of magnetic wormholes where there's all different types of variants and connections
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:35.080]  really heavy stuff magnetic portals connect earth to the sun that's the NASA headline
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:43.080]  here's Scientific American satellites spy changes to earth's magnetic field
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:48.080]  and they say though the process can take nearly 5000 years the earth's magnetic field periodically reverses
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:55.080]  according to a report published today in Nature scientists may have detected the beginning of the fields next such reversal
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:04:04.080]  and that's when all the freak out started back in April 2002 that's where this article is from out of Scientific American
[03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:11.080]  and now here we are nine years later and it is accelerating its shift and so it could happen
[03:04:11.080 --> 03:04:18.080]  I mean it could happen and that could be why the globalists are gearing up so much of this police state stuff as well
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:23.080]  I mean I've always tried to poo poo 2012 and the rest of it but obviously this is going to have to be looked at
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:33.080]  but even if you don't get tectonic massive tectonic movement or a overall change in the earth's angulation to the sun
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:42.080]  there's the issue of the earth's magnetic field shifting in its orientation of the sun in massive weather shifts
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:52.080]  and that's what Paul Joseph Watson's article deals with in great detail and so I hope people will check out that article
[03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:56.080]  at PrismPlanet.com and get it out to everybody.
