[01:32.580 --> 01:38.780]  guest on the show okay let me go ahead and go through the news here
[01:38.780 --> 01:46.140]  financially remember the IMF and World Bank documents that were released in 2001
[01:46.140 --> 01:54.340]  when public 2002 Bilderberg moles that we have reported to us five years ago and
[01:54.340 --> 01:58.740]  then three years ago that the new world order was planning a controlled
[01:58.740 --> 02:05.580]  financial implosion for bank consolidation and to trick the American
[02:05.580 --> 02:09.940]  people the people of Europe and England as well as Australia and Japan the
[02:09.940 --> 02:16.820]  industrialized world into signing on in the name of a bailout but the bailout
[02:16.820 --> 02:21.860]  itself is a new financial order as the Wall Street Journal and as the Chinese
[02:21.860 --> 02:26.780]  government many others have been stating a new financial order is being born out
[02:26.780 --> 02:32.780]  of that and what you have is the Treasury Department becoming a giant hedge
[02:32.780 --> 02:39.660]  fund and being given total and complete
[02:42.060 --> 02:49.540]  basically godhood just no government is above it no government is equal no
[02:49.540 --> 02:57.300]  oversight no investigation no one is even allowed to look at what they are
[02:57.300 --> 03:07.020]  doing that is exactly what we are dealing with here now Sunday the Congress
[03:07.020 --> 03:12.780]  met in secret they've only done that what five times in the 230 plus year
[03:12.780 --> 03:17.700]  history now the Congress is meeting in secret every few weeks and then not even
[03:17.700 --> 03:23.660]  officially announcing it the five previous times it had of course been a
[03:23.660 --> 03:28.260]  big deal now they do it and it's just oh well that's what they do they meet in
[03:28.260 --> 03:40.780]  secret and now we have the financial plan that has been put forward and it
[03:40.780 --> 03:51.340]  clearly states clearly states that no investigation no guessing no second
[03:51.340 --> 04:00.660]  guessing no oversight of any type by Congress or anyone else any court in
[04:00.660 --> 04:05.780]  the land now I mean this is just tyranny on its face let me read to you
[04:05.780 --> 04:15.060]  section 8 of the quote bailout package decisions by the Secretary pursuant to
[04:15.060 --> 04:20.660]  the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency
[04:20.660 --> 04:25.620]  discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative
[04:25.620 --> 04:33.340]  agency no court of law no nothing this is above the law the very definition of
[04:33.340 --> 04:49.460]  hard core tyranny the very definition of extreme tyranny so we're going to break
[04:49.460 --> 04:55.300]  that down I mean no one can say however the course runs that it wasn't obvious
[04:55.300 --> 04:59.100]  that we weren't warned that we did that we weren't given a chance to say no to

[08:31.340 --> 08:37.900]  which is the greatest importance that we've ever covered
[08:37.900 --> 08:44.860]  here on the air in all my years on air before i get to that i would not be
[08:44.860 --> 08:49.020]  here today if things were not so important
[08:49.020 --> 08:52.540]  my uh children got a stomach bug this weekend and then my wife
[08:52.540 --> 08:58.620]  got it yesterday with all the that goes along with the stomach bug
[08:58.620 --> 09:03.500]  and i undoubtedly have it right now i am
[09:03.500 --> 09:09.260]  my mouth's watering and i am attempting to uh wait to vomit during the breaks
[09:09.260 --> 09:13.260]  but i am going to be on air today for the full four hours
[09:13.260 --> 09:16.940]  and i am going to be on coast to coast a m for three hours tonight
[09:16.940 --> 09:20.220]  if the hair lips the admiral of that's god's will and i'm sure i can handle it

[09:23.180 --> 09:26.780]  but uh if i hear me pause or if i have to
[09:26.780 --> 09:31.100]  go to music here and there during the show i will be
[09:31.100 --> 09:37.500]  doing that okay let me compose myself uh here for a moment
[09:37.500 --> 09:42.300]  and then launch into the news and information hold on one moment
[09:42.300 --> 09:46.460]  hmm
[09:47.420 --> 09:54.780]  all right this is a organized orchestrated
[09:54.780 --> 09:59.660]  implosion not just of the united states economy or the economy of north america
[09:59.660 --> 10:06.460]  but the economy on a planetary scale this is not our opinion
[10:06.460 --> 10:13.500]  this is admitted here are just some of the headlines
[10:14.140 --> 10:18.140]  the associated press has a paragraph in one of its articles
[10:18.140 --> 10:21.100]  white house admits it drew up bailout plans
[10:21.100 --> 10:26.540]  months ago abc news is also reporting that
[10:26.540 --> 10:30.540]  we always hear no one could have seen this or heard of this coming
[10:30.540 --> 10:34.220]  well actually the white house has admitted they drew up the bailout plan
[10:34.220 --> 10:37.740]  months ago white house deputy press secretary
[10:37.740 --> 10:41.900]  insisted that the plan was not slapped together and had been drawn up as a
[10:41.900 --> 10:46.620]  contingency over previous months and weeks by administration officials
[10:46.620 --> 10:49.980]  acknowledged lawmakers were getting only days to
[10:49.980 --> 10:54.460]  pursue it but he said this should be enough but the government did nothing
[10:54.460 --> 10:57.580]  real to prevent the financial meltdown instead it let the meltdown happen
[10:57.580 --> 11:01.420]  and is now trying to ram through a terrible counterproductive legislation
[11:01.420 --> 11:06.860]  drafted previously by other fear tactics
[11:06.860 --> 11:11.180]  here is another one nice condensed story here of the wall street journal and
[11:11.180 --> 11:15.180]  Reuters my george washington blog spot it's up on info wars.com
[11:15.180 --> 11:18.940]  Bernanke admits bailout is not aimed at helping taxpayers
[11:18.940 --> 11:22.620]  apologists for the bailout plans say that it will have a
[11:22.620 --> 11:25.980]  trickle down to benefit for taxpayers but this is the testimony to the senate
[11:25.980 --> 11:29.100]  today Bernanke pretty much admitted the bailout isn't aimed at helping
[11:29.100 --> 11:32.860]  taxpayers specifically as the wall street journal summarizes Bernanke
[11:32.860 --> 11:37.580]  used his time to argue for not buying assets at fire cell prices in the
[11:37.580 --> 11:42.060]  treasury 700 billion bailout proposal mr. Bernanke said the treasury plan
[11:42.060 --> 11:45.980]  should have taxpayers buy the assets and hold them at close
[11:45.980 --> 11:49.900]  to their maturity value removing the assets he said would bring liquidity
[11:49.900 --> 11:53.820]  back to markets unfreezing credit markets reduce uncertainty and allow
[11:53.820 --> 11:58.460]  banks to attract private capital as Reuters has the transcript
[11:58.460 --> 12:02.700]  he goes over that says we cannot impose punitive measures on institutions that
[12:02.700 --> 12:05.260]  chose to sell the assets still he acknowledged
[12:05.260 --> 12:10.140]  that the precise approach of doing so hadn't been determined
[12:10.140 --> 12:14.940]  now again the dirty seeker of the bailout 32 words that none dare utter
[12:14.940 --> 12:18.620]  decision by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act
[12:18.620 --> 12:24.940]  are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion and may not be
[12:24.940 --> 12:29.500]  reviewed by any court or law or administrative agency
[12:30.700 --> 12:34.700]  notice the last of the big brokerage firm standing is goldman sacks these are
[12:34.700 --> 12:38.140]  just fronts or cutouts receivership
[12:38.140 --> 12:42.540]  windows to carry out the criminal activities where does polson come from
[12:42.540 --> 12:46.060]  secretary of the treasury former head of goldman sacks
[12:46.060 --> 12:48.860]  where do you see the japanese and the chinese and the arab's dumping their
[12:48.860 --> 12:53.340]  money now where do you see warren buffet dumping
[12:53.340 --> 12:57.020]  five billion yesterday in goldman sacks
[12:57.020 --> 13:00.940]  it clearly is going to be the only one left standing in this
[13:00.940 --> 13:04.220]  while the real assets and the bailout money is
[13:04.220 --> 13:08.060]  fenced through these institutions and then used
[13:08.060 --> 13:11.740]  to be leveraged against other corporations and the real economy to
[13:11.740 --> 13:16.380]  further consolidate those criminally
[13:16.380 --> 13:23.740]  here's another one goldman sacks and morgan stanley may look to buy regional
[13:23.740 --> 13:27.420]  banks see snatching up fake that you have the former head of
[13:27.420 --> 13:29.980]  goldens golden sacks is the treasury secretary
[13:29.980 --> 13:33.820]  carrying out the private fed operations for the private shareholders
[13:33.820 --> 13:37.100]  then they control the federal regulators that go and shut down
[13:37.100 --> 13:41.100]  and consolidate and take over what banks they want they go in and grab them and
[13:41.100 --> 13:46.540]  then hand them to private interest and then buy up whatever assets are there
[13:46.540 --> 13:49.900]  with us tax money and then hand the assets to private
[13:49.900 --> 13:53.820]  interest do you understand how big a criminal operation this is
[13:53.820 --> 13:59.340]  and if you don't like it north com army brigades are standing by army times
[13:59.340 --> 14:03.100]  congress doesn't like it the troops will move
[14:03.100 --> 14:07.180]  if the troops don't follow orders the black op operations will detonate
[14:07.180 --> 14:11.660]  neutron bombs in dc in new york and say al qaeda did it
[14:11.660 --> 14:14.700]  now if you know how to read the army reports and the british reports and the
[14:14.700 --> 14:18.940]  think tank reports they have told the world that's what they'll do
[14:18.940 --> 14:22.940]  they say oh if people rebel and take over capitals we'll use neutron bombs on
[14:22.940 --> 14:26.300]  them we've got a gun up against our head they're
[14:26.300 --> 14:33.100]  robbing your pension funds your future your currency and if that isn't enough
[14:33.180 --> 14:36.860]  they're saying you have to pay the taxes on the inflation of the money down the
[14:36.860 --> 14:40.860]  road meanwhile you hear the domesticated
[14:40.860 --> 14:44.620]  public on talk radio and on tv news shows saying well we we don't like the
[14:44.620 --> 14:47.900]  bill and that we have to to save the economy
[14:47.900 --> 14:54.700]  this is the organized destruction of the economy
[14:58.380 --> 15:04.940]  stocks fall and failed to sustain advance on buffett goldman stocks unable
[15:04.940 --> 15:08.060]  to sustain gain on buffett five billion investment
[15:08.060 --> 15:12.140]  markets uneasy over bailout that's the plan is to blow them out so they can
[15:12.140 --> 15:17.740]  have a fire sale it's what this is this is a fire sale
[15:19.100 --> 15:23.420]  here's another one this is the philadelphia news philadelphia inquire
[15:23.420 --> 15:27.740]  secretary paulson taxpayer hedge fund that's not alex jones saying that
[15:27.740 --> 15:33.820]  last week and monday and all our guests that's even mainstream news saying
[15:33.820 --> 15:37.340]  look to put it in layman's terms
[15:37.340 --> 15:44.620]  they are allowing select last man standing hedge funds
[15:44.620 --> 15:49.180]  like goldman sacks and maybe morgan stanley to where they can engage in
[15:49.180 --> 15:52.620]  short selling naked shorting they can engage in every criminal activity
[15:52.620 --> 15:56.140]  openly that's openly illegal but they openly engage in it no one else is
[15:56.140 --> 16:01.020]  allowed to and they're given unlimited capital from the treasury to do it
[16:01.020 --> 16:04.380]  just this is worse than bank robbery this is just
[16:04.380 --> 16:07.900]  just absolute criminality times a billion
[16:07.900 --> 16:11.180]  it is nothing ever has even come close to this
[16:11.180 --> 16:15.340]  this is just and again army brigades are standing by
[16:15.340 --> 16:19.420]  if you don't like it this and the police and military
[16:19.420 --> 16:23.980]  are not bad people on average they don't know they're compartmentalized
[16:23.980 --> 16:27.260]  the average stockbroker the average banker doesn't even understand this
[16:27.260 --> 16:30.220]  because these are low-level compartmentalized individuals
[16:30.220 --> 16:34.380]  that's how our society is designed it's so complex that no one
[16:34.380 --> 16:37.020]  can be an expert in every area or even a couple areas
[16:37.020 --> 16:41.020]  it's it's it's general knowledge you need to get and get quickly police and
[16:41.020 --> 16:44.300]  military to understand what's happening here
[16:44.300 --> 16:47.260]  if you don't understand let me just read to you again
[16:47.260 --> 16:51.420]  from section eight of the bank robbery bill the
[16:51.420 --> 16:55.420]  the legalized complete looting of everything decisions by the secretary
[16:55.420 --> 16:59.580]  pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable
[16:59.580 --> 17:03.660]  and committed to agency discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law
[17:03.660 --> 17:08.220]  or any administrative agency that's pdd-51 being implemented
[17:08.220 --> 17:11.340]  through the financial structure and that's what pd-51 states
[17:11.340 --> 17:14.540]  military terrorist financial or any other crisis
[17:14.540 --> 17:18.700]  the security council the president homeland security the treasury
[17:18.700 --> 17:23.420]  they can do whatever they want including arresting citizens secretly
[17:23.420 --> 17:29.100]  torturing citizens secretly even if the army tribunals find you not

[33:35.580 --> 33:45.580]  and
[33:55.100 --> 34:01.580]  back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us Anthony J. Helder
[34:01.580 --> 34:06.220]  see me with us in about 27 minutes
[34:11.020 --> 34:16.700]  John Eminem takes some calls on the economy and the news we're covering
[34:16.700 --> 34:22.380]  before he joins us so i'm gonna launch my I am down here in Texas you can
[34:22.380 --> 34:32.300]  fill it up with folks 1-800-259-92-31
[34:32.300 --> 34:39.660]  okay let me run through the news I started in on the financial information
[34:42.540 --> 34:48.700]  by the way I forgot to do this I had a
[34:48.700 --> 34:55.500]  financial expert last night a legal expert on finances
[34:55.500 --> 34:59.420]  doing analysis of that bill I mean I've done my own
[34:59.420 --> 35:05.020]  but he sent it this morning to Trey Bob and I forgot to tell Trey to print that
[35:05.020 --> 35:09.260]  in his email will you go get him to print the email on the bailout analysis
[35:09.260 --> 35:13.260]  that I had separately done because I wanted to make sure
[35:13.260 --> 35:21.100]  of this so I had a one of our advisors
[35:21.660 --> 35:26.620]  do their own analysis of it and I wanted to go over that
[35:26.620 --> 35:32.620]  section by section just the particular
[35:33.820 --> 35:40.700]  section alone that I keep going over is decisions by the secretary pursuant
[35:40.700 --> 35:45.100]  to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency
[35:45.100 --> 35:50.380]  discretion and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any
[35:50.380 --> 35:56.700]  administrative agency which is the most extreme financial
[35:56.700 --> 36:01.660]  tyranny imaginable
[36:02.380 --> 36:07.580]  it's not even a conflict of interest it's it's far worse than that it is
[36:07.580 --> 36:11.420]  criminal to have the former head
[36:13.260 --> 36:16.700]  of Goldman Sachs
[36:18.940 --> 36:24.540]  sitting in the office of the secretary of the treasury
[36:26.780 --> 36:31.100]  piping hundreds of billions of dollars into his own company in front of
[36:31.100 --> 36:36.060]  everyone but that itself
[36:36.060 --> 36:40.540]  pales in significance to the fact that selectively
[36:40.540 --> 36:44.620]  hedge funds banks and financial institutions
[36:44.620 --> 36:49.420]  are under his regulatory control
[36:50.460 --> 36:55.740]  and the treasury along with the private federal reserve working in tandem
[36:55.740 --> 37:02.300]  are deciding on what banks are bought what their supposed assets are worth
[37:02.300 --> 37:07.260]  who the banks are handed over to they are handing the banks
[37:07.260 --> 37:11.020]  in brokerage firms over to other banks in brokerage firms the
[37:11.020 --> 37:15.740]  top tier there's only about five of them
[37:17.020 --> 37:20.620]  there are no books no investigations no transparency
[37:20.620 --> 37:25.420]  no federal agencies involved no state agencies in fact they're saying in this
[37:25.420 --> 37:29.980]  bailout the scam amount the scam out is a
[37:29.980 --> 37:34.060]  better word for this total looting that no one can even look at
[37:34.060 --> 37:38.940]  so in secret under a national security envelope
[37:38.940 --> 37:46.060]  the secretary of the treasury can send regulators in to claim that banks are
[37:46.060 --> 37:49.420]  bankrupt or defunct or have engaged in
[37:49.420 --> 37:57.020]  activities that are violations of law selectively and then hand them over
[37:57.020 --> 38:02.380]  to the allied crime syndicate so this is the international banking cartel
[38:02.380 --> 38:07.500]  eating all the other banks in brokerage firms
[38:07.500 --> 38:12.700]  and then while that is going on palston says internationally
[38:12.700 --> 38:17.980]  not just us best of base banks or us subsidiaries of international banks
[38:17.980 --> 38:20.860]  but any banking institution any brokerage firm
[38:20.860 --> 38:24.860]  in the world you hear quote we'll bail them out
[38:24.860 --> 38:29.820]  what that really means is we will go and pay off their executives
[38:29.820 --> 38:33.100]  pay off their board of directors pay off their chairman
[38:33.100 --> 38:36.540]  pay off their ceo's
[38:37.100 --> 38:42.060]  to roll their institutions under this larger umbrella
[38:42.060 --> 38:46.620]  and they're calling it a new world order international
[38:46.620 --> 38:51.260]  system that is emerging and it's been called that in
[38:51.260 --> 38:56.540]  hundreds of different publications this is not alex
[38:56.540 --> 39:00.060]  jones getting on the air and telling you this this is in
[39:00.060 --> 39:04.380]  the philadelphia news this is in the associated press
[39:04.380 --> 39:09.740]  this is on bloomberg saying the president has dictatorial banking power
[39:09.740 --> 39:13.900]  they just announce it like it's no big deal
[39:14.940 --> 39:19.100]  so with your money you're pledged to pay it
[39:19.100 --> 39:22.540]  you're not bailing out banks so the economy doesn't go under
[39:22.540 --> 39:27.500]  this is the economy going under they are pushing the economy under
[39:27.500 --> 39:30.620]  they've done everything they can remember two and a half years ago
[39:30.620 --> 39:33.420]  after bill de berg said pop the real estate bubble
[39:33.420 --> 39:38.460]  to create a consolidation how suddenly they came out in bad bounty economy
[39:38.460 --> 39:42.700]  and everything they could to drive down the dollar and lower the interest rates
[39:42.700 --> 39:49.820]  so that international bodies would start dumping the dollar
[39:49.900 --> 39:52.860]  and then as soon as they started pushing it under they said okay now it's
[39:52.860 --> 39:55.820]  sliding too fast we want to control the implosion as the
[39:55.820 --> 39:58.940]  financial times of london reported almost two years ago
[39:58.940 --> 40:02.700]  this is too fast so they're gauging it they're governing it
[40:02.700 --> 40:07.580]  they're they they they they throttle they throttle the economy down
[40:07.580 --> 40:11.100]  if it looks like it might try to burst out of this controlled
[40:11.100 --> 40:16.140]  implosion and if it looks like it's imploding too fast they
[40:16.140 --> 40:20.700]  pump it back up this is a virtuoso this is a
[40:20.700 --> 40:26.060]  a master conductor with thousands of instruments and a huge symphony of
[40:26.060 --> 40:31.900]  economic annihilation a symphony of destruction
[40:31.900 --> 40:35.820]  with pulsing and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers
[40:35.820 --> 40:41.020]  up there carrying this out with precision this isn't
[40:41.020 --> 40:48.060]  mismanagement if three black vans pull up in front of a bank
[40:48.060 --> 40:52.060]  and pile in with men wearing black mask and submachine guns
[40:52.060 --> 40:55.180]  and with precision shut off the electronic alarm and
[40:55.180 --> 40:59.100]  put duct tape on everybody's mouths and shove them down on the floor and
[40:59.100 --> 41:02.700]  go up with the codes to the vault and punch it in and go in and steal the
[41:02.700 --> 41:06.380]  gold and the silver and the diamonds and the cash
[41:06.380 --> 41:09.580]  that's not mismanagement that is a precision
[41:09.580 --> 41:12.140]  robbery
[41:14.300 --> 41:19.820]  but it's done by old men in suits on tv
[41:21.420 --> 41:24.780]  completely steely eyed totally focused when you watch them
[41:24.780 --> 41:28.700]  before congress or on television putting out their party line
[41:28.700 --> 41:32.620]  and you notice the party lines what's scary they're not even really lying
[41:32.620 --> 41:35.340]  they're saying no this is to help wall street
[41:35.340 --> 41:39.020]  no this is to help the consolidation no this is to shore things up
[41:39.020 --> 41:43.580]  in a crisis they created and to them there will be peace
[41:43.580 --> 41:48.140]  when they own and run everything and when the world population's been
[41:48.140 --> 41:51.660]  totally shackled and put into a worldwide casual society
[41:51.660 --> 41:56.860]  world id system there will be peace
[41:56.860 --> 42:00.300]  kind of like the peace after a battlefield when it's strewn with dead
[42:00.300 --> 42:05.740]  oh there is peace with the carrion birds circling overhead
[42:10.380 --> 42:15.500]  so this multifaceted implosion by design of the economy
[42:15.500 --> 42:20.620]  and the criminal consolidation is in
[42:21.500 --> 42:24.140]  full swing
[42:25.260 --> 42:29.340]  this is from one of my legal sources who wishes to not be named in this
[42:29.340 --> 42:32.460]  particular analysis there alex there are four
[42:32.460 --> 42:35.580]  owners and unparalleled aspects of the bailout and again
[42:35.580 --> 42:39.420]  everything that's in here is in the articles one is it is exempt from
[42:39.420 --> 42:44.060]  sunset laws it will never go away two it is hugely broad and it covers all
[42:44.060 --> 42:46.700]  institutions
[42:47.820 --> 42:50.940]  three it allows the dollar amount of purchase at any one time
[42:50.940 --> 42:55.260]  which is essentially a blank check for buying all the commercial paper
[42:55.260 --> 42:58.940]  touching on a mortgage or bank or any other security that will ever exist in
[42:58.940 --> 43:03.180]  the world as i read it it entirely removes
[43:03.180 --> 43:07.820]  any monetary limit from the capacity of the secretary
[43:07.820 --> 43:12.380]  to buy securities lash it allows the secretary to sell any asset
[43:12.380 --> 43:15.820]  purchased and use the funds for operations indefinitely
[43:15.820 --> 43:19.740]  this removes the treasury from any shade of congressional oversight
[43:19.740 --> 43:22.940]  and that the treasury will no longer depend on congressional
[43:22.940 --> 43:26.780]  appropriations to function see it's setting up it's the fellow reserve
[43:26.780 --> 43:29.420]  getting rid of the treasuries basically what's happening
[43:29.420 --> 43:33.980]  i believe that what this bailout really does is cover the hot checks the
[43:33.980 --> 43:37.020]  current administration has written and provides a new funding mechanism
[43:37.020 --> 43:39.900]  to supplement and eventually replace the irs code
[43:39.900 --> 43:43.500]  this bill could ultimately give the treasury the power to season sell all
[43:43.500 --> 43:47.820]  our homes to cover banking failures or any other assets for that matter
[43:47.820 --> 43:51.020]  that's exactly what it is and read the presidential
[43:51.020 --> 43:55.260]  executive order is going back about seizing land work brigades
[43:55.260 --> 43:59.580]  we need a master rosetta stone article that goes through all these bullet
[43:59.580 --> 44:03.420]  points see here's what's happening
[44:03.420 --> 44:06.940]  the private federal reserve has taken full control of the treasury through the
[44:06.940 --> 44:10.300]  executive and now congress about to pass this bailout
[44:10.300 --> 44:14.220]  at least on paper you know they it's already going on but but but but they
[44:14.220 --> 44:18.620]  are certifying it giving it some you know legalistic cover at least on the
[44:18.620 --> 44:21.340]  surface
[44:21.340 --> 44:24.940]  and they are going out with naked shorts with shorts
[44:24.940 --> 44:28.780]  they only ban that against their institutions which is already over
[44:28.780 --> 44:32.380]  third of the quote us economy and then they've created
[44:32.380 --> 44:38.780]  over a quadrillion or a thousand trillion hundreds of times more than all
[44:38.780 --> 44:43.020]  the assets in the world and so now they need to somehow
[44:43.020 --> 44:45.740]  trick the congress and the public that it's a bailout when all they're getting
[44:45.740 --> 44:50.540]  us to contractually at least verbally to agree to
[44:50.540 --> 44:56.700]  is to be bound to this and to have to pay on it and so this is debt serfdom
[44:56.700 --> 45:01.340]  that is being engineered and and and so the banks the the the private central
[45:01.340 --> 45:04.540]  coterie or or or enter sanctum in the new world order
[45:04.540 --> 45:07.180]  is waging war against any banks they don't own or control
[45:07.180 --> 45:10.620]  brokerage firms consolidating them all regional banks other international
[45:10.620 --> 45:15.340]  banking syndicates that were smaller
[45:15.340 --> 45:18.860]  they are attacking the real economy thousands of real corporations that are
[45:18.860 --> 45:22.220]  traded on the stock exchanges they're hammering them down right now with
[45:22.220 --> 45:26.620]  unlimited capital snatching them up this is a giant blob
[45:26.620 --> 45:29.740]  absorbing everything in its path everything we said they were gearing up
[45:29.740 --> 45:36.540]  to do what the imf and world bank documents state they were doing
[45:36.540 --> 45:41.020]  this has nothing to do with the mortgages that is only the surface
[45:41.020 --> 45:44.060]  reason to implement this as we told you almost three years ago
[45:44.060 --> 45:47.660]  that they would use that as the cover for the implosion
[45:47.660 --> 45:52.300]  and then blame it on the american people
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.340]  we're going to be blamed for the terror attacks that our criminal government
[45:55.340 --> 45:57.260]  launched it's going to be brought out internationally
[45:57.260 --> 46:01.180]  and it is british italian russian japanese tv
[46:01.180 --> 46:04.140]  it's going to be brought out that our government ordered the rape of children
[46:04.140 --> 46:08.540]  in front of their parents as is now declassified by the government itself
[46:08.540 --> 46:13.100]  when they won't declassify anything else they want to classify 50-year-old stuff
[46:13.100 --> 46:17.660]  but they'll release what they want we're going to be blamed for the economic
[46:17.660 --> 46:21.180]  implosion everything bush the little puppets going to be
[46:21.180 --> 46:24.140]  blamed cheney why do you think they're buying
[46:24.140 --> 46:28.140]  ranches in perigway and lavish homes and armored compound citadels
[46:28.140 --> 46:33.980]  in dubai and switzerland they're leaving the money all left two years ago
[46:33.980 --> 46:39.420]  cheney dumped all his dollars and his us assets two and a half years ago
[46:39.420 --> 46:44.460]  warren buffett dumped it years ago they're leaving
[46:44.460 --> 46:49.420]  they're burning us down all these fools drive around with american flags on
[46:49.420 --> 46:52.540]  their car listening to the heroin head rush limbaugh
[46:52.540 --> 46:58.060]  thinking he's conservative if he's conservative so is linen
[46:59.580 --> 47:04.060]  you got suckered and you got suckered good and i'm telling you you can still
[47:04.060 --> 47:07.660]  turn some of this around you have a lot of you fake conservatives will just
[47:07.660 --> 47:12.220]  grow up and if you fake liberals again you're
[47:12.220 --> 47:15.180]  not even what you believe you are we'll just grow up
[47:15.180 --> 47:18.860]  we could turn a lot of this around
[47:22.460 --> 47:25.420]  it really is a shame
[47:28.060 --> 47:31.900]  and there is such denial out there
[47:31.900 --> 47:37.580]  such unparalleled unprecedented denial last thursday
[47:37.580 --> 47:41.580]  or eight seven days ago
[47:45.180 --> 47:50.540]  the army times came out not with a bang but with a whimper
[47:50.540 --> 47:54.060]  and just said yeah they're going to rotate through combat brigades
[47:54.060 --> 47:58.620]  and train them basically for martial law civil insurrection
[47:58.620 --> 48:03.580]  rioting in the united states and deploy them in the us
[48:03.580 --> 48:06.860]  and it says that in there and north com stated that and that's in the john
[48:06.860 --> 48:11.260]  warner defense authorization act what do people go into that article on info
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.140]  wars dot com that we've reposted and what do they say
[48:16.140 --> 48:20.220]  what do they say about the article that paul watson wrote today
[48:20.220 --> 48:25.500]  us troops in homeland crowd control patrols from october first
[48:25.500 --> 48:30.220]  they go in there and they say hey this is just training
[48:31.420 --> 48:36.220]  i guess weiko was training i guess uh in new york city when
[48:36.220 --> 48:39.740]  troops come up and yell and scream at you at me on video and tell me not to
[48:39.740 --> 48:43.420]  videotape in america that that's just training them cussing at me in my
[48:43.420 --> 48:46.540]  face i guess it's just training when john
[48:46.540 --> 48:50.540]  warner defense authorization act says martial law says
[48:50.540 --> 48:55.820]  if the feds take over the governors and deal with insurrection
[48:55.820 --> 48:59.740]  i guess troops coming up to me in uh central texas
[48:59.740 --> 49:03.180]  running checkpoints on the side of the road saying turn your cameras off
[49:03.180 --> 49:08.140]  i guess that didn't real either huh or the marines in the mid eighties
[49:08.140 --> 49:12.780]  raiding gun shops in virginia secretly you mean that whole giant block up you
[49:12.780 --> 49:15.180]  mean you mean that's training is that what that is
[49:15.180 --> 49:20.620]  is this looting the treasury is that training
[49:20.620 --> 49:25.260]  is uh the cia opening public offices in every major city is that just training
[49:25.260 --> 49:29.900]  are the face scanning cameras are those just training
[49:29.900 --> 49:33.660]  are the infrared cameras they're putting up that face scan you just like they
[49:33.660 --> 49:36.540]  put up in iraq so you can be killed from the air
[49:36.540 --> 49:40.060]  is that just training is this whole control grid they put in
[49:40.060 --> 49:43.020]  and these thumb scanners to buy and sell that are going in all over the place
[49:43.020 --> 49:45.980]  at grocery stores and churches and malls and
[49:45.980 --> 49:51.420]  bookstores is that for training our cops crawling out of our ears is that
[49:51.420 --> 49:56.540]  for training stop living in denial little boys
[49:56.540 --> 50:00.860]  this isn't a drill this isn't an exercise
[50:01.420 --> 50:05.340]  any more than the georgians running drills with the u.s and israel
[50:05.340 --> 50:11.180]  the week before they struck south of setia was that just training
[50:11.180 --> 50:16.780]  this is it ladies and gentlemen this is it
[50:19.020 --> 50:21.580]  and when the troops are rolling down your streets of there's rioting and

[55:26.620 --> 55:31.580]  the next child born was under death sentence now think about what that means
[55:31.580 --> 55:35.820]  if some kid in bangladesh no judge no jury
[55:35.820 --> 55:39.900]  or guilt they're under a death sentence under our
[55:39.900 --> 55:43.420]  system of law we have to have uh... at least
[55:43.420 --> 55:48.460]  a hearing a trial presenting of evidence but kind of telephone or you know and
[55:48.460 --> 55:51.740]  what kind of telephone are you on uh... it's on the sky
[55:51.740 --> 55:57.100]  man it's bad sorry about that but i just wanted to warn just like you've been
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.820]  trying to warn all those who think they are good
[55:59.820 --> 56:02.780]  are they any better than an innocent child that
[56:02.780 --> 56:08.140]  is under that death that's right the united nations and the world bank and
[56:08.140 --> 56:11.900]  the bill melinda gates foundation all these eugenics organizations
[56:11.900 --> 56:15.900]  are just out there engaging in just unbelievable stuff
[56:15.900 --> 56:19.180]  and uh... i'll just remind the police and military
[56:19.180 --> 56:22.860]  the criminals around our government put deadly poison your water supply to and
[56:22.860 --> 56:26.140]  call it fluoride it's a cocktail of things and
[56:26.140 --> 56:29.500]  there's no doubt it's poisonous and there's no doubt they put it in there on
[56:29.500 --> 56:31.820]  purpose i mean that's what i mean it's just
[56:31.820 --> 56:37.100]  it's crazy well let's not lose our morality
[56:37.100 --> 56:41.980]  not for money or anything i hear you man i really appreciate your call joe
[56:41.980 --> 56:46.060]  let's talk to scott in arizona scott you're on the air
[56:46.060 --> 56:49.260]  hey alex how are you today oh i'm really great
[56:49.260 --> 56:52.620]  hey i just wanted to call in there i really enjoyed uh... having uh...
[56:52.620 --> 56:56.140]  steve quill hearing that on there yesterday he was great to hear him
[56:56.140 --> 57:00.060]  i really believe that he's on the something there i think that uh...
[57:00.060 --> 57:03.420]  i always felt it in my gut you always talk about how your gut is what you
[57:03.420 --> 57:06.140]  should listen to i fill up my gut that's something
[57:06.140 --> 57:08.380]  you know it's going to happen this year i just
[57:08.380 --> 57:10.780]  have a hard time let you know they're trying to move at the heat of the
[57:10.780 --> 57:13.260]  moment and if they let something cool down and
[57:13.260 --> 57:16.060]  you build back up and they got something moving right now and they're
[57:16.060 --> 57:19.980]  and they're favor so i just think that they're going to keep moving that way
[57:19.980 --> 57:22.860]  well you know instead of starting stopping
[57:22.860 --> 57:25.420]  so i think that is something that's going to happen before the end of the
[57:25.420 --> 57:29.020]  year and the other thing is uh... i hear that you know when they had that last
[57:29.020 --> 57:32.780]  uh... money that they gave everybody those checks that we brought from china
[57:32.780 --> 57:36.060]  on that and the other thing is uh... i heard that were
[57:36.060 --> 57:39.100]  now if we go into seven hundred billion bill out which we know it won't even
[57:39.100 --> 57:41.900]  cover anything i heard that they're gonna start leveraging
[57:41.900 --> 57:44.940]  like their four spaces and all kinds of our
[57:44.940 --> 57:48.860]  our uh... that was always the plan to go into receivership that the new york
[57:48.860 --> 57:52.860]  times are saying that cities are going to be handed over to private interest
[57:52.860 --> 57:56.060]  now remember the private interest engineer this
[57:56.060 --> 57:59.500]  they engineer the crisis and it's definitely done by design but even if
[57:59.500 --> 58:03.180]  people don't believe that it's admitted that they created it
[58:03.180 --> 58:07.580]  and then they get to be in the catbird seat and run the next phase and then
[58:07.580 --> 58:13.820]  it's just going to get worse and worse and worse
[58:13.820 --> 58:17.340]  yep that's exactly what i feel i think that steve quill though i really i'm
[58:17.340 --> 58:20.300]  glad you had him on the show i really feel that he uh...
[58:20.300 --> 58:23.820]  he's got something he i mean i believe that he's right on on that
[58:23.820 --> 58:26.380]  well i agree with steven about ninety five percent of what he says you know he
[58:26.380 --> 58:29.660]  goes that extra five percent into some things that uh... i can't prove one
[58:29.660 --> 58:32.060]  way or the other and i just i just stick with what i can
[58:32.060 --> 58:34.940]  deal with but it was a very interesting radio interview we appreciate him
[58:34.940 --> 58:37.500]  joining us we'll be right back with bill richard

[1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:41.420]  they'll work for a fraction and it will implode the economy and they keep well
[1:03:41.420 --> 1:03:44.620]  that's good for the economy oh yeah we're finding out how good it is now
[1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:47.740]  well nafta and gat destroy things they say don't worry it'll get better
[1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:50.380]  but everything they tell us to do is poison
[1:03:50.380 --> 1:03:54.060]  i you know we hear all this stuff about american workers were concerned about
[1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:57.500]  your wages your jobs and just look what they do

[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:19.900]  and i started telling people when i've read a couple books on the federal
[1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:23.660]  reserve and they thought i was crazy about a quarter of those people have now
[1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:27.420]  come to me in the last year and they are absolutely freaking out
[1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:29.980]  well they're gonna get really freaked out when they shove a gun in the back of
[1:04:29.980 --> 1:04:33.180]  their head and blow their head off right right before they kill their child in
[1:04:33.180 --> 1:04:36.620]  front of them well i think well i think they're starting
[1:04:36.620 --> 1:04:41.020]  to uh prepare for what's coming our way hopefully well i'm not kidding the people

[1:08:45.900 --> 1:08:50.460]  in texas about how the fbi either runs former fbi agents or

[1:08:56.380 --> 1:09:00.860]  in the united states but that's that's only one part of the covert operation
[1:09:00.860 --> 1:09:06.380]  covertly funded now going back 25 years it's now just bags of cash with special
[1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:10.380]  forces they have the army do it and we've had a police chief san antonio on
[1:09:10.380 --> 1:09:13.260]  how they tried to buy him i've interviewed other police chiefs
[1:09:13.260 --> 1:09:17.580]  this was going on hard and heavy over 10 years ago
[1:09:17.580 --> 1:09:22.060]  so you know i'd buy by ran into all this started in long investigation i've
[1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:24.380]  you know freaked out yellow and screamed on air

[1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:30.220]  their goal and then even worse stuff comes after that
[1:09:30.220 --> 1:09:34.140]  i mean here's the deal folks it's going to get real bad things are wonderful
[1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:37.020]  right now compared to what they're going to be
[1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:40.300]  you're not going to have the internet like you have it now i'm not probably
[1:09:40.300 --> 1:09:45.100]  going to be on the air uh... and i mean that's on the good end
[1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:49.100]  this just gets worse and worse and worse and i'm telling you this is a process
[1:09:49.100 --> 1:09:53.580]  this is a program of enslavement richard finish up
[1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:56.860]  well i only got one more thing to say and that is that when i first started
[1:09:56.860 --> 1:09:59.500]  listening to you back in the old kjfk days
[1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:02.300]  and i started warning people they were laughing at me
[1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:05.580]  and now they're not a lot of more are woken up and that's how we're going to
[1:10:05.580 --> 1:10:08.940]  win this thing if we don't get the message out everybody we can
[1:10:08.940 --> 1:10:12.060]  well it's not just ron paul i appreciate your call it's not just ron paul
[1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:14.380]  there's a several other congressman one of them
[1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:18.460]  up there out of new hampshire you know was asked
[1:10:18.460 --> 1:10:21.260]  the name slips me i can pull it up we played the clips on air we said why aren't
[1:10:21.260 --> 1:10:23.420]  you guys impeaching bush and he said because
[1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:27.020]  they'll just call declare martial law and basically arrest the congress
[1:10:27.020 --> 1:10:30.860]  they've been told that folks and then the british ministry of defense what's out
[1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:35.340]  of report last year saying that if parliaments or congress or the people
[1:10:35.340 --> 1:10:40.140]  try to take over the capitals like something out of uh...
[1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:43.900]  vie for vendetta they'll just kind of detonate a neutron bomb that doesn't
[1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:46.140]  destroy one building
[1:10:46.140 --> 1:10:50.860]  doesn't destroy any infrastructure yet fries it sends a radiation wave
[1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:55.500]  through all life forms that's cockroaches turtles buzzards bees
[1:10:55.500 --> 1:11:00.780]  uh... dragonflies uh... sparrows humans
[1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:05.100]  polar bears at the zoo everything dies
[1:11:05.100 --> 1:11:08.140]  and you know there's ways to get around that we politically take over every
[1:11:08.140 --> 1:11:12.060]  county every city educate everybody at the military and police educated to where
[1:11:12.060 --> 1:11:13.660]  they see through this
[1:11:13.660 --> 1:11:17.660]  then people just start saying no and have general strikes and and you have a
[1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:19.100]  mass revelation
[1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.980]  as anthony hillers always said a revelation something just you know
[1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:24.540]  literally spreads like wildfire
[1:11:24.540 --> 1:11:28.140]  uh... you know an awakening which is really been happening in slow motion
[1:11:28.140 --> 1:11:31.260]  but starting to quicken the enemy's quickening as well
[1:11:31.260 --> 1:11:32.140]  then
[1:11:32.140 --> 1:11:34.460]  we can overt that
[1:11:34.460 --> 1:11:38.460]  but no march on washington you know the congress can't do it now
[1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:42.540]  uh... they're all scared folks and this new bailout plan says
[1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:45.260]  decisions by the secretary pursuant to the authority of this act
[1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:46.300]  are non
[1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:49.660]  reviewable and committed to agency discretion it may not be reviewed
[1:11:49.660 --> 1:11:51.820]  by any court of law or any administrative agency
[1:11:51.820 --> 1:11:55.340]  it allows them to go for any banking any houses any governments
[1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:59.420]  it it's total financial martial law by the federal reserve
[1:11:59.420 --> 1:12:02.860]  and i've got the actor in front of me it is unbelievable
[1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:06.060]  it is dictatorship of the bankers who did they tell you in the mainstream news
[1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:07.980]  a few months ago as i told you years ago
[1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:12.140]  what did they say they said you will be paying your global carbon tax to
[1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:16.860]  an international consortium of banks you're going to pay your taxes to them
[1:12:16.860 --> 1:12:22.220]  the military is going to work for them everything do you understand
[1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:25.500]  you know a pop culture analogies when the private corporation
[1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:27.820]  you know in robo cop
[1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:31.180]  takes over the city and says well that's the deal
[1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:34.140]  well that's basically they're telling you there what they're really doing
[1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:37.020]  and it's all here in black and white this is not a bailout
[1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:40.140]  this is a complete takeover anthony j hilder
[1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:43.420]  we're really honored to have you uh... here with us you made films
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:46.220]  decades ago about their plan to do this because you see them do it many other
[1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:50.860]  nations breakdown what we see happening right now financially
[1:12:50.860 --> 1:12:54.780]  well this is a financial arm again first of all it's not a recession it's a
[1:12:54.780 --> 1:12:58.780]  depression and we're going full bore into it
[1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:02.380]  it's a summer bin laden that is attacking this country
[1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:07.020]  well no i've got to rephrase that it's a summer bin bush
[1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:11.340]  that's the reality the summer bin laden that we hear about have been dead for
[1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:14.780]  years but this is alive they're attacking every bank
[1:13:14.780 --> 1:13:17.900]  account they're attacking every home they're attacking every child they're
[1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:22.140]  attacking every mother every child to be there they're after
[1:13:22.140 --> 1:13:26.460]  they want us all they want us numbered there's an invasion coming from
[1:13:26.460 --> 1:13:30.940]  south of the border that's only because the latinos will accept a
[1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:35.660]  biochip in exchange for a citizenship so by the way they are chipping the
[1:13:35.660 --> 1:13:39.420]  mexican police and they're making the attorney general feds for four years
[1:13:39.420 --> 1:13:43.020]  take chips that's msnbc this is a joke
[1:13:43.020 --> 1:13:46.540]  we have a film of it's called citizen chip
[1:13:46.540 --> 1:13:52.140]  six six six they exchange their freedom for the
[1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:58.460]  citizenship and it is all in the works now
[1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:01.980]  there isn't anything you have there isn't anything you ever had or ever hope
[1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:04.380]  to have they're not planning on taking away
[1:14:04.380 --> 1:14:07.900]  they want it all and this is the coup de gras
[1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:13.660]  if this thing goes through they're going to put put this
[1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:19.020]  this hammer is going to come down like a guillotine in the back of your head
[1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:24.940]  this is a financial armageddon if it doesn't come
[1:14:24.940 --> 1:14:28.540]  they're going to create the crisis for the control it's
[1:14:28.540 --> 1:14:33.420]  ordo abt kao when you see this on the side of the masonic buildings
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:37.900]  it means something they have a reason for doing this
[1:14:37.900 --> 1:14:45.020]  it is a satanic luciferian agenda when you have somebody like paulson
[1:14:45.020 --> 1:14:49.180]  and bernie key from the uh... from the council on foreign relations
[1:14:49.180 --> 1:14:52.460]  this is what we must have we must have
[1:14:52.460 --> 1:14:56.380]  don't be afraid be very afraid
[1:14:56.380 --> 1:15:00.060]  we have to have a revelation we have to have
[1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:03.260]  every single listener get on the phone
[1:15:03.260 --> 1:15:07.100]  to the congressman to just the numbers because they don't go they don't listen
[1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:11.020]  to what you have to say but they look they look at the numbers
[1:15:11.020 --> 1:15:14.620]  if we make it impossible for them to do this
[1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:19.500]  then we will avoid this but even even if we avoid it
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:22.540]  they will create another crisis to bring about control
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:26.060]  and anthony it's not like we just started saying this i mean my book
[1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:29.260]  written six and a half years ago to sent into tyranny the last chapter said
[1:15:29.260 --> 1:15:33.420]  they do this and around 2008 2009 because i had
[1:15:33.420 --> 1:15:36.060]  their own documents it's we it's not hard
[1:15:36.060 --> 1:15:38.460]  uh... when they're telling you what they're going to do and then three years
[1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:41.500]  ago we got our info out of the bilderberg group
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:44.620]  saying they were going to start it with the housing collapse by design
[1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:48.300]  i mean it's not just like we're pointing our finger now they say
[1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:52.060]  it's even in mainstream news that they're privatizing the treasury
[1:15:52.060 --> 1:15:55.500]  and then letting them have select rules where they can consolidate all the other
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:16:00.220]  banking and financials they own the money system
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:04.540]  we have to get the money system out of their hands
[1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:07.980]  uh... when henry kissinger met with sarah paylon yesterday i took a look at
[1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:10.140]  that it's like you know
[1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:14.620]  uh... the angel meeting with the devil but that the angel is influenced by the
[1:16:14.620 --> 1:16:15.420]  devil
[1:16:15.420 --> 1:16:17.820]  we have our preachers
[1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:22.940]  from the podium saying we must go in this direction we must uh...
[1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:26.140]  get ready i'm talking about the
[1:16:26.140 --> 1:16:30.060]  robertson they admittedly are on the government payroll
[1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:32.060]  it's not even a secret

[1:17:51.340 --> 1:17:53.580]  culture of the olympic games ceremonies
[1:17:53.580 --> 1:17:57.100]  where they have ufo's a fake ufo's landing that they've been gearing up for

[1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:00.460]  that's certainly
[1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.420]  in their bag of tricks of dozens of different
[1:18:03.420 --> 1:18:07.740]  tricks but having the pub come out and say aliens are real and there are friends

[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:51.020]  and they hear this roar but not from above like of the aurora
[1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:55.100]  but beneath the ground and the ground shook like an earthquake or like it's
[1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:57.900]  a freight train going underneath them out to the
[1:25:57.900 --> 1:26:03.260]  south the east of the ticaboo valley near the handcock pass and

[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:40.780]  this isn't coming from outer space it's coming
[1:26:40.780 --> 1:26:46.540]  from this government of those who control this government to frighten you

[1:28:49.100 --> 1:28:53.020]  about the star wars program that you had it up at that time
[1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:57.820]  that that that that is declassified but but but you know not very popularly
[1:28:57.820 --> 1:28:59.580]  known he said that's a good way of putting it
[1:28:59.580 --> 1:29:03.340]  he said i can tell you things that have been accidentally declassified because
[1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:06.540]  a lot of uh... you know presidents and others end up leaking things or want to
[1:29:06.540 --> 1:29:11.180]  brag at cocktail parties or it comes out news articles
[1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:16.140]  and he said by the mid-sevenths they already had robotic drone spacecraft
[1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:19.500]  circling the earth in a decapitation program
[1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:23.900]  dropping gravity well uh... d u sabos

[1:29:28.700 --> 1:29:33.340]  and he said that was when he took over the program and he was only there till
[1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:36.940]  eighty one they already had space planes
[1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:39.980]  uh... which uh... have a full compliment
[1:29:39.980 --> 1:29:43.580]  it could already decapitate the world's leaders in an hour

[1:33:10.380 --> 1:33:16.540]  didn't take no chance to say who was a prisoner of doubt
[1:33:16.540 --> 1:33:24.220]  what
[1:33:27.500 --> 1:33:28.220]  got
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:44.220]  coming straight over
[1:33:44.220 --> 1:33:54.660]  thousands of different public and non-public reports put out by 25 influential neocon leaders
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:34:05.100]  including Dick Cheney, Jeff Bush, Perl, Rumsfeld and others, and what did they say in there?
[1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:10.500]  They said, we have control of the United States, we have control of the nuclear weapons, we
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:18.820]  have control of the financial system, we have control of the neutron weapons, of the
[1:34:18.820 --> 1:34:24.180]  race-specific bio weapons, in fact the race-specific bio weapon and the fact that they were in
[1:34:24.180 --> 1:34:29.140]  control of the empire, that's in the September 2000, September 20, 2000, rebuilding America's
[1:34:29.140 --> 1:34:36.660]  defenses document, one 20-something page document, go read it if you dare, very cold-blooded,
[1:34:36.660 --> 1:34:41.700]  very bold, and hey, why not stage a terror attack and launch wars and have trillions
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:45.780]  in oil and hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts, why not set up a domestic
[1:34:45.780 --> 1:34:51.900]  police state you control so you can carry out a mass looting of the entire economy, I broke
[1:34:51.900 --> 1:35:00.580]  it down in the first hour, but reading it, total absolute liability protection, it gives
[1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:04.340]  a pardon to all the criminals that have been stealing and thieving, that's why they're
[1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:09.300]  saying no investigation, no arrest, no nothing, now that's for now while they're stealing,
[1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:13.700]  later they'll burn some low-level stockbroker who had a crooked toenail or didn't wash
[1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:19.820]  his car once a week or didn't tie his shoelaces properly and say that's the arts criminal,
[1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:23.820]  but they're saying they can take over anything they want in the economy, your homes, any
[1:35:23.820 --> 1:35:28.180]  banking, any government, Congress is signing its authority over forever, they can't really
[1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:34.380]  do that, that's treason, by that, you know, this is all color of law and a fraud, Violet's
[1:35:34.380 --> 1:35:38.940]  Bill of Rights and Constitution, it's null and void, Marbury versus Madison, but it
[1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:45.980]  is not a bailout, but they've got everybody debating well should we bail them out, and
[1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:49.340]  then people debate well I'm not getting, I'm not getting bailed out of my credit card
[1:35:49.340 --> 1:35:54.260]  debt or out of my mortgage, you know, only 28% of Americans in a Ross Musician major
[1:35:54.260 --> 1:35:58.700]  poll and other poll show similar numbers, right around 25-30% depending on the poll,
[1:35:58.700 --> 1:36:03.940]  Ross Musician came out yesterday, 28% are for the bailout, but when you hear them on
[1:36:03.940 --> 1:36:07.100]  talk radio and read them in the paper, it's like I don't like it and it's bad and it's
[1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:12.380]  socialism for the rich guys, but you know the economy's going to implode if we don't,
[1:36:12.380 --> 1:36:16.540]  no, no, no, you don't, you don't understand, they'll stabilize things for a few months if
[1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:20.580]  you let them do this and then they're going to tank it all, they get it all when it goes
[1:36:20.580 --> 1:36:27.900]  for fire sale, pennies on the dollar, Anthony, you know, you produced, you put together,
[1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:32.700]  you helped write up the Myron Fagan Illuminati tapes, you know, breaking down on the bankers
[1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:36.260]  did this in Europe, how they did this here, all of the economic collapses come out of
[1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:41.300]  Wall Street and come out of the stock exchanges worldwide, they do this cyclically, this is
[1:36:41.300 --> 1:36:45.340]  a historical fact, it came out in congressional hearings during the Great Depression, but
[1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:50.940]  people forget this every, every generation, break it down for people. First of all, when
[1:36:50.940 --> 1:37:00.180]  they created the mechanism through which they gained control, they never had any intention
[1:37:00.180 --> 1:37:07.620]  for the people to ever wake up, but through talk radio we do that, you can make a change,
[1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:13.700]  you can get the message, you are getting the message, the privately owned Federal Reserve
[1:37:13.700 --> 1:37:23.660]  came in 1913, the income tax came in 1913, the tax exempt, you pay the taxes, the foundations,
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:29.580]  the FBI came, the Federal Police Force in 1913, the ADL came in 1913.
[1:37:29.580 --> 1:37:36.660]  So what they have done is they've taken over the control over the issuance of currency,
[1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:44.660]  they create a debt that is called a dollar bill, it's a debt bearing note issued at point
[1:37:44.660 --> 1:37:52.540]  of origin, they issue it into circulation, now they're asking you to see the Grand Canyon,
[1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:57.740]  the head of the Federal Reserve and Paulson is saying come over to the edge, you can get
[1:37:57.740 --> 1:38:02.540]  a better view, just step a few, we're right behind you, don't worry, don't worry, just
[1:38:02.540 --> 1:38:08.980]  come right over to the edge, you can see the Grand Canyon from here and they push and you're
[1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:19.420]  off, don't go in that direction, do whatever you have to do by getting on other radio shows
[1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:27.460]  to talk about this financial armageddon, they, it looks like with the Panic project, well
[1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:35.700]  I've just revamped the Panic project and Alien 51, making it into DVDs and you can get those
[1:38:35.700 --> 1:38:45.940]  by going to FreeWorldFilmWorks.com, we talk about that aspect of this program to bring
[1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:53.540]  you to suck you into the core of their operation, there's never been any fight anywhere over
[1:38:53.540 --> 1:39:00.900]  anything, at any time there's been one, defensively, we must take the offense right now, we must
[1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:08.340]  stop this thing, when I say thing from, I used to watch horror movies when I was a kid
[1:39:08.340 --> 1:39:12.420]  and I saw the thing and everybody was scared because they didn't know what the hell was
[1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:17.340]  on the other side of the door, but you have an opportunity to see what's on the other
[1:39:17.340 --> 1:39:24.580]  side of the door, you can get these films, you had mentioned Illuminati, the first one
[1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:32.980]  that came out, along with yours, we did another one after that, it's called 9-1-1, the greatest
[1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:41.300]  lie ever sold, it's in 23 countries, it's in 7 languages, these programs are being seen
[1:39:41.300 --> 1:39:42.300]  throughout the world.
[1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:47.780]  And that certainly is troubling the New World Order, whereas in the past they could fool
[1:39:47.780 --> 1:39:52.060]  the public, now they know they've been exposed, the problem is, they just don't care, they're
[1:39:52.060 --> 1:39:57.780]  moving forward, I mean let's break down, if the people don't speak up, if the people
[1:39:57.780 --> 1:40:02.380]  don't say no, if the police and military don't say no, we know they're waking up, what the
[1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:05.900]  globalist plan to do, what their master plan looks like Anthony?
[1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:15.380]  Well, it is like hell on earth, literally hell on earth, by breaking the dollar down,
[1:40:15.380 --> 1:40:21.980]  by crashing the dollar it gives the fours in the opportunity to introduce the Amaro,
[1:40:21.980 --> 1:40:27.020]  they want to break down the sovereignty of the United States of America, so they have
[1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:34.380]  to crash the dollar, what is being done today in the Congress of the United States is an
[1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:41.660]  introduction, it's a preparation for the abolition of what you now think of as the United States
[1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:49.900]  of America, and the introduction of the North American Union, this is a nowsy agreement,
[1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:54.620]  this is what Adolf Hitler envisioned in his book, The World Order, this is the one after
[1:40:54.620 --> 1:41:01.580]  Mein Kampf, we're taking a look at a nowsy agreement, and it is a nowsy, it's a Nazi,
[1:41:01.580 --> 1:41:06.620]  it's a Nazi version of the European Union.
[1:41:06.620 --> 1:41:13.820]  The currency has already been put together, it's the Amaro, they have to crash the dollar
[1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:19.300]  before they can introduce the Amaro, they have to abolish the United States of America
[1:41:19.300 --> 1:41:28.580]  to bring in this union, it's Nazi like in nature, and it is being done now, we're doing
[1:41:28.580 --> 1:41:40.100]  a series of films, I'm going to give you a number at 928-227-0760, that's 928-227-0760,
[1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:46.100]  you can go to that or preworldfilmworks.com, get some of the products that I do, you've
[1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:53.500]  got to get some of the products that Alex makes, the films that you make, the films
[1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:57.820]  that I make, we're all discussing the same thing, it's just different aspects.
[1:41:57.820 --> 1:42:02.340]  Well, films are such a great vehicle because you don't have to talk to your blue in the
[1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:06.460]  face, you just fire and forget, you just give somebody a copy of a DVD, and I found that's
[1:42:06.460 --> 1:42:10.740]  the most effective thing, Anthony I want to go to some calls in a moment, but let's specifically
[1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:18.260]  talk about how important 9-11 truth is, how successful it's been, I mean our goal was
[1:42:18.260 --> 1:42:25.060]  to- You've made it, you've made it, let me interrupt you, Alex, you personally have
[1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:30.500]  stayed on this thing, you're like a pit bull, you're going out there, you're grounded by
[1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:35.980]  the throat and you're shaking and shaking and shaking, you brought in Charlie Sheen,
[1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:39.660]  Charlie Sheen did the movie about being a Wall Street, we're looking at that thing
[1:42:39.660 --> 1:42:40.660]  right now.
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:43.300]  Well the point is it got a lot of attention, it made it safe for other celebrities like
[1:42:43.300 --> 1:42:47.900]  Governor Ventura, Willie Nelson, the best actress this year, German defense minister,
[1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:52.580]  Italian president, members of the Japanese parliament, architects and engineers, that's
[1:42:52.580 --> 1:42:56.500]  why that was so important now two and a half years ago, but I mean for people that don't
[1:42:56.500 --> 1:43:02.100]  understand, the victory for 9-11 truth is that in major polls worldwide, the majority
[1:43:02.100 --> 1:43:07.540]  of people believe it's an inside job, the vast majority is upwards of 84% in Angus and
[1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:08.540]  Leedon.
[1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:11.060]  The majority of people in New York City understand it's a-
[1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:15.260]  Yeah, they've had polls where the 60-something percent believe inside job in New York, we're
[1:43:15.260 --> 1:43:19.340]  talking Togby, we're talking Angus and Reed, well I mean I want to get your take on this,
[1:43:19.340 --> 1:43:25.380]  for people that don't know, worldwide now, the majority folks know that 9-11 was an inside
[1:43:25.380 --> 1:43:28.980]  job but has to go further, not that it was just George Bush, he's just a puppet, but
[1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:33.740]  the international financial elite did this as a pretext to invade the Middle East, as
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:37.900]  a pretext to set up a police state in Europe and the United States and England, and so
[1:43:37.900 --> 1:43:44.380]  now we are having that revelation that you called for, Anthony, where do we go from here?
[1:43:44.380 --> 1:43:52.300]  Well we have to expand, that's where we go from here, when we expand, then we become
[1:43:52.300 --> 1:44:01.940]  offensive in nature, they can't combat the giant, they are in a minority, when we understand
[1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:09.700]  that they are in a minority, when we go to co-opt their military, when we take people
[1:44:09.700 --> 1:44:15.980]  in the military through this story and they understand it, when they get the message,
[1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:27.060]  when we bring our films into Pakistan, into Islamabad, and Lahore, when this happens, and
[1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:33.580]  it is already happening, and by the way our films are everywhere, and they bootleg them,
[1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:37.820]  and that's alright because they get out there, somebody said that they were taking my film
[1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:43.100]  out to Dubai, and they were going to go into Pakistan, and they are selling them on the
[1:44:43.100 --> 1:44:50.300]  streets for 1 and 2 rupees, and they are in Malaysia, they are in Thailand, I was talking
[1:44:50.300 --> 1:44:55.260]  to two individuals who are Chinese, who are taking one of our films, the Chinese answer
[1:44:55.260 --> 1:45:01.580]  to cancer, at a meeting just two nights ago, they are going to distribute it throughout
[1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:09.700]  all of East Asia, in China, I did this film over there with Dr. Bruce Halstead, the film
[1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:15.060]  can be seen by a million people, a million people can see a film before a book can be
[1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:21.100]  read by one, that's a fact, absolutely, and what happens now is that a guy sitting in
[1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:26.460]  his chair, reading New World Order quotes, gets seen by millions, and somebody who makes
[1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:31.220]  a powerful film, gets seen by hundreds of millions, and this stuff just keeps bouncing
[1:45:31.220 --> 1:45:39.900]  around forever, we've put so much lead downrange in the Info War, you know I've got a parable
[1:45:39.900 --> 1:45:46.820]  or an analogy or a parallel, remember the Harrison Ford movie, the sequel to the Guns
[1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:53.580]  of Navarone, Force 10 from Navarone, where they blow up the dam and they are sitting
[1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:57.220]  there griping at the guy that planted the demolition saying the dam didn't fall down,
[1:45:57.220 --> 1:46:00.780]  and he says give it a minute and he starts smoking his pipe and then it starts cracking
[1:46:00.780 --> 1:46:05.380]  and pieces fall out and it implodes, well we're just now starting to see the cracks
[1:46:05.380 --> 1:46:09.740]  form, we have already blown the daylights out of the New World Order, they were already
[1:46:09.740 --> 1:46:14.940]  planning to bankrupt us and go for broke, but now they're having to accelerate their
[1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:19.180]  program which makes it even more obvious because it's collapsing out from under them, they're
[1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:24.900]  trying to flee forward, fail forward right now, and that's not me putting a pretty face
[1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:31.540]  on it, we have done something never before seen in the Info War, more than 1776 and the
[1:46:31.540 --> 1:46:34.740]  pamphleteers and the Sons of Liberty for a decade before.
[1:46:34.740 --> 1:46:40.700]  Alex, what I'd like to do with your films, I'd like to go to the American Film Mart here
[1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:45.300]  in Los Angeles, it's like the Cannes Film Festival, you haven't done it but I can do
[1:46:45.300 --> 1:46:52.660]  it for you, I'd like to go into the American Film Mart with your film, our film from Alien
[1:46:52.660 --> 1:46:59.220]  51, the Panic Project, the Chinese answer to cancer, Luminati 9-1-1, 9-1-1, the greatest
[1:46:59.220 --> 1:47:06.580]  livers sold, and sell the rights to foreign distributors because they will go out and
[1:47:06.580 --> 1:47:13.300]  they will promote it for us, you get a little bit of money but they, we get a lot of action
[1:47:13.300 --> 1:47:14.300]  and I'm going to...
[1:47:14.300 --> 1:47:18.540]  I'm not even worried about it, it's already, I mean the films are already just going completely
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:23.060]  insane, I mean just where we can gauge it, you know millions and millions and millions
[1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:28.220]  of views a month just for my main films on YouTube and Google alone and yours as well
[1:47:28.220 --> 1:47:33.260]  and just thank God that we decided to fight, I mean Anthony Hilder, I go back to you, what
[1:47:33.260 --> 1:47:36.660]  year with Myron Fagan did you put out the Luminati records?
[1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:37.660]  1967.
[1:47:37.660 --> 1:47:42.580]  And I mean think about the effect on the catalyst, how many people that woke up in chain reaction
[1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:46.460]  and think of those coming after us, I don't think the New World Order is going to get
[1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:48.100]  away with this Anthony.
[1:47:48.100 --> 1:47:54.900]  Well when I first put out the three volume set of this long playing records, I figured
[1:47:54.900 --> 1:48:00.380]  if I could only get 1,000 sets at 3,000 records the story wouldn't be ended, it wouldn't come
[1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:05.580]  to a close, we'd have an opportunity for other people to come along and get the message to
[1:48:05.580 --> 1:48:10.540]  pick up the baton, not only have you picked up the baton, you've gone around the field
[1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:15.700]  many many many times and you've been very successful at it, I'm going to give you a
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:25.700]  number, our number, because we've got a fellow waiting to take down orders 928-227-0760,
[1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:26.700]  928-227-0760.
[1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:32.900]  Anthony, I would imagine folks have gotten that, but we can give it out before you leave
[1:48:32.900 --> 1:48:37.180]  us, let's get a few calls in here, Robert in California, go ahead Robert.
[1:48:37.180 --> 1:48:40.140]  Good day gentlemen, how are you feeling?
[1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:42.700]  Well we're doing as good as we can, run away folks up.
[1:48:42.700 --> 1:48:43.700]  I cry a lot.
[1:48:43.700 --> 1:48:44.700]  How are you doing?
[1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:49.780]  I'm doing great, I don't guys, you know it's just being prepared, a lot of times and this
[1:48:49.780 --> 1:48:54.340]  is where probably your frustration comes in, is that these people are in there, just great
[1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:59.060]  denial and delusion, and no matter what you say to them, even if you had articles, even
[1:48:59.060 --> 1:49:02.980]  if you had like the body just laying in front of them they would still say, nope I don't
[1:49:02.980 --> 1:49:04.980]  see it.
[1:49:04.980 --> 1:49:10.980]  We have to create such action that the enemy is not prepared, the enemy is not prepared
[1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:11.980]  for us awakening.
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:20.420]  Well that's already happening, they are not happy, I mean this gobbling of the economy
[1:49:20.420 --> 1:49:27.180]  came sooner than they were planning to, according to most of the experts we talked to, Anthony,
[1:49:27.180 --> 1:49:31.540]  the new order is not invincible, they're not gods, do you agree that they're being destabilized
[1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:32.540]  right now?
[1:49:32.540 --> 1:49:40.140]  Absolutely, because the pedal is to the metal, they would not be doing now what they are
[1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:45.420]  doing now, unless they were frightened to death that this whole damn thing was coming
[1:49:45.420 --> 1:49:52.020]  apart and we were succeeding, there is an exponential rise of awareness.
[1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:54.380]  Absolutely, anything else you want to add Robert?
[1:49:54.380 --> 1:49:58.460]  I agree with you guys because they can't control it because they haven't accounted for human
[1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:02.340]  nature or the other people, the smaller people involved in investing are trying to get out
[1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:04.620]  as fast as they can as well.
[1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:10.860]  You've got to get the films, Alex has been making these films, it's not just to sit on
[1:50:10.860 --> 1:50:16.300]  the damn shelf, it's to get them out and play on cable access, let's say you're in
[1:50:16.300 --> 1:50:24.340]  a little town in Podunk, Iowa and out at Podunk you've got 133 people see it in an afternoon
[1:50:24.340 --> 1:50:31.060]  because somebody took the time to go out there and put it on, they're at their show, I mean
[1:50:31.060 --> 1:50:38.060]  when they do this, it just expands, absolutely folks, you cannot sit on your hands, you've
[1:50:38.060 --> 1:50:43.340]  got to get films like Illuminati and Terror Storm and Endgame and Truth Rising and make
[1:50:43.340 --> 1:50:49.060]  copies of them and pass the files around, the video files to your email list every day
[1:50:49.060 --> 1:50:54.580]  because the power of a film, that's what the enemy uses against us, the power of UV listeners
[1:50:54.580 --> 1:51:01.580]  taking action is incalculable, we'll be right back.
[1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:13.500]  What will you do when it happens, when you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation
[1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:21.180]  and fear or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with www.patreonfood.com.

[1:51:27.340 --> 1:51:30.140]  magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[1:51:30.140 --> 1:51:35.900]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?

[1:52:06.340 --> 1:52:08.340]  was an inside job.
[1:52:08.340 --> 1:52:11.340]  Do you like being a puppet sir, do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:15.940]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage, it was engineered by you, David
[1:52:15.940 --> 1:52:17.940]  King, Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:52:17.940 --> 1:52:25.940]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:52:25.940 --> 1:52:27.940]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:32.940]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:32.940 --> 1:52:36.940]  An inside job, how dare you?
[1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:43.940]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:46.940]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.940 --> 1:52:51.940]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the tenth anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:57.940]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:57.940 --> 1:53:00.940]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:53:00.940 --> 1:53:08.940]  Cameras are everywhere, above stop lights on toll booths and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate
[1:53:08.940 --> 1:53:10.940]  only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:14.940]  In California red light tickets are as high as $400.
[1:53:14.940 --> 1:53:18.940]  Spray your plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.

[1:53:57.940 --> 1:54:00.940]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:06.940]  David Ray Griffin is coming up at the eight after.
[1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:10.940]  9-11 Truth has had amazing victims.
[1:54:10.940 --> 1:54:13.940]  It's growing faster than it ever has before.
[1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:24.940]  More and more prominent people from science, media, academia, film are joining the ranks.
[1:54:24.940 --> 1:54:31.940]  This is just about 9-11. It's about stopping future stage terror attacks.
[1:54:31.940 --> 1:54:37.940]  It's about realizing who really creates the economic crisis.
[1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:39.940]  The problem reaction solution.
[1:54:39.940 --> 1:54:40.940]  Gailian dialectic.
[1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:42.940]  Robert in California thanks for the call.
[1:54:42.940 --> 1:54:46.940]  Dan Bruce, Cody, Derek, Wes, a few others I want to try to get to.
[1:54:46.940 --> 1:54:48.940]  Oh, Cody in Florida disagrees.
[1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:51.940]  I want to go to him first. I didn't see that there on the screen.
[1:54:51.940 --> 1:54:54.940]  Before we do that, just in a nutshell, Anthony Hilder, you're an icon.
[1:54:54.940 --> 1:54:57.940]  I just respect you so much and thank you for the work you've done.
[1:54:57.940 --> 1:54:59.940]  I probably wouldn't be here doing what I'm doing.
[1:54:59.940 --> 1:55:03.940]  It wasn't for people who really set the ball in motion back in the 50s and 60s like yourself.
[1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:08.940]  In a nutshell, explain to people the system of problem reaction solution.
[1:55:08.940 --> 1:55:11.940]  I know most of them know, but some of them don't and don't understand.
[1:55:11.940 --> 1:55:15.940]  This really is the modus operandi of the enemy.
[1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:17.940]  Look at the Masonic and the Masonic temples.
[1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:21.940]  It says Ordo Ab Cale.
[1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:23.940]  That isn't just words written in Latin.
[1:55:23.940 --> 1:55:25.940]  Bush has even said that in a bunch of speeches.
[1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:26.940]  We're going to bring order out of chaos.
[1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.940]  Order out of chaos for control.
[1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:35.940]  To create a problem is essential.
[1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:41.940]  They have to create a problem so that we are led into trying to solve this thing ourselves
[1:55:41.940 --> 1:55:44.940]  and we get brought to the edge of the cliff.
[1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:55.940]  They create the financial armageddon so that when we go to the bank, we find it's frozen.
[1:55:55.940 --> 1:55:59.940]  And then we have to look to them for help and they say they're going to give us a national ID,
[1:55:59.940 --> 1:56:01.940]  FEMA card with money on it.
[1:56:01.940 --> 1:56:03.940]  They are real bastards.
[1:56:03.940 --> 1:56:04.940]  Well, it's not just bastards.
[1:56:04.940 --> 1:56:06.940]  It's a satanic order.
[1:56:06.940 --> 1:56:08.940]  It's a Luciferian order.
[1:56:08.940 --> 1:56:13.940]  If you don't believe in God, they have their Lord Lucifer.
[1:56:13.940 --> 1:56:15.940]  No, I know they believe in it.
[1:56:15.940 --> 1:56:20.940]  You know, when you fold that $20 bill and we fold it on our film 9-1-1, The Greatest Library Soul,
[1:56:20.940 --> 1:56:22.940]  we forgot to put in something.
[1:56:22.940 --> 1:56:26.940]  When you do the fold, there is on the left-hand side at the bottom an ST.
[1:56:26.940 --> 1:56:29.940]  ST is the abbreviation for saint.
[1:56:29.940 --> 1:56:32.940]  On the other side, there's an IN.
[1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:34.940]  It's saint in.
[1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:35.940]  No, I know.
[1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:36.940]  I know these people.
[1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:38.940]  Hey, I've got this big Mason going into Masonic meetings saying,
[1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:39.940]  I love Lucifer.
[1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:40.940]  I am Lucifer.
[1:56:40.940 --> 1:56:44.940]  And the average Mason, of course, isn't a bad person, doesn't know that the higher levels of their order,
[1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:47.940]  it's actually just a gateway into another order.
[1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:49.940]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:56:49.940 --> 1:56:52.940]  Dan in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[1:56:52.940 --> 1:56:53.940]  Hello?
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:54.940]  Yes, sir.
[1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:55.940]  Hello, Dan.
[1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:56.940]  Oh, wow.
[1:56:56.940 --> 1:56:58.940]  Hey, what's going on, guys?
[1:56:58.940 --> 1:56:59.940]  We're on a roadshow, sir.
[1:56:59.940 --> 1:57:00.940]  You got anything you want to say?
[1:57:00.940 --> 1:57:01.940]  Yeah.
[1:57:01.940 --> 1:57:02.940]  Yeah.
[1:57:02.940 --> 1:57:04.940]  We need a detailed plan from you, Alex.
[1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:06.940]  You keep talking and we need to bring them down.
[1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:07.940]  We need to do this.
[1:57:07.940 --> 1:57:08.940]  We need to do that.
[1:57:08.940 --> 1:57:09.940]  I 100% agree.
[1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:12.940]  I just think people who know don't know what to do.
[1:57:12.940 --> 1:57:14.940]  You know what I mean?
[1:57:14.940 --> 1:57:19.940]  Well, I mean, you know, it's easy to say, meet up with us and I'll be the leader and do this
[1:57:19.940 --> 1:57:22.940]  and that, but they can cut the head off, something like that.
[1:57:22.940 --> 1:57:23.940]  All of us waking people up.
[1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:24.940]  All of us saying no.
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:27.940]  People in government leaking information, bringing out corruption.
[1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:29.940]  People in media saying no, no, no.
[1:57:29.940 --> 1:57:31.940]  And you're seeing more and more of that.
[1:57:31.940 --> 1:57:38.940]  Just the courage of going public and saying 9-11's an inside job, that will sabotage this system.
[1:57:38.940 --> 1:57:40.940]  The problem is they control the banking system.
[1:57:40.940 --> 1:57:41.940]  They control.
[1:57:41.940 --> 1:57:42.940]  It's their system.
[1:57:42.940 --> 1:57:44.940]  So they, you know, have the high ground.
[1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:45.940]  Anthony Holder.
[1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:46.940]  Well, you start the job.
[1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:49.940]  You start the fight where you are with what you've got.
[1:57:49.940 --> 1:58:01.940]  If you can get a phone call into a major national show, they've got all of these opportunities
[1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:02.940]  that are in front of you.
[1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:04.940]  All you have to do is pick up the phone.
[1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:05.940]  Exactly.
[1:58:05.940 --> 1:58:09.940]  Folks, you're looking for a magic silver bullet that will kill all the werewolves.
[1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:16.940]  There isn't one person or one thing or one perfect organization or group or multi-level marketing thing that's going to do it.
[1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:22.940]  It is going to demonstrations, going to protests, going and speaking to your city council that goes out locally on cable,
[1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:28.940]  going to your media, having them, you know, calling in to talk shows, setting up websites, making films.
[1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:33.940]  I mean, look at, you know, Dylan Avery makes a $5,000 film and it reaches 100 million people.
[1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:36.940]  You know, all of my films reaching hundreds of millions together.
[1:58:36.940 --> 1:58:37.940]  That's how it's done.
[1:58:37.940 --> 1:58:39.940]  You just take action.
[1:58:50.940 --> 1:58:57.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:57.940 --> 1:58:59.940]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:58:59.940 --> 1:59:01.940]  But who is the enemy?
[1:59:01.940 --> 1:59:02.940]  Bin Laden.
[1:59:02.940 --> 1:59:03.940]  This is his M.O.
[1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:06.940]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:06.940 --> 1:59:13.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:13.940 --> 1:59:20.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:20.940 --> 1:59:24.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:31.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:31.940 --> 1:59:35.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[1:59:35.940 --> 1:59:36.940]  Fabled Enemies.
[1:59:36.940 --> 1:59:38.940]  Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:59:43.940 --> 2:00:01.940]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:00:36.940 --> 2:00:38.940]  Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you doing?
[2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:39.940]  Good.
[2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:49.940]  Yes, I actually disagree about something you said a month ago about vaccines, about how the military is actually illegal to force them to take vaccines.
[2:00:49.940 --> 2:00:52.940]  Okay, go ahead and put out your information.
[2:00:52.940 --> 2:01:00.940]  Well, I looked into it, and I could only find a waiver for related reasons that only went out to select branches.
[2:01:00.940 --> 2:01:02.940]  You didn't even cover all of them.
[2:01:02.940 --> 2:01:07.940]  Okay, now let me give you the facts. Are you listening? Do you have a pen and paper? Because I'm going to give you the facts. Are you ready?
[2:01:07.940 --> 2:01:08.940]  Yes, sir.
[2:01:08.940 --> 2:01:10.940]  This deals with people's lives here.
[2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:15.940]  When you sign that corporate indentured servitude contract, and that's what it is.
[2:01:15.940 --> 2:01:22.940]  Same thing, sharecroppers, indentured servants on slave ships 300 years ago coming to this country sign.
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:27.940]  You corporately waive your rights, but they're not allowed to shoot you or kill you.
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:31.940]  Are they allowed to feed you pesticides? Are they allowed to chop your fingers off?
[2:01:31.940 --> 2:01:34.940]  No, they can't violate the military code.
[2:01:34.940 --> 2:01:39.940]  So they can, by color of law, intimidate you into the fact that they're supposedly allowed to do that.
[2:01:39.940 --> 2:01:43.940]  But your drill sergeant isn't allowed to pull your teeth out with pliers, are they? No.
[2:01:43.940 --> 2:01:53.940]  Now, you corporately agree, and then you can be dishonorably discharged, because under the corporate agreement you've signed with the International Crime Center to get the private corporation,
[2:01:53.940 --> 2:01:59.940]  you've agreed to that in a further adjudification. You're like on probation with them.
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:08.940]  That's how the color of law works. But under federal law, they cannot force you to take any experimental vaccines, smallpox, anthrax,
[2:02:08.940 --> 2:02:14.940]  and they have to tell you what it is when they give it to you. You can still say no, there may be consequences.
[2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:20.940]  But they cannot give you experimental vaccines without your consent. That's what I was saying.
[2:02:20.940 --> 2:02:25.940]  And they certainly can't say, we won't tell you what this is, then they give it to you and a whole bunch of the troops die.
[2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:28.940]  That's what I was saying.
[2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:38.940]  Cody, when you talk about the military, you see the advertisements that says, be army strong. It's smart to be in the military.
[2:02:38.940 --> 2:02:50.940]  It is never smart to surrender your rights and your sovereignty and your life to an organization that is controlled by the President of the United States
[2:02:50.940 --> 2:02:56.940]  when the President of the United States is using the U.S. military against the people.
[2:02:56.940 --> 2:03:02.940]  We're not against the military. We're against, like Hitler took control of the German military.
[2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:08.940]  You see, the military is openly run by foreign crime syndicates. Do you understand that?
[2:03:08.940 --> 2:03:12.940]  Yes, and could I explain what kind of my theory was?
[2:03:12.940 --> 2:03:14.940]  A theory. I'm telling you the facts. Go ahead.
[2:03:14.940 --> 2:03:22.940]  Well, I mean, for a while I was on a join. I was hoping to be part of one of the good guys to hopefully, someday if there could be a second revolution,
[2:03:22.940 --> 2:03:25.940]  be a part of that in the military structure.
[2:03:25.940 --> 2:03:30.940]  It's not a matter of being army strong, it's being army dumb.
[2:03:30.940 --> 2:03:39.940]  We have a football player that decided he wanted to surrender his career and join, and he was killed over in Afghanistan.
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:45.940]  He found out it was a scam, so they fragged him. He didn't want to guard opium fields.
[2:03:45.940 --> 2:03:50.940]  You know what they did? They shot him, and he was still alive, and they walked right up and sprayed him right in the face.
[2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:51.940]  Yes, Pat Tillman, right?
[2:03:51.940 --> 2:03:52.940]  That sound good?
[2:03:52.940 --> 2:04:01.940]  That's Pat Tillman. In fact, he's in our film. We would talk about that story in The Skull and Bones with a Catholic connection.
[2:04:01.940 --> 2:04:12.940]  We have to utilize this information effectively. Alex has got this film, his films, out around the world.
[2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:14.940]  They take them from God knows where.
[2:04:14.940 --> 2:04:23.940]  That's a huge part of the solution. Listen, I'm out of time. I'm not trying to be mean to you, Cody. You can call me back someday, and I'll be happy to talk to you.
[2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:25.940]  It just scares the daylights out of me.
[2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:28.940]  Thinking about all these good young men and women that joined the military.
[2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:32.940]  Have you heard about Project Shad Cody when they sprayed the troops with nerve gas and killed them?
[2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:33.940]  Yes.
[2:04:33.940 --> 2:04:38.940]  Why would you join something run by psychopathic killers that will kill you?
[2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:43.940]  You understand the army's main job, shipping narcotics in here?
[2:04:43.940 --> 2:04:49.940]  This is not our military. They find out you're a good guy, they'll put you in the front lines. If you're a criminal, they'll promote you into black ops.
[2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:52.940]  Anthony Hilder, it was great having you on. Fire out your website.

[2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:13.940]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:16.940 --> 2:08:21.940]  Well, for the next hour, maybe we'll hold him over a bit if he can, take some calls.
[2:08:21.940 --> 2:08:26.940]  David Ray Griffin is our guest. He's written about three books. Or is it more now?
[2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:35.940]  A very scholarly, very piercing, and very effective waking up intellectuals, the intelligentsia on both sides of the control left-right paradigm.
[2:08:36.940 --> 2:08:45.940]  And he was one of the first, you know, real heavyweight researchers and academics to come in for the big win for 9-11 Truth.
[2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:55.940]  This isn't something that's seven years ago. False Flag Terror is one of the main tools used by the military industrial banking pharma complex to have control.
[2:08:55.940 --> 2:09:03.940]  They're now orchestrating this economic implosion to hand full power over the treasury, basically privatizing it with the Federal Reserve to take over the entire economy.
[2:09:03.940 --> 2:09:09.940]  I've got the bill here. It is unbelievable. We'll cover that in the next hour in more detail.
[2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:15.940]  But we must expose False Flag Terror, or the establishment will continue to use it.
[2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:26.940]  You know, we've gone from being laughed at to Willie Nelson, you know, former governors, Italian presidents, CIA section chiefs, best actress, hundreds of architects and engineers and physicists.
[2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:33.940]  It's gaining momentum. The newness report has fallen right on its face. They had to throw out five previous reasons, they said.
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:40.940]  25% of the building scooped out fuel oil tanks, bad construction, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:45.940]  So just in their face, we're going to be talking about this with David Ray Griffin today.
[2:09:45.940 --> 2:09:52.940]  But first off, sir, and then I want to run through your books for folks that don't know about them. We carry several of them at infowars.com.
[2:09:52.940 --> 2:10:00.940]  Just your take on this journey, this quest, this saga, this road of exposing orchestrated government terror.
[2:10:00.940 --> 2:10:06.940]  I mean, now we have Cy Hirsch talking about Cheney wanting to attack our own ships with Navy Seals to blame it on Iran.
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:11.940]  Now we have even people like Keith Oberman talking about it on MSNBC.
[2:10:11.940 --> 2:10:16.940]  I mean, I don't think we've been in this battle so hot and heavy and up close to it, you pull back.
[2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:25.940]  I know you've done this as a philosopher. I mean, pulling back, are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing that we've just had unbelievable victories?
[2:10:25.940 --> 2:10:31.940]  Well, in one respect, yes, and in another respect, no.
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:37.940]  The respect in which the movement is much stronger.
[2:10:37.940 --> 2:10:47.940]  As you say, people are coming a little closer in the mainstream to saying something like what I've been saying.
[2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:55.940]  But on the other hand, it's still verboten to come out and say it explicitly about 9-11.
[2:10:55.940 --> 2:11:03.940]  You can talk about other things, but you can't say, well, of course 9-11 was one of these.
[2:11:03.940 --> 2:11:09.940]  You can kind of hit around it as Keith Oberman does, but you can't come right out and say it.
[2:11:09.940 --> 2:11:13.940]  So in that respect, we have not broken through, obviously.
[2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:26.940]  But on the other hand, the makeup of the 9-11 truth community is so radically different now than it was when you started things,
[2:11:26.940 --> 2:11:36.940]  and then when I got involved in early in 2003, and then when I wrote my first book, which was the end of 2003,
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:52.940]  came out in 2004, The New Pearl Harbor, they could still, with not too much implausibility, dismiss us as a bunch of conspiracy theorists or cooks
[2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:59.940]  who really didn't know much about the things we were talking about because we didn't have any real expertise.
[2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:07.940]  And they could say, well, you know, you don't have pilots who verify what you're talking about, you certainly don't have architects and engineers,
[2:12:07.940 --> 2:12:11.940]  while you don't even have any physicists, and so on and so on.
[2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:19.940]  Well, then you know the story we early on got, I forget exactly when it was that Steve Jones came on.
[2:12:19.940 --> 2:12:23.940]  We know the story, but a lot of listeners may not grasp it, so walk through that.
[2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:34.940]  Yeah, well, first of all, we started getting scientists involved. An organization was begun that was called Scholars for 9-11 Truth,
[2:12:34.940 --> 2:12:44.940]  and there was some disagreement there, and it split into two groups, one of them became Scholars for 9-11 Truth and Justice,
[2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:56.940]  and most of the scientists in the movement went with that group, and so we have a growing number of physicists and chemists and other scientists
[2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:05.940]  who joined the movement, and they would still dismiss it and say, well, you know, physicists don't really count with World Trade Center,
[2:13:05.940 --> 2:13:18.940]  that's for architects and engineers. Well, in 2006, Richard Gage heard a presentation about explosives in the towers,
[2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:26.940]  literally pulled off the side of the road to listen to it because it was so shaking to him,
[2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:35.940]  and then started architects and engineers, and within a year, the anniversary passed only recently,
[2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:44.940]  he had over 200, 400 people with licensed architects and engineers calling for a new investigation.
[2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:54.940]  Then along the way, we got veterans for 9-11 Truth, pilots for 9-11 Truth, and most recently, firefighters for 9-11 Truth.
[2:13:54.940 --> 2:14:02.940]  Veterans for 9-11 Truth, we've had all these former CIA section chiefs in Berlin, that's the chief post.
[2:14:02.940 --> 2:14:10.940]  Four sections, Bill Christiansen saying absolute inside job, and Ray McGovern saying clearly they've staged terror and they're all over this,
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:15.940]  and Bob Baer came on this show and said all the evidence says inside job.
[2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  I mean, it's just incalculable the people that have gone public.
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:29.940]  Yeah, but still the mainstream and still a major, you know, the majority of the left who control left-leaning publications
[2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:43.940]  still stay completely away from it. They would even, you know, it wasn't too long ago that Alexander Coburn of Counterpunch
[2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:50.940]  and wrote in The Nation that we were a bunch of conspiracy cooks who knew nothing about the real world.
[2:14:50.940 --> 2:14:55.940]  Well, he just showed he knew nothing about the evolution of the 9-11 Truth movement.
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:15:00.940]  And then Chomsky came out and said on video, okay, but it's an inside job, so what?
[2:15:00.940 --> 2:15:10.940]  Yeah, and so in that respect, either with the mainstream nor with the majority of the publication dominated left,
[2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:20.940]  have we made progress, but on the other hand, the story that we have for people who will look at it with an open mind
[2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:28.940]  and look at the evidence that we have plus the quality of the people who now endorse this evidence,
[2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:35.940]  it is what you can call now a slam dunk that it was that the official story is false
[2:15:35.940 --> 2:15:41.940]  and that on the other hand, the contrary to that is that it was an inside job.
[2:15:41.940 --> 2:15:45.940]  Now, people can differ on the details of how the inside job...
[2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:47.940]  Well, we know the official story is a manifest fraud.
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:50.940]  Now, I want to go into that and talk about this report in your latest book,
[2:15:50.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  but, you know, we go and interview Amy Goodman for Truth Rising.
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:59.940]  They just came out two months ago, three months ago, and she says, yeah, we need to investigate.
[2:15:59.940 --> 2:16:02.940]  They could have blown up Building 7. Michael Moore, he's in Truth Rising.
[2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:06.940]  He says, yeah, a lot of firefighters and cops, I know, said there was a countdown and bombs on Building 7
[2:16:06.940 --> 2:16:08.940]  and it could have been blown up.
[2:16:08.940 --> 2:16:15.940]  So, I mean, even Michael Moore is starting to come out and, you know, that is just so exciting.
[2:16:15.940 --> 2:16:22.940]  And then you look at the establishments counter to us and it's so flimsy and they won't debate most of the time.
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:24.940]  I mean, they act very guilty, don't they?
[2:16:24.940 --> 2:16:33.940]  Well, yeah, just the other day, you know, we know that you and other people have tried to get people who would come on
[2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:39.940]  and defend the official account, you know, people with any authority, any credibility to defend the official account,
[2:16:39.940 --> 2:16:42.940]  and they won't do it and that happened to me on 9-11.
[2:16:42.940 --> 2:16:47.940]  A French TV station had lined me up for an interview that morning
[2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:53.940]  and when I got on my computer and read my email, they said, oops, sorry,
[2:16:53.940 --> 2:16:58.940]  we couldn't find a single person in the English-speaking world who would agree to debate you,
[2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:04.940]  who would agree, you know, to defend the official story in a public debate.
[2:17:04.940 --> 2:17:11.940]  So, they write all these documents where they can just shout out, you know, their megaphone, here's the truth,
[2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:16.940]  but then they refuse to have any public discussion.
[2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:24.940]  You know, it was a couple years ago that the spokesperson for NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
[2:17:24.940 --> 2:17:32.940]  said that no NIST scientists would participate in any public discussion with scientists from the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:41.940]  So, they know that what they're saying is a big lie and they know they can't defend it with people who know what they're talking about.
[2:17:41.940 --> 2:17:46.940]  So, like Sarah Palin, they just keep quiet.
[2:17:46.940 --> 2:17:52.940]  Absolutely. We're going to break here in a few minutes, but particular today, I wanted to get your analysis on the NIST report
[2:17:52.940 --> 2:17:56.940]  because they contradict the previous statements in previous reports
[2:17:56.940 --> 2:18:02.940]  and so it appears that their official story is bleeding to death or is dead on the carpet in front of us
[2:18:02.940 --> 2:18:06.940]  and they somehow declared that their last report was some victory.
[2:18:06.940 --> 2:18:08.940]  I guess hoping no one would read it?
[2:18:08.940 --> 2:18:21.940]  Well, no one in the news media would report on what was in it and all the falsehoods and extreme exaggerations
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:26.940]  and impossibilities that the 9-11 Truth Movement has already brought out.
[2:18:26.940 --> 2:18:31.940]  And new phenomenons like thermal expansion and magnetics, I mean, it's something new here.
[2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:39.940]  And now we've got other federal branches and other groups are suing the government saying we can't put in new building codes off this science.
[2:18:39.940 --> 2:18:41.940]  It doesn't make sense.
[2:18:41.940 --> 2:18:49.940]  Well, you know, they all know this is a fraud, so they're just going to say, well, yeah, that report is true,
[2:18:49.940 --> 2:18:55.940]  but on the other hand, we don't have to take it serious. We don't have to do anything about it because, you know, we know it's not true,
[2:18:55.940 --> 2:18:57.940]  but publicly, we will say it's true.
[2:18:57.940 --> 2:19:03.940]  Well, it's been said the new form of demolition is to have a big lighter, go into a building, light a few filing cabinets on fire
[2:19:03.940 --> 2:19:06.940]  and the whole thing's going to fall down perfectly in a neat pile.
[2:19:06.940 --> 2:19:15.940]  Yeah, you can say, you know, tens of millions of dollars, you know, you don't have to hire these controlled demolition companies anymore.
[2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:24.940]  You just find a, you know, figure out that the people who built the building were so stupid, they would build it so that all, you know,
[2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:34.940]  if they've got 81 columns, that 80 of them will all depend on one, so all you have to do is find that one critical volume
[2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:41.940]  and cause it to go sideways and the whole building will collapse in virtually freefall speed.
[2:19:41.940 --> 2:19:47.940]  Yeah, all buildings now, of course, they never collapsed before, but now, since they did on 9-11, it's completely normal,
[2:19:47.940 --> 2:19:50.940]  so they're going to have to rebuild all the buildings.
[2:19:50.940 --> 2:19:55.940]  David Ray Griffin's our guest back in just a few minutes and we'll go into whatever areas he wants to
[2:19:55.940 --> 2:20:00.940]  and later we have time, take some of your phone calls, also get out his website and tell you about some of his books.
[2:20:00.940 --> 2:20:24.940]  Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com are my websites updated with unbelievable info daily.
[2:20:24.940 --> 2:20:30.940]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S. hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[2:20:30.940 --> 2:20:34.940]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions forcing the Yang Revolution.
[2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:40.940]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to
[2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:44.940]  spike hammering the U.S. housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[2:20:44.940 --> 2:20:48.940]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[2:20:48.940 --> 2:20:55.940]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China threatens nuclear option of dollar sales.
[2:20:55.940 --> 2:21:01.940]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237. The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[2:21:01.940 --> 2:21:06.940]  Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[2:21:06.940 --> 2:21:13.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:21:13.940 --> 2:21:17.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. Who is the enemy?
[2:21:17.940 --> 2:21:19.940]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[2:21:19.940 --> 2:21:22.940]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[2:21:22.940 --> 2:21:29.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:21:29.940 --> 2:21:36.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:21:36.940 --> 2:21:40.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:47.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[2:21:47.940 --> 2:21:52.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[2:22:06.940 --> 2:22:11.940]  We live in a world of vanishing privacy.
[2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:16.940]  The added threat of invisible radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them
[2:22:16.940 --> 2:22:19.940]  makes our privacy as citizens even less secure.
[2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:23.940]  The RFID tags and ID cards have been proven to be not secure.
[2:22:23.940 --> 2:22:27.940]  Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.

[2:24:50.940 --> 2:24:57.940]  Well, I don't know. Have you probably talked a whole lot about Barry Jennings?
[2:24:57.940 --> 2:25:01.940]  Absolutely, but let's discuss that. I want to get your perspective.
[2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:10.940]  Well, I do discuss it at some length in my new book, The New Pearl Harbor Revisited,
[2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:20.940]  which is my seventh book about 9-11. And as a purpose of the book, it's two...
[2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:24.940]  Some people have thought it's an updated edition of New Pearl Harbor, not at all.
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:29.940]  It's a completely new book, and the idea is that the two books are to be read together.
[2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:35.940]  The New Pearl Harbor tells you the story up until about 2004,
[2:25:35.940 --> 2:25:41.940]  and then the New Pearl Harbor takes it from there, beginning with the 9-11 commission report
[2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:46.940]  and then the NIST report and so on and so on.
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:54.940]  With regard to Jennings, of course, it's very convenient now that he has died
[2:25:54.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  and is convenient because he could have, if interviewed, contradicted
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:10.940]  and quite likely would have contradicted both the BBC report about him
[2:26:10.940 --> 2:26:19.940]  and then what the NIST report says here. The New NIST report on Building 7
[2:26:19.940 --> 2:26:29.940]  does mention reporting an explosion, but here's what they say in case you haven't heard this yet.
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:36.940]  They say, well, if he had heard an explosion or felt an explosion,
[2:26:36.940 --> 2:26:42.940]  that was the explosion that brought the building down, then he would have died.
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:47.940]  And that's their rebuttal to the notion that he reported an explosion
[2:26:47.940 --> 2:26:52.940]  because their general topic is, were any explosions going off in the building?
[2:26:52.940 --> 2:26:55.940]  And so they give you this false dilemma.
[2:26:55.940 --> 2:27:01.940]  Either there were no explosions in the building or Barry Jennings, they don't use his name,
[2:27:01.940 --> 2:27:08.940]  or Barry Jennings reported an explosion that would have killed him and therefore it's not true.
[2:27:08.940 --> 2:27:17.940]  That is the level of the whole NIST report, that kind of false dilemma.
[2:27:17.940 --> 2:27:24.940]  In case there are some listeners who don't know what Jennings told,
[2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:29.940]  and of course this was revealed first of all upon your show,
[2:27:29.940 --> 2:27:34.940]  was that he got there early that morning, he and Hess,
[2:27:34.940 --> 2:27:39.940]  and then they were going down the stairs, they were told to get out of there,
[2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:48.940]  and so it would have been about 9.15 that they felt this enormous explosion on the sixth floor,
[2:27:48.940 --> 2:27:54.940]  went back up to the eighth floor and waited at least an hour and a half, that's what Hess said,
[2:27:54.940 --> 2:28:01.940]  before they were rescued, and so here was an enormous explosion in the building early that morning.
[2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:09.940]  What NIST said was that when they tried to go down the elevator and it wouldn't work,
[2:28:09.940 --> 2:28:16.940]  that was because the South Tower had come down and of course that was 9.59,
[2:28:16.940 --> 2:28:20.940]  and then when they got down and thought they felt an explosion,
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:28.940]  that was really just the North Tower collapsing, so they just felt the effects of the North Tower collapse,
[2:28:28.940 --> 2:28:30.940]  which was at 10.28.
[2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:38.940]  Well that was ridiculous too, that means it would have taken all that time from 9.59 to 10.28,
[2:28:38.940 --> 2:28:46.940]  29 minutes to get down 15 flights of stairs, and Jennings said he was running,
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:52.940]  hopping down, jumping down, they were getting out of there, they thought as fast as they could.
[2:28:52.940 --> 2:29:00.940]  So that's what NIST said, and so when the BBC did its story on the building 7,
[2:29:00.940 --> 2:29:09.940]  they quoted, they had interviewed Jennings, and I'm sure he would have told them exactly what he told Dylan Avery
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:14.940]  that was played on your show, as far as the times,
[2:29:14.940 --> 2:29:22.940]  and yet they put it within their time framework so they made it appear that when he was talking about this explosion,
[2:29:22.940 --> 2:29:26.940]  it was at 10.28 when the North Tower came down,
[2:29:26.940 --> 2:29:34.940]  and so then they had to say that he and Hess weren't rescued until afternoon
[2:29:34.940 --> 2:29:38.940]  in order to allow the hour and a half after 10.28,
[2:29:38.940 --> 2:29:44.940]  and of course Hess was giving an interview before noon, a half mile away.
[2:29:44.940 --> 2:29:48.940]  Stay there, let's talk about this on the other side.
[2:29:48.940 --> 2:29:53.940]  Barry Jennings, our guest right now is David Ray Griffin, seven books.
[2:29:53.940 --> 2:29:57.940]  I know I've read three of them, we carry three of them at infowars.com.
[2:29:57.940 --> 2:30:00.940]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:30:00.940 --> 2:30:04.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:04.940 --> 2:30:12.940]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here,
[2:30:12.940 --> 2:30:16.940]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:30:16.940 --> 2:30:23.940]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:30:23.940 --> 2:30:32.940]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:30:32.940 --> 2:30:39.940]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:30:39.940 --> 2:30:42.940]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:30:42.940 --> 2:30:48.940]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:30:48.940 --> 2:30:51.940]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[2:30:51.940 --> 2:30:57.940]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide,
[2:30:57.940 --> 2:31:00.940]  or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:31:00.940 --> 2:31:06.940]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:10.940]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking.
[2:31:10.940 --> 2:31:16.940]  When it comes to this economy, the banks are crashing, the stock market's a mess, there's the mortgage crisis,
[2:31:16.940 --> 2:31:22.940]  there's the lending crisis, there's the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis,
[2:31:22.940 --> 2:31:24.940]  and we are paralyzed a little bit.
[2:31:24.940 --> 2:31:26.940]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[2:31:26.940 --> 2:31:30.940]  I don't know what to say, what can you do? Do what you can do, that's what you do, you do what you can do.
[2:31:30.940 --> 2:31:32.940]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:37.940]  I know there's a global food shortage, I can read it, I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this,
[2:31:37.940 --> 2:31:42.940]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.

[2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:32.940]  We got a mega huge guest coming on.
[2:33:32.940 --> 2:33:41.940]  It's like five, six days now, I get the butterflies.
[2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:46.940]  It's exciting.
[2:33:46.940 --> 2:33:51.940]  Dan Ray Griffin is our guest, another important guest.
[2:33:51.940 --> 2:33:55.940]  I'm very glad that he has joined us today.
[2:33:55.940 --> 2:34:01.940]  Barry Jennings died August 19.
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.940]  We began hearing it days after.
[2:34:03.940 --> 2:34:07.940]  Little blurbs on YouTube, Google, message boards.
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:11.940]  We did in-depth Google searches, Yahoo searches.
[2:34:11.940 --> 2:34:13.940]  Lexus Nexus could find nothing.
[2:34:13.940 --> 2:34:16.940]  We even bought data packages on his neighbors' home.
[2:34:16.940 --> 2:34:18.940]  Everything called his house over and over again.
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  They wouldn't call us back.
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:22.940]  We confirmed that with folks that had his number.
[2:34:22.940 --> 2:34:24.940]  Then we started calling his office over and over again.
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:26.940]  They wouldn't tell us if he was dead or not.
[2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:27.940]  Finally, they did.
[2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:28.940]  The spokesman called us back.
[2:34:28.940 --> 2:34:31.940]  The names, everything are on the story at infowars.com.
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:33.940]  Yes, he's dead.
[2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:37.940]  That's confirmed with the names from the New York Housing Authority.
[2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:40.940]  It's confirmed.
[2:34:40.940 --> 2:34:42.940]  We were walking through.
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:47.940]  The fact that he and Hess go out on TV that day with dust all over them and say,
[2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:50.940]  yeah, explosions in the building barely got out.
[2:34:50.940 --> 2:34:51.940]  This guy saved me.
[2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:52.940]  We were in building seven.
[2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:54.940]  Nobody was in there.
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:34:58.940]  Then you've got Giuliani and Kennedy with FEMA saying,
[2:34:58.940 --> 2:35:00.940]  oh, yeah, we were doing drills that day of an anthrax attack.
[2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:04.940]  We were out of the building, tripod two the night before.
[2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:08.940]  We were told to get out that morning that the building was going to fall
[2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:10.940]  before either tower had fallen, building seven.
[2:35:10.940 --> 2:35:14.940]  Then Giuliani and Kennedy said, oh, that's a mistake, or we never said that.
[2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:16.940]  They gave both stories.
[2:35:16.940 --> 2:35:19.940]  Then it came out in other testimony that he had indeed said that.
[2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:20.940]  Now he admits it.
[2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:22.940]  I mean, there's so much lying going on here.
[2:35:22.940 --> 2:35:27.940]  Let's keep walking through all of that and talk about, it's all suspicious that,
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:29.940]  but they won't tell us how he died.
[2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:30.940]  And it's so secret.
[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:34.940]  There's not even an obituary of a deputy emergency manager of that department.
[2:35:34.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  But David Ray Griffin, please continue.
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:43.940]  Well, yeah, this new NIST report then.
[2:35:43.940 --> 2:35:47.940]  You know, we had revealed, you had done it on your show.
[2:35:47.940 --> 2:35:48.940]  Dylan had done it.
[2:35:48.940 --> 2:35:51.940]  Jason's doing it.
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:59.940]  Barry told this story that is very different from what NIST and the BBC told.
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:05.940]  And the crucial point has to do with the timing because the issue is,
[2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:08.940]  was there a massive explosion, at least one.
[2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:11.940]  Actually, he reports on more.
[2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:16.940]  In the building early that morning, and they tried to claim that,
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:23.940]  that it was just the collapse of the North Tower, which didn't occur until 1028.
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:33.940]  And so, as I said, they then argued in the earlier NIST reports that he and Heth,
[2:36:33.940 --> 2:36:37.940]  again, they didn't use their names, but it's very clear who they're talking about,
[2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:43.940]  were not rescued until 1210 to 1215.
[2:36:43.940 --> 2:36:48.940]  And as I said, Heth was giving an interview on the street a half mile away,
[2:36:48.940 --> 2:36:53.940]  either at 1134 or 1157 that morning.
[2:36:53.940 --> 2:36:54.940]  And that's live television.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:56.940]  That's, I mean, so it's on record, that's wrong.
[2:36:56.940 --> 2:36:57.940]  That's right.
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:02.940]  And we've just published this on the internet now.
[2:37:02.940 --> 2:37:06.940]  So I've got a long introduction that explains the significance of the Heth interview.
[2:37:06.940 --> 2:37:07.940]  Give that address out.
[2:37:07.940 --> 2:37:09.940]  Give that address out.
[2:37:09.940 --> 2:37:23.940]  It's on peers, but if you just look under Michael Heth and building,
[2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:28.940]  and World Trade Center 7, I think if you Google that, it should come up.
[2:37:28.940 --> 2:37:32.940]  I don't have the exact website in front of me here.
[2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:33.940]  That's fine.
[2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:35.940]  Michael Heth's building 7, it'll pop up.
[2:37:35.940 --> 2:37:36.940]  Yeah.
[2:37:36.940 --> 2:37:37.940]  I think so.
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:38.940]  Sure.
[2:37:38.940 --> 2:37:44.940]  And so then we publicized this discrepancy.
[2:37:44.940 --> 2:37:48.940]  The fact that Heth had, was on the street.
[2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:56.940]  So he could, he had to have been rescued by 11 or if this 1157 time is right.
[2:37:56.940 --> 2:38:00.940]  I don't think it is, but if it is, at least by 1130.
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:06.940]  And so about 45 minutes earlier than NIST claims they were rescued.
[2:38:06.940 --> 2:38:10.940]  Well, so what do they do in the new report?
[2:38:10.940 --> 2:38:18.940]  They get rid of this 1210 to 1215 claim and just, and make it appear that they were rescued
[2:38:18.940 --> 2:38:26.940]  about 11 o'clock that morning, which would have allowed Heth to have been on the street
[2:38:26.940 --> 2:38:34.940]  a half mile away about at 1134, which is what I had reported in 9-11 contradictions.
[2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:37.940]  My book just before this last one.
[2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:44.940]  So it looks like they just withdrew that claim and made, and then tried to adjust to what
[2:38:44.940 --> 2:38:45.940]  we had revealed.
[2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:53.940]  But the problem is what Barry Jennings had said in his testimony, which is that after
[2:38:53.940 --> 2:39:00.940]  he and Heth felt this enormous explosion, went back up to the eighth floor, looked out the
[2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:06.940]  window, and he said, as you recall, I looked one way, I looked the other way, the two towers,
[2:39:06.940 --> 2:39:09.940]  the twin towers were still standing.
[2:39:09.940 --> 2:39:17.940]  So this means that what he felt occurred not only before the North Tower collapsed at 1028,
[2:39:17.940 --> 2:39:22.940]  but also before the South Tower collapsed at 959.
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:28.940]  So this shows that their story is a flat-out lie.
[2:39:28.940 --> 2:39:33.940]  And had Jennings lived, he could have been interviewed.
[2:39:33.940 --> 2:39:40.940]  And this could have been all over YouTube with Jennings saying they flat-out lied about
[2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:43.940]  what I told the BBC.
[2:39:43.940 --> 2:39:50.940]  And now NIST has flat-out lied about when we were, when I experienced this explosion.
[2:39:50.940 --> 2:39:54.940]  But more than just that, and that's key, it was a key witness that had to be gotten rid
[2:39:54.940 --> 2:39:58.940]  of, you have Heth coming out right around the time he dies denying everything, putting
[2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:03.940]  out things that we know aren't true, as you just laid out eloquently.
[2:40:03.940 --> 2:40:09.940]  But also, when you see there have been two different little BBC pieces, another one coming
[2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:15.940]  out that's reportedly got Jennings in it, and in that they don't even have him in there
[2:40:15.940 --> 2:40:20.940]  honestly denying things, they have an actor going through the motions without Hess with
[2:40:20.940 --> 2:40:26.940]  him in the re-enactment, and they tightly edit the real Jennings to where the only thing
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:31.940]  he really denies is saying, well, it looked like bodies, or felt like bodies, but he's
[2:40:31.940 --> 2:40:37.940]  clear in the interview with us for Luce Change Final Cut that he's saying that, no, they
[2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:40.940]  were saying, don't look down, we're stepping over bodies.
[2:40:40.940 --> 2:40:46.940]  He said, you can tell when you're walking over bodies.
[2:40:46.940 --> 2:40:53.940]  There was no doubt about the fact that he reported that there were bodies on the floor
[2:40:53.940 --> 2:40:58.940]  of the lobby as he was being taken out of the building.
[2:40:58.940 --> 2:41:04.940]  Just amazing, and now he's conveniently dead, and another eyewitness supposedly commits
[2:41:04.940 --> 2:41:08.940]  suicide, who had been there reporting bombs going off in one of the main towers, right
[2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:16.940]  around the same time, but we all know governments never assassinate anybody, so that's impossible.
[2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:21.940]  Yeah, now, so that's in the NIST report.
[2:41:21.940 --> 2:41:29.940]  That is, from my point of view, the most obvious flat-out lie, but there are so many others.
[2:41:29.940 --> 2:41:37.940]  In the New Pearl Harbor Revivated, I couldn't wait any longer for the NIST report on Building
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:42.940]  7, because every year they had promised it's going to come out next year, and then they
[2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:44.940]  would delay, and it would be next year.
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:51.940]  Finally, I went ahead and went to press to get this book out, hopefully by 9-11 of this
[2:41:51.940 --> 2:41:57.940]  year, and then the NIST organization did finally publish their report.
[2:41:57.940 --> 2:42:04.940]  I had predicted what they would argue, given what they had said in the past, and that they
[2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:11.940]  were probably going to use this scooped-out front of the building as a major claim, but
[2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:15.940]  as you said, they didn't make that.
[2:42:15.940 --> 2:42:21.940]  So everything they had been saying all these years, and news people and popular mechanics
[2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:28.940]  had all been confidently saying that there was no mystery about Building 7.
[2:42:28.940 --> 2:42:30.940]  NIST had essentially already solved it.
[2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:36.940]  They just hadn't quite put out their final report yet, and in fact, if you remember, popular
[2:42:36.940 --> 2:42:45.940]  mechanics referred to NIST's interim report as definitive, and it clearly wasn't because
[2:42:45.940 --> 2:42:55.940]  in this new report, they make up a new claim that is entirely implausible and continue
[2:42:55.940 --> 2:43:02.940]  to simply stonewall about all the evidence that contradicts it.
[2:43:02.940 --> 2:43:05.940]  That part of my prediction, I got right.
[2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:07.940]  Well, they have a big problem.
[2:43:07.940 --> 2:43:12.940]  I want you to elaborate on this, because in this movement of liberty and freedom and
[2:43:12.940 --> 2:43:17.940]  exposing false flag terror and other black ops, and we have a tendency to just glaze
[2:43:17.940 --> 2:43:22.940]  over our major victories, they've had to throw out, or partially throw out, or hopefully
[2:43:22.940 --> 2:43:28.940]  more, the five other reasons they gave for Building 7, bad craftsmanship, improperly built,
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:34.940]  fuel tank blows up, steel weakened by fire, 25% of the south face scooped out by the north
[2:43:34.940 --> 2:43:39.940]  tower falling, on and on and on, and then now they've had to come out and say, okay,
[2:43:39.940 --> 2:43:44.940]  it wasn't that, but because they don't have to rewrite all of engineering, and because
[2:43:44.940 --> 2:43:47.940]  they don't want there to be liability on those that built it, because there really isn't
[2:43:47.940 --> 2:43:51.940]  liability, and they know that'll be fought, and come out, and in court impeach them, they've
[2:43:51.940 --> 2:43:54.940]  had to just say basically, okay, there's a new phenomenon.
[2:43:54.940 --> 2:43:57.940]  Like, they've discovered a new particle, or they've discovered a new planet.
[2:43:57.940 --> 2:44:03.940]  I mean, this is a big deal in physics and in construction, and in the history of engineering.
[2:44:03.940 --> 2:44:06.940]  Thermal expansion and magnetic fields.
[2:44:06.940 --> 2:44:09.940]  I mean, the tooth fairy was there.
[2:44:09.940 --> 2:44:11.940]  I mean, this is incredible.
[2:44:11.940 --> 2:44:14.940]  So this is a massive route and defeat for them.
[2:44:14.940 --> 2:44:17.940]  They're just hoping people just hear, hey, open and shut.
[2:44:17.940 --> 2:44:19.940]  You heard what NIST said.
[2:44:19.940 --> 2:44:24.940]  Well, that's right, and of course, that's what the news channels did.
[2:44:24.940 --> 2:44:29.940]  They had the subtitle down there, 9-11 Mystery Solve.
[2:44:29.940 --> 2:44:32.940]  Last remaining 9-11 Mystery Solve.
[2:44:32.940 --> 2:44:40.940]  But if anybody actually looks at the report, and anybody who's curious can read Kevin Ryan's
[2:44:40.940 --> 2:44:48.940]  preliminary critique based on their preliminary draft, which is on 9-11 Blogger, and he gives
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:52.940]  a pretty good summary of some of the main problems.
[2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:57.940]  But essentially, what they do, as you say, they gave up the claim.
[2:44:57.940 --> 2:45:02.940]  Earlier we were hearing, oh, the building had become a towering inferno and all that stuff,
[2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:05.940]  and it couldn't withstand such heat.
[2:45:05.940 --> 2:45:10.940]  Well, now they admit the temperatures really weren't very high.
[2:45:10.940 --> 2:45:16.940]  And they were really, you know, fires were burning on only a few floors.
[2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:21.940]  Eventually, only four floors where fires lasted very long.
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:25.940]  And then there's this, they call a new phenomenon.
[2:45:25.940 --> 2:45:31.940]  Of course, it's not a new phenomenon at all that steel will expand if it gets hotter.
[2:45:31.940 --> 2:45:36.940]  But they say it expanded at remarkably low temperatures.
[2:45:36.940 --> 2:45:37.940]  That's what's amazing.
[2:45:37.940 --> 2:45:38.940]  That's right.
[2:45:38.940 --> 2:45:42.940]  Doesn't it generally expand at about 2,200 according to all the published?
[2:45:42.940 --> 2:45:47.940]  I went to major universities and UL studies of countless other fires, and they built the
[2:45:47.940 --> 2:45:51.940]  building for, you know, knowing that there might be fires in thermal expansion.
[2:45:51.940 --> 2:45:56.940]  And so magically, we're seeing thermal expansion when it never happens at that temperature previously.
[2:45:56.940 --> 2:45:57.940]  Yeah.
[2:45:57.940 --> 2:46:07.940]  And then remarkably, at even a very low temperature, the expansion was so great that it put pressure
[2:46:07.940 --> 2:46:19.940]  on column 79 and so that it made it move sideways and fail and therefore cause all the other
[2:46:19.940 --> 2:46:22.940]  columns, 80 columns in the building to fail.
[2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:26.940]  The problem is they've got real models have been done and you wouldn't have that symmetrical
[2:46:26.940 --> 2:46:29.940]  collapse even if that column failed.
[2:46:29.940 --> 2:46:31.940]  Well, no.
[2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:39.940]  And they try to get around that by claiming that it wasn't entirely symmetrical because
[2:46:39.940 --> 2:46:46.940]  they say there was a whole lot going on below the surface that the cameras didn't show.
[2:46:46.940 --> 2:46:56.940]  And so you had some failure inside, but then it produced what appeared to be a symmetrical
[2:46:56.940 --> 2:47:02.940]  collapse because it looked symmetrical from the outside and appeared to be at virtually
[2:47:02.940 --> 2:47:09.940]  freefall speed, but they want to say it really started several seconds earlier and then they
[2:47:09.940 --> 2:47:17.940]  count the initial collapse of the east penthouse as really the beginning of the collapse of
[2:47:17.940 --> 2:47:22.940]  the building even though they admit, you know, that the global collapse didn't begin until
[2:47:22.940 --> 2:47:25.940]  seven seconds before the whole thing had collapsed.
[2:47:25.940 --> 2:47:29.940]  We know in reality in a real control demolition from the countless Las Vegas videos, they
[2:47:29.940 --> 2:47:34.940]  blow central columns first, so when they blow the outers, it falls in instead of out damaging
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:39.940]  nearby real estate very hard to pull that particular type off so smoothly.
[2:47:39.940 --> 2:47:45.940]  So I guess it just magically mimics a beautifully done control demolition all by itself.
[2:47:45.940 --> 2:47:52.940]  Yeah, and then their PR propaganda here is to say, well, you know, the people have been
[2:47:52.940 --> 2:47:58.940]  claiming this was at freefall speed, which would have been about seven seconds, but really
[2:47:58.940 --> 2:47:59.940]  it wasn't.
[2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:03.940]  It was more like 13 seconds and that's not close to freefall at all.
[2:48:03.940 --> 2:48:08.940]  And they do that by counting that the collapse of the east penthouse.
[2:48:08.940 --> 2:48:10.940]  Which is blown first.
[2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:15.940]  Yeah, but the bulk of the building, what we normally think of as building seven, they
[2:48:15.940 --> 2:48:21.940]  admit global collapse happened in, I think they put at 6.9 seconds.
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:28.940]  Well, that is virtually freefall and that is a remarkable phenomenon, even if we say 13
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:29.940]  seconds.
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:37.940]  That is so remarkable beyond what would happen with any real phenomenon.
[2:48:37.940 --> 2:48:43.940]  Well, a lot of people like simple analogies, but take your iron cooking stove with blue
[2:48:43.940 --> 2:48:46.940]  flames under it that's over 2,000 degrees.
[2:48:46.940 --> 2:48:50.940]  I mean, you don't see it melting, you don't see it weakening, you don't see your fireplace
[2:48:50.940 --> 2:48:51.940]  great melting.
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:53.940]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:54.940]  Yeah.
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:49:05.940]  So, besides that, then they ignore the fact that there was steel melted and even though
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:14.940]  the FEMA report had come out and talked about this intergranular melting of steel that was
[2:49:14.940 --> 2:49:20.940]  sulfadized, you had steel that actually had holes developed in it, so it was described
[2:49:20.940 --> 2:49:27.940]  as looking like Swiss cheese, which the New York Times called the deepest mystery uncovered
[2:49:27.940 --> 2:49:31.940]  in the exploration of the World Trade Center collapses.
[2:49:31.940 --> 2:49:38.940]  And they specifically said that steel from both one of the towers and from building seven
[2:49:38.940 --> 2:49:44.940]  experienced this phenomenon and should be subjected to further study.
[2:49:44.940 --> 2:49:46.940]  What did NIST do?
[2:49:46.940 --> 2:49:48.940]  It didn't even mention it.
[2:49:48.940 --> 2:49:52.940]  Now listen, you've been so close to this everywhere, Griffin, and close to the physicists and
[2:49:52.940 --> 2:49:54.940]  scientists, so let's dumb this down.
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:56.940]  I mean, people like me, let's explain.
[2:49:56.940 --> 2:50:00.940]  Let's say thermal expansion really did this, which of course didn't.
[2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:05.940]  You're just going to have weakening, bowing, you're going to have things pushing out and
[2:50:05.940 --> 2:50:08.940]  then falling apart, that's why you wouldn't get a pretty fall down.
[2:50:08.940 --> 2:50:11.940]  But with thermate, with explosive thermite, you're going to have popping, you're going
[2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:13.940]  to have burn holes.
[2:50:13.940 --> 2:50:18.940]  You see, to melt through steel folks, especially to quickly melt through it, where you have
[2:50:18.940 --> 2:50:25.940]  pitted holes and things, we're talking 3500, 4000, not just steel melting at 27 to 3300,
[2:50:25.940 --> 2:50:28.940]  depending on its type of steel.
[2:50:28.940 --> 2:50:34.940]  I mean, we're talking about mega temperatures here to just be blasting little burn holes
[2:50:34.940 --> 2:50:38.940]  in it, so nothing to do with thermal expansion.
[2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:45.940]  And then sulfidation is direct derivative and a byproduct of the thermate, correct?
[2:50:45.940 --> 2:50:46.940]  That's right.
[2:50:46.940 --> 2:50:52.940]  And so their approach is to develop a theory and then ignore all the evidence that their
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:54.940]  theory won't fit.
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:51:00.940]  Instead, the thermite theory continued through scores of tests, continues to be validated
[2:51:00.940 --> 2:51:04.940]  through the scientific method over and over again and this just happens to be run by a
[2:51:04.940 --> 2:51:07.940]  bunch of top thermate experts, but we'll talk about that when we get back.
[2:51:07.940 --> 2:51:12.940]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:16.940]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:51:16.940 --> 2:51:21.940]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:24.940]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:51:24.940 --> 2:51:29.940]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:51:29.940 --> 2:51:30.940]  across America.
[2:51:30.940 --> 2:51:32.940]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[2:51:32.940 --> 2:51:34.940]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:51:34.940 --> 2:51:38.940]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:51:38.940 --> 2:51:39.940]  healthier I feel.
[2:51:39.940 --> 2:51:41.940]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:51:41.940 --> 2:51:46.940]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventive
[2:51:46.940 --> 2:51:49.940]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:12.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:12.940 --> 2:52:13.940]  against this country.
[2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:16.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:16.940 --> 2:52:17.940]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:18.940]  Bin Laden.
[2:52:18.940 --> 2:52:19.940]  This is his MO.
[2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:21.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:21.940 --> 2:52:23.940]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:52:23.940 --> 2:52:28.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:30.940]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:30.940 --> 2:52:35.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:52:35.940 --> 2:52:37.940]  in and on the U.S.
[2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:41.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:46.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:50.940]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[2:52:50.940 --> 2:52:51.940]  much, much more.
[2:52:51.940 --> 2:52:57.660]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with
[2:52:57.660 --> 2:52:59.940]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:59.940 --> 2:53:08.940]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:11.940]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[2:53:11.940 --> 2:53:14.940]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:18.940]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a
[2:53:18.940 --> 2:53:20.940]  whole week in advance?
[2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:22.940]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:27.940]  The guys over at eminiforcaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[2:53:27.940 --> 2:53:31.940]  They call it a G line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week
[2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:32.940]  in advance.
[2:53:32.940 --> 2:53:33.940]  Impossible?
[2:53:33.940 --> 2:53:38.940]  Head over to eminiforcaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:42.940]  Eminiforcaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.

[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:28.940]  This is Rob at eminiforcaster.com and I approve this message.
[2:54:31.940 --> 2:54:36.940]  Take my chances on you.
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:44.940]  Again and again.
[2:54:44.940 --> 2:54:48.940]  Coming straight on for you.
[2:54:48.940 --> 2:54:55.940]  Now I'm strong.
[2:54:55.940 --> 2:54:58.940]  Straight on.
[2:54:58.940 --> 2:55:02.940]  I carry three of his books at eminiforclores.com.
[2:55:02.940 --> 2:55:03.940]  One I really like.
[2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:04.940]  They're all excellent.
[2:55:04.940 --> 2:55:11.940]  You could say definitive is the debunking 9-11 debunking.
[2:55:11.940 --> 2:55:16.940]  And these are great to get to somebody that believes that ridiculous popular mechanics
[2:55:16.940 --> 2:55:19.940]  book or who's never read it just says, oh, that proves it.
[2:55:19.940 --> 2:55:21.940]  That proves the world is flat.
[2:55:21.940 --> 2:55:26.940]  Or that there really are leprechauns and pots of gold in Ireland.
[2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:31.940]  Debunking 9-11, debunking an answer to Popper Mechanics, Hearst Publishing,
[2:55:31.940 --> 2:55:34.940]  and other defenders of the official conspiracy theory.
[2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:36.940]  David Regriffon, available at eminiforclores.com.
[2:55:36.940 --> 2:55:38.940]  He's with us five minutes to the next hour.
[2:55:38.940 --> 2:55:39.940]  He wouldn't be longer.
[2:55:39.940 --> 2:55:40.940]  There's another interview coming up.
[2:55:40.940 --> 2:55:43.940]  David, tell us how we get the new book.
[2:55:43.940 --> 2:55:48.940]  Of course, at good bookstores everywhere.
[2:55:48.940 --> 2:55:51.940]  But it's available at Amazon.
[2:55:51.940 --> 2:55:53.940]  For some reason, they were very slow getting it.
[2:55:53.940 --> 2:55:56.940]  But it is available now.
[2:55:56.940 --> 2:55:57.940]  Or you can order it directly.
[2:55:57.940 --> 2:56:02.940]  If you want to order a book at discount, you can order directly from the publisher,
[2:56:02.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  which is interlinked books.
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:07.940]  And give us your website.
[2:56:07.940 --> 2:56:08.940]  There's so many.
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:09.940]  I'm not even sure.
[2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:10.940]  I don't have my own.
[2:56:10.940 --> 2:56:12.940]  You're just all over everywhere.
[2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:13.940]  So I just guess.
[2:56:13.940 --> 2:56:15.940]  Google David Regriffon.
[2:56:15.940 --> 2:56:19.940]  Yeah, you can find a lot of things that way.
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:20.940]  Absolutely.
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:25.940]  Okay, we've got about total time every time about eight minutes left in the segment the
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:26.940]  next.
[2:56:26.940 --> 2:56:28.940]  Any other key areas you want to cover?
[2:56:28.940 --> 2:56:34.940]  Well, yeah, let me just mention some of the other things where I bring the story up to
[2:56:34.940 --> 2:56:35.940]  date.
[2:56:35.940 --> 2:56:43.940]  So in the second chapter, I focus on Flight 11 and the Pentagon.
[2:56:43.940 --> 2:56:49.940]  And there you know, the support for the official story has been the eyewitness testimony.
[2:56:49.940 --> 2:56:56.940]  People who say, oh, well, sure, we saw Boeing airplane 757 coming in.
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:57:01.940]  And in this, I show that there's an enormous amount of eyewitness testimony on the ground,
[2:57:01.940 --> 2:57:07.940]  both inside and outside the building far more than we had before saying there simply was
[2:57:07.940 --> 2:57:08.940]  no plane.
[2:57:08.940 --> 2:57:12.940]  People come and it's just like Schenckville, you know, they look around and say, well,
[2:57:12.940 --> 2:57:13.940]  where's the plane?
[2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:16.940]  You think you would see something.
[2:57:16.940 --> 2:57:23.940]  So on the Bush attempt at, you know, what happened to Bush at the school, the fact he
[2:57:23.940 --> 2:57:30.940]  wasn't hustled out of there, I show that the White House even tried to change the story.
[2:57:30.940 --> 2:57:36.940]  Before that video surface that we've all seen in the Michael Moore movie, they tried to
[2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:41.940]  change the story on the first anniversary of 9-11 and said after Andy Card whispered
[2:57:41.940 --> 2:57:46.940]  in Bush's ear that Bush just sat there a second or two and got up and left the room.
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:49.940]  I know that the incredible lives they try to feed the public.
[2:57:49.940 --> 2:57:50.940]  Yeah.
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:51.940]  It's just.
[2:57:51.940 --> 2:57:52.940]  Yeah.
[2:57:52.940 --> 2:57:57.940]  Now probably the newest thing in the book for many readers will be the fact that the
[2:57:57.940 --> 2:58:01.940]  stronger evidence that there simply were no hijackers.
[2:58:01.940 --> 2:58:07.940]  In fact, there are two kinds of evidence that all the evidence that there were Muslim hijackers
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:12.940]  on the plane dissipates when looked at closely.
[2:58:12.940 --> 2:58:16.940]  And in some of the stories you can see, they just made them up.
[2:58:16.940 --> 2:58:23.940]  And then secondly, that there's evidence against there being any hijackers on the plane.
[2:58:23.940 --> 2:58:29.940]  So that the whole idea, and this is finally the bottom line, what it all comes down to,
[2:58:29.940 --> 2:58:33.940]  was America attacked by Muslims on 9-11.
[2:58:33.940 --> 2:58:40.940]  And one way to look at my book is there's a long argument saying absolutely no.
[2:58:40.940 --> 2:58:41.940]  All right.
[2:58:41.940 --> 2:58:42.940]  Stay there, David Ray Griffin.
[2:58:42.940 --> 2:58:49.940]  We'll be back in just 70 seconds for five more minutes.
[2:58:49.940 --> 2:58:51.940]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:51.940 --> 2:58:57.940]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:57.940 --> 2:58:59.940]  Now from the makers of Loose Change.
[2:58:59.940 --> 2:59:04.940]  The most downloaded film in Internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:10.940]  Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[2:59:10.940 --> 2:59:15.940]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[2:59:15.940 --> 2:59:17.940]  family members receive answers to their questions.
[2:59:17.940 --> 2:59:21.940]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[2:59:21.940 --> 2:59:25.940]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:59:25.940 --> 2:59:29.940]  Hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings.
[2:59:29.940 --> 2:59:33.940]  Loose Change Final Cut is the 1-9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:59:48.940 --> 2:59:51.940]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[2:59:51.940 --> 2:59:57.940]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[3:00:39.940 --> 3:00:43.940]  I am here, ladies and gentlemen, because there's so much stuff happening.
[3:00:43.940 --> 3:00:51.940]  They're banning homeschooling in California, running a financial 9-11, an economic terrorism right now.
[3:00:51.940 --> 3:00:54.940]  I'll be covering that, taking your calls in the next 55 minutes.
[3:00:54.940 --> 3:00:57.940]  But no prisonplanet.tv today.
[3:00:57.940 --> 3:00:59.940]  I am bowing out here.
[3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:02.940]  But four minutes left with David Ray Griffin.
[3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:04.940]  David, any other points you want to make?
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:06.940]  I do just want to get your take.
[3:01:06.940 --> 3:01:09.940]  I'm sure you've seen it by Skeptics Magazine.
[3:01:09.940 --> 3:01:14.940]  I mean, it's got to be more than 50-plus websites, groups, people that claim they're in our own movement,
[3:01:14.940 --> 3:01:21.940]  COINTELPRO, some others just pick it up and parrot it, saying 9-11 Truth's dead, nobody cares, nobody's listening.
[3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:26.940]  There are a bunch of polls showing 60-something percent believe it's an inside job,
[3:01:26.940 --> 3:01:28.940]  80-something percent don't believe the official story,
[3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:33.940]  then other weird polls from questionable groups only showing 30% thinking inside job,
[3:01:33.940 --> 3:01:36.940]  which sounds like, ooh, that's a lot, but I think that's disinfo.
[3:01:36.940 --> 3:01:42.940]  We're seeing, I mean, all the evidence says 9-11 Truth is really growing faster than ever,
[3:01:42.940 --> 3:01:45.940]  and getting peer reviewed now, and going over all the hurdles,
[3:01:45.940 --> 3:01:48.940]  and we just keep hearing a drum beat, it's dead, it's dead, it's dead.
[3:01:48.940 --> 3:01:51.940]  That looks like a lot of propaganda to me.
[3:01:51.940 --> 3:01:53.940]  Your take on that.
[3:01:53.940 --> 3:01:58.940]  Yeah, that's, you know, it's wishful thinking and lying.
[3:01:58.940 --> 3:02:06.940]  Annie McCone, who's the head of the UK 9-11 movement, was just up by the other day,
[3:02:06.940 --> 3:02:14.940]  and said that the movement in Europe has become much stronger this last year, and much more unified.
[3:02:14.940 --> 3:02:21.940]  So they are really getting on the story over there, as exemplified, of course, by the Italians,
[3:02:21.940 --> 3:02:28.940]  and then the growth in Asia, exemplified by Fujita from Japan,
[3:02:28.940 --> 3:02:32.940]  and by the way, I'm going over to Japan later this fall.
[3:02:32.940 --> 3:02:33.940]  Congratulations.
[3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:39.940]  You had an ad there for Loose Change Final Cut, and I want to put in a word about that.
[3:02:39.940 --> 3:02:47.940]  It seems like it hasn't caused quite the buzz that the previous editions of Loose Change did,
[3:02:47.940 --> 3:02:51.940]  and I think that's partly due to the fact that now there is so much competition,
[3:02:51.940 --> 3:02:53.940]  there's so much good stuff out there.
[3:02:53.940 --> 3:02:57.940]  Well, I mean, there's been millions of Google and YouTube views, that's a huge victory,
[3:02:57.940 --> 3:02:59.940]  it's just not hundreds of millions.
[3:02:59.940 --> 3:03:03.940]  Yeah, but I think part of the reason may be that many people suspect,
[3:03:03.940 --> 3:03:08.940]  oh, it's Loose Change, it's just an updated edition of Loose Change 2,
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:11.940]  and I've seen it, and they're probably in enough new here.
[3:03:11.940 --> 3:03:15.940]  Well, let me say, I was, of course, the script consultant for Loose Change Final Cut.
[3:03:15.940 --> 3:03:16.940]  It's entirely new.
[3:03:16.940 --> 3:03:17.940]  It is entirely new.
[3:03:17.940 --> 3:03:19.940]  It's an entirely new film.
[3:03:19.940 --> 3:03:24.940]  Also, as script consultant, I sort of had veto power.
[3:03:24.940 --> 3:03:27.940]  I couldn't get everything in I wanted, but I could keep things out.
[3:03:27.940 --> 3:03:30.940]  I didn't want that I thought weren't credible.
[3:03:30.940 --> 3:03:36.940]  And so, all the objections people had to Loose Change Final Number 2.
[3:03:36.940 --> 3:03:37.940]  No, it's very, very clean.
[3:03:37.940 --> 3:03:38.940]  It's very, very serious.
[3:03:38.940 --> 3:03:41.940]  Yeah, where they would say, oh, well, this discredits it.
[3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:43.940]  None of that stuff is in there.
[3:03:43.940 --> 3:03:46.940]  This is all really, really solid stuff.
[3:03:46.940 --> 3:03:57.940]  So, I regard it, along with Zero, the film made by the Italian Keza, as equally good.
[3:03:57.940 --> 3:04:02.940]  People differ on which one is better, but I see them as equally good.
[3:04:02.940 --> 3:04:07.940]  So, let me say one more thing about the hijackers.
[3:04:07.940 --> 3:04:13.940]  A new thing, a story that I told in the new book, the New Pearl Harbor Revisited, that
[3:04:13.940 --> 3:04:19.940]  I hadn't dealt with before, was the so-called Amy Sweeney Call.
[3:04:19.940 --> 3:04:23.940]  She was the flight attendant on Flight 11.
[3:04:23.940 --> 3:04:32.940]  And we were told that she made a 12-minute cell phone call to the headquarters there
[3:04:32.940 --> 3:04:38.940]  in Boston, to Michael Woodward, and reported the hijackers, and that's how we learned
[3:04:38.940 --> 3:04:41.940]  that it was Al-Qaeda because she gave the seat numbers.
[3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:48.940]  And a 12-minute cell phone call from an airliner, of course, was absolutely ridiculous.
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:53.940]  And so, the FBI has now changed the story, and I hadn't realized this before.
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:54.940]  That's right.
[3:04:54.940 --> 3:04:56.940]  They've been backing off all their official lines.
[3:04:56.940 --> 3:04:58.940]  They are the ones being discredited.
[3:04:58.940 --> 3:05:02.940]  David Ray Griffin, let's get you up soon, okay?
[3:05:02.940 --> 3:05:03.940]  Okay.
[3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:05.940]  Thanks for all the time, and congratulations on the new book.
[3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:07.940]  Let me say bye to you off air.
[3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:09.940]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:13.940]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance,
[3:05:13.940 --> 3:05:15.940]  or contact a poison control center immediately.
[3:05:15.940 --> 3:05:18.940]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[3:05:18.940 --> 3:05:23.940]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling,
[3:05:23.940 --> 3:05:27.940]  then you need solely smile on natural tooth powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.
[3:05:27.940 --> 3:05:33.940]  Soleil Smile contains 84 mineral-rich Himalayan sea salt, baking soda, and xylitol,
[3:05:33.940 --> 3:05:36.940]  a sugar substitute with long-lasting dental benefits.
[3:05:36.940 --> 3:05:40.940]  Soleil Smile comes in five flavors, made from grade A essential oils,
[3:05:40.940 --> 3:05:42.940]  so I know it'll please even your kids.
[3:05:42.940 --> 3:05:46.940]  You'll also appreciate the convenient two-ounce airline safe size.

[3:06:07.940 --> 3:06:10.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[3:06:10.940 --> 3:06:14.940]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:14.940 --> 3:06:16.940]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:06:16.940 --> 3:06:18.940]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:18.940 --> 3:06:19.940]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:20.940]  This is his MO.
[3:06:20.940 --> 3:06:21.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:06:21.940 --> 3:06:23.940]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:06:23.940 --> 3:06:26.940]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[3:06:26.940 --> 3:06:30.940]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:30.940 --> 3:06:33.940]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[3:06:33.940 --> 3:06:37.940]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:37.940 --> 3:06:41.940]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:45.940]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[3:06:45.940 --> 3:06:48.940]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:06:48.940 --> 3:06:51.940]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:06:51.940 --> 3:06:54.940]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,
[3:06:54.940 --> 3:06:56.940]  or see it in super high quality,
[3:06:56.940 --> 3:07:00.940]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:07:00.940 --> 3:07:29.940]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:39.940]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[3:07:39.940 --> 3:07:42.940]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations
[3:07:42.940 --> 3:07:46.940]  have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[3:07:46.940 --> 3:07:48.940]  Will they use them on America?

[3:08:00.940 --> 3:08:06.940]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[3:08:06.940 --> 3:08:08.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[3:08:08.940 --> 3:08:11.940]  probably presents the Alex Jones show
[3:08:11.940 --> 3:08:14.940]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:19.940 --> 3:08:22.940]  We reported on this six months ago.
[3:08:22.940 --> 3:08:24.940]  I'm not tooting our horn.
[3:08:24.940 --> 3:08:28.940]  I'm just glad that people finally paid attention to it.
[3:08:28.940 --> 3:08:30.940]  It's strange.
[3:08:30.940 --> 3:08:37.940]  Some moderate-sized website can report on something,
[3:08:37.940 --> 3:08:39.940]  and it gets huge attention.
[3:08:39.940 --> 3:08:43.940]  But then our gigantic websites, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[3:08:43.940 --> 3:08:46.940]  report on something, and it doesn't get as much.
[3:08:46.940 --> 3:08:50.940]  I mean, I had a listener send me the appeals court ruling
[3:08:50.940 --> 3:08:54.940]  in California saying that no one can have their children
[3:08:54.940 --> 3:08:57.940]  in homeschool unless you are government-approved
[3:08:57.940 --> 3:09:01.940]  and have a teaching certificate from an accredited college.
[3:09:01.940 --> 3:09:05.940]  Doesn't matter if homeschoolers have higher test scores
[3:09:05.940 --> 3:09:10.940]  or better than even the best prep schools for Ivy League.
[3:09:10.940 --> 3:09:13.940]  They are the best in every study, everywhere.
[3:09:13.940 --> 3:09:17.940]  We did a big report on that original for prisonplanet.com
[3:09:17.940 --> 3:09:21.940]  like six months ago, and it just blipped on the radar screen.
[3:09:21.940 --> 3:09:24.940]  And finally, it's all over the web.
[3:09:24.940 --> 3:09:27.940]  There's a bunch of stories about it.
[3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:30.940]  I'm actually trying to find it on infowars.com.
[3:09:30.940 --> 3:09:35.940]  It was posted last night, and the reason I thought of it
[3:09:35.940 --> 3:09:38.940]  to mention it, see, we have a problem here.
[3:09:38.940 --> 3:09:41.940]  We're so close to the tyranny, so close to all the things
[3:09:41.940 --> 3:09:46.940]  that are happening that now is everything we foretold
[3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:50.940]  is unfolding, we're not even tuning our horns,
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:52.940]  which is important because then it gives us credibility
[3:09:52.940 --> 3:09:55.940]  to point out, hey, in this article, hey, in this radio show,
[3:09:55.940 --> 3:10:00.940]  we said this, we said that, and that we are specifically right,
[3:10:00.940 --> 3:10:05.940]  you know, that we're so on target.
[3:10:05.940 --> 3:10:08.940]  Where is it? It was posted yesterday. I'll find it.
[3:10:08.940 --> 3:10:11.940]  The reason I thought of it to get into it in this hour
[3:10:11.940 --> 3:10:14.940]  is we now have an info wars poll that we put up a new one
[3:10:14.940 --> 3:10:17.940]  every day or two. This one is, tens of thousands
[3:10:17.940 --> 3:10:20.940]  are responding to these, and it's one time per IP address,
[3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:22.940]  so it's somewhat scientific.
[3:10:22.940 --> 3:10:24.940]  California appeals court has ruled that homeschooling
[3:10:24.940 --> 3:10:26.940]  of children is illegal.
[3:10:26.940 --> 3:10:28.940]  Does California have the right to enact such a law?
[3:10:28.940 --> 3:10:31.940]  No, the state has no authority over the education of children.
[3:10:31.940 --> 3:10:34.940]  One, two, yes, there should be standards for education.
[3:10:34.940 --> 3:10:37.940]  Three, I don't have children, so I'm not concerned.
[3:10:37.940 --> 3:10:42.940]  And you can vote, but it's telling me I already voted,
[3:10:42.940 --> 3:10:44.940]  so now I've backed out of the page.
[3:10:44.940 --> 3:10:48.940]  I need to be able to see what the, it says,
[3:10:48.940 --> 3:10:51.940]  you have already voted for this poll, ID five.
[3:10:51.940 --> 3:10:54.940]  I know, but I backed out, and now I can't see.
[3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:56.940]  I think it was a couple thousand votes since this morning,
[3:10:56.940 --> 3:10:58.940]  and the vast majority, if you go look at it,
[3:10:58.940 --> 3:11:00.940]  now I don't have the number.
[3:11:00.940 --> 3:11:02.940]  It won't let me in there, it won't let me in.
[3:11:02.940 --> 3:11:05.940]  I'm not trying to vote twice, I want to see the number.
[3:11:05.940 --> 3:11:07.940]  That's up there, so we're going to get to that.
[3:11:07.940 --> 3:11:09.940]  I've got a big stack here, I want to go through it,
[3:11:09.940 --> 3:11:12.940]  and then I'll go over it, but I'll get the number.
[3:11:12.940 --> 3:11:14.940]  After I take some calls, and I will at least take
[3:11:14.940 --> 3:11:17.940]  the five calls that are holding Bruce,
[3:11:17.940 --> 3:11:20.940]  Wes, Charles, Brian, Eric, and maybe a few others.
[3:11:20.940 --> 3:11:22.940]  I want to recap the economic news, get to some new news
[3:11:22.940 --> 3:11:24.940]  that came out.
[3:11:24.940 --> 3:11:26.940]  I want to go check the financials before I do that,
[3:11:26.940 --> 3:11:29.940]  and then get into the homeschooling and some other incredible news.
[3:11:29.940 --> 3:11:32.940]  It's all just off the charts, but again,
[3:11:32.940 --> 3:11:34.940]  we're some of the worst here being acclimated to it.
[3:11:34.940 --> 3:11:37.940]  We're just like, oh yeah, announcing troops are going to be on the streets.
[3:11:37.940 --> 3:11:43.860]  everything. Oh yeah, they're saying parents don't control their children. Oh yeah, it's just all off
[3:11:43.860 --> 3:11:50.740]  the charts here. I'm going to go home after the show, I'm going to sleep, and then I'm going to be
[3:11:50.740 --> 3:12:00.580]  on coast to coasty tonight for three hours, going over all of this. But that is coming up. But I
[3:12:00.580 --> 3:12:06.500]  wanted now to play the end, or at least part of the end, of Donahue trying to demonize. He starts
[3:12:06.500 --> 3:12:11.220]  backing off towards the end. The ADL and others are babbling, demonizing the militia, the paranoid
[3:12:11.220 --> 3:12:15.140]  militia that thinks the government's planning to bankrupt the economy by the bankers, by design,
[3:12:15.140 --> 3:12:18.820]  and thinks they want to come after our guns, and thinks they want to have warrantless wiretapping,
[3:12:18.820 --> 3:12:23.460]  and thinks that they want to CPS people's kids. I mean, everything they mentioned here 14 years ago
[3:12:24.260 --> 3:12:28.580]  is coming through or has come through. So we'll play this and we'll come back in the next segment
[3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:34.020]  and take your call. Stay with us. Come in and expose it and stop it and take the people. You sound
[3:12:34.020 --> 3:12:38.100]  like you're going to be Gandhi. You're going to walk out there unarmed and stand between the police
[3:12:38.100 --> 3:12:42.580]  and the children. You're right. But yes, but we have the testimony of at least one of your members
[3:12:42.580 --> 3:12:48.020]  that he's going to let somebody have it if they come unauthorized in his view in his property.
[3:12:48.020 --> 3:12:52.820]  You can ask millions of American gun owner Americans, non-militia members, when they come to get my
[3:12:52.820 --> 3:12:58.420]  guns, they'll have to take it on my cold dead hand. And you know it's true, and that's life. They
[3:12:58.420 --> 3:13:02.820]  believe in the Second Amendment of the Constitution. You cannot come and confiscate my weapons. And
[3:13:02.820 --> 3:13:07.540]  if you do, I'm going to defend myself with at least one of them. You can say in the last 18 months
[3:13:07.540 --> 3:13:12.340]  you've watched gun sales and ammunition sales skyrocket. We didn't buy them all. The American
[3:13:12.340 --> 3:13:18.260]  public did. Millions. Millions. They did not buy 200 scrolls. I got involved with this when I first
[3:13:18.260 --> 3:13:22.580]  went into a gun show and I asked the lady, why are you buying these things? They said, because we
[3:13:22.580 --> 3:13:37.700]  are fearful of our government and we'll be back in just a moment. Yes, got much time now. What I
[3:13:37.700 --> 3:13:43.060]  think you're doing is praying on people's fears and creating the same tensions that created
[3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:51.460]  when we had Hitler's Nazism. I have read the Constitution. I have read all of it.
[3:13:51.460 --> 3:13:56.020]  What you're trying to do is twist it to your own means. Ma'am, you do not know what we're doing.
[3:13:56.020 --> 3:14:00.180]  You don't know us, ma'am. You don't know us. You don't know me, but I do know that we do need
[3:14:00.180 --> 3:14:05.940]  laws against guns. There's nothing I can do any more than fascism. And Hitler's Nazi, you don't
[3:14:05.940 --> 3:14:13.460]  know us. I talked to Dick Loganfau from the Detroit area ADL and he told me that every fascist
[3:14:13.460 --> 3:14:20.100]  government starts out with a democracy where the Constitution suspended temporarily.
[3:14:20.100 --> 3:14:27.700]  Hitler's Germany, folks. Over here, please. I'm not from Montana, but I've never had a FBI agent
[3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:33.620]  or a sheriff ever knock on my door for every reason, for any reason. And one other thing is...
[3:14:33.620 --> 3:14:37.620]  There are so many inner-city people that want you to know that this is happening.
[3:14:38.420 --> 3:14:46.420]  Okay, all right. If you don't understand, at least we have a responsibility as citizens
[3:14:46.420 --> 3:14:52.180]  to understand that there is enough evidence to go around that auto-alarm anybody interested in
[3:14:52.180 --> 3:14:56.100]  the Bill of Rights. If you don't care about the Bill of Rights, then really, what the hell is the
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:15:01.700]  point of this whole American experiment? That's the whole... But these people who are... I think
[3:15:01.700 --> 3:15:07.300]  it's called paranoia and the best cure for that would be a nice little shot of Prozac that could
[3:15:07.300 --> 3:15:13.220]  take care of their... Yeah, for a while. That's all they need. If you see C's and they define,
[3:15:13.220 --> 3:15:18.340]  they would be paranoid of you. Would you say to the little children that Waco... Hey, honey,
[3:15:18.340 --> 3:15:24.660]  don't be so paranoid. No, Michael Sam isn't going to do this. I don't think they had a right to
[3:15:24.660 --> 3:15:28.260]  combine the First and Second Amendment. I don't think if you have freedom of religion,
[3:15:29.060 --> 3:15:34.020]  freedom of their arms has the same thing to do with each other. You should be able to have your
[3:15:34.020 --> 3:15:39.460]  religion without having your arms. The point was that the Constitution of the United States
[3:15:39.460 --> 3:15:45.620]  basically was created on a God-fearing group of people. That's the extent of that. We're not
[3:15:45.620 --> 3:15:50.580]  espousing special religion here. How many of you really know what the Second Amendment of the
[3:15:50.580 --> 3:15:56.020]  Constitution says? It also... Now, for the Constitution, not as Phil said, but it also says
[3:15:56.020 --> 3:16:01.140]  that we have the right to form militias to people. You do also, but we have the right to form militias
[3:16:01.140 --> 3:16:05.860]  as well as the right to keep and bear arms all in one sentence. Phil, that is a total distortion
[3:16:05.860 --> 3:16:10.660]  of the Second Amendment to the Constitution. This guy doesn't have the foggiest idea of what that
[3:16:10.660 --> 3:16:25.380]  amendment... Yeah, there's more to it. The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[3:16:25.940 --> 3:16:32.020]  And also, the establishment of a militia is declared... You know that it says a well-regulated
[3:16:32.020 --> 3:16:39.140]  militia necessary with the security of the state. The militia is a military force of the state
[3:16:39.140 --> 3:16:45.380]  government. The Second Amendment is in the bill of rights, the bill of rights for guarantees to
[3:16:45.380 --> 3:16:50.980]  the people, not to the government. Please let me say that we have on the stage represented three
[3:16:50.980 --> 3:16:58.100]  states in which there is militia activity. Considerable amount of it. The New York Times has reported
[3:16:58.100 --> 3:17:04.340]  on your states and others. Florida has considerable militia activity. I think the Mr. Fletcher,
[3:17:04.340 --> 3:17:09.780]  he of the many photographs, and now here he comes with a report, would want to say that...
[3:17:09.780 --> 3:17:14.580]  Would want to say that what, half our states now have militia activity? No, no, no. Probably...
[3:17:14.580 --> 3:17:20.980]  Probably what? Probably... Phil, here's a fact. I have 48 states that have militia activity,
[3:17:20.980 --> 3:17:28.660]  25% of the counties, I can document every one of them. And we'll be back in just a moment.
[3:17:34.660 --> 3:17:38.660]  I just want to say that there are other ways besides arms not to stop this. I mean, you don't
[3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:42.580]  have to go to arms all the time. We agree. The battle box is a way to do it. And all you want to do is
[3:17:42.580 --> 3:17:46.020]  share the problems with us. Yes. I've sat here with an open mind and listening to you guys,
[3:17:46.020 --> 3:17:49.700]  and so far you haven't told me anything. You're like afraid of Russians and people in hoods.
[3:17:49.700 --> 3:17:54.260]  I don't see that. You haven't said anything to me. Yes. Give me a few more years of life,
[3:17:54.260 --> 3:17:58.100]  you'll see much more stuff. You have way too much time on your hands. You need a hobby.
[3:18:01.700 --> 3:18:05.780]  I'm sure I can get a lot of people to join my organization too, if I could give everyone a gun,
[3:18:05.780 --> 3:18:10.020]  and especially gentlemen, I know they like this, to run around in the woods and shoot them and play
[3:18:10.020 --> 3:18:19.940]  war games. Those of you that don't quite get a handle on it and don't quite understand it, contact
[3:18:19.940 --> 3:18:24.900]  us there in Knox and Montana, and we'll give you things such as examples of Bill Clinton's
[3:18:26.340 --> 3:18:32.900]  emergency rules that he just laid down June the 3rd. This is the entire document from martial law.
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:37.940]  You can read it yourself. Thank you. So where are all the women on the stage? Yeah. You have women,
[3:18:37.940 --> 3:18:44.100]  are women part of the militia? Absolutely. What do the women do? Do they identify?
[3:18:46.660 --> 3:18:55.780]  They're worried about what's happening. I think the reasons you're giving, there's
[3:18:55.780 --> 3:19:00.820]  nothing triggering this kind of response to all this military action. There's nothing. You talk
[3:19:00.820 --> 3:19:10.740]  about Waco, there's nothing. Everybody I talk to in the press says Waco. When I mention other
[3:19:10.740 --> 3:19:17.540]  cities, it seems to go over everybody's head. Your sheriff and your county condemn what the feds
[3:19:17.540 --> 3:19:23.540]  did in Waco. We've got it on tape to prove it. Excuse me, you. This young woman wanted to say,
[3:19:23.540 --> 3:19:29.860]  17 children died in Waco. You hold no responsibility to David Koresh for that. He was a pedophile.
[3:19:29.860 --> 3:19:34.580]  He was a racist. He believed he was Jesus Christ. There's only one Jesus Christ that I've never
[3:19:34.580 --> 3:19:39.380]  met. He wasn't David Koresh. He couldn't have come and got him any time. He went jogging. He went
[3:19:39.380 --> 3:19:44.580]  to coffee shops in town. It had nothing to do with him. You know, Phil, there's no doubt. He wasn't
[3:19:44.580 --> 3:19:49.460]  even there. You know, Phil, there's no doubt. Mr. Heningen would like your attention for just a
[3:19:49.460 --> 3:19:53.940]  moment. Mr. Heningen is with the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. Sir. No, these folks are so
[3:19:53.940 --> 3:19:59.540]  concerned about those kids killed in Waco. What about the 15 children that die every day in this
[3:19:59.540 --> 3:20:03.460]  country because of gunfire? That is a natural tragedy.
[3:20:08.340 --> 3:20:14.900]  Hello. This is Tom with hempusa.org. Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months,
[3:20:14.900 --> 3:20:19.700]  and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors. If you've
[3:20:19.700 --> 3:20:25.140]  been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family,
[3:20:25.140 --> 3:20:32.340]  the time to act is now. At hempusa.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset

[3:21:03.860 --> 3:21:10.580]  or visit us at hempusa.org today. May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a
[3:21:10.580 --> 3:21:16.580]  message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being
[3:21:16.580 --> 3:21:20.820]  a puppet from the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was
[3:21:20.820 --> 3:21:25.700]  it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A. Park, the U.S.,
[3:21:25.700 --> 3:21:30.820]  and the House of Shadow? The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[3:21:30.820 --> 3:21:36.980]  the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:21:36.980 --> 3:21:47.540]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you? If you know that there's
[3:21:47.540 --> 3:21:52.100]  treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on
[3:21:52.100 --> 3:21:57.300]  6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:22:03.140]  anniversary of 9-11. Choose Rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD

[3:22:11.620 --> 3:22:16.420]  The stock market is crazy. The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:21.060]  It's time to think about what is important. Most forget just how important life is.
[3:22:21.700 --> 3:22:27.940]  Life change tea removes toxins, chemicals, parasites, and bacteria that store up in your
[3:22:27.940 --> 3:22:33.700]  body. It cleanses you and gives you results in hours. And one of the wonderful side effects

[3:23:07.460 --> 3:23:12.500]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[3:23:12.500 --> 3:23:17.460]  and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food,
[3:23:17.460 --> 3:23:22.260]  energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[3:23:22.260 --> 3:23:26.100]  Is this a flaw for enterprise? Or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve
[3:23:26.100 --> 3:23:31.140]  Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[3:23:31.140 --> 3:23:35.540]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[3:23:35.540 --> 3:23:40.740]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[3:23:40.740 --> 3:23:44.980]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[3:23:44.980 --> 3:23:49.860]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases
[3:23:49.860 --> 3:23:57.220]  this book. Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today. It's critical that the public be made
[3:23:57.220 --> 3:24:13.140]  aware of the system. Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:24:13.140 --> 3:24:28.580]  Oh, it's hard to cut this song off, isn't it?
[3:24:28.580 --> 3:24:42.340]  Living on the road, my friend, was gonna keep you free and clean. And now you wear your skin like
[3:24:42.340 --> 3:24:47.780]  our, and your breath is hard. I love how that militia commander to that young kid says,
[3:24:47.780 --> 3:25:00.180]  son, give it a few years. You're gonna find out we're telling you the truth. Ah, what hindsight does
[3:25:00.180 --> 3:25:07.060]  makes it so clear, doesn't it? There's no more time to live in the dial.
[3:25:07.060 --> 3:25:20.980]  The time is now to resist the new world order and all of its allied forces.
[3:25:37.300 --> 3:25:41.620]  California and other states are openly announcing that homeschooling is illegal.
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:46.420]  The army saying they're gonna control the streets of America.
[3:25:48.580 --> 3:25:53.300]  They've secretly hired, now it's admitted, the preachers, 20-something thousand of them to tell
[3:25:53.300 --> 3:25:59.060]  their flock to turn their guns in. The private banks are taking over the whole economy.
[3:25:59.060 --> 3:26:07.700]  The pension funds, the denial, has to end.
[3:26:07.700 --> 3:26:12.500]  We're gonna cover all this news in the next segment. Bruce in Connecticut, here on the year,
[3:26:12.500 --> 3:26:18.660]  worldwide. Hey, Alex. Hey, good to talk to you. Yeah, great shows last couple of weeks.
[3:26:18.660 --> 3:26:25.620]  My sister sent me a quote. If you don't mind, I could read it. Go ahead. All right, this is in the
[3:26:25.620 --> 3:26:32.420]  congressional record, number 26, volume 118, by a Dr. Jose M. R. Delgado, director of
[3:26:32.420 --> 3:26:38.260]  Neuropsychiatry, Yale University. He stated, we need a program of
[3:26:38.260 --> 3:26:43.300]  psychosurgery for political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of
[3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:49.220]  the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated. The individual may
[3:26:49.220 --> 3:26:54.660]  think that the most important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal viewpoint.
[3:26:54.660 --> 3:27:00.180]  Man, does that have the right to develop his own mind? We must electrically control the brain.
[3:27:00.180 --> 3:27:05.540]  Yeah, there are thousands of such quotes where they say the families of disease must be eradicated.
[3:27:05.540 --> 3:27:09.060]  There's even videos of them saying it. That's the ruling class. Go ahead.
[3:27:09.780 --> 3:27:14.820]  So you go, some day armies in general will be controlled by electronic stimulation of the brain.
[3:27:15.540 --> 3:27:19.380]  And now they're shifting over to that. Oh, you want to be a father pilot. You've got to take
[3:27:19.380 --> 3:27:23.460]  this interface. I haven't seen that particular quote, but I've seen many quotes like it.
[3:27:23.460 --> 3:27:25.300]  This is February 1974.
[3:27:27.940 --> 3:27:33.940]  Very interesting, sir. Yeah, my sister turned me out to 911 truth a couple of years ago, and I've
[3:27:33.940 --> 3:27:41.060]  been reading and listening and watching all your videos. I read David's books, you know, Ray Griffin
[3:27:41.060 --> 3:27:46.820]  and a couple others and my God, what a mess we're in, huh? And it's only going to get worse until
[3:27:46.820 --> 3:27:51.060]  we get the general public to stop being cattle. Bruce, good to hear from you. Weston, Idaho,
[3:27:51.060 --> 3:27:59.060]  you're on the air. Oh, hello. Hi, Wes. Mercy. I've been waiting since you had Anthony Hilder on.
[3:27:59.060 --> 3:28:04.580]  What would you rather me not go to your call? I'm sorry. I want to talk about the Illuminati,
[3:28:04.580 --> 3:28:14.500]  if possible. Go ahead. You have made a film about the Illuminati. I want to get to the root of this
[3:28:14.500 --> 3:28:24.740]  tree. It was only formed in 1776, correct? No. No, one, one incarnation of what was called the
[3:28:24.740 --> 3:28:32.820]  Illuminated Ones, Ingolstadt University 1776 in Bavaria, Germany. But you can go back to Machiavelli
[3:28:32.820 --> 3:28:40.340]  and others in the 15th and 1600s with it. And it goes back to Solomon's Temple and back to Egypt
[3:28:40.340 --> 3:28:48.260]  and Babylon. Let's go back even further, or at least right now to the founding of the Illuminati.
[3:28:48.260 --> 3:28:54.660]  You seem to be avoiding the issue that Mayor Amchel Rothschild actually financed
[3:28:55.540 --> 3:29:04.420]  Adam Weissop to form the Illuminati, which is based upon the teachings of the Talmud,
[3:29:04.420 --> 3:29:12.100]  which is and turn the teachings of the rabbinical Jews. This comes from one of Tex Marz's books.
[3:29:12.660 --> 3:29:16.420]  Hold on. I'm going to hold you over. But first off, you come on and say you've been on hold too
[3:29:16.420 --> 3:29:21.140]  long. Then you say I'm avoiding something. Tex Marz has been in here about five, six times this year.
[3:29:21.780 --> 3:29:27.700]  I had a bunch of other guests on this year. You asked where the Illuminati came from and I said
[3:29:27.700 --> 3:29:32.660]  Solomon's Temple before you open your mouth about that. Now, it's not intellectually fair
[3:29:32.660 --> 3:29:39.460]  to say I'm covering something up when I said it before you even opened your mouth and accused me
[3:29:39.460 --> 3:29:45.460]  of that. I mean, how in the world do you do that? I mean, I said, did I screen your call to call in
[3:29:45.460 --> 3:29:53.860]  here? I don't know. Oh, you don't know. That's really friendly of you. You know what? Stay there.
[3:29:53.860 --> 3:30:01.220]  We're going to come right back to you. Okay? We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:30:01.220 --> 3:30:04.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:08.020 --> 3:30:13.220]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space
[3:30:13.220 --> 3:30:19.220]  at work. Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation
[3:30:19.220 --> 3:30:24.900]  in Sydney. Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston online from
[3:30:24.900 --> 3:30:30.420]  my desk with WebEx. WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk. I just talked
[3:30:30.420 --> 3:30:34.660]  to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop
[3:30:34.660 --> 3:30:39.380]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel. Travel less,

[3:31:08.180 --> 3:31:13.940]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[3:31:13.940 --> 3:31:20.260]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Ben Laden. This is
[3:31:20.260 --> 3:31:24.980]  his M.O. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Ben Laden. Fabled enemies
[3:31:24.980 --> 3:31:29.620]  is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:31:29.620 --> 3:31:34.900]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[3:31:34.900 --> 3:31:42.020]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:42.020 --> 3:31:47.220]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:31:47.220 --> 3:31:51.460]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[3:31:51.460 --> 3:31:58.020]  much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with
[3:31:58.020 --> 3:32:04.580]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[3:32:08.420 --> 3:32:13.060]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[3:32:13.060 --> 3:32:17.620]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[3:32:17.620 --> 3:32:22.420]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:32:22.420 --> 3:32:28.260]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[3:32:28.260 --> 3:32:33.940]  lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:32:33.940 --> 3:32:39.700]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[3:32:39.700 --> 3:32:44.100]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:32:44.100 --> 3:32:49.060]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF Shower Filter normally,

[3:33:06.340 --> 3:33:19.700]  All right, I want to get to Charles, Brian, Eric, and Ricardo and hit some news, some financial
[3:33:19.700 --> 3:33:27.300]  information before this transmission ends in T-minus 26 and a half minutes. But we had Michael
[3:33:27.300 --> 3:33:34.420]  Hoffman on twice this year. What I don't like by the crew out there that the claims I don't cover
[3:33:34.420 --> 3:33:39.460]  this is that I've always talked about every issue. I've always discussed everything.
[3:33:40.820 --> 3:33:45.460]  And even before you accused me of not talking about the Illuminati having roots back to Solomon,
[3:33:45.460 --> 3:33:53.300]  I said it before you accused me. I mean 10 seconds before. And so, sir, what I'm saying is when you
[3:33:53.300 --> 3:33:57.220]  call, they just ask your first name and where you were calling from. If you volunteer that you
[3:33:57.220 --> 3:34:01.860]  disagree, you will get preferential treatment and go to the head of the line. And I said,
[3:34:01.860 --> 3:34:06.340]  did we screen your call? And you said, I don't know. I mean, do you think that would be giving,
[3:34:06.340 --> 3:34:11.300]  you know, in, in the intellectual debate somehow to me? Was your call screened when you called in?
[3:34:11.300 --> 3:34:18.660]  Wes? No. Okay, because a lot of the people that put him on hold, put him on hold, put him on hold.
[3:34:18.660 --> 3:34:23.300]  Listen, you're going to be able to talk, Wes, but you're not going to be able to lie about me,
[3:34:23.300 --> 3:34:31.060]  okay? I am not going to put up with this anymore. Now, let's get one thing straight. We don't screen
[3:34:31.060 --> 3:34:35.460]  your calls that people claim we do. It's a lie. Anybody can call in and find out for themselves.
[3:34:35.460 --> 3:34:41.140]  Hey, except maybe once a month when I say, you know, the topic is this, our guest is on about
[3:34:41.940 --> 3:34:45.940]  black holes. We're talking about that or our guest is on about little red fire engines. We're
[3:34:45.940 --> 3:34:52.500]  talking about that. Now, instead of talking about how I'm bad, you've got your time on air right now.
[3:34:52.500 --> 3:34:59.300]  You can say whatever you want, Wes, okay, but I'm going to interrupt you if you make stuff up about
[3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:07.460]  me. Now, make your point about the Illuminati. Okay. Once again, I said the Illuminati is based
[3:35:07.460 --> 3:35:14.660]  on the teachings of the Talmud, which is in turn the teaching of the rabbinical Jews. So let's quickly
[3:35:14.660 --> 3:35:23.460]  switch to Freemasonry. Here is a quote from Rabbi Isaac Wise. Freemasonry is a Jewish establishment
[3:35:23.460 --> 3:35:29.380]  which history, grades, official appointments, passwords, and explanations are Jewish from
[3:35:29.380 --> 3:35:34.580]  beginning to end. Now, why don't you have Victor Thorne on there if you're going to talk about
[3:35:34.580 --> 3:35:39.700]  9-1-1. You've read his book. That's enough. That's enough. Okay. I'm not going to have
[3:35:39.700 --> 3:35:46.500]  Scott Mafutka up with his operation. Okay. I don't allow those top of operations to be run on me.
[3:35:46.500 --> 3:35:54.180]  Now, sir, you called in. You made false claims. We cover all issues here. I am not going to let
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:59.860]  people pick fights with me to then get into these little battles. I'm the big fish in all of this,
[3:35:59.860 --> 3:36:05.700]  and believe me, I don't like it most days. And so people obsess on Alex Jones. They try to pick
[3:36:05.700 --> 3:36:13.780]  fake fights with me so that they think I will build them up in debates. It is not going to happen.
[3:36:13.780 --> 3:36:21.780]  Now, I happen to have had a true scholar on because he's respected. His information is
[3:36:22.340 --> 3:36:28.180]  accurate. I have read his books over a decade ago. I have researched it. Dr. Michael Hoffman
[3:36:28.180 --> 3:36:33.540]  will probably have him back on, you know, for two, three hour interviews. And I have had Jeff
[3:36:33.540 --> 3:36:41.220]  Rents and so many others up here. And Texmars married my wife and I. I do not like the Jewish
[3:36:41.220 --> 3:36:46.740]  mysticism, the New World Order stuff. And I criticize that and I expose Kabbalah and I talk
[3:36:46.740 --> 3:36:54.420]  about it all the time and sacred geometry and all the rest of it. And so I just can't play along
[3:36:54.420 --> 3:37:01.460]  with the lie that we don't cover this and we don't get into it. Okay. Now, I tend to disagree,
[3:37:01.460 --> 3:37:09.780]  and of course, Hoffman agrees with this, that it is solely a Jewish thing,
[3:37:09.780 --> 3:37:15.620]  but it's like if you have three guys rob a bank and you convict them all of robbing the bank,
[3:37:15.620 --> 3:37:21.220]  it doesn't mean the German, the Jew and the Chinese guy are less guilty than each other.
[3:37:22.580 --> 3:37:29.780]  I happen to have studied esoterica. Okay. And Tex, any of these people who you're naming,
[3:37:29.780 --> 3:37:36.740]  I can have on the show to explain to you that the library in Alexandria was lost. It burned.
[3:37:36.740 --> 3:37:43.300]  And other libraries during the sacking of Rome were lost. But we know that it is Babylon mystery
[3:37:43.300 --> 3:37:53.620]  religion. It's the same religion in Greece, the same religion in Egypt, the same religion in
[3:37:53.620 --> 3:38:04.580]  Babylon on the Tigris Euphrates, 35 miles south of Baghdad in Iraq. And that is where this pre-Christian
[3:38:04.580 --> 3:38:09.700]  stuff comes from. That's what the Masons worship. Now, the Jews, being big writers and scholars,
[3:38:09.700 --> 3:38:15.300]  codified it, developed it and carried it through. And after during the dark ages and the sackings
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:20.900]  and the destruction and the Visigoths sacking of Rome by Alaric in 410, that was carried forward
[3:38:20.900 --> 3:38:25.380]  by them. So in its modern incarnation, it certainly is. And I'm not debating you,
[3:38:26.820 --> 3:38:31.300]  but I will not promote or have on people that have lied about me, that have slandered me,
[3:38:31.300 --> 3:38:36.340]  that have been all these things, sir. You know, the people you mentioned say that this show is
[3:38:36.340 --> 3:38:43.540]  owned and run by ABC. That that's not true. Now, I do have an AT&T cell phone. I am not working
[3:38:43.540 --> 3:38:49.700]  for AT&T. One of the three satellites we have is a leased feed for five and a half thousand dollars
[3:38:49.700 --> 3:38:55.380]  a month from ABC. And every station owner out there is laughing because they know that's the
[3:38:55.380 --> 3:38:59.780]  receivers radio stations have and you go lease time to be on that, whether it's a baseball game
[3:38:59.780 --> 3:39:05.700]  or a game of P. Knuckle. So that's the type of distortions and lies that come out of the people
[3:39:05.700 --> 3:39:15.460]  that you want me to have on this show. And I have serious news, sir. The private banking
[3:39:15.460 --> 3:39:22.180]  establishment is taking over our entire society right now. This is not a bailout. This is a
[3:39:22.180 --> 3:39:27.700]  takeover of the entire economy. And I broke that down in detail in the first hour. This is so serious
[3:39:27.700 --> 3:39:33.460]  that I'm sick today. But I came in here. I know the time is short. And I just don't have time for
[3:39:33.460 --> 3:39:37.140]  all this infighting. Now, I don't believe you're coming to El Pro. You sound like a well-meaning
[3:39:37.140 --> 3:39:42.340]  old guy up in Idaho West. And if you'd have called in here, you could have had three or four minutes
[3:39:42.340 --> 3:39:47.460]  on air like every other caller to say whatever you wanted about that. No one screams you. No
[3:39:47.460 --> 3:39:54.260]  one censored you. No one stopped you to come on and say it. But I will not sit here and hear a
[3:39:54.260 --> 3:40:00.820]  bunch of bull about how I'm bad. And we've laid out what's happening. We're a platform
[3:40:00.820 --> 3:40:04.980]  to expose what's going on, to build up other talk show hosts, to build up other websites.
[3:40:04.980 --> 3:40:11.140]  And I have an open hand to everybody that doesn't lie and slander and attack me. Okay?
[3:40:14.420 --> 3:40:18.420]  You know, I am not a Scientologist. But there are millions who think I am because of liars.
[3:40:19.380 --> 3:40:23.860]  I am not Alex S. Jones that runs a Shorin teen center. But I've gotten death threats a week ago
[3:40:23.860 --> 3:40:29.780]  over that. He's 70 years old or something. It's not me. I'm not a black guy named Alex Jones who's
[3:40:29.780 --> 3:40:35.300]  some Catholic promoter. And I'm not against Catholics either. But I'm not a Catholic. And it's not
[3:40:35.300 --> 3:40:39.940]  fair when my family helped found Texas as Protestant revolutionaries,
[3:40:41.860 --> 3:40:47.460]  the heirs, the Johnsons and others. And you sit there and tell me that I'm some Vatican
[3:40:47.460 --> 3:40:54.980]  Tooth Fairy. Listen, I'm not going to play along with your lies. I mean, I just can't do it with you.
[3:40:56.020 --> 3:41:02.100]  This is about reality. This is about what's veritas. I said I'd go to calls. I have all
[3:41:02.100 --> 3:41:06.820]  this homeschooling news, all this tyranny news, Marines implicated in mainstream news and the
[3:41:06.820 --> 3:41:13.140]  bombing and Islamabad in Pakistan. So much is going on. We're in so much trouble.
[3:41:13.140 --> 3:41:18.260]  And the New World Order knows it can go into our movement and just get us all fighting with each
[3:41:18.260 --> 3:41:24.980]  other. Look, this isn't about Alex Jones. What have you done today, Wes, to expose the New World
[3:41:24.980 --> 3:41:32.660]  Order and to try to bring people together? What have you done? What have you done? I mean, what
[3:41:32.660 --> 3:41:42.900]  can I do for you? I'm here. What you say is a fraud. Who you promote. The last thing is
[3:41:42.900 --> 3:41:50.900]  a fraud. And if I know someone lies about me on hundreds of issues, then I disregard them.
[3:41:53.380 --> 3:41:57.300]  All it is is people trying to make names for themselves. Like I'm the biggest, baddest,
[3:41:57.300 --> 3:42:02.980]  quickest draw gunfighter. That's the analogy. And they're going to want to try to get me in a gunfight
[3:42:02.980 --> 3:42:09.380]  with them to build up their cred, to build up their name. That's not what this is about. This is a
[3:42:09.380 --> 3:42:14.020]  mission-oriented radio show to reach as many people as we can and wake up as many people as we can.
[3:42:14.580 --> 3:42:17.540]  Not to get into hot-button stuff and turn people off and get into
[3:42:17.540 --> 3:42:24.980]  balkanization and divide and conquer. Okay? We go where the truth is, nothing more. But we don't
[3:42:24.980 --> 3:42:32.660]  do it in a politicized, bigoted way. And that's why people lie and say we don't cover all the
[3:42:32.660 --> 3:42:39.700]  issues. We do. Now you asked me where the Illuminati came from and I told you it came from King Solomon,
[3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:52.260]  the son of David. And you said I'm covering up that it has Jewish origins. Before you accused me
[3:42:52.260 --> 3:43:00.740]  of it, I said it. I said what you said before you said it. And then you take that from me.
[3:43:00.740 --> 3:43:08.980]  You take my bold stance. You take my truth. You repeat the truth right after I said it and
[3:43:08.980 --> 3:43:17.940]  then say I didn't say it. That is a grand illusion. God help you. I've got all this news. I'm going
[3:43:17.940 --> 3:43:21.860]  to hurry. Each caller gets one minute. I'm sorry for cheating Charles and Brian and others,
[3:43:21.860 --> 3:43:27.700]  but I just spent too long with the West. Charles, go ahead. Go ahead, Charles. You're on the air
[3:43:27.700 --> 3:43:34.580]  from California. Hi, Alex. Hello. Thanks for taking my call. God bless you. I'd like to make a
[3:43:34.580 --> 3:43:38.180]  couple of points. The first thing I was going to say was about fluoride and all that because I
[3:43:38.180 --> 3:43:42.580]  think it's like the main thing is all the shrugging down. But we can't warn people that the fluoride
[3:43:42.580 --> 3:43:46.420]  is killing them in the water because it's the Jews, the Jews. We've got to hate Jews. That's the
[3:43:46.420 --> 3:43:51.140]  answer. Just repeat the word Jew over and over again. That's why I was just going to say I wanted
[3:43:51.140 --> 3:43:56.020]  to just stop the fluoride talk for a second. I was going to go into my other point was the Roth
[3:43:56.020 --> 3:44:01.300]  Child because I was searching up the timeline of their family yesterday. By the way, I made a film
[3:44:01.300 --> 3:44:07.460]  in-game about the Roth Childs running things. Yeah. I'm a Sephardic Jew from New Jersey and all
[3:44:07.460 --> 3:44:11.780]  this. I feel like the last caller, I was glad when you said that, I'm not going to play into this
[3:44:11.780 --> 3:44:16.100]  whole, you know, blame the Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, because like that's all it is. There's a lot of
[3:44:16.100 --> 3:44:20.340]  people that just want to go after the Jews, Jews, Jews. Meanwhile, you know, like you said, this
[3:44:20.340 --> 3:44:25.140]  has developed thousands of years, whatever it's been, and then it was taken, you know, by the Roth
[3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:30.660]  Child and whatever. But, um, what I wanted to ask you- And by the way, the Roth Child, you know,
[3:44:30.660 --> 3:44:36.260]  took over 100,000 Sephardic kids and radiated a many to death. Right. And also, I was reading that
[3:44:36.260 --> 3:44:41.940]  they were like basically planning this whole like, you know, put all the Jews in Israel, get them out
[3:44:41.940 --> 3:44:47.300]  of Europe. Yeah. The Zionists supported Hitler. Right. I know. And they funded the whole Holocaust.
[3:44:47.300 --> 3:44:53.300]  Listen, I try to tell all my friends, I'm from the biggest community of, you know, Jews from New
[3:44:53.300 --> 3:44:58.340]  Jersey, New York. I try to wake all of them up as many as I can. A lot of them, they're still stuck
[3:44:58.340 --> 3:45:02.180]  on, you know, seeing skinheads in the parking lot and getting mad at those people. Like, they're
[3:45:02.180 --> 3:45:06.900]  the Nazis. Like, they're the ones that funded the Holocaust and all this shit, all this stuff.
[3:45:06.900 --> 3:45:12.020]  You know what I mean? It's really, it's really sad. And that's why I'm saying the main obstacle, I feel
[3:45:12.020 --> 3:45:17.860]  like, is the fluoride, is the drugging, is the gumming down of America. Because, you know, the
[3:45:17.860 --> 3:45:22.260]  people you could get across to are really just the intelligent people. They're really the people
[3:45:22.260 --> 3:45:26.900]  that still have a brainless, you know what I mean? That could still, could take. I hear you and we
[3:45:26.900 --> 3:45:32.980]  need to depoliticize it and not make it a hateful thing. Then the truth can be told. Right. And
[3:45:32.980 --> 3:45:37.300]  that's why I, right away, because some people just say, oh yeah, if McCain wins, I'm going to move to
[3:45:37.300 --> 3:45:43.300]  Canada. I'm like, um, you ever hear the North American Union? And did you ever know that? You
[3:45:43.300 --> 3:45:46.980]  know, he talks to the people say that. And then they say like, it's such a crucial time in history.
[3:45:46.980 --> 3:45:51.220]  I'm like, yeah. So you think that people that are running this country and that are above our
[3:45:51.220 --> 3:45:56.580]  government are going to allow some random black guy who's just going to give the power to the
[3:45:56.580 --> 3:46:01.620]  people to win the Democrats. No, they let him in. He's there. Call me back later, Charles. I
[3:46:01.620 --> 3:46:07.780]  got to move on. No matter how good your call is. It comes down to this. There's Zionist documents,
[3:46:07.780 --> 3:46:11.300]  there's British documents, there's government documents where the people that are involved
[3:46:11.300 --> 3:46:16.260]  in all this evil stuff, they want to make it vicious and hateful and with a shaved head and a
[3:46:16.260 --> 3:46:22.980]  howl Hitler, so that it's a poison pill. They want to radicalize people. That's why there's
[3:46:22.980 --> 3:46:27.940]  bullying in the movement to make it as just horrible and vicious as possible. So that,
[3:46:27.940 --> 3:46:32.820]  so that it's an unpalatable movement. They're basically coming into the middle of our party
[3:46:33.700 --> 3:46:38.420]  or waking people up, black, white, old, young, Jewish, German, Chinese, doesn't matter.
[3:46:38.420 --> 3:46:44.980]  Native American, Mexican, we're coming together. And they want to say, just basically,
[3:46:44.980 --> 3:46:49.460]  you know what, they climb on the top of the table, the punch bowl, and you know what they do,
[3:46:49.460 --> 3:46:54.500]  they pull their pants down and they do something in the punch bowl. And they say that anybody
[3:46:54.500 --> 3:46:59.540]  else that won't do that in the punch bowl is bad. You know, I don't even want to bash illegal
[3:46:59.540 --> 3:47:03.140]  aliens anymore because I realize that's playing into balkanization. Oh, they're being used to
[3:47:03.140 --> 3:47:08.980]  tear down the country, break down the border, but I need to lovingly explain that and put that out
[3:47:08.980 --> 3:47:13.220]  so that it doesn't then add into the new world order where we're all fighting with each other.
[3:47:13.220 --> 3:47:18.420]  God, I don't care if you're a Jew, Gypsy, Chinese, Mexican, I don't want you drinking the deadly
[3:47:18.420 --> 3:47:25.860]  fluoride water. And we have all these scientific guests on. I, you know, we're folks, it's so far
[3:47:25.860 --> 3:47:31.700]  gone that I just don't even know what to say anymore. I am just not, I mean, it's painful to
[3:47:31.700 --> 3:47:36.740]  have to come on here and talk about how horrible and wicked Israel is because there's a lot of
[3:47:36.740 --> 3:47:41.620]  people that misunderstand that and it'll hate me, but I still do it. There's a lot of people,
[3:47:41.620 --> 3:47:46.820]  you know, who are Jewish, who'd have nothing to do with the new world order. Just like a lot of
[3:47:46.820 --> 3:47:50.420]  Germans have to do with Hitler or a lot of people that are British who aren't involved in the new
[3:47:50.420 --> 3:47:54.660]  world order. I get emails saying, why are you bashing British people? My last name is Jones,
[3:47:54.660 --> 3:48:01.540]  folks. I'm not bashing Brits. You know, it's like the old cliche of you're not bashing Italians to
[3:48:01.540 --> 3:48:06.180]  say that La Cosa in Austria is Italian. And I come from it from that perspective. And, you know,
[3:48:06.180 --> 3:48:10.100]  the anti-Semites, they first said, oh, we're not against Jews, we're against Zionists. But now
[3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:13.860]  they'll tell you everywhere, it's Jews, Jews are evil, but rest them, get them. And, you know,
[3:48:13.860 --> 3:48:18.260]  that's a load of bull. 98% of Jews out there don't know about the new world order.
[3:48:19.620 --> 3:48:24.580]  Just the same as everybody else. It's a load of bull. The people are blind and aren't aware of
[3:48:24.580 --> 3:48:30.500]  what's happening. I want to come back in the final segment and blitz through some financial news.
[3:48:30.500 --> 3:48:35.700]  We're just out of time and I can't take any more calls. If you call back tomorrow, Brian and Eric
[3:48:35.700 --> 3:48:40.100]  and Ricardo, I'll get to you first. I want to come back in the final segment and hit some key
[3:48:40.100 --> 3:48:46.980]  information. But I'm not going to let my message be tainted and pulled down by a bunch of ego maniacs
[3:48:46.980 --> 3:48:50.420]  that if I put on a Hitler uniform, they'd still attack me because that's what they do.
[3:48:51.540 --> 3:48:55.060]  It's just, it's bad. And they don't like it because I criticize Hitler. Hitler was bad.
[3:48:55.780 --> 3:49:01.380]  You know, it's just unbelievable. Before I go to break, folks, a few sponsors that make this
[3:49:01.380 --> 3:49:07.940]  show possible, eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, the longest continually operating storeable foods

[3:49:18.340 --> 3:49:22.740]  you have your own bread, they say. And it's true. Now with inflation, the threat of war,

[3:54:49.380 --> 3:54:53.460]  Look, in the first hour, I know we'll be on the MNFM dial shortwave that'll rear tonight
[3:54:53.460 --> 3:54:59.540]  on stations everywhere. I went through what this bailout really is and it's so much worse
[3:54:59.540 --> 3:55:03.060]  than even most people know. I'll be on Coast to Coast AM tonight for three hours covering that
[3:55:03.860 --> 3:55:08.820]  and other key issues. But Ted Anderson's been watching a lot of the hearings the last few
[3:55:08.820 --> 3:55:14.580]  days where they're admitting all this. They're taking over the whole economy. It's a takeover.
[3:55:14.580 --> 3:55:20.580]  It's not a bailout. Ted Anderson, bottom line. Gold went crazy today. The stock market went down.
[3:55:20.580 --> 3:55:24.020]  Last time I checked, where is gold in the stock market right now, Ted? Well, high today,
[3:55:24.020 --> 3:55:29.700]  gold 903-60. We're seeing it right now at 80. Broke 900. Broke 900. Oh, it did. Yeah. Major
[3:55:29.700 --> 3:55:34.020]  psychological barrier. They cannot suppress it. It should be above 3,000. Yeah. Then of course,
[3:55:34.020 --> 3:55:39.220]  silver 1369. That's up. I mean, it was a strong day in the precious metals market. The
[3:55:39.860 --> 3:55:44.260]  watching these guys go back and forth about this whole bailout deal. I mean, it's
[3:55:44.260 --> 3:55:48.660]  half the people are in with the new world order. Some of the, you should hear every one of these
[3:55:48.660 --> 3:55:52.740]  congressmen are telling, my constituents are telling me that they don't want this thing and
[3:55:52.740 --> 3:55:58.020]  how can I explain this to them? Why would this be good? You know, it's crazy to watch this whole
[3:55:58.020 --> 3:56:02.020]  deal. And by the way, the market is falling. See, it's terrorism. The market will fall. The market
[3:56:02.020 --> 3:56:06.500]  will die if you don't do this. And then literally, Paulson has turned it into a private hedge fund.
[3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:11.140]  They're grabbing up all the banks, using the regulators. This is a takeover. The next hour on
[3:56:11.140 --> 3:56:16.100]  the info wars refeed, folks. I detail it. It is just off the charts. Ted, we don't have much time.
[3:56:16.100 --> 3:56:19.940]  I cover it in the next hour for the info war stream listeners. You cannot miss it. I'm going
[3:56:19.940 --> 3:56:24.900]  to recap it right here at the end. But before we do that, you've got gold. What is it? 30 something
[3:56:24.900 --> 3:56:30.580]  bucks below what it's trading at right now? This is just a great deal. It hurts the new
[3:56:30.580 --> 3:56:34.500]  world order to get out of their paper money. Protect yourself while there's still time. Ted,
[3:56:34.500 --> 3:56:37.860]  tell me about the golden silver offer. Oh yeah, right now we have British sovereigns. They're
[3:56:37.860 --> 3:56:44.100]  at $247 and I've got Franks at the 198. I mean, those are just fabulous buys because the fact
[3:56:44.100 --> 3:56:49.860]  that gold is so strong. Again, the silver right now at $1.60 on the dimes, same thing. I mean,
[3:56:49.860 --> 3:56:54.420]  the market is going, it's gyrating and it's going so well on the golden silver market. But Ted,
[3:56:54.420 --> 3:56:59.300]  explain. I mean, you walked in this supply of gold and silver you had before. It just went up another
[3:56:59.300 --> 3:57:03.380]  30 bucks. Well, that's right. And that's why I've been able to hold on. But I'm really surprised
[3:57:03.380 --> 3:57:08.500]  that we haven't seen gold and silver jump even higher than it is right now because all the
[3:57:08.500 --> 3:57:12.580]  indicators are showing that that's going to happen. This is a buying opportunity. Now,
[3:57:12.580 --> 3:57:16.100]  tell them about the golden silver. Tell them specific. Well, specifically, first of all,
[3:57:16.100 --> 3:57:21.140]  it's the physicals in such short supply. Get the British sovereigns. They're currently right now
[3:57:21.140 --> 3:57:27.300]  at $247. The Franks are a fifth of an ounce of gold. They're at 198. And the silver is probably
[3:57:27.300 --> 3:57:32.180]  the shortest thing that I have. It's hard to get silver right now. It's at $1.60 for the dimes.
[3:57:32.180 --> 3:57:36.900]  And I just can't say that enough. Right now, at this particular time, you can't get into this
[3:57:36.900 --> 3:57:43.300]  stuff. The market is so hot. There's just so many people calling on it. It's like one of the
[3:57:43.300 --> 3:57:47.940]  number one things that are that are Google Fortune magazine as a picture of a gold coin right on
[3:57:47.940 --> 3:57:51.620]  front of it. That's right. They can try to suppress its price, but they can't. But they're running
[3:57:51.620 --> 3:57:55.540]  out of supply. Ladies and gentlemen, every indicator says they're killing the dollar,
[3:57:55.540 --> 3:58:00.260]  and it's only going to go up. But regardless, they can't devalue this. This is real. You need
[3:58:00.260 --> 3:58:05.140]  to hold it. You've got sovereigns. You've got Franks and you've got silver and gold,
[3:58:05.140 --> 3:58:11.940]  800-686-2237. Brokers are there. They'll be there till midnight. Can you hold that deal till midnight,
[3:58:11.940 --> 3:58:19.300]  Ted? Until midnight. You've got it all the way through tonight, man. 800-686-2237. Midnight,
[3:58:19.300 --> 3:58:22.580]  central. You can even call tonight at midnight. There'll be some brokers there. They're standing
[3:58:22.580 --> 3:58:26.980]  by right now. Folks, this is a win-win-win-win-win, and it makes this broadcast possible. And here
[3:58:26.980 --> 3:58:30.260]  at the end of the show, we've been telling you about our sponsors. You're just crazy if you don't
[3:58:30.260 --> 3:58:38.500]  get involved. 800-686-2237. Here's that number. 800-686-2237. Thanks, Ted. Thanks a lot, Alex.
[3:58:38.500 --> 3:58:41.780]  You bet. Okay, I'll be right back in one minute, but you got it. Not the Genesis Stream. You've got to
[3:58:41.780 --> 3:58:47.300]  go to infoawards.com. I do an hour-long analysis. Then David Ray Griffin, all these other people.
[3:58:47.300 --> 3:59:11.380]  Stay with us.
