[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  It's Sunday, March 28th, the year is 2021, I'm your host, Alex Jones, and it's now official.
[00:11.680 --> 00:19.120]  A world government UN run planetary ID is being rolled out as we speak.
[00:19.120 --> 00:27.560]  The Bible, every dystopic novel warning of a future authoritarian state, every futurist
[00:27.560 --> 00:33.640]  worth their salt, every common sense person has always understood that once a planetary
[00:33.640 --> 00:38.120]  government is erected and once it brings in a world ID and a world tax and a world army
[00:38.120 --> 00:43.840]  and a world court, it will be able to control every facet of our lives and now it's here.
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.760]  Communist China is the model of the globalist, they set it up, they gave it one-sided trade
[00:47.760 --> 00:52.240]  deals to build it up and now it's global social credit score.
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.040]  Now six months ago by Xi Jinping, based on a QR code is being adopted in the state of
[00:58.040 --> 01:04.560]  New York by the United Kingdom, by the European Union, and they're all acting like magically
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.000]  all this happened, but I told you back a year ago when they closed all the restaurants,
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.240]  I said watch, next they'll have a QR code instead of a menu claiming it's dangerous
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.360]  to have menus, but really it's there to acclimate you and prepare you, how did I know that?
[01:19.360 --> 01:25.240]  Because Stanford and Yale and other major universities here in the U.S. but also Oxford
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.280]  and others in the U.K. were on record being hired over a decade ago to prepare the public
[01:31.280 --> 01:34.280]  for the rollout of this planetary system.
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.240]  So they tie it to having vaccine records, so you can't travel if you haven't been vaccinated,
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.000]  that's bad enough, but what it really does is establish that global government and gives
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.320]  the U.N. the authority to administer the IDs and then has all the nation states getting
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.520]  on board and now you see all the PR firms, there's a big zero hedge article out on as
[01:54.520 --> 02:01.080]  well, it's on infowords.com saying, oh, there's just so many different IDs and so many different
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.000]  QR codes and so many different systems and countries for these vaccine passports that
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.480]  we all agree we have to have to reopen, see we're held hostage all based on hoax, and
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.720]  so we need the U.N. to bring in the QR code and oh, it's exactly what G.G.
[02:15.720 --> 02:22.240]  Ping proposed and so China's already done it, we'll follow what they do, total dystopia
[02:22.240 --> 02:23.240]  from the beginning.
[02:23.240 --> 02:28.200]  Notice they said, oh, get your vaccine, you can travel, not wear a mask, not social distance.
[02:28.200 --> 02:35.760]  Now they say, oh, sorry, you still do, not until there's a global standard ID system
[02:35.760 --> 02:38.120]  tied to a social credit score.
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.480]  And anybody have any freedom, and then of course, next phase in the next year or two,
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.880]  you'll start hearing Roy seeing it, oh, if you haven't been vaccinated, if you haven't
[02:47.880 --> 02:52.560]  been vaccinated, you're the reason everybody isn't free to travel still once they've all
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.360]  had the inoculations, once they're all being tracked, once they've all submitted, they're
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.360]  going to point to 20, 30, 40% of people that haven't and said it's them, they didn't give
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.800]  us herd immunity, even though they're now admitting the vaccine will never protect you,
[03:06.800 --> 03:10.580]  there's constant new mutations, they picked a cold virus because they could never make
[03:10.580 --> 03:14.280]  a vaccine for it because there's too many mutations, they picked a problem they can
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.840]  never fix, and it's also based on the PCR test, which they're standardizing, that's
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.800]  a fraud, so that when they don't want you to be able to travel, they simply say, sorry,
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.720]  the PCR test says you have a new variant or a new virus, so it doesn't matter if you've
[03:28.720 --> 03:34.280]  had 10 gene therapy inoculations a year, remember it was going to be two, then five, I told
[03:34.280 --> 03:40.760]  you it would be 10 a year at least, this is a dystopia, submitting only makes it worse,
[03:40.760 --> 03:45.240]  we must get our governors, we must get our Congress educated on this and to have them
[03:45.240 --> 03:50.720]  stop going along with it because if they don't, it's game over, Senator Paul attacks Fauci
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.040]  and says, well these people have had vaccines, we don't need to wear masks, we need to be
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.520]  rewarded, we need to be given our passports, no, of course Fauci says sorry, you never
[03:59.520 --> 04:05.480]  get to anyways, because it's a bear trap, you never get out of it, you don't play along
[04:05.480 --> 04:08.920]  and argue each new point of their fraud with them and show how they lied over and over
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.320]  again, you have to counter them with the fact that it's all a great reset, globalist takeover
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.840]  with the UN and Communist China as the model in their own admissions to lower carbon footprint
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.200]  and that they're now all admitting in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, London
[04:24.200 --> 04:29.720]  Guardian that it's a global reset for carbon and we need carbon lockdowns, that's what
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.600]  this control grid and digital system is, is the global lockdown control system, they
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.680]  admit it is, there's no debate, it's all here, it's biblical, it's dystopic and the churches
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.440]  are all scrambling to implement it so they can quote reopen, then next comes the chips
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.080]  and the Neuralink, I'm Alex Jones, it's the live Sunday transmission, stay with us, key
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.200]  guest host Jason Jones coming up and a lot more, if you're watching or listening to this
[04:53.200 --> 04:57.200]  transmission, you are the resistance, if you don't spread the word, we're lost, you take
[04:57.200 --> 05:00.920]  action, we win, now get on your knees and ask God for guidance.
[05:00.920 --> 05:05.920]  It's so hard for me when I'm cutting ads to not get overly excited.
[05:05.920 --> 05:08.920]  People ask me all the time, they go, Joe, are you on cocaine or are you on meth?
[05:08.920 --> 05:09.920]  How are you so excited?
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.280]  How do I not get excited about world government?
[05:13.280 --> 05:19.040]  Force masks, force inoculations, open announcements that our country is going to be dissolved.
[05:19.040 --> 05:20.040]  I'm sorry.
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.040]  I'm a fighter.
[05:21.040 --> 05:24.280]  And I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well and so
[05:24.280 --> 05:30.320]  I'll just say this, I try to be calm, I try to be focused, I don't know what I do, I wasn't
[05:30.320 --> 05:36.440]  still on air right now, but I just really want to thank you for keeping us on air because
[05:36.440 --> 05:40.400]  you have to realize, when I tell you that you're the infomer, that's not me patting
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.120]  on the head, you are 99% of the equation.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.800]  So when you decide to spread the word, when you decide to buy the products, infomerstore.com,
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.920]  when you decide to share the articles and videos we produce, it changes the world.
[05:52.920 --> 05:55.240]  So you are the Info War.
[05:55.240 --> 05:56.840]  Thank you so much for the fight.
[05:56.840 --> 05:57.840]  Thank you for all you've done.
[05:57.840 --> 06:16.840]  Now let's take action together and take down the globalist.
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.680]  Info Wars, Tomorrow's News Today.
[06:21.680 --> 06:26.160]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[06:26.160 --> 06:31.360]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately served to the border.
[06:31.360 --> 06:33.240]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[06:33.240 --> 06:34.400]  They deserve to be heard.
[06:34.400 --> 06:35.400]  That's who we are.
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.880]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.600]  It's Sunday, March 28th.
[06:41.600 --> 06:43.960]  The year is 2021.
[06:43.960 --> 06:49.600]  The Texas border, the California border, the Arizona border are collapsing.
[06:49.600 --> 06:53.880]  Hundreds of thousands of people a week, not a month, are pouring across.
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.120]  That's what our border patrol sources are telling us right now.
[06:58.120 --> 07:04.560]  Upwards of half of them are children under the age of 15, many as young as two, unaccompanied
[07:04.560 --> 07:06.680]  and in many cases kidnapped.
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.480]  Senator Ted Cruz valiantly has gone to the facilities and is confronted by a leftist
[07:11.480 --> 07:16.360]  high-level appointee of Biden saying that he's treating the children badly by showing
[07:16.360 --> 07:17.360]  what's happening to them.
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.160]  And it is an incredible squalor, worse than a third world prison, way beyond what Obama
[07:22.160 --> 07:24.480]  did and of course Trump cleaned it up.
[07:24.480 --> 07:29.680]  Here is that shocking footage that I hand the baton to Jason Jones, hosting this important
[07:29.680 --> 07:30.680]  Sunday transmission.
[07:30.680 --> 07:36.280]  Please give dignity to the people, please give dignity to the people.
[07:36.280 --> 07:39.720]  So you worked for the commissioner, your senior advisor, you were hired two weeks ago and
[07:39.720 --> 07:44.360]  you're instructed to ask us to not have any pictures taken here because the political
[07:44.360 --> 07:48.200]  leadership at DHS does not want the American people to know it.
[07:48.200 --> 07:51.800]  You keep standing in front of the pictures so you don't want the pictures taken.
[07:51.800 --> 07:55.480]  The rules are arbitrary and they're designed to keep the American people in the door.
[07:55.480 --> 07:59.120]  Dignity and respect, that's all we ask, dignity and respect.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.120]  You're asking, is this dignity and respect?
[08:00.120 --> 08:01.120]  Look at these people, there's a pandemic.
[08:01.120 --> 08:05.960]  Please give dignity and respect to the people, I ask you, I respectfully ask you, sir.
[08:05.960 --> 08:09.200]  There is a pandemic, is this respecting the rights of these kids?
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.200]  This is not a zoo, sir, please don't treat the people.
[08:13.200 --> 08:19.040]  You're right and this is a dangerous place and your policies unfortunately are trying
[08:19.040 --> 08:20.040]  to hide them.
[08:20.040 --> 08:24.040]  I understand you were instructed when 18s senators came down here, I ask you to please
[08:24.040 --> 08:25.040]  respect the people, give them dignity and respect.
[08:25.040 --> 08:29.840]  I respect them and I want to fix this situation and the administration you're working for
[08:29.840 --> 08:31.880]  is responsible for these conditions.
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.040]  Please respect the people with dignity and respect.
[08:34.040 --> 08:36.760]  And I ask you to respect the people as well.
[08:36.760 --> 08:37.760]  This is not respect.
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.400]  This is not respecting you, I am respecting the people.
[08:39.400 --> 08:41.680]  Respect, this is not respect.
[08:41.680 --> 08:42.680]  That's shocking.
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.360]  That looks like a camp at Xinjiang, that looks like the Uyghur camp in China, that's shocking.
[08:47.360 --> 08:52.360]  Aloha, my name is Jason Jones and it's a privilege to be here, to be a guest, special guest
[08:52.360 --> 08:54.200]  host of the Alex Jones show.
[08:54.200 --> 08:58.720]  You know, Alex is a hero of mine, Ted Cruz is a hero, that man cares about those people.
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.920]  That's really heartbreaking.
[08:59.920 --> 09:03.960]  You know, a nine-year-old child drowned in that river, drowned coming to the country
[09:03.960 --> 09:04.960]  this week.
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.400]  Senator Ted Cruz wants the truth.
[09:09.400 --> 09:11.360]  Senator Ted Cruz cares about those people.
[09:11.360 --> 09:19.360]  If you care about migrants, you want a secure border because you don't want vulnerable ethnic,
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.240]  you don't want vulnerable immigrants exploited.
[09:23.240 --> 09:27.920]  You don't want children to drown in a river, you don't want them trafficked, heartbreaking.
[09:27.920 --> 09:32.800]  Well we have, first of all, I hope you watched the special yesterday, the Skolen Bone Special.
[09:32.800 --> 09:39.200]  I watched it twice, brought my wife in, she watched it, her jaw dropped.
[09:39.200 --> 09:41.800]  And it kind of leads into what we're going to be talking today, we're going to be talking
[09:41.800 --> 09:44.280]  about little Nas X.
[09:44.280 --> 09:49.920]  You know, they used to, I remember watching Alex Jones as a college student and when he
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.360]  was on, when he was on public access in Hawaii O'Lello, I believe, and I would watch Alex
[09:56.360 --> 10:00.720]  say, this guy, they're not doing that inside, they're not doing that inside the Skolen
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.600]  Bones Temple, there's no way that is over the top.
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.160]  And now little Nas X takes what they used to do and shame and in secret and they put
[10:09.160 --> 10:10.160]  it out there for the world to see.
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.200]  We're going to talk about little Nas X that comes out on the weekend that is, it's disgusting.
[10:17.200 --> 10:23.200]  This is Palm Sunday, you know, the one day where we remember that people celebrated,
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.200]  the crowd celebrated Jesus coming into Jerusalem, you know, he wept, he wept before he went
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.400]  to Jerusalem because he knew what was coming, but the crowds were cheering.
[10:34.400 --> 10:40.240]  The crowds were cheering and Hosanna and in a couple of days they'd be yelling crucify
[10:40.240 --> 10:41.240]  him.
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.760]  And now even on that day where we're supposed to be celebrating Christ, they come out with
[10:45.760 --> 10:52.760]  a satanic shoe, the music video looks like a ritual that they would do 20 years ago only
[10:52.760 --> 10:54.280]  in secret in the Skolen Bones Temple.
[10:54.280 --> 10:57.760]  We're going to be talking with television and movie producer Darius Garland on little
[10:57.760 --> 11:03.440]  Nas X's video, this new tragedy that happened in Washington DC with the Uber driver.
[11:03.440 --> 11:06.200]  We've had a week of tragedies.
[11:06.200 --> 11:08.600]  We've had the shooting in Atlanta.
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.400]  They wanted to make that about race.
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.700]  We had the shooting in Denver.
[11:15.700 --> 11:18.960]  By God's grace, I was worried people were going to want to make that about his religion
[11:18.960 --> 11:19.960]  and his ethnicity.
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.800]  I haven't heard anyone do that.
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.760]  And then now we have this tragedy, two children, 14 and 13 I believe kill an Uber driver.
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.720]  Last night with my 14 year old son and four of my other children, we played foosball.
[11:31.720 --> 11:34.680]  We played foosball and watched a movie, eight popcorn.
[11:34.680 --> 11:40.840]  Here's what I know, those two girls want with their father watching a movie last night.
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.520]  And so we're going to talk to Darius Garland about how they, whenever there's a shooting,
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.800]  look at this tragedy, whenever there's a tragedy, the first thing they do, the first thing they
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.760]  do is they look, how can they cover the story to divide us?
[11:54.760 --> 11:56.920]  Has it not become completely obvious?
[11:56.920 --> 11:59.920]  How can they cover the story to divide us?
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.000]  You can guarantee every time there's a shooting in this country, every time there's some horrible
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.680]  tragedy or crime, the mainstream media will look at that story and say, how do we divide
[12:09.680 --> 12:11.080]  the American family?
[12:11.080 --> 12:17.720]  Let's make it out to be black men are violent, white men are violent, Muslim men are violent.
[12:17.720 --> 12:20.240]  But no, America, we have a problem.
[12:20.240 --> 12:22.400]  We have a problem with violence.
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.840]  And it's info wars that gets kicked off of every social media platform that is uniting
[12:26.840 --> 12:30.440]  America that gets to the truth of these tragedies.
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.560]  And so we're going to interview Darius Garland, a television producer, movie producer, and
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.280]  my buddy since we were five, and then we're going to go all the way to Hawaii.
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.320]  If you want to know how the elite see you, how they want to treat you, you have to ask
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.200]  yourself this question, how are the Uighurs being treated?
[12:48.200 --> 12:50.360]  Are they being treated well?
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.160]  Does Nike seem to care about three million ethnic and religious minorities in concentration
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.160]  camps making shoes?
[12:56.160 --> 12:57.840]  Do you think they care about you more?
[12:57.840 --> 12:59.760]  How did we treat Hawaii?
[12:59.760 --> 13:03.720]  How did we treat Hawaii for the past 100 years?
[13:03.720 --> 13:08.760]  Right now, 50% of families with children in Hawaii as reported in the Star Advertiser
[13:08.760 --> 13:10.120]  are food insecure.
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.440]  We are going to have the Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Hawaii on the show today.
[13:14.440 --> 13:15.440]  We're going to talk about that.
[13:15.440 --> 13:18.280]  And at the end of the show, we're going to bring it to East Turkestan.
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.120]  We're going to talk about the Uighur because I truly believe that the Alex Jones audience,
[13:22.120 --> 13:28.600]  the infill war audience, can play the key role in getting Nike, Apple, and Costco to
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.520]  abandon East Turkestan to cease working with China.
[13:33.520 --> 13:42.320]  When our Lord entered Jerusalem, the religious leader said to him, have your followers shut
[13:42.320 --> 13:44.080]  up.
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.280]  And Jesus said, even if I did that, the rocks would cry out.
[13:49.280 --> 13:55.800]  Well, the Pope, I'm Catholic, has not said a single word for the Uighur and their defense.
[13:55.800 --> 13:58.520]  The bishops, the Catholic bishops of the United States, silence.
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.520]  So you know what?
[13:59.520 --> 14:04.880]  I think infill wars, me being on here as a filmmaker, Alex Jones leading the way for
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.680]  the Uighur, is our Lord saying, I will get the stones to cry out.
[14:08.680 --> 14:15.960]  I will have, from the most unexpected places, voices ring out, and Nike made a big mistake.
[14:15.960 --> 14:20.640]  Nike and China made big mistakes, we're going to get to that, which I think we can capitalize
[14:20.640 --> 14:25.440]  on those mistakes to get the concentration camps closed in East Turkestan.
[14:25.440 --> 14:31.000]  And in today's show, this week, it has been so obvious, the gaslighting and division that
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  I'm going to have the secret.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.360]  I'm going to share with you the secret that can unite us as a country, the secret that
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.840]  has been with us from the very beginning.
[14:38.840 --> 14:42.400]  And I'm going to go over five principles that I have talked about before when I've been
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.880]  on the show.
[14:43.880 --> 14:49.560]  Five principles, I promise you, that if we as a nation just hold one of these principles,
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.720]  the New World Order and the Great Reset is broken, is broken.
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.480]  And you know, they're falling apart.
[14:58.480 --> 15:01.600]  They're saying things now that they haven't even prepared us for.
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.480]  This week alone, I saw Bill Gates, you think you're wearing a mask forever is Bill Gates's
[15:06.480 --> 15:08.480]  worst plans for us and for you?
[15:08.480 --> 15:09.480]  No.
[15:09.480 --> 15:15.440]  Bill Gates said he wants to pump in chalk, litter the atmosphere with chalk to block
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.440]  out the sun.
[15:16.440 --> 15:17.440]  You don't believe it.
[15:17.440 --> 15:19.640]  It sounds like conspiracy theory, unbelievable.
[15:19.640 --> 15:21.680]  It's being reported in the mainstream news.
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.280]  You think filling the atmosphere with chalk is the worst thing yet?
[15:25.280 --> 15:26.280]  No.
[15:26.280 --> 15:29.720]  He wants you to eat bugs.
[15:29.720 --> 15:33.200]  The World Economic Forum wants you to eat bugs.
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.040]  And do you think it doesn't get worse than that?
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.560]  The guy that wants you to eat bugs is buying up all the farmland.
[15:39.560 --> 15:40.880]  We might have to eat bugs.
[15:40.880 --> 15:41.880]  All right?
[15:41.880 --> 16:00.000]  Well, we're coming back with my buddy Darius Garland after this break, all right?

[18:00.560 --> 18:04.560]  Blisters ask me all the time, why do you have multiple multivitamins?
[18:04.560 --> 18:07.160]  Why do you have multiple high-quality iodines?
[18:07.160 --> 18:08.160]  Why do you do that?
[18:08.160 --> 18:10.360]  Because different strokes for different folks.
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.800]  And we're talking to researchers and scientists and they say, hey, a lot of people love deep
[18:14.800 --> 18:18.800]  earth pure crystal iodine, but you should put one out with deeper crystal iodine and
[18:18.800 --> 18:21.920]  the two other types because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[18:21.920 --> 18:23.080]  Boom, we did it.
[18:23.080 --> 18:24.080]  It's popular.

[18:25.080 --> 18:26.080]  Is it better than X2?
[18:26.080 --> 18:27.080]  Right.

[19:00.800 --> 19:03.960]  BrainForce Plus, by the way, one of my all time favorite products.
[19:03.960 --> 19:06.600]  I completely owe my ability to do this job.
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.120]  I owe my ability to have graduated college four or five years ago.
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.200]  I owe it completely to BrainForce Plus, one of the most powerful nutraceuticals you will
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.200]  find.
[19:15.200 --> 19:16.600]  I put it right up there with TurboForce.
[19:16.600 --> 19:17.600]  I love TurboForce.
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.600]  It's great, but when you don't have time or you don't have the wherewithal to drink,
[19:21.600 --> 19:28.520]  a bottle of water, take two capsules of BrainForce Plus and you will launch into the stratosphere.
[19:28.520 --> 19:29.880]  You will go to the moon.

[19:33.240 --> 19:34.240]  no crash.
[19:34.240 --> 19:37.640]  That's the important part about BrainForce Plus is there's no crash.
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.760]  It's not like drinking three cups of coffee to get that same amount of buzz because you
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.360]  don't come crashing down.
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.480]  You also, you don't get the jitters, at least I don't.
[19:45.480 --> 19:46.480]  You don't get the anxiety.
[19:46.480 --> 19:51.320]  You don't get all of the things that usually come with drinking coffee or energy drinks.
[19:51.320 --> 20:03.640]  BrainForce Plus, clean natural energy and right now, it's on sale 50% off Infoworthstore.com.
[20:03.640 --> 20:22.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[20:26.760 --> 20:28.480]  You want to stop tyranny?
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.040]  Well, so does he.
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.320]  Live from the Infoworth.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:35.320 --> 20:42.560]  I don't know about you, but I didn't see that Ted Cruz clip till right when not.
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.400]  I saw Alex's special report and it's really heartbreaking.
[20:46.400 --> 20:48.720]  My first movie was a little movie called Bella.
[20:48.720 --> 20:54.640]  It won the Toronto International Film Festival, made it with my partner, Eduardo Verastige.
[20:54.640 --> 20:58.640]  We made that film, we didn't realize at the time that it was the first movie in Hollywood
[20:58.640 --> 20:59.640]  history.
[20:59.640 --> 21:00.640]  This is 2005.
[21:00.640 --> 21:02.120]  You're going to rack your brain.
[21:02.120 --> 21:06.160]  It's the first movie in Hollywood history that showed a Latino male as a hero, not as
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.360]  Superman or Batman, but just as a hero, as a good man, as a family man.
[21:10.360 --> 21:12.560]  This is what the neoliberal elites really think.
[21:12.560 --> 21:17.080]  You can tell by the stories they tell, how they cast people, how they use them for political
[21:17.080 --> 21:21.200]  gain, victimism, feigning concern for the vulnerable so you can use them for wealth
[21:21.200 --> 21:24.200]  and for power.
[21:24.200 --> 21:27.960]  That was the first time I saw that clip with Senator Ted Cruz at the border.
[21:27.960 --> 21:31.520]  By the way, whenever we, Bella came out, I think Senator Cruz was just starting to run
[21:31.520 --> 21:32.520]  for office.
[21:32.520 --> 21:33.520]  It was like 3% of the polls.
[21:33.520 --> 21:36.040]  He was a big supporter of our film as a Cuban man.
[21:36.040 --> 21:42.800]  He loved how it, there's Eduardo right there, loved how it showed the Latino man as a hero.
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.880]  This scene actually sets it up with the stereotype.
[21:44.880 --> 21:48.400]  It was playing into prejudice knowing that you're going to be afraid of this guy, but
[21:48.400 --> 21:51.760]  then at the end you discover he's a real hero.
[21:51.760 --> 21:58.960]  This immigration issue is very important and we have allowed the neoliberal left to control
[21:58.960 --> 21:59.960]  the narrative on this.
[21:59.960 --> 22:07.360]  And here's the reality, securing the border, we must secure the border first and foremost
[22:07.360 --> 22:13.040]  to protect the vulnerable from economic exploitation, from nine-year-old children, from drowning
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.320]  in rivers, from women being dragged into the sex industry to be trafficked.
[22:18.320 --> 22:22.800]  We need a mandatory verification system because right now in this country we need to verify
[22:22.800 --> 22:25.160]  system that's mandatory and simple to use.
[22:25.160 --> 22:31.000]  Because in this country right now, there are those who have this huge architecture of legal
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.800]  protection, this huge architecture of protection, and then there are those, these migrants who
[22:36.800 --> 22:43.200]  are lured across the border, trapped into an underground economy, exploited, right?
[22:43.200 --> 22:45.160]  It's robber baron stuff.
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.560]  So we have, this is what we have right now.
[22:47.560 --> 22:55.600]  What we want is to make sure everyone living and working in this country has the same architecture
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.160]  of legal protection.
[22:57.160 --> 23:01.680]  And so what we see down there at the border, what we've seen with the immigration issue
[23:01.680 --> 23:10.040]  all along is using migrants for economic gain, using migrants for political gain.
[23:10.040 --> 23:11.440]  This is what we have seen.
[23:11.440 --> 23:18.960]  And so it is, we cannot allow what the Trump movement started, we must secure the border.
[23:18.960 --> 23:23.400]  Not only to protect vulnerable migrants from exploitation, but they lure vulnerable migrants
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.760]  into the economy to undermine working-class Americans at the same time.
[23:27.760 --> 23:33.120]  We're using the vulnerable, exploiting the vulnerable at the expense of the vulnerable.
[23:33.120 --> 23:40.420]  And what we've just seen at the border is really heartbreaking and catastrophic.
[23:40.420 --> 23:43.000]  You probably don't even know a nine-year-old boy drowned this week.
[23:43.000 --> 23:49.120]  The media is not even reporting it, and you'd have to ask yourself, if this happened under
[23:49.120 --> 23:54.160]  President Bush, it's all you, I'm sorry, President Trump, this is all you'd be hearing about.
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.920]  I got President Bush in my head because I watched that Skowen Bones special three times
[23:58.920 --> 24:03.000]  in the past 24 hours, and you need to watch it.
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.080]  Now I want to also cut to this, and I really hesitant to show this to you, but I think
[24:08.080 --> 24:09.080]  we must see it.
[24:09.080 --> 24:12.320]  The crime we're about to see, this is this Uber driver.
[24:12.320 --> 24:20.840]  This Uber driver is being held up with a taser, and it goes horribly wrong.
[24:20.840 --> 24:27.920]  These, I believe it's a 14-year-old and a 13-year-old, are holding this gentleman up.
[24:27.920 --> 24:33.960]  And then what is about to happen is a tragic crime and a murder, a murder.
[24:33.960 --> 24:38.420]  This is the third horrible tragedy we've seen, I believe, in less than two weeks.
[24:38.420 --> 24:42.320]  And now we can see the media is gaslighting it, they call this an accident.
[24:42.320 --> 24:43.680]  They call this an accident.
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.000]  What appears to be a sex crime that happened in Atlanta, they're calling racism.
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.400]  By God's grace, no one right now, I haven't seen anyone, trying to turn what happened
[24:53.400 --> 24:58.920]  into Denver, into anything more than it appears to be a mentally ill man, started out as an
[24:58.920 --> 25:05.840]  angry youth and grew into be a very ill man, but we must acknowledge as a nation, children
[25:05.840 --> 25:06.840]  did this.
[25:06.840 --> 25:14.600]  I have a 14-year-old, I mean, 14, 13, these are eighth grade, these are junior high students.
[25:14.600 --> 25:16.680]  We have to ask, where is this coming from?
[25:16.680 --> 25:23.960]  Well, the obvious answer is the breakdown of the family, lonely and lost children.
[25:23.960 --> 25:27.040]  Look at this.
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.240]  And now, a man died and two children, we'll lose their, they'll spend the rest of their
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.080]  life in prison, and you have to ask yourself, how did this happen?
[25:37.080 --> 25:45.520]  So we need to unite as a country around, and my film, Divided Hearts of America, we saw
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.920]  two years ago when we started making this movie, we saw that they are going to try to
[25:49.920 --> 25:56.440]  use the 2020 election to split a wedge between us as Americans.
[25:56.440 --> 26:00.800]  And we need to see, what will unite us?
[26:00.800 --> 26:03.280]  What will unite us as a country?
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.720]  And we discovered that our principle of unity was with us from the very beginning before
[26:09.720 --> 26:16.120]  the Constitution, embedded in the Declaration of Independence as a vision of the human person,
[26:16.120 --> 26:23.600]  as having an alienable dignity, equal dignity, given not by the government, but by God.
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.720]  The Constitution was written to protect the truth about the human person, where the only
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.400]  country in the history of the world founded on the truth of the human person on our equal
[26:34.400 --> 26:37.320]  dignity are incomparable beauty and worth.
[26:37.320 --> 26:43.760]  Of course, we know the weed of slavery grew with that wheat.
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.840]  That wheat of slavery was growing in the world for centuries before our founding fathers
[26:48.840 --> 26:52.760]  planted the seeds, that wheat of the Declaration principle.
[26:52.760 --> 26:57.000]  And that was, that wheat was a brutal denial of the truth of the human person.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.040]  And then we had segregation.
[27:00.040 --> 27:06.480]  And then we had, after 100 years of battling against legal discrimination, we had Roe v.
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.480]  Wade.
[27:07.480 --> 27:11.720]  So what Divided Hearts of America looks at is, well, the truth is, the only thing that
[27:11.720 --> 27:16.200]  will unite us is ascending to the Declaration principle.
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.880]  And we've had these relentless, brutal denials.
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.040]  You know, we're canceling everything in this country.
[27:24.040 --> 27:32.000]  Slavery, segregation, and abortion on demand for all nine months, for any reason, have
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.400]  those three denials of the founding principle have three things in common.
[27:36.400 --> 27:37.400]  Say it, we all know it.
[27:37.400 --> 27:38.400]  What are the three things?
[27:38.400 --> 27:44.000]  It's slavery, segregation, and abortion on demand for all nine months, for any reason.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  What do they have in common?
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.720]  It's the Democrat Party.
[27:47.720 --> 27:49.480]  It is the Democrat Party.
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.480]  And now the neoliberal elites and the media, they seek to take everything they can get
[27:54.480 --> 27:56.640]  their hands on to divide us.
[27:56.640 --> 28:02.520]  The immigration issue, any crime that happens anywhere in the country, if you want to know
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.720]  how it's, you will know before it happens, do this as an intellectual exercise, write
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.640]  down a crime, write down a bunch of crimes, then Wade is the new cycle unfolds over the
[28:11.640 --> 28:16.920]  years, and then look at the crimes that you wrote down, and then you can anticipate how
[28:16.920 --> 28:19.560]  each of those are going to be covered.
[28:19.560 --> 28:22.000]  What would be the best way to cover this issue?
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.840]  Not to get to the root cause, not to get to the truth, but to divide the American people
[28:27.840 --> 28:28.960]  amongst themselves.
[28:28.960 --> 28:30.960]  How do we do that?
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.400]  That's how the story is going to be covered.
[28:33.400 --> 28:39.880]  And the places where you find the truth, they're getting kicked off of every platform.
[28:39.880 --> 28:46.080]  I heard Alex say yesterday, info wars may not be here forever, but he's throwing seeds
[28:46.080 --> 28:47.080]  like Johnny Appleseed.
[28:47.080 --> 28:50.600]  There will be too many trees that they can chop down.
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.760]  Evil is a deprivation.
[28:52.760 --> 28:55.280]  Good exists.
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.840]  Evil is the absence of being.
[28:56.840 --> 29:00.040]  All ideologies of evil collapse.
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.640]  It was six years ago that Dr. Group helped us develop living defense, and he told me
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.240]  Alex, this is going to be one of your most popular products, and we were really a bunch
[29:08.240 --> 29:13.440]  of black walnut, a bunch of these herbs, he said, listen, this stuff flushes out parasites,
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.320]  this stuff is beyond probiotics for the bacterial on up.
[29:17.320 --> 29:18.320]  It's amazing.
[29:18.320 --> 29:23.840]  It's got Indian science, Native American science, ancient European herbology.
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.840]  It's all there.
[29:24.840 --> 29:26.400]  And it's become a best seller.
[29:26.400 --> 29:27.400]  People love it.
[29:27.400 --> 29:28.400]  It's amazing.
[29:28.400 --> 29:31.080]  If you've been on the fence and haven't taken it, it is a big bottle with more than two
[29:31.080 --> 29:32.320]  regimens in it.
[29:32.320 --> 29:35.920]  So this will cover you basically for a year, but you want to do it every six months.
[29:35.920 --> 29:37.960]  And the cleanse is incredible.
[29:37.960 --> 29:40.400]  Everybody gets benefits from it, plus it funds the info war.
[29:40.400 --> 29:45.360]  And it's part of our mega blowout sale, 50% off and free shipping on living defense.
[29:45.360 --> 29:49.640]  But the sale has to end Wednesday night, the last day of March.
[29:49.640 --> 29:54.240]  The sale has to end March 31st, 2021, in just a few days.
[29:54.240 --> 29:56.600]  Get it while you can at infowarstore.com.
[29:56.600 --> 30:00.520]  It's massively discounted and it funds the info war.
[30:00.520 --> 30:04.520]  Info wars mega blowout sale only has a few days left.
[30:04.520 --> 30:08.840]  It's Friday evening and I'm cutting this quick ad because coming up on the 31st, we
[30:08.840 --> 30:10.560]  have to stop the sales.
[30:10.560 --> 30:13.000]  The sales will be over by Thursday morning.
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.960]  They have to because a lot of these products are selling out.
[30:15.960 --> 30:23.120]  All of our incredible iodine products, X2, X3, also the oral spray and the topical disinfectant
[30:23.120 --> 30:28.480]  spray are all 50% off with free shipping on these items.
[30:28.480 --> 30:31.960]  You cannot beat these deals and believe me, when I'm sitting there talking about X2 or
[30:31.960 --> 30:33.960]  X3, I'm thinking, hey, I haven't taken it a week or so.
[30:33.960 --> 30:34.960]  I need to take it.
[30:34.960 --> 30:38.160]  The energy it gives me, the focus it gives me.
[30:38.160 --> 30:40.240]  How good it makes my skin feel, everything.
[30:40.240 --> 30:41.240]  It's essential.
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.920]  And the globalists don't want you to know about iodine, they don't want you to know
[30:43.920 --> 30:47.640]  about pure iodine, they don't want you to be full of the bad halogens.
[30:47.640 --> 30:48.760]  Don't let them do it.
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.760]  Take action.
[30:49.760 --> 30:54.480]  And for the info war, a 360 win, 50% off on all four of our great iodine products and
[30:54.480 --> 30:59.080]  free shipping at infowarstore.com, part of the mega blowout sale, but it ends in just
[30:59.080 --> 31:00.080]  a couple days.
[31:00.080 --> 31:01.080]  So take action.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.560]  The people are awakening.
[31:02.560 --> 31:05.240]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[31:05.240 --> 31:07.440]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[31:07.440 --> 31:11.960]  Maybe they're a supercomputer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[31:11.960 --> 31:17.000]  governments, foreign governments, the Chai comms especially, are using this to steal
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.680]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[31:21.680 --> 31:26.520]  up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.520]  mass movements.
[31:27.520 --> 31:34.600]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[31:34.600 --> 31:36.080]  In their own words, they admit it.
[31:36.080 --> 31:39.960]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more than
[31:39.960 --> 31:40.960]  a decade.
[31:40.960 --> 31:42.920]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[31:42.920 --> 31:43.920]  They're Faraday cages.
[31:43.920 --> 31:45.680]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[31:45.680 --> 31:47.680]  They work absolutely great.
[31:47.680 --> 31:52.680]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity
[31:52.680 --> 31:55.720]  when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what you're up to because
[31:55.720 --> 31:56.720]  it's another business.
[31:56.720 --> 32:04.720]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[32:04.720 --> 32:07.720]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[32:07.720 --> 32:08.720]  Go ahead.
[32:08.720 --> 32:11.360]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[32:11.360 --> 32:16.880]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[32:16.880 --> 32:22.360]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[32:22.360 --> 32:28.360]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[32:28.360 --> 32:31.680]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.720]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[32:35.720 --> 32:39.280]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[32:39.280 --> 32:42.440]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[32:42.440 --> 32:47.960]  But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[32:47.960 --> 32:48.960]  This is working.
[32:48.960 --> 32:49.960]  This is wonderful.
[32:49.960 --> 32:54.320]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[32:54.320 --> 33:03.120]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[33:03.120 --> 33:26.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:26.920 --> 33:33.760]  You are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from the info wars dot
[33:33.760 --> 33:35.280]  com studios.
[33:35.280 --> 33:39.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:39.800 --> 33:40.800]  Welcome back.
[33:40.800 --> 33:41.800]  I would be remiss.
[33:41.800 --> 33:43.800]  So we're opening up.
[33:43.800 --> 33:47.360]  I've been open up since July since I left Hawaii and got to Texas.
[33:47.360 --> 33:51.160]  We've been open up, but I would have to be honest, I was eating a little too much, drinking
[33:51.160 --> 33:54.280]  a little too much and not in the best shape of my life.
[33:54.280 --> 33:57.160]  But about two months ago, I committed myself.
[33:57.160 --> 33:58.160]  I'm going to work out.
[33:58.160 --> 33:59.160]  I'm going to eat right.
[33:59.160 --> 34:00.160]  I'm going to take the proper supplements.
[34:00.160 --> 34:02.080]  And so I want to make sure I get this out.
[34:02.080 --> 34:04.000]  There is a mega blowout sale right now.
[34:04.000 --> 34:10.040]  There's 50% off plus free shipping on the top selling products at info wars.
[34:10.040 --> 34:11.400]  A lot of things are selling out.
[34:11.400 --> 34:15.000]  The vaso beats sold out, alpha power sold out, but you still can get the living defense
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.080]  plus 50% off all iodine products, 50% all of it.
[34:21.080 --> 34:22.080]  The brain focus.
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.240]  I need to try that, you know, you can probably tell I need the brain focus plus everything
[34:26.240 --> 34:30.080]  is there and things are close to selling out.
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.760]  If you like that charcoal toothpaste, you got to get that now.
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.160]  But as America has opened it up and what made me think of this is I was looking at my buddy
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.000]  that Darius, we've been friends since we were five, this guy is in shape.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  This guy is healthy.
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.600]  He takes his health seriously.
[34:42.600 --> 34:46.360]  He's been locked down in LA, which is horrible.
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.840]  But as your city, especially those of you who live in blue cities, now is your finally
[34:50.840 --> 34:52.240]  they're letting you out of your house to play.
[34:52.240 --> 34:53.240]  You need to play.
[34:53.240 --> 34:54.240]  You need to eat right.
[34:54.240 --> 34:55.560]  You need to get these supplements.
[34:55.560 --> 34:58.840]  But you know, working in Hollywood, I got some stories.
[34:58.840 --> 34:59.840]  Maybe I'll share some with you, Darius.
[34:59.840 --> 35:02.080]  There's not a lot of people you trust.
[35:02.080 --> 35:03.680]  There's some strange rangers out there.
[35:03.680 --> 35:05.160]  There's some weird things going on.
[35:05.160 --> 35:07.200]  We've been friends since we were five.
[35:07.200 --> 35:13.280]  When I saw this Lil Nas X video, which I must confess, I knew he did that country rap
[35:13.280 --> 35:14.280]  song.
[35:14.280 --> 35:20.280]  That's all I knew about Lil Nas X saw this video, shocking, startling, unbelievable.
[35:20.280 --> 35:23.560]  And I thought, I need to have Darius on to talk about this.
[35:23.560 --> 35:30.400]  And then I saw the Uber and I said, they're trying to divide us racially.
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.280]  And they're promoting Satanism on television.
[35:34.280 --> 35:36.160]  This is the worldview of Hollywood.
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.560]  Let me get Darius Garland, TV producer, writer, movie producer on Aloha Brother.
[35:42.560 --> 35:45.520]  Good to see you.
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.280]  Can you hear me, Darius?
[35:49.280 --> 35:53.200]  I think I'm having trouble with Darius.
[35:53.200 --> 35:57.920]  Yeah, we're having a bit of a technical problem, but here's the thing.
[35:57.920 --> 35:59.840]  I want to go through what we're waiting for, Darius.
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.320]  I want to talk about what this week is, because I was an atheist, I was 30.
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.800]  My mother was a Scientologist, can you believe this, and my grandfather didn't know anything
[36:10.800 --> 36:11.800]  about you.
[36:11.800 --> 36:12.800]  Give me the Bible.
[36:12.800 --> 36:14.800]  I didn't know there was a New Testament, Old Testament.
[36:14.800 --> 36:15.800]  I did it.
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.960]  I knew Jesus Christ.
[36:16.960 --> 36:18.760]  I knew Christians, something Jesus.
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.480]  I knew more about Santa and the Easter Bunny.
[36:20.480 --> 36:26.000]  Didn't know a lot, but I want to tell you about the story of this week, Holy Week, that
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.320]  begins today with Palm Sunday.
[36:28.320 --> 36:31.040]  It's very important to know, because this story repeats itself.
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.960]  This Holy Week story repeats itself over and over.
[36:33.960 --> 36:37.640]  Begins with Jesus comes into town, and he's cheered.
[36:37.640 --> 36:41.320]  He's celebrated, okay?
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.280]  Then on Monday, the day after he enters Jerusalem, by the way, he weeps because he knows what's
[36:46.280 --> 36:47.880]  coming for Jerusalem.
[36:47.880 --> 36:49.280]  He enters, they cheer him.
[36:49.280 --> 36:52.960]  The religious leaders say, hush up.
[36:52.960 --> 36:54.560]  Tell your people to not celebrate you.
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.600]  He goes, I can't, because even if I do, they'll be celebrating me on Alex Jones and Info Wars.
[37:00.600 --> 37:03.560]  I can't tell them to shut up.
[37:03.560 --> 37:06.920]  So he just lets them celebrate him, but he knows they're going to yell, crucify him in
[37:06.920 --> 37:07.920]  just five days.
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.800]  Then on Monday, the day after, Mary's anointing his feet with oil, and Judas is like, what
[37:12.800 --> 37:14.320]  a waste of money.
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.960]  Why are you doing that?
[37:15.960 --> 37:22.280]  Then Judas betrays Jesus Christ, then he goes to get some money to pray, he asks his followers
[37:22.280 --> 37:28.840]  to just stay awake, but they fall asleep, and then they come and arrest him.
[37:28.840 --> 37:36.160]  The crowd that celebrated Jesus cheers for his execution, his brutal execution.
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.640]  Why do I say this is a story that you don't have to be a Christian, you need to know this
[37:39.640 --> 37:40.640]  story?
[37:40.640 --> 37:48.040]  One of my friends, whether they're celebrities, the people who cheer you, the people who wave
[37:48.040 --> 37:53.880]  palms at you, those are going to be the ones to crucify you.
[37:53.880 --> 38:00.360]  Maybe we'll just look at President Trump and the Q movement.
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.560]  So many in the Q movement now have turned on Trump.
[38:04.560 --> 38:10.560]  Matt Coulter made a God out of Donald Trump, Matt Drudge made a God out of Donald Trump,
[38:10.560 --> 38:12.720]  and then they turned on him.
[38:12.720 --> 38:13.880]  See this is what happens.
[38:13.880 --> 38:20.480]  Now, the people in Jerusalem wanted to make a man out of Jesus, see, it's Passover week
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.480]  too, right?
[38:21.480 --> 38:24.800]  Passover is the Jews made it from Egypt to Jerusalem, but the new Passover with Jesus
[38:24.800 --> 38:29.520]  Christ is that we go from Jerusalem, we go from this earth to heaven.
[38:29.520 --> 38:37.040]  That's the new Passover, but the crowd wanted a political leader and he wasn't about politics.
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.960]  He wasn't about making them healthy, wealthy, powerful, getting rid of the Romans.
[38:40.960 --> 38:42.600]  He was about getting them right.
[38:42.600 --> 38:47.080]  He was about getting them right, but so many times people do make their political leaders
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.600]  or their favorite actor or their favorite podcast or new show.
[38:51.600 --> 38:52.600]  They'll turn that person.
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.120]  They want that person to be a God and they're just a person, and so they'll crucify them.
[38:56.120 --> 38:57.520]  But it's the same story.
[38:57.520 --> 38:59.320]  They want you to be what you're not.
[38:59.320 --> 39:02.600]  They pretend you're something else and when you're not that, they want to crucify, but
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.000]  what we, as Christians, it's always so interesting to me.
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.800]  You know, when you look at what the founder of Stop the Steel, Ali Alexander, if you
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.560]  saw what they did with this guy, they were saying in the media, his real name is Ali
[39:15.560 --> 39:22.520]  Akbar, baiting us, trying to think in Christians and conservatives and go, oh, no, that was
[39:22.520 --> 39:23.520]  his given name.
[39:23.520 --> 39:24.520]  We hate him now.
[39:24.520 --> 39:25.520]  That's what they thought, right?
[39:25.520 --> 39:28.000]  They tried to bait us, but we're Christians.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.240]  We love people.
[39:29.240 --> 39:30.400]  We transcend.
[39:30.400 --> 39:34.640]  We transcend these narrow bigotries and narrow tribes that they lay out.
[39:34.640 --> 39:41.240]  And so as this holy week is the week that of all things, and by the way, I wanted to
[39:41.240 --> 39:42.240]  talk to Darius about this.
[39:42.240 --> 39:44.200]  I'm just going to talk to you about this.
[39:44.200 --> 39:45.200]  I have some weird stories.
[39:45.200 --> 39:46.200]  I've been at a party.
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.760]  I was at a party with Harvey Weinstein, talked to him for 30 minutes, didn't know who he
[39:49.760 --> 39:50.760]  was.
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.000]  But once I was at a party and I was told, this guy does music videos for Beyonce.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.080]  You know, all those creepy music videos you see in the industry?
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.400]  This is the guy that this young woman who worked for me couldn't want me to come to
[40:01.400 --> 40:02.400]  her parties.
[40:02.400 --> 40:03.400]  He said, you got to meet this guy.
[40:03.400 --> 40:04.400]  He's, he's a genius.
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.520]  And he does all these videos and I'm like, those videos are disgusting and satanic.
[40:08.520 --> 40:09.520]  So I met with this guy.
[40:09.520 --> 40:10.800]  Are you there, Darius?
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.720]  I met with this guy.
[40:12.720 --> 40:18.560]  I met with this guy and he was vaping, you know, pot the whole time, whatever.
[40:18.560 --> 40:20.680]  But dumb as rocks, dumb as rocks.
[40:20.680 --> 40:26.440]  So when I saw the little Nas video, I'm thinking, was Lil Nas X?
[40:26.440 --> 40:34.000]  Was he the one that said, let me make a music video where I dress up like a woman and give
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.200]  Satan a lap dance?
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.440]  Do I think Lil Nas X, Lil Nas, by the way, I know nothing about his name.
[40:41.440 --> 40:42.440]  I know about Nas.
[40:42.440 --> 40:45.120]  I know about Malcolm X.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.960]  And I know that Malcolm X would not approve of this video.
[40:47.960 --> 40:48.960]  How about that?
[40:48.960 --> 40:50.200]  Nas would not approve of this video.
[40:50.200 --> 40:53.960]  I would almost guarantee that, but I know Malcolm X would not.
[40:53.960 --> 41:00.640]  So I don't know why his, his name should be Lil Aleister Crowley or maybe Lil, uh, Madame
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.960]  Blavatsky, Lil Yale Scone Bones.
[41:04.960 --> 41:08.600]  But I've seen nothing to do with Malcolm X in that video.
[41:08.600 --> 41:10.640]  You know, he, he died a Sunni Muslim.
[41:10.640 --> 41:12.280]  I don't think he would approve of that video.
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.200]  So I don't know where his name comes from, but, but, but I don't think that that young
[41:16.200 --> 41:17.880]  man, by the way, he is a young man.
[41:17.880 --> 41:18.880]  I'm, I'm almost 50.
[41:18.880 --> 41:20.400]  You see, I became a father at 18, right?
[41:20.400 --> 41:21.400]  High school drop.
[41:21.400 --> 41:27.600]  I had my son at 18 when I was a soldier, infantryman, and so I have a 31 year old son.
[41:27.600 --> 41:28.880]  I think my son is older than him.
[41:28.880 --> 41:31.760]  I got to, I have two grandchildren, I have a daughter older than him too.
[41:31.760 --> 41:32.760]  That's it.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.760]  That to me is a young man.
[41:33.760 --> 41:36.800]  Do I think that young man said, Hey, let's make a spectacle.
[41:36.800 --> 41:41.320]  Let's take my image, my likeness, my name, and associate it with pedophilia because
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.200]  they winked to that movie, call you by my name, call me by my name, right?
[41:44.200 --> 41:45.440]  Did you catch that?
[41:45.440 --> 41:47.600]  That's a little wink at pedophilia.
[41:47.600 --> 41:49.880]  So I hope to God that he didn't.
[41:49.880 --> 41:51.600]  It's probably some creep.
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.920]  Like this creep I met at this party who let me tell you, I'll tell you a story is how
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  dumb he was.
[41:56.920 --> 41:58.880]  He is pontificating on politics.
[41:58.880 --> 41:59.880]  The whole party.
[41:59.880 --> 42:04.480]  Well, he's vaping away and I had just come back from Iraq where I was documenting the
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.480]  ISIS genocide against the Christians and he's like, Why are there Christians there anyways
[42:10.480 --> 42:11.480]  to Muslim country?
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.520]  And I said, Well, actually the Muslims they're called the Christians are older brothers
[42:15.520 --> 42:19.360]  because the Assyrians and the Christians that have been there have been there forever.
[42:19.360 --> 42:23.280]  In fact, the oldest Christian community in the world is in Iraq.
[42:23.280 --> 42:26.720]  And he like laughed like I was telling him a joke and he's like, Yeah, a lot of Baptists
[42:26.720 --> 42:27.720]  running around Iraq.
[42:27.720 --> 42:29.360]  I'm like, I know they're Assyrians.
[42:29.360 --> 42:30.360]  All right.
[42:30.360 --> 42:31.360]  Do we got you?
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.360]  Darius?
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.360]  All right, bro.
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.160]  I can't wait to get Darius back on, but yeah, they again, this is the exploitation of a
[42:37.160 --> 42:38.160]  young man.
[42:38.160 --> 42:39.160]  I hope I pray.
[42:39.160 --> 42:40.160]  I don't, I don't know.
[42:40.160 --> 42:42.280]  I don't know if this was his thinking.
[42:42.280 --> 42:43.280]  Pray God it wasn't.
[42:43.280 --> 42:44.280]  I pray God forgives them all.
[42:44.280 --> 42:48.240]  All right, after this break, we'll be joined with, I think I hear the music coming in.
[42:48.240 --> 42:52.680]  We'll be just make sure you go and check out this mega blowout because as we come back
[42:52.680 --> 42:56.120]  as your cities are opening up those blue state city folks, let's get in shape.
[42:56.120 --> 42:59.240]  Let's get healthy and let's have a beautiful year.
[42:59.240 --> 43:00.740]  They're not taking our year.
[43:00.740 --> 43:03.840]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.440]  The population has been trained to submit to what you're told that's all going to pass.
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.240]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[43:12.240 --> 43:16.400]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[43:16.400 --> 43:17.400]  totally enslaved.
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.200]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[43:21.200 --> 43:22.200]  that move.
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.200]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[43:26.200 --> 43:31.880]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[43:31.880 --> 43:36.840]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[43:36.840 --> 43:42.480]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[43:42.480 --> 43:47.080]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[43:47.080 --> 43:53.080]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[43:53.080 --> 43:56.040]  get more IMF and World Bank money.
[43:56.040 --> 43:59.960]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[43:59.960 --> 44:04.880]  I cannot remember the time that I did 50% off on Immersion Central because these are
[44:04.880 --> 44:11.520]  private labeled, top of the line, organic oils, essential oils, organic hand sanitizer
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.240]  sprays, organic shampoo, organic deodorant, organic body wash and more.
[44:16.240 --> 44:18.280]  And so there's not a lot of markup in them.
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.520]  So when we do 50% off, that is almost a loss leader.
[44:21.520 --> 44:24.320]  With free shipping, ladies and gentlemen, it is a loss leader.
[44:24.320 --> 44:28.840]  You can get it right now at infowarstore.com, but they're selling out quick and I'm doing
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.040]  this to introduce people who have been on the fence to EmRick's Essential.

[44:38.320 --> 44:40.520]  a few days as of me taping this.

[44:52.560 --> 44:53.560]  Thanks for visiting InfoWareStore.
[44:53.560 --> 45:00.640]  You kept us on air, but these are great products you need, so please take action now at infowarstore.com.
[45:00.640 --> 45:04.920]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point, it's very bittersweet.
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.080]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would, and now we have
[45:08.080 --> 45:09.800]  a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[45:09.800 --> 45:13.760]  I care about beating the new world order, and it's because we have so much credibility,
[45:13.760 --> 45:16.640]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[45:16.640 --> 45:19.880]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[45:19.880 --> 45:23.520]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.120]  the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.760]  So please pray for us, and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.360]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.520]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.520]  Do they fund freedom?
[45:37.520 --> 45:38.520]  No, a lot of them don't.
[45:38.520 --> 45:43.200]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[45:43.200 --> 45:45.000]  up and looking for truth.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.640]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.080]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[45:50.080 --> 45:53.560]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[45:53.560 --> 45:57.000]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.600]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[46:00.600 --> 46:03.800]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air and trying to move quicker.
[46:03.800 --> 46:04.800]  Hey Alex.
[46:04.800 --> 46:05.800]  Welcome.
[46:05.800 --> 46:10.360]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[46:10.360 --> 46:13.480]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[46:13.480 --> 46:20.200]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[46:20.200 --> 46:21.680]  Living defense saved my life.
[46:21.680 --> 46:26.040]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[46:26.040 --> 46:27.480]  Living defense brought me back.
[46:27.480 --> 46:33.200]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[46:33.200 --> 46:39.960]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[46:39.960 --> 46:46.120]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.320]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[46:50.320 --> 46:52.040]  That's right where we're at brother.
[46:52.040 --> 46:56.480]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[46:56.480 --> 47:04.080]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:08.080 --> 47:33.040]  Welcome back, Alex Jones show, Jason Jones sitting in and it looks like we may not be
[47:33.040 --> 47:39.760]  getting Darius, but I want to take some time to talk about breaking the great reset because
[47:39.760 --> 47:44.920]  sometimes we look at the challenges, we look at all the ways they're coming at us, the
[47:44.920 --> 47:49.600]  gaslighting mainstream media, all the people that we trust and look to for our news, they're
[47:49.600 --> 47:54.080]  being shoved off of easy to access outlets.
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.960]  But as a young man in the mid 90s, I saw this coming.
[47:58.960 --> 48:02.760]  That's why I was attracted to Alex Jones when I was in college and a grad student.
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.080]  I'd watched everything you made because I knew we were heading to a catastrophe now
[48:08.080 --> 48:09.960]  it's here.
[48:09.960 --> 48:17.760]  And it is seems almost really unbelievable that Bill Gates would publicly advocate muscling
[48:17.760 --> 48:28.400]  your children for eight hours in school, changing their DNA, filling the air with pollution
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.960]  to cool it down, eating bugs, it seems unbelievable.
[48:32.960 --> 48:40.040]  So I wanted to know, I'm never going to be able to unravel every conspiracy, every secret
[48:40.040 --> 48:41.040]  society.
[48:41.040 --> 48:42.040]  I'm never going to know their plans.
[48:42.040 --> 48:45.320]  I'm never going to know their players, but do I need to know them?
[48:45.320 --> 48:53.040]  I need to know the mechanisms they use to control us and the principles that we can advance
[48:53.040 --> 48:55.000]  to subvert those mechanisms.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.400]  So I'm going to name the five mechanisms that really are being used to control us.
[48:59.400 --> 49:01.600]  They're five ideologies.
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.000]  The first and first of all, they're all rooted in subhumanism and subhumanism has lots of
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.040]  names, right?
[49:08.040 --> 49:12.280]  Transhumanism, transhumanism, they want to make you less than human.
[49:12.280 --> 49:17.240]  What they really want is they want to keep you locked and think of Plato's cave.
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.480]  They want to keep you locked in the cave for eternity.
[49:20.480 --> 49:27.760]  They don't want you to go from Egypt to Jerusalem, they don't want you to go from here to eternity
[49:27.760 --> 49:28.760]  with God.
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.760]  They want to keep you trapped in their transhumanist cave because they want to dissolve you in
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.040]  an acid bath, destroy you, obliterate your personality, right?
[49:38.040 --> 49:39.040]  They're also humanism.
[49:39.040 --> 49:40.960]  And what are the mechanisms they use to control us?
[49:40.960 --> 49:43.360]  Number one is total war, total war.
[49:43.360 --> 49:44.800]  Look what's happening in Yemen.
[49:44.800 --> 49:47.280]  Look what we did to the people of Iraq.
[49:47.280 --> 49:49.140]  We sat on our hands.
[49:49.140 --> 49:55.160]  Well, ISIS, the JV team, as President Barack Obama called them, and I'm going to tell you
[49:55.160 --> 49:58.200]  the truth, they were the JV team.
[49:58.200 --> 50:00.200]  But that doesn't make it better.
[50:00.200 --> 50:02.480]  That makes it much, much worse.
[50:02.480 --> 50:09.280]  We allowed the JV team to commit several ethnic cleansings and genocides, total war, shattering
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.920]  order, changing borders.
[50:11.920 --> 50:15.680]  And Alex's special on the skull and bones, the granddaughter and daughter of a bones
[50:15.680 --> 50:20.120]  man, said they change nations, they change borders.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.120]  Yes, they do.
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.040]  Think of the Sykes-Picot Agreement in the Middle East.
[50:24.040 --> 50:26.800]  After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, there was a Sykes-Picot Agreement.
[50:26.800 --> 50:29.560]  War was used to change all the borders.
[50:29.560 --> 50:30.560]  Okay.
[50:30.560 --> 50:31.560]  Total war is the first one.
[50:31.560 --> 50:34.200]  We're going to come back because we have Darius on Darius.
[50:34.200 --> 50:35.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones.
[50:35.880 --> 50:38.080]  Jason, thank you for having me.
[50:38.080 --> 50:39.080]  No, I know you're thinking.
[50:39.080 --> 50:40.080]  I want to be on with Alex.
[50:40.080 --> 50:41.080]  Not you.
[50:41.080 --> 50:42.080]  That's what you're thinking.
[50:42.080 --> 50:43.080]  So it's good to see you, brother.
[50:43.080 --> 50:44.080]  No, I'm happy to be on with you.
[50:44.080 --> 50:47.240]  So look, you and I, we grew up together.
[50:47.240 --> 50:50.840]  You and I, first of all, there's no such thing as race, right?
[50:50.840 --> 50:51.840]  No such thing as race.
[50:51.840 --> 50:52.840]  There's ethnicity.
[50:52.840 --> 50:53.840]  There's culture.
[50:53.840 --> 50:54.840]  There's tradition.
[50:54.840 --> 50:55.840]  Right?
[50:55.840 --> 50:56.840]  There's all this, but race isn't a thing.
[50:56.840 --> 51:00.560]  But you and I, like as pals in our neighborhood, we grew up kind of learning about this together,
[51:00.560 --> 51:01.560]  right?
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.520]  Yeah, I agree with that, absolutely.
[51:03.520 --> 51:08.300]  We grew up learning about this with our friends and we were like friends before, I was your
[51:08.300 --> 51:13.360]  friend before I was your white friend, before there was even a concept and vice versa.
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.800]  And you've been looking at, and I want to get to the Hollywood thing.
[51:15.800 --> 51:19.040]  I don't know if we're going to have time for that, but the way, do you notice whenever
[51:19.040 --> 51:25.080]  there's a mass shooting or a tragedy, it is covered in a way, the news covers it in
[51:25.080 --> 51:29.080]  a way to create maximum division?
[51:29.080 --> 51:30.080]  Yes.
[51:30.080 --> 51:34.240]  And that's just the icing on top of the cake.
[51:34.240 --> 51:40.120]  You know, I think the real intention is to take our arms away from us, but adding racism
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.920]  to it makes it a little bit more sexy and spicy.
[51:43.920 --> 51:49.040]  So you know, a week or so ago, we had a racism against Asians and here in California, there's
[51:49.040 --> 51:54.000]  billboards and public service announcements and all the celebrities are speaking out against
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.560]  this racism.
[51:55.560 --> 52:02.440]  And then, you know, a few days ago in Boulder, Colorado, which is not, Colorado, the state
[52:02.440 --> 52:09.280]  which is no stranger to mass shootings, you know, several, several, what we say are false
[52:09.280 --> 52:11.240]  flags have taken place in the state of Colorado.
[52:11.240 --> 52:14.120]  We have the shooting at a grocery store.
[52:14.120 --> 52:20.400]  And that young man was a Syrian descent, but I believe he struggled with tremendous, tremendous
[52:20.400 --> 52:22.400]  mental illness.
[52:22.400 --> 52:27.120]  And then there's this whole thing that came out about how all mass shooters are white,
[52:27.120 --> 52:28.120]  you know, no one's of color.
[52:28.120 --> 52:32.040]  And I think that was debunked right away in social media where they showed a collage of
[52:32.040 --> 52:35.600]  all these faces that were Latin, black, white, Asian, et cetera.
[52:35.600 --> 52:40.760]  And why did they bring that up, except to divide us, to make us fearful of each other?
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.920]  It's all about division, you know, you know, we can take COVID has divided us to a point
[52:45.920 --> 52:49.440]  where we're divided and separated from our own families, so to speak.
[52:49.440 --> 52:56.120]  But now we want to, the media is manipulating us with this fear of this group is racist,
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.640]  that group is racist.
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.120]  And it's all a myth, man, it's not, it's no truth, there's no honesty to it at all.
[53:02.120 --> 53:07.320]  You know, what happened in Washington, D.C. on January 6th is another, you know, great
[53:07.320 --> 53:15.560]  example of division, you know, manipulated division at its finest is to where, you know,
[53:15.560 --> 53:22.600]  the individuals that perpetrated that crime, I don't believe at all were really Trump supporters.
[53:22.600 --> 53:26.080]  I believe they were for somewhere else and their agenda was something else.
[53:26.080 --> 53:32.720]  But the point I'm making is it was all about racism, racism, racism, and the propaganda
[53:32.720 --> 53:40.320]  that spilled out post that event with people being on camera saying that I was called the
[53:40.320 --> 53:45.040]  N-word and they treated me like this and it's all about this group of people who are so
[53:45.040 --> 53:46.040]  racist.
[53:46.040 --> 53:56.000]  It's really getting nauseating and frustrating to exist nowadays with, with how division
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.960]  is so heightened and so out of control.
[53:58.960 --> 54:01.280]  And into divide us, they cannot tell the truth.
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.880]  Like, and then we have this new thing, it's anti-racism.
[54:04.880 --> 54:08.200]  It's not enough for you yourself not to be racist.
[54:08.200 --> 54:14.280]  You have to go around sniffing everyone out and looking for subtle, subtle, subtle clues
[54:14.280 --> 54:19.840]  that they may be racist and as soon as you smell something, you better quickly be very
[54:19.840 --> 54:22.080]  cruel to them publicly, right?
[54:22.080 --> 54:23.400]  Like, it's not enough.
[54:23.400 --> 54:28.440]  Like, you yourself, oh yeah, you yourself, but are you an anti, is anti-racism is really
[54:28.440 --> 54:30.720]  kind of racism, isn't it?
[54:30.720 --> 54:37.440]  It's very racism, you know, and these companies with the, with teaching people how not to
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.800]  be white is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[54:40.800 --> 54:44.400]  You know, it's like the Black Mirror episode where everybody was walking around through
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.280]  mobile phone and hitting the like button for every interaction.
[54:48.280 --> 54:51.960]  And it's almost to the point where we're getting to this place where, like you said,
[54:51.960 --> 54:56.320]  there has to be a sniff or a smell test to really see what we are is all about, what
[54:56.320 --> 55:01.600]  we are all about as human beings, but you know, we were created by a benevolent God
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.280]  that wants nothing for the best for every human being that walks this planet.
[55:06.280 --> 55:13.080]  So, so all of this divisiveness and this race-baiting really goes against what I believe as a reason
[55:13.080 --> 55:14.080]  why we're here.
[55:14.080 --> 55:15.640]  It's just to love each other, you know, unconditionally.
[55:15.640 --> 55:18.320]  And isn't that what most Americans believe at most times?
[55:18.320 --> 55:21.920]  Like, we can allow ourselves, all of us, I'm a very emotional person.
[55:21.920 --> 55:25.440]  But all of us can be manipulated from time to time.
[55:25.440 --> 55:27.800]  We can be whipped into frenzies and enthousiasms.
[55:27.800 --> 55:34.680]  But don't you think most Americans, most human beings on the planet at most times when they're
[55:34.680 --> 55:41.640]  not pushed into fear, whipped into frenzies, gas-lit and lied to, they love people.
[55:41.640 --> 55:45.320]  You know, they want to do normal human things when Alex said, hey, can you guest host the
[55:45.320 --> 55:46.320]  show?
[55:46.320 --> 55:49.000]  And my first thought was, I'm having a barbecue with a bunch of my friends.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.320]  Oh, well, yeah, this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
[55:51.320 --> 55:52.320]  Of course.
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.760]  But I wanted to do normal human things that any human would, every human wants to do.
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.200]  Love each other, watch our kids play with each other, ride their bikes around the cul-de-sac.
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.400]  Like you and me, we play Whippleball and football all day, every day, right?
[56:06.400 --> 56:08.880]  This is what people want for their family, for their friends and for their children,
[56:08.880 --> 56:11.120]  like most people.
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.280]  I cannot disagree with that.
[56:14.280 --> 56:15.280]  And that's what it's all about.
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.560]  You know, I believe that we're at a point where, we're at a tipping point where if we
[56:19.560 --> 56:24.000]  don't get back to the fundamentals of caring for and loving each other, that we're going
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.240]  to be lost, not as Americans, but as humans, period, you know, is what you were talking
[56:30.240 --> 56:38.400]  about with Alex is, I want to say three, two, two, three, so scum of all aspects.
[56:38.400 --> 56:44.880]  You know, we have been manipulated by design for millennia, for a very, very, very long
[56:44.880 --> 56:45.880]  time.
[56:45.880 --> 56:51.480]  And we were made to believe that they were supposed to be separated, were supposed to
[56:51.480 --> 56:52.480]  be divided.
[56:52.480 --> 56:54.800]  We were groomed to believe.
[56:54.800 --> 56:58.520]  They're having a, Darius, I don't know if you know about, they're having like right
[56:58.520 --> 57:06.000]  now, they're segregating graduations, not only by ethnicity, they're calling it race.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  There's no race.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.720]  Could we stop even calling it that?
[57:08.720 --> 57:14.600]  By ethnicity, by culture, by heritage, by gender, by sexual orientation.
[57:14.600 --> 57:15.600]  How many graduates?
[57:15.600 --> 57:19.760]  Well, why don't we just have each kid go off somewhere in the forest alone, have his
[57:19.760 --> 57:20.760]  own ceremony?
[57:20.760 --> 57:25.600]  I mean, how, how, how many, how are we going to like keep slicing this pie?
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.520]  I don't have words for that, and I really don't, I don't, it's, it's, it's unconscionable
[57:31.520 --> 57:32.520]  man.
[57:32.520 --> 57:33.520]  It doesn't make any sense.
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.000]  It sounds like, you say these things, there it is, national review, it sounds like we're
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  lying, Darius.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  Well, thank you.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.360]  And have you back, I'm going to have you on my podcast, and you know, I got a movie
[57:42.360 --> 57:44.480]  we're making, I can't wait to share it with Alex in the world.
[57:44.480 --> 57:45.480]  It's good to see you.
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.480]  That's right.
[57:46.480 --> 57:47.480]  Good to see you too.
[57:47.480 --> 57:48.480]  Thank you.
[57:48.480 --> 57:49.480]  We're coming on.
[57:49.480 --> 57:51.480]  We're going to have the Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Hawaii joining us.
[57:51.480 --> 57:55.120]  Six years ago, the doctor group helped us develop living defense, and he told me, Alex,
[57:55.120 --> 57:57.320]  this is going to be one of your most popular products.
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.600]  I mean, really a bunch of black walnut, a bunch of these herbs, he said, listen, this
[58:01.600 --> 58:07.280]  stuff flushes out parasites, this stuff is beyond probiotics from the bacterial on up.
[58:07.280 --> 58:08.280]  It's amazing.
[58:08.280 --> 58:13.840]  It's got Indian science, Native American science, ancient European herbology, it's, it's
[58:13.840 --> 58:14.840]  all there.
[58:14.840 --> 58:16.360]  And it's become a bestseller.
[58:16.360 --> 58:17.360]  People love it.
[58:17.360 --> 58:18.360]  It's amazing.

[58:21.040 --> 58:22.280]  regimens in it.

[59:53.560 --> 1:00:01.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:04.440]  Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
[1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:10.160]  The people of the world submitted to United Nations Directives on their health, on their
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:15.880]  right to travel and how to raise their children and the UN told us that the family was bad
[1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:20.920]  and the UN told us that capitalism was bad and the UN told us that they were good and
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:21.920]  would direct us.
[1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.800]  There was no discussion or question about who created the UN and who was behind it and
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.800]  how did it have so much power.
[1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:32.520]  Sure it had been in the back of the newspaper that the virus came out of a long lab, but
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:33.520]  that was okay.
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:37.760]  It didn't matter that Fauci had been involved with Bill Gates actually funding the very
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:43.560]  virus that was released because now there are saviors and here's the zero hedge headline
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.560]  upon infowarstore.com.
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:50.480]  Here come the global vaccine passports for businesses who rely on tourism.
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:55.400]  The passport is seen as a route to salvation close quote.
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:56.400]  That's right.
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:00:59.400]  You see, it's not the lockdown that caused them to go bankrupt.
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.680]  It's not the fraud of the virus and the global hopes that caused that.
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:03.680]  No, no, no.
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:08.080]  If they just submit and take the vaccine and have the passport, then they'll be allowed
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:12.920]  to travel, then they'll be allowed to trade, but that's not true.
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:15.240]  It's the global digital passport that's actually the trap.
[1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.440]  Once it's in place, the restrictions will only intensify and Klaus Schwab, the Davos
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:20.680]  group that UN have all said they want less travel.
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.440]  They want to lower our carbon footprints.
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:28.160]  They want yearly and bi-yearly global lockdowns to lower our carbon footprint.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:31.520]  That's the sick part as they brag about it all, but here's the business owners in the
[1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:32.720]  article in Greece.
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:37.200]  We're pitting our hopes on the vaccines and the COVID pass to the hotel manager.
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  Instead of saying this is a fraud, this is a lie, they counted all the other deaths of
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:42.200]  other things.
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:43.200]  This is not very contagious.
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:44.520]  This is just like the flu.
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.920]  They're teaching us to have phobias of normal activity so that we run into our houses and
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:48.920]  never leave again.
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:51.720]  We're all being trained to live on house arrest and be prisoners.
[1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:53.800]  All the big tech companies doubled or tripled their profits.
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:57.080]  China made more billionaires in one year than all billionaires in the rest of the world
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:01:58.080]  combined.
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:02.200]  No, there's no discussion of the takeover, no discussion of how it's an economic war
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.480]  using fear, using psychological systems.
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:06.480]  No.
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:12.120]  It's all just the way forward is submit with your global ID and your global passport.
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:15.200]  And here's another microcosm example also in infowars.com.
[1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:21.400]  Belt and Road, China reportedly doubled freight shipping to Europe via Russia and Central Asia
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.120]  before the Suez jam up.
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:28.120]  So globalists shipped all our jobs to China, but suppose the Americans could buy the goods
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.040]  back and then sell them to others, but now that's all over.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.880]  And since the Suez Canal got jammed up with thousands of ships blocked, they're now reporting
[1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:41.160]  that China isn't just going to double, not just quadruple, but quintuple their trade
[1:02:41.160 --> 1:02:44.480]  and that people will then be basically addicted to doing that.
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:49.040]  There's also a magical shortage in shipping containers.
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:51.800]  And so as you can see, those boxcars are perfect.
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:56.600]  So now their Belt and Road initiative is taking over the planet where JPMorgan Chase, Goldman
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:01.240]  Sachs, and all the globalists have been investing because business is over in Europe, business
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:06.000]  is over in Australia, business is over in the U.S. and Canada, and they're going to do
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.640]  everything they can in economic warfare to block us.
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:13.680]  Isn't it funny that every accident, every disaster, every problem helps China where
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:17.440]  the globalists put all their eggs because they're the authoritarian model of the future?
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:22.840]  Again, the articles from Sputnik, it's on infowars.com, Belt and Road, China reportedly
[1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:28.000]  doubled freight shipping to Europe via Russia and Central Asia before Suez jammed up.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:33.240]  And then a Japanese ship just magically wedges itself in there and there's just no way to
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:34.240]  fix it.
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:35.240]  Look forward to take weeks or months.
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:39.720]  This is just the new way of life and that will further put the U.S. into depression,
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:43.640]  which Joe Biden is working around the clock to do.
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:48.280]  We have more than 10 supplement manufacturers that are all the highest grade in the U.S.
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:51.240]  And four of them, we can't even get products from anymore, they've just shut down because
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:54.160]  of COVID and gone bankrupt basically permanently.
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:57.320]  And that's just an example of the economic warfare America is under.
[1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:02.120]  And that's why I tell listeners, you need to get storeable food now at preparewithalix.com
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:06.560]  at the highest quality, the lowest prices, why you need to get the supplements and things
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:11.960]  now so that you're stocked up and so that we're also funded someone in the future because
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:16.400]  this is the beginning of the collapse, not the end of the collapse.
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:20.640]  The globalists have us in their trap and the more we submit and the stupider our lawyer
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.160]  politicians are, not realizing what's happening, the worse it's all going to be.
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.800]  We end the big sale this Wednesday evening of free shipping on all immigrants essentials,

[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:44.320]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest, it's so popular we can't keep it in

[1:05:54.120 --> 1:06:17.080]  All right, we're coming back with Darius, but while we wait for Darius, I got a plan,
[1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:22.720]  I sat down with my family, we're new to Texas, we left this beautiful state of Hawaii, it's
[1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:27.440]  a privilege to live in, you know, having lived in the two states now that were countries,
[1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:30.520]  and maybe, maybe there'll be countries again, I don't know, we're gonna have a secretary
[1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:34.680]  of state of the kingdom of Hawaii on, but I put the map of Texas out for my children
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:41.000]  and I said, they tried to take a year from our life, but this is a big, beautiful state,
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.360]  look at all these lakes, look at all these rivers, look at all these towns with great
[1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:50.000]  histories, rich histories, the hill country, the Guadalupe River, the German immigrants
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.240]  and the Comanche, there is so much to do.
[1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:58.440]  It's important that we live our life for our community, that we share the truth about what's
[1:06:58.440 --> 1:07:03.760]  happening to us, but for those of us, especially fathers and mothers and families and friends,
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:09.320]  we need to have barbecues, festivals, we need to have wiffleball games, kickball games in
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:16.000]  the parks, we need our kids out on the street playing football, yelling, car, this is what
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.040]  we need, this is what life is, do we have Darius back, I see him smiling there, because
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:24.840]  that was that, that was, you know, when Darius and I were kids, that's what we did, that,
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:30.960]  that light post over there and that VW over there with the muffler hanging off of it, that's,
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:36.080]  that's an in zone and that's an in zone, and then we'd play and then a car would come and
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:41.440]  we'd yell car, then the dudes, the old men would sit on their stoops and they would
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:46.360]  cheer for us, they would watch us like it was Monday night football and they would beam
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:51.280]  and they would cheer and it was just six kids playing in the street all summer long, that's
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:55.240]  what we need, they want to take away our leisure, they want to take away our joy, they want
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:00.840]  to take our way our communities, but I have a saying, think local, act local, live local,
[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:03.520]  it's your neighborhood, it's your block, it's your community, it's your family, it's your
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:08.560]  friends, it's your church community, live there, love there, celebrate there, Darius Garland,
[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.200]  welcome back to the show.
[1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.200]  Thank you much, Jason Jones.
[1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:17.640]  I want to go to this little nozz, little nozz X. Now, I was talking to you on the phone
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:21.280]  and you saw the shoes, you didn't see the video and I said, I said, you need to watch
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:25.440]  this because nothing you've ever seen in your life, nothing you have ever, you could have
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.720]  watched Eyes Wide Shut 27 times, Clockwork Orange back to back with no sleep, even mushrooms
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:34.880]  and that would not have prepared you for this video.
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:35.880]  Was I exaggerating?
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:45.400]  No, you aren't exaggerating, the end of times in satanic symbolism is off the charts.
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:53.640]  And I think about the demographic of the age of the kids that are fans of this artist and
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:59.200]  how they're consuming this, how they're perceiving it, and that's just a big head scratcher to
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:00.200]  me.
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:07.160]  It's a lot to unpack with this content that this young man has created and I'd be remiss
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:14.440]  to say that the intention is to brainwash and to have children start thinking in that
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:15.440]  direction.
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:19.480]  Well, it's on the shoes, Darius, it's on the shoes, it says, it has the Bible verse on
[1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:28.960]  the shoes, that Bible verse is, I see Satan fall, Eve imitated Satan when she rebelled
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:33.600]  and Adam rebelled, they were watching Satan, imitating Satan.
[1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:39.360]  Now we're watching Lil Nas and they want our children to imitate them.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:44.000]  Going back to Plato and Aristotle, they understood that human beings learn through imitation.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:52.240]  Nike does not spend millions of dollars for commercials because people don't imitate what
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:56.840]  they see on television, right, if that didn't work.
[1:09:56.840 --> 1:09:59.760]  So clearly young people are going to imitate this.
[1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:00.760]  That's the goal, right?
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:04.000]  That's the goal and that's the intention, yeah.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.800]  I think it goes past the capitalistic point of view of generating revenue.
[1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:16.680]  It's more in gaining a customer for life.
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:20.840]  It's gaining a follower and I don't say a follower like a social media follower, I say
[1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:34.520]  like a cult follower, where there's no investment into anything culturally positive or benevolent
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:40.000]  with any of these companies and how they're right, no beauty, no goodness.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.440]  I got excited when I first heard about it, Darius, I thought, oh, is this, I heard about
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:48.120]  the shoes first and I thought it's Lil Nas X criticizing Nike because they're selling
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:54.840]  you satanic shoes 666 with blood, get drops of blood, you get blood on the shoe.
[1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:59.400]  And I thought, well, you know, the dope, this is the dope of the Uyghur, right here.
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:04.160]  And I thought maybe, maybe, this is a stand in solidarity with the Uyghur because we have
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:09.040]  all the NBA players, you know, taking knees, but yet they have their repping Nike that
[1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:11.000]  uses slaves to make their shoes.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.640]  So at first I got hopeful, like is this truth in advertising, like he's saying that these
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.680]  shoes were made with the blood of slaves?
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:19.560]  No, that's not what's going on here.
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:20.880]  That's not what's going on here.
[1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:27.160]  Luke 10, 18, I see Satan fall like lightning and this comes out tomorrow, the shoes will
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:28.160]  come out tomorrow.
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:31.200]  It was announced on Friday, a week before Good Friday.
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:32.480]  This was not an accident.
[1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:33.480]  No.
[1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:34.480]  There's no accidents.
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:36.040]  Like Alex said, it was, was it an accident?
[1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.040]  Man, it startled me.
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:41.320]  Did you see the scone bone special?
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:47.200]  I watched some of it and, and a lot of that stuff I researched and, and I have familiarity
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:48.200]  with it.
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:51.520]  So, you know, what I saw on the sculling bones didn't really surprise me.
[1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:56.000]  It was kind of validated a lot of things that I, I believe that I was a little bit
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  unclear on.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:06.560]  What I didn't know, maybe you knew that Genesis three, two, two is the verse where the tree
[1:12:06.560 --> 1:12:11.000]  of life where they want to live forever.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.960]  And so much of this is, is in transhumanism.
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:20.000]  What I find with people that are seduced by transhumanism is that they don't even live
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.840]  the life they have now.
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:27.760]  Like, no, the transhumanists, I know you meet these folks, they're living lives.
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:31.680]  They're not even living lives because life is about love.
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.840]  Love is about sacrifice and they live like lives of desperation.
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:42.360]  And I just, this week, it was tragic, I believe, some a prominent transhumanist committed suicide.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.480]  They live the lives of despair.
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:50.440]  Why would they want to extend into eternity living in this cave, living in this life of
[1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:57.040]  despair, you know, that, that tragedy with that juice world, that young man went to
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:00.760]  the high school I went to right next to where we grew up.
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:04.440]  And he lived a life of desperation and sadness.
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:06.920]  And that's, we don't need to know.
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:12.920]  Young people, young people don't think that Lil Nas X is happy.
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:15.400]  He's living a very sorrowful life.
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:19.240]  This, it's, it's, this always leads to sorrow and despair.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:20.240]  Right.
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  No, he can't be happy.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:27.640]  Like, I don't know that I don't know the guy personally, but I think anybody that lack
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:33.520]  of better term self or soul for fame and riches cannot, cannot be happy.
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:36.400]  I don't think there's any happiness with any of that.
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:38.120]  You know, I'll, I'll, I'll.
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:41.280]  Someone I thought about, I want to ask you before we go to break.
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:47.720]  When I saw this, it was a lot of gender dysphoria going on in this video and transgender and
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:52.800]  and Kat Williams does, you know, he's, he's really great critic of Hollywood and he talks
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.920]  about how every black man to be successful in Hollywood has to wear a dress.
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:00.760]  He also says, don't, you know, be careful when you go to a party in Hollywood, you
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:03.000]  might go into the wrong room.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  What happened to me?
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  Like two times.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  I went to a party.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I said, I think I'm at the wrong party.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  I want to ask you about those two things.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.240]  Have you ever, I guess, first, what do you think about Kat Williams is what he noticed.
[1:14:14.240 --> 1:14:18.160]  He discovered this idea of the have to wear a dress to be successful.
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:24.280]  That's always been a joke and, and that if in order to be successful, you have to dress
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:25.280]  in drag.
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:32.600]  And there's been a lot of Hollywood stars, black and white that have all done drag.
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:39.080]  Like if you occur Russell and tango and cash, uh, Jude Law in 2009, uh, he played Binks
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  in the movie Rage, uh, Johnny Depp in Ed Wood, uh, John Travolta in hairspray, um, uh, you
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:48.080]  know, Martin.
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:50.080]  I didn't know that.
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:51.080]  Yeah.
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:56.560]  John Travolta in hairspray, Robin Williams, Mrs. Doubtfire, Justin Hoffman, Tootsie, the
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:03.520]  Williams brothers were white chicks, um, Stephen Dorff played, uh, it's candy darling in the
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  world.
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:05.520]  So it's like an initiation.
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:06.520]  It's like a ritual.
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.520]  Yeah.
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  It's like a co-ritual.
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:09.520]  Yeah.
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:10.520]  I believe so.
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.520]  I believe so.
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:17.040]  It's, it's, it's the shame and humiliation, um, to be in that, that circle or that club.
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:18.560]  Now you talked about parties.
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:19.560]  Yeah.
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:22.400]  Have you ever gone to the wrong room at one of these parties and go, oh, no, I got to
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.400]  call my new world?
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:24.400]  No.
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:25.760]  I'm a couple of degrees of separation.
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:30.560]  I've had a lot of close friends tell me stories about being at celebrities homes where they
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:35.760]  had to sign a lot of paperwork and, you know, if you want to leave, leave now, but I'm
[1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:36.760]  out.
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:37.760]  Yeah.

[1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:20.320]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:26.040]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:32.040]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:38.680]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:43.280]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:49.200]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual

[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:14.720]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a

[1:19:56.480 --> 1:20:01.600]  Welcome.
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:19.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:35.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:40.800]  I am Jason Jones sitting in for the day, and what a privilege to be here with you, the
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:46.680]  InfoWare's audience, because I know when the history books are written on how the great
[1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:53.800]  reset was crushed, how the trans-liberal New World Order was a fantasy, was a republic
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:57.160]  in the sky that vanished, was a wisp.
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:21:02.440]  The Alex Jones show and his audience are going to be chapter one of that book, and it is
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:03.440]  a privilege.
[1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:07.280]  You know today we're going to talk about the Uyghur, but you can't love people on the
[1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:12.360]  other side of the world if you do not love your own.
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:17.320]  And when I told my friends when I left Hawaii, I said, I'm not leaving Hawaii, I'm deploying.
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:22.480]  Because in July, if you remember, I was arrested, or you may not remember, I was arrested in
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.120]  the very first reopen rally.
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:31.880]  I maybe was the first person in the world arrested at a reopen event, and I had friends
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:36.880]  in the state government, and they said, Jason, do you know that we were in meetings and they're
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:43.800]  going to keep the state shut down until there's a vaccine?
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:51.800]  And then if you don't get the vaccine, the state will still be shut down for you.
[1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:57.440]  And when I heard that, I said, you know, I'm a student of political philosophy, and I know
[1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:03.400]  that a regime forms your children, where you live shapes your children.
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:09.720]  That's why I lived in Hawaii for 31 years, because I wanted that community to raise and
[1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:11.080]  shape my children.
[1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:14.840]  There was no place in the world that I would rather be my partner.
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:18.080]  We laugh at Hillary Clinton when she says it takes the village to raise your child.
[1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:20.200]  Your village raises your child.
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:24.720]  And right now folks, your village is showing your kid little Nas X, right?
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:31.880]  So you need friends and family and neighbors that celebrate community, solidarity, family,
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:36.040]  faith, and I'm telling you, that's Hawaii, especially where I lived on the west side
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:39.280]  of Oahu, that's those values.
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:43.960]  But when the state locked us down, said you can't leave your house, kids, you can't go
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:49.560]  to swimming competition, dance class, hula class, no, no, that's over.
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:52.600]  And if you go to school, you got to wear a mask, we're homeschool.
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:55.680]  And if you want, no, that's going to change my children.
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:23:01.360]  What we need to understand is this 12 months of a shutdown going on and on, when is it going
[1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:02.360]  to stop?
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:07.280]  Those of you who live in these blue states and blue cities, it is changing almost going
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:11.120]  to change the very nature of your children and you.
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:13.520]  So I had to get out of there.
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:16.800]  But my big concern, and if you saw what there was in handcuffs, people said, were you there
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:18.360]  for the First Amendment?
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:19.360]  No.
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:24.320]  I was there because of my fear for food security.
[1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:26.520]  I run a human rights organization.
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:31.080]  We focus on famine, genocide, genocide, war and abortion.
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:37.240]  And all of the great famines of history and history were caused by government.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:42.200]  And so I knew that the furthest place in the world, from any other place in the world,
[1:23:42.200 --> 1:23:43.700]  is Hawaii.
[1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:48.800]  We import 90% of our food not because of the farmers that we're an agriculture community.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:50.460]  We had agript from us.
[1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:54.840]  Not because we wanted to destroy our ag industry, because it was destroyed.
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:56.640]  I feared food insecurity.
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:59.720]  And so that's why I wanted to have on my guest today, Leon Sue.
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:03.960]  So Leon Sue is the Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:10.960]  And as he's coming back, Leon, brother, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:11.960]  Can you hear me?
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:12.960]  Yes.
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:13.960]  Yes, I can hear you.
[1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:14.960]  Fine.
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:15.960]  Thank you, Jason.
[1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:16.960]  Aloha.
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:17.960]  Aloha.
[1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:21.240]  You know, the people of Hawaii, you know, there's this canary in the coal mine.
[1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:26.720]  If you want to know how the skull and bones and those folks treated the people of Africa
[1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:34.000]  or China or Asia or how the Hawaiians were treated, they don't see folks in Iowa or New
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Hampshire or Boston.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  They don't see them any different.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.800]  And I thought I wanted to have you on to address this great catastrophe that people
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:41.200]  in the world don't know.
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.120]  Our own paper in Hawaii, just the Star Advertiser reported this week, that 50% of families with
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:50.600]  children are food insecure in Hawaii right now.
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:53.720]  Can you kind of set up what is happening in Hawaii and how did we get here?
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:58.440]  Well, that all defines how you define secure.
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:05.000]  We actually have been food insecure for a long time because, as you said, 90% of the food
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  in Hawaii is imported, as well as energy and most of the other materials that we need to
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.280]  survive on.
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:17.400]  They all come in from the United States, and the way it got there is that the United States
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:23.840]  took over the Hawaiian kingdom, which was in the 19th century, a sovereign, independent
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:29.320]  state recognized by all the other countries of the world as an equal sovereign.
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:36.800]  The Hawaiian kingdom had over 130 diplomatic missions around the world, consulates and
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:38.880]  embassies and things like that.
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:45.720]  And then suddenly in 1893, the United States landed troops in Hawaii and they invaded,
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:54.880]  where they sent an invasion force, the queen decided not to oppose the United States because
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:26:00.400]  of the United States superiority, of course, as far as in arms.
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:05.240]  But what the United States was doing was that they were supporting an insurrection by a
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.440]  few disgruntled local white businessmen who were actually sugar barons.
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  Really ag?
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:12.440]  The ag industry.
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:13.440]  Big ag.
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  Right?
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:15.920]  That's the version of big ag.
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:22.880]  Yes, big ag, exactly what it was, they had turned away into this huge agricultural production
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:30.640]  state, but not producing food, but producing sugar cane for export, and then later, pineapple.
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:40.320]  But these sugar cane barons wanted a better market for their sugar, and the McKinley tariff
[1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:45.600]  had put some severe limitations on the pricing of sugar in the United States.
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:49.240]  And this was part of reconstruction, I mean, it's part of the history of the Civil War,
[1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:53.040]  and then we looked to Hawaii for sugar during the Civil War.
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:57.320]  Can you bring us up to speed on, we had the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom, which
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:02.160]  is undeniable, it was an illegal overthrow, where we go from here with that, maybe even
[1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:06.520]  you and I disagree and we're close friends, shared office for years, can you hear me,
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:07.520]  Leigh Ann?
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:08.520]  Can you hear me?
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:09.520]  Right, yeah.
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:10.520]  Okay.
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:14.200]  One is that there were two motives for the overthrow.
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:18.440]  One was the sugar planters wanted bigger profits, because they were used to getting
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.320]  really rich on sugar, and now the McKinley tariff stood in their way.
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:28.840]  The second part is the United States wanted to expand its influence out into the Pacific,
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:31.040]  and Hawaii had Pearl Harbor.
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.640]  The United States had recognized Pearl Harbor 20 years earlier and said this is the most
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:42.440]  ideal port in the Pacific if we want to expand into the Pacific.
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:50.320]  And so these two motives collided or collaborated and cooked up the scheme to overthrow the
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:56.320]  Hawaiian kingdom, annex the Hawaiian islands to the United States, therefore the tariffs
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:01.880]  would be gone, and secondly, the United States would have access, open access to the port
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.480]  of Pearl Harbor.
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:04.720]  And that's what happened.
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:10.120]  They concocted the scheme, 1893, overthrew the government, took over, and even though
[1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:16.440]  President Cleveland decried that action, and he said this was an act of war against a
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:17.440]  friendly nation.
[1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:18.440]  We cannot do that.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:26.240]  The United States acted, did an international wrongful act in the United States by invading.
[1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:30.720]  And I'm going to bring you back after this break, Leigh Ann.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.640]  I want to make sure we, after this break, we bring it up to how the folks in Hawaii
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:36.760]  today are food insecure and how we got there.
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:44.800]  I'll bring you back on the other side of the break, and yeah, social engineers brought
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:49.760]  people from all over the world, created a new community around agriculture, and then
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:54.920]  just as they overthrew the Hawaiian kingdom, they ripped out the industry that knit together
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:58.000]  this new community that we know of today as the people of Hawaii.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:02.600]  It was six years ago that Dr. Group helped us develop living defense, and he told me
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:06.200]  Alex, this is going to be one of your most popular products, and we were really a bunch
[1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:11.440]  of black walnut, a bunch of these herbs, he said, listen, this stuff flushes out parasites,
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:16.320]  this stuff is beyond probiotics, from the bacterial on up, it's amazing.
[1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:22.880]  It's got Indian science, Native American science, ancient European herbology, it's all there,
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:26.040]  and it's become a bestseller, people love it, it's amazing, and you've been on the fence
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:27.440]  and haven't taken it.
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:31.400]  It is a big bottle with more than two regimens in it, so this will cover you basically for
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:36.120]  a year, but you want to do it every six months, and the cleanse is incredible, everybody gets

[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:03.400]  I cannot remember the time that I did 50% off on emergency essentials, because these
[1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:10.200]  are private labeled, top of the line, organic oils, essential oils, organic hand sanitizer
[1:30:10.200 --> 1:30:15.520]  sprays, organic shampoo, organic deodorant, organic body wash, and more, and so there's
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:20.280]  not a lot of markup in them, so when we do 50% off, that is almost a lost leader, with

[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:17.760]  up there with Turboforce, I love Turboforce, it's great, but when you don't have time or
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:23.280]  you don't have the wherewithal to drink a bottle of water, take two capsules of Brainforce

[1:31:32.680 --> 1:31:36.500]  the important part about Brainforce Plus, is there's no crash, it's not like drinking

[1:31:49.960 --> 1:31:58.880]  Plus, clean natural energy, and right now, it's on sale 50% off InfowordStore.com.
[1:31:58.880 --> 1:32:04.200]  I've been sneaking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there, about looking at
[1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:08.200]  the world from the perspective of the globalist, that the public is so dumbed down that they
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:11.400]  don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them, that
[1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:15.240]  we're sterilizing them, that they deserve to be killed.
[1:32:15.240 --> 1:32:19.080]  Yes, that's the position of the globalist, they play God, and they think because we don't
[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:21.920]  stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:26.040]  You know, I've told you that the globalists have tried to harm me, they've tried to get
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:31.880]  me to join them, but metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the Holy Spirit, I'm connection
[1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:36.640]  with God, and I know that God does not like that, so I cannot join the enemy, but I'll
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:42.000]  tell you at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:45.320]  believing you're part of it, or believing you're getting power along with it.
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:51.200]  Whether you're just a steelworker, or a schoolteacher, or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:55.720]  And treating other people like they're animals, and you're God, is something that the real
[1:32:55.720 --> 1:33:01.600]  God of the universe doesn't like, and that's a fact.
[1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:12.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:12.680 --> 1:33:20.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.600]  Well, so does he.
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:29.640]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:35.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, I am your guest host, Jason Jones.
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:40.960]  You may not be able to go to Hawaii without a vaccine passport, but today on Infowars,
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:46.920]  you are going to Hawaii with the Secretary of State for the Kingdom of Hawaii, Leon Sue,
[1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:50.480]  and here's what folks need to understand, Leon.
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:54.800]  The people of Hawaii didn't decide to get rid of their agriculture industry.
[1:33:54.800 --> 1:33:58.920]  When you and I were young, the farm fair was the biggest thing in Hawaii.
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:01.640]  We were an agriculture state.
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:06.080]  When the sugar plantation owners over through the Kingdom of Hawaii, they reached out around
[1:34:06.080 --> 1:34:09.120]  the world, Okinawa, Japan, the Philippines.
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:12.520]  We even had cowboys, the Paniolo from Mexico.
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:14.360]  They all came to Hawaii, Puerto Ricans.
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:21.080]  We made a new community built around farming, then the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, those
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:28.080]  same groups through international trade agreements, decided in 1994, Hawaii no longer will be
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:30.440]  an ag state.
[1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:37.200]  So now the furthest place in the world from any other place in the world requires ships
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.720]  to bring in 90% of its food.
[1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:44.840]  Now if you think that sounds bad, it's about to get worse, folks, because of something
[1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:46.560]  called the Jones Act.
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:51.600]  The Jones Act, which I think is actually a good act, it supports domestic shipbuilders
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.160]  and shipping, which means that all ships going to Hawaii have to come from U.S. ports and
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:57.800]  U.S. ships.
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:02.440]  The problem is the Jones Act, Hawaii should be exempt, Hawaii should be exempt because
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:06.440]  it's in the middle of the ocean halfway between Asia and the United States.
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:13.800]  So the Jones Act, on top of the destruction of our ag industry combined, will I promise
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:20.160]  you sometime in the 21st century, Leon, it's unimaginable that in our lifetime, the lifetime
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.680]  of our children and grandchildren, there will not be a major food catastrophe in Hawaii.
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  Isn't that true?
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:32.360]  Absolutely, and just the irony of it was that when Hawaii was discovered, Hawaii was a fully
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:36.400]  self-sustaining system of agriculture.
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:41.360]  And so we basically were able to take care of ourselves, and some estimates are up to
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:43.360]  a million people at the time.
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:47.920]  So the 1.4 million people in Hawaii right now, but they've destroyed the agriculture,
[1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:55.080]  the United States policies has destroyed agriculture in the islands, and we import everything.
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:01.040]  Now, we can cause it to return, so we can raise our own foods and be self-sufficient
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:04.440]  once again, but we can't do it under the United States.
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:09.240]  This is why there is a strong movement to restore the Hawaiian Kingdom as a sovereign
[1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:14.640]  independent country, because we have to be making these types of decisions ourselves.
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:16.720]  What's going to be best for our people?
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:22.280]  Not what's going to make the U.S. economy more money or extend its power into the Pacific.
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:26.000]  Leon, you and I have been friends for 30 years.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.760]  For 30 years, you and I have agreed that you can't deny that the Kingdom of Hawaii was
[1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.400]  illegally overthrown.
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:37.880]  We've been having this discussion, I've been telling you for 30 years, Leon, changing
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:44.280]  political communities and political structures is dangerous and can create chaos and poverty
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:45.800]  and war.
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:50.800]  But this present situation, this COVID year, has made me really think there's not one political
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:55.000]  leader that I see in Hawaii that has put the interests of the people of Hawaii first.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.040]  Their behaving as administrators to distant, unelected bureaucracies, not even in the United
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:01.040]  States.
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:05.640]  So, Leon, I am very close to saying maybe the people of Hawaii need sovereignty.
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:07.680]  The founding fathers were conservatives.
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:09.300]  They didn't take leaving England lightly.
[1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:10.760]  They wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:12.800]  They made their case.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  Am I missing something?
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:20.040]  Is there anyone in Hawaii, any elected official that is acting more than just an administrator
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:22.040]  to a global bureaucracy?
[1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:23.040]  No.
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:24.040]  Did you say no?
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:25.040]  Did you say no?
[1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:26.040]  I said no.
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.040]  That's right.
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:31.480]  They're all placed here by the United States and by the global bureaucracy.
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:37.600]  They're serving a different purpose for Hawaii and they're not looking for the best interests
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:38.600]  of our people.
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:45.080]  So, this is why we need to separate ourselves from the United States so that we can make
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:48.760]  our own decisions and become part of the international community.
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:55.080]  But most of all, so that we can restore our nation to being a self-sufficient and self-sustaining
[1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.920]  society like we were before.
[1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:04.080]  And we were not a pagan or a backward society.
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.720]  We were a very progressive society in the 19th century.
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:12.800]  Hawaii was the most literate country in the world by 1850.
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:16.160]  You abolished slavery before the Kingdom of Hawaii abolished slavery before the United
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:17.160]  States.
[1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:22.720]  The palace, the Queen's Palace had electricity before the White House.
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:28.000]  It was, if a slave made it to Hawaii, they were free automatically.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Isn't that true?
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  That's true.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  That's correct.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.440]  If that's why in soil, you're free.
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:33.440]  And many did.
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:40.040]  So, anyway, so going back to the food sovereignty issue, the only way we can see us going back
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:48.160]  and restoring our ability to feed ourselves is to become in control of our own government
[1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:53.720]  and to alter the priorities, to put the priorities back on the health of the people, the health
[1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:56.960]  and welfare of the people, to serve the people.
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:03.160]  We do not need to have a huge military presence in Hawaii in order to feed our people.
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:06.440]  We do not have to have tourism to feed our people.
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:09.240]  What we need is we need to return back to our lands.
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:13.920]  Now, there is a huge movement that has been going on for years, and it's starting to peak
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:16.120]  now, particularly with the pandemic.
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:21.440]  So there's a huge movement of people realizing that we need to grow our own foods.
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:23.920]  There was a weird phenomenon I want to ask you about, Leanne.
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:27.920]  A lot of the sovereignty movement for people out there in the world, you don't know, there's
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:32.120]  a big movement, especially the Hawaiian community, that was built around what was happening, the
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:33.720]  telescope at Mauna Kea.
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:38.240]  I saw trucks where I lived flying the Mauna Kea flag.
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:40.280]  Those same trucks were flying Trump flags.
[1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:46.080]  What is the connection between the sovereignty movement in Hawaii, so many Hawaiians, Native
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:49.520]  Hawaiians and others, and explain to people the Kingdom of Hawaii was a multi-ethnic community.
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.440]  It wasn't based on ethnicity.
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.380]  It was already a very multi-ethnic kingdom.
[1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:55.480]  What is the connection?
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:40:00.120]  What was the Trump movement, or why did President Trump appeal to so many folks who support
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.120]  Hawaiian sovereignty?
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:08.080]  It's the basic principles, and the principles was that of freedom, that people should be
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:11.560]  able to decide to do what is best for themselves.
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:21.560]  I think that's what a lot of Hawaiians responded to, that they saw Trump as a person who was
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:28.480]  talking about freedom and law, under rule of law, and all that.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:34.480]  To release the oppression, if you look at these pictures, we don't look like we're being
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:36.320]  oppressed, but we actually are.
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.600]  We're being prevented from running our own country, from serving the needs of our own
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  people.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:44.840]  And that is the issue of this, and that is freedom.
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:50.920]  As we saw, the United States is losing its freedoms tremendously.
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:55.200]  And so we're saying to ourselves, we don't want to go there either.
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:59.680]  The United States does not have, apparently, not working on the solutions, or does not
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:02.440]  have anything in place right now.
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:07.200]  To solve our problems, we need to take control of our own destiny.
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:12.920]  Yeah, confirm this for me, because I think I remember seeing on Ni'ihau, the Hawaiian
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:17.720]  island, the Hawaiian way, 100% Hawaiian, Native Hawaiians live there, but one person voted
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:18.720]  for Trump.
[1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:19.720]  Is that correct?
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:21.720]  Something like that, something amazing like that.
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:22.720]  Probably.
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:30.960]  Yeah, the small Hawaiian towns have been profoundly Republican for many, many years, but the state
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:36.240]  of Hawaii has been under strict Democratic control for 65 years now.
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:42.360]  And this has been a real, this has not been good for the Hawaiian people.
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:48.600]  And in fact, there are lots of issues now rising up about racism, because it's appearing
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:54.760]  that many of the policies that are installed by the United States and by the Democratic
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:58.040]  power in Hawaii are racist.
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:04.320]  They have their roots in keeping Hawaiians down and keeping their own interests.
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:08.760]  And basically, they're greedy interests, not necessarily racist, but they're basically
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:15.960]  saying our American culture or our Japanese culture or whatever is in control is the one
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:17.760]  that should be ruling in Hawaii.
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:20.760]  And Hawaiians are always getting the short-trip of this.
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.880]  Well, you're wrapping this segment up.
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:27.720]  I've known you for 30 years to be relentless, not only here but around the world, going
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:28.720]  back to that.
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:31.160]  All over the world, you're fighting for the people of Hawaii.
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:35.440]  The people of Hawaii deserve leaders that fight for their interests, that are acting
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:38.880]  as, rather than acting as administrators for a world state.
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:40.960]  And that is the reality right now.
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:45.840]  Hawaii is being governed by people who are acting like bureaucrats and administrators,
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.200]  not leaders for their people.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:49.200]  Thank you, Leon Sue.
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:51.000]  Thank you.

[1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:38.040]  If you take it stumbling, when we under the tongue, oh, how about blasting off of sleep?

[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:41.200]  It's basically a liquid formula of rocket rest.
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:43.800]  It's so popular, we can't keep it in stock.

[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:04.720]  The entire New World Order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:09.360]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:14.200]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:15.200]  will.
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:21.280]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:23.280]  an entire system.
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:26.360]  And the fact that you are able to commune with God, the fact that you are able to see
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:30.720]  the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:35.680]  wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:40.600]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:43.960]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:48.120]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things of the
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:53.960]  system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:58.960]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:05.920]  As negative as times are right now and as depressing as things can be, you have to understand
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:07.240]  that this is all a test.
[1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:14.520]  This experience, this life on this planet, is a reckoning.
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:18.440]  It's God giving us a chance to work things out with third dimension so we can decide
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:22.760]  where we want to spend eternity and what level we want to go to and it really does come
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:23.760]  down to that.
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:27.840]  So as sad as things are and as evil as things are, look at all the good in the world as
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:32.120]  well and realize that God is the author of our consciousness.
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:35.720]  God is the author of us having our own will.
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:41.320]  God is the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing.
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:45.600]  When you look at mainstream media in Hollywood and this whole evil culture in Washington,
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:50.760]  DC and Fauci and the mass cult, it's all about dominating your free will.
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:54.560]  It's all about telling you you're dirty, you're ugly, you're in the bad because Satan
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:01.120]  hates you because you're made in the image of God, the creator of the universe.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:22.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:27.520]  front lines of the Info War.
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:29.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:33.120]  I am your guest host, Jason Jones.
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.360]  You know what the plan is?
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:36.600]  You're the plan.
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:39.000]  You are the plan.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.280]  We are going to break the great reset.
[1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:49.360]  We are going to crack this little new world order of theirs because life depends on it.
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:55.200]  Right now, already, 15% of children in Hawaii are food insecure, 3 million ethnic and religious
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:59.840]  minorities and Chinese occupied East Turkestan are in concentration camps.
[1:47:59.840 --> 1:48:03.840]  And if that's not bad enough, they're making shoes for Nike.
[1:48:03.840 --> 1:48:05.440]  This is where we are.
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:06.840]  Sometimes we can feel lost.
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:09.800]  We watch the media gaslighting us and dividing us.
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:14.760]  Well, the secret to unite us is what I just heard Alex say in the break.
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:18.480]  The secret that can unite us is the truth.
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:26.160]  And the truth is that you, you are the most precious, created thing in the cosmos.
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:28.040]  You are made in the image and likeness of God.
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:29.320]  That is a profound mystery.
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:33.840]  Guess who else is made in the image and likeness of God, Lil Nas.
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:42.360]  What a great tragedy that this young man would allow himself to fall so far and participate
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:47.600]  because I don't believe he was the engine driving that disgusting music video.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:49.360]  He is a commodity.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:55.640]  He is a commodity, no different, no different than the Uyghur in a concentration camp in
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:57.720]  China making shoes for Nike.
[1:48:57.720 --> 1:48:59.160]  That is how they see him.
[1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:00.680]  That is how they see me.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:01.680]  That is how they see you.
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:06.040]  But, but we know the truth that we're made in the image of God and that truth by God's
[1:49:06.040 --> 1:49:10.520]  grace is embedded in the Declaration of Independence and we have a constitution and the founding
[1:49:10.520 --> 1:49:12.120]  fathers were clever.
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:17.560]  They're warring at us, pushing it in every side, but they run into the constitution.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:20.120]  So, but it won't hold forever, so we need to step up.
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:25.200]  There are five principles that we can advance to smash the great reset.
[1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.320]  I would ask that you take a pen, pen or pencil, no pen, write these down.
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:33.480]  You can go to my website, thegreatcampaign.org and get my book right there.
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:34.640]  It's on the front page.
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:38.440]  I wrote this book, The Race to Save Our Century, took me 20 years.
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  Turn it into the publisher.
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  It was 600 pages.
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:41.600]  They said that book is way too big.
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:42.600]  Get it down to 200.
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  John's Mirac.
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:44.920]  I said, John, I can't do that.
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:46.440]  He goes, I'll get it down.
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:52.320]  It's 600 pages and 190 pages and this is the plan to defeat the great reset.
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:56.520]  Number one, the first and foremost thing we need to do everywhere we go is tell the truth
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:57.520]  about the human person.
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:49:59.000]  I hear Alex doing it all the time.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.840]  We're made in the image and likeness of God.
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:04.160]  That truth right there, if your friends, your family, your neighbors knew that, they wouldn't
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:07.760]  allow themselves to be treated like slaves.
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:10.240]  That's the first, that's the biggest truth.
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:11.360]  What's the other truth?
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:13.600]  The transcendent moral order.
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  What does that mean?
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:15.600]  That's simple.
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:18.720]  There is a law above public opinion.
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:20.320]  There is a law above the mob.
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:21.760]  The mob is fickle.
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  The mob is waving you in with palms one day, nailing you to a cross the next day.
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:27.320]  One day I'm a part of the mob.
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.320]  The next day, the mob's against me.
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:30.320]  One day you're a part, no, no.
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:31.880]  We don't want to be a part of the mob.
[1:50:31.880 --> 1:50:33.280]  We want to look to the truth.
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:37.920]  The Reverend Martin Luther King always used to say, a just law is a man made law that
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:42.520]  conforms to the divine will, to the transcendent truth.
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:43.920]  That's number two.
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:47.400]  Number three, this is a key one, subsidiarity.
[1:50:47.400 --> 1:50:50.000]  What is subsidiarity?
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:56.080]  Local power, local control, that you don't, you don't give power to distant, unelected
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:57.080]  bureaucrats.
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:59.640]  Who does Bill Gates think he is?
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:00.640]  Changing the earth's climate.
[1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:04.080]  Who gave him, you ever had a friend in your car and he's fiddling with your heater?
[1:51:04.080 --> 1:51:05.080]  You used to turn the heat on.
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:06.560]  Who gave him control?
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.800]  Bill Gates, who gave you the thermostat for the world?
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:10.720]  Who told you you can control that?
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:16.400]  Who told the WHO that they're going to mandate what a local business does in my neighborhood?
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:22.680]  Why are our elected officials acting like bureaucrats and a global bureaucracy?
[1:51:22.680 --> 1:51:23.760]  Why?
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:28.600]  We need to take back control and say, my neighborhood, my state house district, this
[1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:33.160]  is our state senate district, this is my township, go away.
[1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:37.760]  Subsidiarity is key, fundamental, that alone would stop them.
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:43.760]  All the great tragedies of the 21st century, the rise of national socialism in Germany
[1:51:43.760 --> 1:51:49.480]  or totalitarian socialism in Russia or in China, how do they commit such great crimes?
[1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:51.920]  How did Mao starve 60 million Chinese?
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:55.320]  He obliterated the free institutions of civil society.
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:52:00.440]  He made every elected official, every bureaucrat and government, they all were controlled by
[1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:01.440]  him.
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:02.440]  No, no, no.
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:07.880]  And so 60 million people starved until the farmers in China, through corruption and force
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:10.080]  took back their farmland.
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:13.720]  Subsidiarity is key, and then what's the next?
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:16.720]  Humane economy, that's very simple.
[1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:20.280]  Adjust social order is grounded in private property rights.
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:23.560]  Set within a commonwealth, we live in a lot of commonwealths.
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:26.320]  I make money, but I'm a steward of that wealth.
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:29.840]  For my neighbors, for my family, for my friends, I'm a steward of that wealth.
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:30.840]  I can't be reckless.
[1:52:30.840 --> 1:52:33.760]  I can't buy a river and pour toxins into it.
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:34.760]  But I'm the steward.
[1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:39.640]  I am the steward of that property for my posterity, and I might be a horrible steward.
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:44.880]  But when you give the state, you let Stalin steward all of the property of Russia, that's
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:46.880]  going to be a horrible steward.
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:50.320]  Some people will be good stewards of their wealth, their property, and others won't.
[1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:54.520]  Private property and thoughtfulness to the commonwealths were a part of our family, is
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:58.600]  the foundation of a just social order, and five, solidarity.
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:01.160]  And that's what Infowars has always been about.
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:05.840]  You look at Infowars, this incredible staff, it's like nothing I've ever seen or Alex Jones,
[1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:12.400]  what drives him to walk up to the scorn bones and bang on their door and say, I'm a contact
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:13.400]  tracer.
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:15.360]  What drives him to do that?
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:19.120]  Thoughtfulness, love, solidarity for his community, for the Uyghur.
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:22.560]  Why are you watching Infowars right now?
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:25.760]  Thoughtfulness to your children, your grandchildren, your posterity, your family, your friends,
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:29.840]  your neighbors, that is solidarity.
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:32.240]  And solidarity begins closest to home.
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:35.520]  Again, that goes back to subsidiarity.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:38.440]  We got to start, we got to care for our family or friends.
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:43.240]  One thing I said earlier in the show is we have to celebrate.
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.280]  We have to have festivals.
[1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:49.440]  We have to play baseball on the street, basketball with our kids.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:52.920]  We have to fill our lives with joy and have barbecues.
[1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:57.040]  That's important, that's starting local, bringing life, right?
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:01.160]  Care for others, but we can't forget those on the other side of the world because we
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:05.640]  do know and we do participate whether I like it or not.
[1:54:05.640 --> 1:54:11.360]  When I use an Apple product, if I have Nike shoes on my feet, I have benefited from the
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:15.320]  exploitation of slave labor in China.
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:24.040]  And so as we end the show, I want to put on your heart to reach out to your senators
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:32.680]  and tell them to support Senate Bill 65, the Uyghur Force Labor Prevention Act, because
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:36.120]  China made a big mistake this week.
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:41.920]  Nike feigned concern about having their products made by slaves.
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:44.440]  They've known it, now they're feigning concern.
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:48.000]  China then announced they would be boycotting Nike products.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:51.440]  So now Nike, so Nike stock fell five points.
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:55.600]  So now, like all criminal conspiracies, they begin to turn on each other.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:58.400]  Nike, Nike, you know what I love about Info Wars?
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:00.800]  This great privilege of being on the show.
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:05.120]  Thank you, Alex Jones, as I know that there are executives, there are people watching
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:10.280]  the show that own a heck of a lot of Nike stock right now, too.
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:12.560]  Nike needs to make a decision.
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.480]  You're an American company that makes free.
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:19.240]  You have free people make shoes for free people, or you are, or you make slaves.
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:21.520]  You make shoes for slaves by slaves.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:23.360]  Let's free the Uyghur folks.
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:27.840]  There's a special report coming here from Alex, and I'm going to be throwing it there.
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:32.040]  But it has been a privilege to guest host this show, to address such a wonderful audience
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:36.960]  of folks that are thoughtful of their posterity, and I hope we get a chance to get a lo-ha.
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:40.240]  And that's it for this live Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:44.680]  I want to thank filmmaker and author and talk show host Jason Jones for doing a great job.
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:48.760]  In the last two hours, I also want to thank the great crew, all of our affiliates, the
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:53.400]  listeners, and of course number one, God, who is the creator of the universe.
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:56.360]  Coming up next is Owen Shroyer and Sunday Live.
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:55:57.960]  It is a powerful transmission.
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:01.400]  It's only got six minutes of commercial breaks an hour.
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:02.400]  That's for the local stations.
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:03.960]  A lot of great stations are picking it up.
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:04.960]  A lot of people are tuning in.
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:07.080]  Owen has a lot of great guests, takes a lot of calls.
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:11.680]  So Owen Shroyer coming up next with Sunday Live.
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:16.440]  I just want to thank all the listeners and all the viewers for being part of the right
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:22.400]  side, for being part of the solution, for being informed, for not being lazy, for being
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:25.880]  engaged and for standing up for humanity, not just America.
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.680]  The globalist and their whole satanic system is now right out in the open.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:33.000]  You see Nike coming out with pentagram Hail Satan shoes.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:39.240]  You see almost all the mainline music videos openly showing the most bizarre satanic rituals.
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:43.400]  Imaginal evil makes its move over and over again throughout history.
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:49.240]  Then it loses after a huge battle, a huge war, and a lot of pain, and then it receives into
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:52.920]  the background and claims it doesn't exist anymore.
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:55.760]  That's the devil's greatest trick, is convincing the world didn't exist.
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:57:00.200]  Well, now the devil is making his move with the world government, world ID, the attack
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:05.480]  on the family, the attempt to disarm us, the attempt to destroy our nation that was found
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:07.520]  with godly principles of liberty and freedom.
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:10.400]  And so that's why all of you are more important than you've ever been.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:16.280]  And I thank you, and I just beg you to understand that without you, we don't have any hope.
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:19.480]  Please take the live feed of the show, the archives, the articles, the videos that you
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:24.840]  think are most important from MFullWars.com and band.video, and share them continually
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:28.520]  on your email, your text messages by word of mouth, and while you still can on Twitter
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:32.240]  and Facebook and other systems, because that's how we bypass the globalist.
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:36.080]  Their entire system is based on silencing, we the people, that's why we the people must
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:37.680]  come together and say no.
[1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:42.680]  All right, quick two minute break, and we'll have two hours of live radio slash TV with
[1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:46.360]  hard hitting truth with Owen Schreuer and Sunday Live straight ahead.
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:47.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:48.360]  God bless and good luck.

[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:56.800]  It's Friday evening and I'm cutting this quick ad because coming up on the 31st, we
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:58.400]  have to stop the sales.
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:00.840]  The sales will be over by Thursday morning.
[1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:03.800]  They have to because a lot of these products are selling out.
[1:59:03.800 --> 1:59:11.000]  All of our incredible iodine products, X2, X3, also the oral spray and the topical disinfectant
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:16.320]  spray are all 50% off with free shipping on these items.
[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:19.680]  You cannot meet these deals and believe me, when I'm sitting there talking about X2 or
[1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:22.800]  X3, I'm thinking, hey, I haven't taken it in a week or so, I need to take it.
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:28.040]  The energy it gives me, the focus it gives me, how good it makes my skin feel, everything,
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:29.040]  it's essential.
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:31.760]  And the globalists don't want you to know about iodine, they don't want you to know
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:36.040]  about pure iodine, they don't want you to be full of the bad halogens, don't let them
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:37.040]  do it.
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:42.280]  And for the InfoWare, a 360 win, 50% off on all four of our great iodine products and
[1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:46.880]  free shipping at InfoWareStore.com, part of the mega blowout sale, but it ends in just
[1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:52.200]  a couple days, so take action.
[1:59:52.200 --> 2:00:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
